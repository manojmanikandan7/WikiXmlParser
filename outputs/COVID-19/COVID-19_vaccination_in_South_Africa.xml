		<segment id="id66976335">South Africa is conducting an ongoing immunisation campaign against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in response to the ongoing pandemic in the country.





On 17 February 2021, South Africa started its national vaccination program against COVID-19. The program will go through in phases, prioritizing healthcare and frontline workers and then those over the age of 60. According to health officials, South Africa has administered 38,717,957 vaccine doses across the country . South Africa has accepted delivery of 3 different vaccines, Janssen (Johnson &amp; Johnson), Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca, administering both Janssen and Pfizer-BioNTech, with the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine suspended, after a small study cast doubt on its effectiveness against the Beta variant.

Background

Rollout strategy


Registration

As of 20 October 2021, registration for the COVID-19 vaccine has been opened to people aged 12 and older. There are currently 5 ways to register for the vaccine, including online on the EVDS platform. All services are zero rated, meaning airtime, data or money are not required to use the service.

Vaccines on order

On 27 August 2021, the Department of Health announced that the US would donate another 2.2 Million doses of the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine. They further stated that low weekend vaccinations were due to lack of health care workers able to work weekends with the hope that as the 3rd wave ends more workers would become available. They also said that they were in the process of procuring AstraZeneca vaccine due to data that it is efficacious against the Delta variant but were unable to find a supplier with stock. They expected stock to become available in September/October. They reiterated that they had not yet ordered CoronaVac as they were still waiting for further clinical data.

On 30 August 2021, the Department of Health released an updated circular recommending all pregnant and lactating women get vaccinated with either of the available vaccines.

By the end of the month, 11.1 million vaccine doses had been administered. 19% of the target population had been fully vaccinated by the end of the month.

September 2021
On 3 September 2021, the health minister stated vaccinations would only open to those under 18 once 70% of the over 18 population was vaccinated. The country had the capacity to vaccinate between 300 000 and 400 000 people a day. The Government was not yet mandating vaccinations but would rather try incentivise through entrance to entertainment, cultural and sporting events.

On 10 September 2021, the health minister announced plans for issuing digital vaccine certificates, which would be printable and would be issued to all people with vaccination data already on the EVDS platform. These certificates would be in line with WHO guidelines to prevent fraud.

On 11 September 2021, SAHPRA announced that the EUA for the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine was extended to include all people 12 and older, creating opportunity for teenagers and children to be included in the vaccination rollout in the future.

On 15 September 2021, a circular was released to prioritise the Janssen vaccine stock for rural areas, pop up and mobile sites only until the supply stabilises.

On 17 September 2021, the health minister stated that they were currently focussing on vaccinating people 50 years and older but would review the decision to open to under 18s at the end of October. The Draft implementation of the digital vaccine certificates would be submitted to the national coronavirus command council in 2 weeks and would be rolled out once approved. The certificates would not be used for access to essential services but would give vaccinated people access to more activities. The government would not implement vaccine mandates in the public sector but would not interfere with mandates in the private sector and at higher education institutions as long as the mandates are implemented legally.

On 29 September 2021, the health department confirmed that the vaccine certificate would be made available on 5 October. It would be downloadable from a website and could be printed. It would have a QR code to scan to verify authenticity and would link to the person's ID number.

The Ministerial Adversary Committee also recommended a 2nd Jansen shot for all Sisonke trial participants, pending SAHPRA approval. Doses for this program would be donated by Johnson &amp; Johnson. The health department also confirmed that pilot programs were in place to vaccinate undocumented people at specific vaccination sites and would be slowly expanded.

On 18 October 2021, SAHPRA announced that they would not be authorising the Sputnik V vaccine for emergency use due to concerns about the use of Ad5-vectored vaccines in a population at high risk of HIV infections and the fact that the vaccine had not received Emergency Use Listing by the WHO. The rolling review would, however, remain open for further data to be submitted.

On 19 October 2021, vaccinations opened to people 12 to 17 with 39 109 registrations (0.6% of the age group) on the first day.

Vaccine Trials
On 17 March 2020, the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority announced that it would expedite review of treatments, vaccines and clinical trials. Currently a total of 6 vaccine candidates are under trial in South Africa.



Janssen



Both Phase II and Phase III trials of the Janssen (Johnson &amp; Johnson) vaccine were conducted in South Africa beginning late February 2021 and April 2021.

Phase II Trials, enrolled about 800 across Spain, United Kingdom and United States of America and proved to be 64% effective.

Phase III Trials under Sisonke Protocol began early April enrolling 500,000 participants. This trial was completed successfully, it consisted of half a million of South Africa's health workers and Phase I of the vaccine rollout.

In January, Johnson &amp; Johnson, which held trials for its Janssen vaccine in South Africa, reported the level of protection against moderate to severe COVID-19 infection was 72% in the United States, but 57% in South Africa.

Pfizer–BioNTech
Both Phase II and Phase III trials of the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine were conducted in South Africa beginning late May 2020. Pfizers vaccine appeared to be 100% effective at preventing cases of the South African variant, B.1.351.

On 17 February 2021, Pfizer announced neutralization activity was reduced by two thirds for the 501.V2 variant, while stating no claims about the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing illness for this variant could yet be made.

Oxford–AstraZeneca
Both Phase I and Phase II of the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine were conducted in South Africa.Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials began mid June 2020 consisting of about 2,130 participants.  The trial revealed that the vaccine does not have at least 60% efficacy against mild-moderate COVID-19 due to the B.1.351 (501Y.V2) variant. This resulted in the vaccine being suspended and the 1 million doses derived being sold to other Members of the African Union.

On 6 February 2021, The Financial Times reported that provisional trial data from a study undertaken by South Africa's University of the Witwatersrand in conjunction with Oxford University demonstrated reduced efficacy of the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine against the 501.V2 variant. The study found that in a sample size of 2,000 the AZD1222 vaccine afforded only &quot;minimal protection&quot; in all but the most severe cases of COVID-19.

On 7 February 2021, the Minister for Health for South Africa suspended the planned deployment of around 1 million doses of the vaccine whilst they examined the data and awaited advice on how to proceed. Ultimately, around March 2021, the roll-out of Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine in South Africa was cancelled, and the short-dated stock offered to other African countries.

Novavax
A Phase II Trial of the Novavax vaccine of 4,400 people was conducted from August 2020 to November 2021 in South Africa, that showed that the vaccine was 51% effective, compared to 89% in the US

The vaccine had an efficacy of 51% against infections caused by the South African variant among people who were HIV negative. The vaccine was only 43% effective in the group that included people who were HIV positive.

GRAd-COV2
Phase II and Phase III trials of GRAd-COV2 are being conducted in South Africa.

ImmunityBio
The BioVac Institute, a state-backed South African vaccine company, has a contract with American based ImmunityBio Inc. to manufacture the ImmunityBio vaccine.

ImmunityBio is currently conducting Phase I and Phase II trials. Trials began January 2021 consisting of about only 35 participants in Phase I.

Vaccine Effectiveness

Janssen

In January, Johnson &amp; Johnson, which held trials for its Janssen vaccine in South Africa, reported the level of protection against moderate to severe COVID-19 infection was 72% in the United States, but 57% in South Africa.

After Phase III trials in South Africa completed, Johnson &amp; Johnson received Section 21 approval from SAHPRA on 31 March 2021.

In a manufacturing deal, Johnson &amp; Johnson began to manufacture 220 million vaccines at the Aspen Pharmacare manufacturing facility in Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape. They plan to distribute the vaccine to other African countries with 30 million to go to South Africa.

Oxford–AstraZeneca
On 6 February 2021, The Financial Times reported that provisional trial data from a study undertaken by South Africa's University of the Witwatersrand in conjunction with Oxford University demonstrated reduced efficacy of the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine against the 501.V2 variant. The study found that in a sample size of 2,000 the AZD1222 vaccine afforded only &quot;minimal protection&quot; in all but the most severe cases of COVID-19.

On 7 February 2021, the government suspended the planned deployment of around 1 million doses of the vaccine whilst they examined the data and awaited advice on how to proceed. The South African government subsequently cancelled the use of the vaccine, selling its supply to other African countries, and switched its vaccination program to use the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine.

On 27 August 2021, the government announced that they were in the process of procuring the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine due to data showing good protection against the Delta variant but were only expecting stock to become available late September/early October.

Sputnik V

The South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) has confirmed that it has received documentation for the vaccine developed by the Gamaleya Institute in Russia.

The Sputnik V vaccine is one of three Covid vaccines worldwide with an efficacy higher than 90% in symptomatic cases. They are still in the process of testing its effectiveness against the 501Y.V2 variant of the virus.

Pfizer–BioNTech
On 17 February 2021, Pfizer announced neutralization activity of the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine was reduced by two thirds for the South African Beta variant, while stating no claims about the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing illness for this variant could yet be made.

On 16 March 2021, The South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for section 21 Emergency Use Authorisation.

A trial ending in March 2021 of the Pfizer-BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine appeared to be highly effective at preventing cases of the Beta variant. The trial consisted of 800 people, with a total of 9 cases, all in the placebo group.


Moderna
In February, Moderna reported that the current Moderna vaccine produced only one-sixth of the antibodies in response to the South African variant compared with the original virus. They have launched a trial of a new vaccine to tackle the South African 501.V2 variant.

Sinopharm BIBP
Other African countries have begun the roll out of the Sinopharm BIBP vaccine, including Morocco, Egypt, The Seychelles and Zimbabwe. A study by Sinopharm researchers in early 2021 showed that it was less efficacious against the 501Y.V2 variant than the original variant.

CoronaVac
CoronaVac is yet to be approved for use by the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA).

On 3 July 2021, the vaccine was approved under section 21, EUA. Sinovac  is currently in negotiation with South Africa to provide 5 million doses of the vaccine.

ImmunityBio
The Biovac Institute, a state-backed South African vaccine company, plans to use a deal it won to manufacture the ImmunityBio vaccine. The contract with American based ImmunityBio Inc is currently conducting phase 1 vaccine trials with their hAd5 vaccine in the United States and South Africa.

ImmunityBio and Biovac plan to distribute the vaccines throughout South African and Africa.

Vaccine Exports

South Africa is the first country in Africa to locally manufacture any covid vaccine. The vaccines are to be reserved for purchased exclusively to Africa. South Africa is currently manufacturing 220 000 million doses of the Janssen (Johnson &amp; Johnson) vaccine in Port Elizabeth. Pfizer-BioNTech production is expected to begin in Cape Town end of 2021. If the ImmunityBio vaccine makes it through the trials, manufacturing will commence locally.

Vaccination sites

The COVID-19 Vaccine can be obtained at 1397 different locations nationwide, as of 28 August. Any person qualified for a vaccine will be allocated to the most appropriate site, regardless if it is private or public or if they are insured or not. Vaccination sites are expected to increase to 3,338 locations, as Phase II and Phase III progress ramps up. So far it is planned that all Clicks, Dis-Chem, and other pharmacies and hospitals nationwide be used to distribute vaccines.
