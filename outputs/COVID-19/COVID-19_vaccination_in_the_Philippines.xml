   of these have been administered with the first dose of a two-dose vaccine or a single-dose vaccine, while 73,873,958  have been fully vaccinated with a two-dose or a single-dose vaccine while 21,500,083 has received a booster doses.




The COVID-19 vaccination program in the Philippines was a mass immunization campaign against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in response to the pandemic in the country. The vaccination program was initiated by the Duterte administration on March 1, 2021, a day after the arrival of the country's first vaccine doses which were donated by the Chinese government.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued emergency use authorizations (EUA) to 10 COVID-19 vaccines (in chronological order): Pfizer–BioNTech, Oxford–AstraZeneca, Sinovac, Sputnik V, Janssen, Covaxin, Moderna, Sinopharm BIBP, Sputnik Light and Novavax.

As of February 19, 2023, 166,423,405 total vaccine doses have been administered throughout the country, with 73,873,958 being fully vaccinated, 21,500,083 booster doses administered.

Background and timeline

The COVID-19 Immunization Program Management Organizational Structure was formed on October 26, 2020, to facilitate the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines, however this was replaced by a vaccine cluster within the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) by November 6, 2020. Carlito Galvez Jr. was appointed to lead the cluster under the title of vaccine czar. The Philippine National Vaccination Program and Implementation Plan was also approved by November 6, 2020.

Preparation

Organizations involved
The COVID-19 Immunization Program Management Organizational Structure was formed on October 26 with the intention of it overseeing the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines once these became available. However, by November 6, the vaccine body was abolished and replaced with a vaccine cluster within the National Task Force Against COVID-19 of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID). The vaccine cluster is distinct from the national task force's COVID-19 response cluster.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on their part is the agency tasked to review and approve the use and commercial distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines as well as the issuance of an emergency use authorization for the same.

Delivery plan


The national government planned to roll out its vaccination program around February expecting the delivery of Pfizer's vaccines sourced from the COVAX facility and the first batch of Sinovac's vaccines, consisting of 50,000 doses. The delivery of Pfizer's vaccines was delayed due to documentary issues.

The government planned to start a full rollout or mass vaccination for the general populace around late 2021.

Regulatory approval
Under normal circumstances, drugs and vaccines are reviewed for approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under a period of six months. President Rodrigo Duterte to fast-track the government's medical response to the pandemic signed an executive order on December 2, 2020, which allowed the FDA to grant emergency-use authorization (EUA) to COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. An EUA for a particular vaccine would authorize the government to buy said vaccine and allow to use the same for the vaccination program. An EUA would not authorize the commercial use of such vaccines or consent the use of the vaccine for personal use.

The EUA approval process by the FDA is covered under FDA Circular No. 2020-036.

An EUA granted for COVID-19 vaccine or drug remains valid if it fulfills three conditions:

*Based on the totality of evidence including data from adequate and well-known controlled trials, it is reasonable to believe that the drug or vaccine may be effective to prevent, diagnose or treat COVID-19.
*The known and potential benefits of the drug or vaccine...outweigh the known and potential risks, if any.
*There is no adequate, approved, and available alternative to the drug or vaccine.

The EUAs validity ends one year from the lifting of the public health emergency status declared in response to the pandemic or one year from the date it was registered if a COVID-19 drug or vaccine gets fully registered with the FDA.

Among the conditions for a vaccine manufacturer to secure an EUA in the Philippines is to obtain prior EUA in its country of origin or other countries with a &quot;mature&quot; regulator. No manufacturer would be allowed to obtain an EUA in the Philippines first. For the purpose of the FDA's EUA approval process, the following foreign regulators are considered as &quot;mature&quot;:

*Therapeutic Goods Administration (Australia)
*Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (Japan)
*Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (South Korea)
*Health Canada
*Health Sciences Authority (Singapore)
*Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products (Switzerland)
*Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (United Kingdom)
*Food and Drug Administration (United States)
*European Medicines Agency (European Union)

Vaccine manufacturers applied for EUA
The FDA announced that three vaccine manufacturers namely Pfizer–BioNTech, AstraZeneca, and Sinovac have inquired on the process of obtaining an EUA in the Philippines.

Rollout



The Philippines' vaccination officially began on March 1, 2021, shortly after the arrival of the first batch of vaccines from Sinovac. Prior to the official roll-out, a dry run was conducted to ensure that the vaccines, especially temperature-sensitive ones, would be rolled-out with minimal problems.

In February 2021, the Food and Drug Association recommended against the usage of Sinovac vaccines for health care workers due to its low efficacy rates in trials on health care workers in other countries. It has recommended its usage instead to the vaccine to the working population and military personnel.

The National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) on February 26 has approved the use of the Sinovac vaccine to health care workers. Health care workers are still allowed to not take the vaccine and wait for a more effective vaccine. Philippine General Hospital (PGH) employees demanded for a better vaccine and an increase with their hazard pays.

At a press conference, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque stated that health care workers can refuse the Sinovac vaccine and wait for the vaccines from Pfizer–BioNTech, Moderna, and Oxford–AstraZeneca while still being prioritized but other prioritized groups shall only get what is available in their locality.

The rollout for the Philippines' national vaccine program began on March 1, 2021, shortly after the arrival of 600,000 doses of Sinovac's vaccine. Philippine General Hospital director and doctor Gerardo Legaspi officially became the first recipient of a COVID-19 vaccine in the country. The initial batch will cover around 50,000 military personnel and 250,000 health workers. As of March 3, 2021, vaccinations has been limited to Metro Manila and to health workers. However, select government officials were vaccinated in a bid to boost confidence on the vaccine.

On March 6, 2021, Oxford–AstraZeneca, under the COVAX facility, began the rollout. Health workers who refused Sinovac's vaccines were prioritized.

In May 2021, the rollout of vaccines from two manufacturers began. The rollout of the Sputnik V vaccines began on May 3 with five cities of Metro Manila; namely Makati, Manila, Taguig, Parañaque, and Muntinlupa. The deployment of Pfizer started on May 12, beginning in two cities in Metro Manila (San Juan and Makati). On June 30, 2021, the Moderna vaccine began its rollout in Metro Manila including San Juan. On July 20, 2021, the Janssen vaccine began being rolled out in Tacloban. On August 12, 2021, Vaccine Czar Carlito Galvez Jr. announced that recipients of the Sputnik V vaccine as their first dose can receive the AstraZeneca vaccine as their second dose provided that the shipment of Sputnik V is delayed due to logistical issues.

Vaccination of minors began in mid-October 2021. At that time, emergency use authorizations for the use of Moderna and Pfizer vaccines for minors (ages 12–15 for Pfizer; age 12-17 for Moderna) has been granted.

To hasten the immunization program, the government announced that it was holding &quot;National Vaccination Days&quot; on November 29 until December 1. November 29 and December 1 will be special working days. Initially targeted to immunize 15 million people, it was reduced to 9 million due to logistics issues surrounding the syringes for Pfizer vaccines.

Issuance of vaccine certificates

 
Upon being vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine, the local government unit (LGU) or recognized private healthcare providers issue a vaccine card that shall act as proof of vaccination. Later on, the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) in coordination and the Department of Health along with the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) for a centralized registry for COVID-19 vaccinated residents under a common digital vaccine ID that shall feature a unique QR code.

Since September 6, 2021, the VaxCERTPH, the national digital COVID-19 vaccination certificate was launched to serve as the official COVID-19 vaccination certificate for international and domestic travel for fully vaccinated Philippine citizens and residents. The digital certificate is based on the international standards as prescribed by World Health Organization (WHO). Vaccination records for the VaxCERTPH certificate are based on the Vaccination Information Management System (VIMS), managed by the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) based on the uploads by the local government units in the Philippines. In 2022, the VaxCERTPH has since updated vaccination certificates that would include additional booster shots.

At the same time since July 2021, the Bureau of Quarantine in the Philippines has begun issuing a new format of the International Certificate of Vaccination (ICV) to fully vaccinated Philippine citizens and residents for international travel provided that the COVID-19 vaccine is listed under the Emergency Use Listing (EUL) by the World Health Organization (WHO).

Recognition of vaccination certificates
On July 4, 2021, the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF) has permitted domestic travel within the Philippines for fully vaccinated individuals that have been vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine under the Emergency Use Listing (EUL) by the World Health Organization (WHO) or have been granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) or a compassionate special permit (CSP) issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The same rules applies for fully vaccinated international travelers from countries and territories deemed as &quot;low-risk&quot; and can receive a reduced quarantine period of seven days.

On October 8, 2021, the IATF introduced revised guidelines that fully vaccinated travelers from &quot;low-risk&quot; (green list) and &quot;moderate-risk&quot; (yellow list) jurisdictions can receive a reduced facility-based quarantine up to five days upon presentation of a national digital certificate issued by a foreign government with a reciprocal agreement with the Philippines.

On October 13, 2021, the IATF subsequently permitted the entry of fully vaccinated travelers from &quot;low-risk&quot; (green list) countries and jurisdictions to skip facility-based quarantine provided there is a presentation of negative RT-PCR test result within 72 hours before departure from their country. This policy was later to the presentation of a negative RT-PCR test result within 48 hours before departure from their country.

The Philippines presently recognizes the vaccination certificates issued by the following countries: Albania, Armenia, Argentina, Azerbaijan, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Belgium, Brazil, Brunei, Cambodia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Ecuador, Egypt, Estonia, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Macau, Malaysia, Maldives, Malta, Myanmar, Monaco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Oman, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Portugal, Qatar, Samoa, Singapore, Slovenia, Spain, Syria, Switzerland, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Timor–Leste, Tunisia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the United States, Uruguay, and Vietnam.

Booster shots
The Health Technology Assessment Council (HTAC), the independent advisory council issued its recommendation for the administering of a third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine as a booster shot with a priority towards health care workers and other priority groups.

Booster shots were rolled for frontline healthcare workers on November 16, 2021. Similarly, the IATF has approved the administration of booster shots for Overseas Filipino Workers who are set for deployment within four months provided their second dosage was taken six months prior. Senior citizens and immunocompromised persons were rolled out on November 22, 2021. These groups can choose their preferred vaccine brand in comparison to their primary series.

On December 3, 2021, the Philippine Department of Health announces the expansion of the booster shot program stating all adults aged 18 years and above can receive additional booster shots at least six months from the primary series or three months after receiving the single-dose Janssen COVID-19 vaccine.

Due to the threat of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant, the Department of Health announced on December 22, 2021, the shortening of the interval of the booster doses for all adults aged 18 years and above at three months from their primary series or two months after receiving the single-dose Janssen vaccine.

Vaccine supply

Summary


By acquisition

Vaccines on order

By the national government
The Philippine government has been negotiating with various foreign vaccine manufacturers to secure the country's COVID-19 vaccine supply. These manufacturers include Sinovac Biotech (China), Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology (Russia), Moderna (United States), and Pfizer (United States). The private sector, with government sanction, has secured at least 2.6 million vaccine doses from British-Swedish manufacturer AstraZeneca. The government also has secured 10 million doses from American firm Novavax which would be supplied from the Serum Institute of India.

The government plans to secure 171 million doses from at least seven firms by the end of 2021. The procurement efforts of the national government have been a subject of various controversies.

The national government through the Department of Foreign Affairs responding to the request of Germany and the United Kingdom to be exempted from the Philippines' prevailing cap on the deployment of nurses abroad in exchange for vaccines. The United Kingdom declined the offer refusing to link the vaccines to negotiations on the deployment of Filipino health workers to their country. The proposal was also opposed by labor group Migrante International.

The Philippine government is negotiating with four pharmaceutical firms for the supply of COVID-19 booster shots.

By local governments
Local government units in the Philippines, from individual municipalities and cities and provinces has allocated part of their budgets to procure their own supply of COVID-19 vaccines.

Along with private companies, local governments had to procure vaccines through cooperation with the national government which led to some members of the Congress questioning urging the national government to allow local governments to procure vaccines unilaterally. However, the government pointed out that only national governments could directly procure vaccines through the World Health Organization's COVAX facility and that third-party private firms and local governments had to sign a tripartite deal with the national government and member vaccine manufacturer.

Vaccines sourced from donations
The first vaccines acquired by the Philippine national government was from Sinovac. The first batch of Sinovac's vaccines consisting of 600,000 doses were received by the Philippines on February 28, 2021, with the country expected to receive a total of 26 million doses.

Five local firms are in negotiations with foreign organizations to set up vaccine manufacturing sites in the Philippines as of March 2021. The origin of these foreign organization include China, India, South Korea, Russia, and the United States. South Korean firm EU Biologics has a partnership with Philippine vaccine distributor Glovax Biotech Corp. since 2012. The two companies plan to set-up their own vaccine production hub in Clark. Other interested foreign parties include the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology of Russia and a university research unit based in the United States.

Philippine company United Laboratories launched a program known as &quot;Vaccine Self Reliant Philippines&quot; which includes plans to set up a vaccine manufacturing plant by 2023.

By vaccine

Progress to date
;DYN;


By region


Vaccination priority groups
The Philippine government released a priority groups list for the national vaccination program in February 2021 as approved by the Interim National Immunization Technical Advisory Group. The list include three main categorizations, with utmost priority provided for populations under &quot;A&quot; categorization. As of February 2022, people under priority groups A1 to A5, the rest of adult population and minors (ages 5 to 17 years old) are being allowed to receive vaccination.

Controversies

Black market
In January 2021, during the time when only the Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine had an emergency use authorization, it was reported that an alleged black market of smuggled vaccines from China has established itself in the Philippines. The demand for the vaccines is particularly high for Chinese nationals in the country, especially those employed by Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (POGOs). The doses are reportedly sold at inflated prices, considerably more expensive than the standard price of the same vaccines in China.

In late March 2021, the FDA released an advisory cautioning the public against fake vaccines and that vaccines which had emergency use authorization are not authorized to be sold commercially. Although as of that date, there are no reports yet of fake vaccines proliferating in the country as per the FDA.

Line jumping
The DOH reported in March 2021 that a number of individuals had jumped the line to get the vaccine, becoming vaccinated despite being otherwise ineligible to do so. These include several local government officials, prompting the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) to issue show cause orders against them to explain why they were vaccinated, and actor Mark Anthony Fernandez, who was vaccinated despite not belonging to a priority group for the vaccine. Fernandez, for his part, claimed that he had underlying health conditions that otherwise made him eligible.

The issue has raised the concerns of the Commission on Human Rights, and has also led to the WHO warning the Philippine government that it risks losing access to its share of vaccines provided by COVAX if the practice continues.

A number of suggestions were floated to address line jumping, with Senator Franklin Drilon urging the government to ramp up the country's vaccine supply, and Representative Precious Hipolito, who represents the second district of Quezon City, filing a bill that would amend the Philippines' COVID-19 vaccination law to criminalize the practice.

Vaccination of the Presidential Security Group and President Duterte


On May 3, 2021, President Rodrigo Duterte received his first dose of the Sinopharm BIBP vaccine despite the latter not receiving an EUA from FDA. The FDA only issued a one-time compassionate special permit (CSP) for 10,000 doses of the vaccine for the PSG.

But due to public outrage, President Duterte apologized for taking the vaccine that has not been authorized by the FDA for emergency use and asked the Chinese Embassy to take back its donation.

Non-recognition of vaccine certificates by Hong Kong
Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. announced the Government of Hong Kong will not honor the proof of vaccination issued by local government units and the Bureau of Quarantine in the Philippines due to a lack of a central registry. This was after several Overseas Filipino Worker (OFWs) bound for the territory were reported to have been refused entry due to non-recognition of their vaccine certificates.

As an interim solution, the Department of Health confirmed that all outbound travelers would use the International Certificate of Vaccination (ICV) issued by the Bureau of Quarantine as an official proof of vaccination for international travel better known as the &quot;yellow card&quot;.

On August 22, 2021, the Department of Labor and Employment announced that the Government of Hong Kong will permit the entry of fully vaccinated Filipino workers into the territory upon the presentation of the International Certificate of Vaccination issued by the Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) beginning on August 30, 2021.

US disinformation campaign

A Reuters investigation found that the United States Department of Defense (DoD) undertook a disinformation campaign in the Philippines from 2020 to 2021 which sought to discredit China, in particular its Sinovac vaccine. The campaign reportedly aimed to counter &quot;China’s COVID diplomacy and propaganda.&quot; The campaign was overseen by Special Operations Command Pacific as well as the United States Central Command. Military personnel based in Tampa, Florida operated phony accounts on Facebook, Instagram, and X (formerly Twitter), some of which were more than five years old according to Reuters. During the COVID-19 pandemic, they disseminated hashtags of #ChinaIsTheVirus and posts claiming that the Sinovac vaccine contained gelatin from pork and therefore was haram or forbidden for purposes of Islamic law. US diplomats aware of the campaign were against the idea, but they were overruled by the military, which also asked tech companies not to take down the content after it was discovered by Facebook and X. A retrospective review by the DoD subsequently uncovered other social and political messaging that was &quot;many leagues away&quot; from acceptable military objective. The primary defence contractor on the project was General Dynamics IT, which received $493 million for its role. The military-run accounts had tens of thousands of followers. It is currently unknown how many people might have been persuaded not to be vaccinated.
