		<segment id="id67967123">COVID-19 vaccination in Burundi is an ongoing immunisation campaign against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in response to the ongoing pandemic in the country.
Burundi was one of the last nation states in the world to commence vaccination against COVID-19. This was mostly due to the government's refusal to vaccinate the population throughout most of 2021. In February 2021, Thaddee Ndikumana, the health minister of Burundi, said his country was more concerned with prevention measures. &quot;Since more than 95% of patients are recovering, we estimate that the vaccines are not yet necessary,&quot; local media reported.

In October 2021, however, the Burundian government announced that it had received delivery of 500,000 doses of the Chinese Sinopharm BIBP vaccine, and announced that it would begin inoculation. Targeted vaccinations subsequently started on 18 October 2021.
