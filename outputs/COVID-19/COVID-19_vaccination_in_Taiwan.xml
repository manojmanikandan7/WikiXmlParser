The Tsai Administration, which was strictly against the importation of Chinese COVID-19 vaccines in Taiwan, has successfully secured direct access to German manufactured Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.

Despite the vaccine has proven to be safe through its Phase 2 clinical trial, the approval was still considered a controversial political move due to the lack of efficacy data and Phase 3 clinical-trial.

On 21 July the Tzu Chi Foundation announced they had reached final agreements and signed a deal with Fosun Pharma to purchase 5 million doses of Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.

In the third step, individuals can make their appointment on the platform, the vaccination app, or at the convenient store, pharmacy, or dedicated health centers.
