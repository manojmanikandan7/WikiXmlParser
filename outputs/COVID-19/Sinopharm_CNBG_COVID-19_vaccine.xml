Sinopharm NVSI COVID-19 vaccine, also known as mutI-tri-RBD or NVSI-06-08, is a COVID-19 vaccine developed by National Vaccine &amp; Serum Institute (NVSI, 中生研究院), a subsidiary of CNBG of Sinopharm.

They claim to be the world's first &quot;second generation broadly protective&quot; recombination protein subunit vaccine, i.e. by combining three heterogeneous antigens into one single trimer RBD protein (突变集成三聚化RBD, mutI-tri-RBD). It's based on the original, and the Beta (K417N/E484K/N501Y) and Kappa (L452R/E484K) variants.
