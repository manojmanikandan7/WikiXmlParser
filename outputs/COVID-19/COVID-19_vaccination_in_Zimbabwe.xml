		<segment id="id67006659">On 22 February 2021, Zimbabwe launched their national COVID-19 vaccination program using the Sinopharm BIBP vaccine. As of 17 June 2022, 6,260,228 people have received their first dose, 4,598,703 have received their second dose, and 851,874 have received a third dose.

Corruption is alleged to exist within the public vaccination program, with priority for receiving vaccines being given to those willing to pay bribes to hospital staff, and members of Zimbabwe's ruling party ZANU-PF. Vaccines are reportedly available within the private health care system at a cost of approximately US$40.
