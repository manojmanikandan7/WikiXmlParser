		<segment id="id67894241">COVI-VAC (codenamed CDX-005) is a COVID-19 vaccine developed by Codagenix, Inc. In December 2020, COVI-VAC started a Phase I clinical trial, involving 48 participants. The trial was scheduled to complete in June 2021, with results to be reported by May 2022. On September 29, 2021, Codagenix presented positive phase 1 data for COVI-VAC at IDWEEK2021. Data indicates that COVI-VAC is well tolerated, with no significant adverse events reported and that administration of the intranasal vaccine was immunogenic and capable of blocking nasal replication of the virus with minimal viral shedding, recorded at levels lower than those likely to result in subsequent transmission of COVID-19. Furthermore, COVI-VAC was shown to stimulate both serum and mucosal antibody immune responses.

 Medical uses 
The vaccine is administered intranasally and requires a single dose.

 Pharmacology 
COVI-VAC is a live attenuated vaccine.
