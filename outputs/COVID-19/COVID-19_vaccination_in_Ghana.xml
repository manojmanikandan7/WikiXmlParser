		<segment id="id67139751">COVID-19 vaccination in Ghana began on 1 March 2021 after the country became the first recipient of the Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine as part of the COVAX initiative. As of 6 June 2021, Ghana had administered 1,230,000 vaccine doses.

 Background 

In 2020, president Nana Akufo-Addo signed the UNAIDS Public Letter on People's Vaccine which was a campaign calling for public accessibility to the COVID-19 vaccine. He joined other world leaders to write an open letter in order to encourage the distribution of free vaccines at no cost to all people. This was because of concerns raised that people in richer countries may have quicker access to the vaccine than poor countries. Minister for Foreign Affairs, Shirley Ayorkor Botchway stated on 12 February 2021 that there was an engagement between Ghana, Russia and China to secure COVID-19 vaccines. Accra and Kumasi were said by the government to be the first places to receive the vaccines.

On 24 February 2021, a shipment of 600,000 Oxfordâ€“AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine to Accra via COVAX made it the first country in Africa to receive vaccines via the initiative. The vaccination campaign began on 1 March 2021 as president Akufo-Addo received the first jab.
