Vaccines on order


Vaccines in trial stage


Statistics



Challenges
Only |270203917|2 of the Indonesian population has been fully vaccinated. This is caused by several problems and challenges. First, Indonesia lacks vaccines and human resources to support the program. The country also struggles to distribute the vaccines equally to all regions, especially to rural and remote areas. Some provinces have vaccinated its population multiple times more than other provinces. Hoaxes and fake news have also caused many Indonesians to question the efficiency of the vaccine, leading to them choosing not to be vaccinated.

Effectiveness
On 23 April 2021, a public health office in Semarang reported that 411 of vaccinated individuals had contracted COVID-19. 267 of them were infected after the first dose, while 144 after the second dose.

Based on observations on about 120,000 public health workers in Jakarta who were vaccinated from January to March, 28 days after the second dose, CoronaVac prevents 94% of COVID-19 symptoms, 96% in preventing hospitalization, and 98% in preventing deaths. But after the first dose, the effectiveness against the symptoms is only 13%.

During an outbreak in Kudus, Central Java, from 6,000 health professionals who were inoculated with CoronaVac, as of 12 June 2021, 308 of them were infected with COVID-19, 277 practice self-isolation, and 193 recovered. The director of Dr. Loekmono Hadi Regional General Hospital, dr. Abdul Aziz Achyar, stated the vaccines were proven to be able to reduce sickness and death risk from COVID-19.

On 18 June 2021, Reuters reported that more than 350 Indonesian doctors and medical workers had contracted SARS-CoV-2 despite being vaccinated with CoronaVac. Griffith University epidemiologist, Dicky Budiman, said that it was unclear how effective CoronaVac was against the Delta variant.

Based on observations study on 86,936 Jakarta residents aged 60 and above  from March to April, CoronaVac is 85% effective against symptomatic illness and 92% against hospitalization. If only the first dose is given, the effectiveness against symptomatic illness is reduced to 35%.

Controversies
As one of the first public figures who received a COVID-19 vaccine inoculation, Raffi Ahmad was criticized for breaking health protocols during a party the night after he was vaccinated.
