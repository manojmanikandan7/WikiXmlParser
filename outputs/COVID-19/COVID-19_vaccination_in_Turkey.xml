As of April 2nd, 2022, 57,784,362 people have received their first dose, and 52,982,877 people have been fully vaccinated. 27,648,857 people received their third dose. 63% of the total population in Turkey is fully vaccinated.

Effect of vaccine
In January 2021, new COVID-19 cases in Turkey were at 12,203. Then, in April 2021, they rose to 40,806. However, due to the vaccine rollout, cases dropped to 5,288 in July 2021.

Public perception of vaccine
Through a study done on the population of Turkey's perception of the COVID-19 vaccine, it was shown that only 62.7% of participants had a positive perception of the vaccine. Specifically, those with previous experience with COVID-19, those with bachelor's degrees or higher, and those with experience with influenza vaccines were more likely to have a positive perception of the COVID-19 vaccine.
