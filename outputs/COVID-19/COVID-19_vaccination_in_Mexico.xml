		<segment id="id67282435">COVID-19 vaccination in Mexico is an ongoing immunization campaign against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in response to the ongoing pandemic in the country.

Background

By September 25, 2021, Mexico had administered a total of 97,523,789 doses (74.87 vaccine doses per 100 people), with 54,275,054 residents having received at least one dose and 43,248,659 residents fully vaccinated. Mexico has purchased 310.8 million vaccines doses which covers 141.2% of its population.

Wealthy Mexicans were reported to travel to the neighbouring United States for receiving their vaccinations. In March, the White House announced that four million of doses of COVID-19 vaccines manufactured in the United States will be sent to Mexico.

In a survey conducted in March 2021, 52% of the Mexicans said that they were willing to get vaccinated against COVID-19, 20% said they were not sure and 28% said they would not get vaccinated.

On 20 April 2021, President López Obrador televised himself receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine.
