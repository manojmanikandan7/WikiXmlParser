		<segment id="id67268564">The COVID-19 vaccination in Vietnam is an ongoing immunization campaign against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in response to the ongoing pandemic in the country. Following the approval of the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine on 30 January 2021, vaccinations commenced on 8 March 2021, and will continue throughout the year with the goal of vaccinating 80% of the population by June 2022. The Sputnik V was later approved for use on 23 March 2021. The Sinopharm BIBP vaccine was approved for emergency use on 4 June 2021, while Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, Moderna COVID-19 vaccine and Janssen COVID-19 vaccine were approved on 12 June 2021, 29 June 2021, and 15 July 2021, respectively. Vietnam approved Abdala vaccine from Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology on 18 September 2021, and Covaxin from Bharat Biotech on 10 November 2021.

This is the country's largest-ever immunization campaign, aiming to administer over 150 million doses. As of 6 April 2022, Vietnam has administered 207,235,119 vaccine doses across the country.

History

In August 2020, the Vietnamese government announced that they had signed up for 50 to 150 million doses of Sputnik V vaccine from Russia. The Russians will also donate a number of machines, biological products and equipment to Vietnam for COVID-19 prevention, including their vaccine. In the meantime, Vietnamese researchers will still continue developing the country's own vaccine. In early June, Minister of Health Nguyen Thanh Long confirmed that Russia had agreed to provide Vietnam with 20 million doses of Sputnik V in 2021. Vabiotech will also start packaging Sputnik V vaccine in Vietnam from July, with a monthly capacity of five million doses. On 21 July 2021, it was announced that a batch of Sputnik V had been produced for the first time in Vietnam by Vabiotech. Before that, on 12 July 2021, the Government allowed T&amp;T Group to negotiate with the Direct Investment Fund of the Russian Federation (RDIF) for 40 million additional doses of Sputnik V vaccine, using its own fund; not from the government budget or Vietnam's vaccine fund. On August 4, 2021, Vimedimex signed an import contract with an UAE-based company called Royal Strategics Partners, for 10 million doses of COVID-19 Janssen vaccine; 5 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine Pfizer; 10 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine Sputnik V. Currently, the parties are completing legal documents to submit to the Ministry of Health for an import license.

In February 2021, the Ministry of Health suggested the government to approve COVID-19 vaccines from AstraZeneca, Gamaleya, and Moderna for domestic inoculation to prevent and control the ongoing pandemic in the country. National Deployment and Vaccination plan (NDVP) was signed off by Deputy Minister of Health on 9 February 2021. Vietnam will receive the feedback of the plan from NDVP review committee as one of the required steps to receive COVID-19 vaccines through [https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/act-accelerator/covax/covax-facility-background.pdf?sfvrsn=810d3c22_2 COVAX Facility] – a global mechanism for developing, manufacturing, supplying and procuring COVID-19 vaccines for all country, especially for low and middle-income economies. Through COVAX, it is confirmed that Vietnam will receive 38.9 million doses of COVID vaccine in 2021. The first batch of vaccines sourced via Covax mechanism, containing 811,200 doses, arrived in Hanoi's Noi Bai International Airport on 1 April 2021. On 6 July, it was confirmed that the United States would send Vietnam two million doses of Moderna COVID-19 vaccine via Covax mechanism. 10 days later, on 16 July, the US embassy in Hanoi informed the Ministry of Health that the country will support Vietnam with 3 million additional doses of Moderna vaccine.

On 14 October 2021, the Ministry of Health authorized the use of COVID-19 vaccine for children aged 12 to 17.

On December 10, the city of Ho Chi Minh initiated a campaign to administer third doses of AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccinations to adults over 50, those with weakened immune systems, and frontline workers. The city plans to vaccinate all adults above the age of 18 with the third dosage in 2022.

Vaccines on order
As of 9 November 2023, a total of 230,910,514 doses have arrived in Vietnam. The government began to procure doses of COVID-19 vaccines from various sources:


* Even when the Chinese announced it would provide priority access to CoronaVac and the Sinopharm BIBP vaccine, Vietnam is the last ASEAN nation to publicly state if it will use this due to anti-China sentiment among the public. It is also one of the last to approve a Chinese vaccine.
* For locally produced COVID-19 vaccines, the MOH expects to have the first batch ready for use at the end of the third quarter of 2021. These vaccines can be put into the country's vaccination campaign in 2022 to ensure supply source and health security, overcome the difficulties when purchasing foreign vaccines. The two locally produced vaccines, Nanocovax and COVIVAC, were put on trial on January to March 2021, respectively. On 21 July 2021, the first test batch of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine has been produced in Vietnam, according to Russia's sovereign wealth fund RDIF and Vietnamese pharmaceutical company Vabiotech. The first validation samples taken from the batch were shipped to Gamaleya Center in Russia for quality control checks. On 24 September, the vaccine began to be mass-produced when it was determined that it met the quality standards.

Local production


Vaccines in trial stage




* A spokesman from the Covivac vaccine development team stated on November 30, 2021, that they are currently unable to locate a location with several thousand people who have not been inoculated against COVID-19 and are eligible to participate in clinical trials. As a result, the development team opted to halt the phase three experiment indefinitely.

Rollout plan


VNVC – the company in charge of importing and storing vaccines in Vietnam, announced that it is ready to deploy staff and facilities that can store up to 170 million doses of vaccines. The facilities include 49 provincial vaccine warehouses, 2 cold-condition warehouses, and 3 deep-freeze warehouses designed for storing vaccines at temperatures ranging from -40 to -86°C. In February 2021, VNVC's service capacity was reported to reach up to 100,000 customers per day, with the capability to scale up to accommodate the distribution of up to 4 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines per month.

According to Deputy Minister of Health Tran Van Thuan, for the majority of the population to be protected, Vietnam needs to diversify its vaccine supply. This diversification includes using locally manufactured vaccines and the maximizing resources from businesses and local government budgets, in addition to the national government's budget, to support the vaccination program. The budget for vaccinating 20% of the population is estimated at 6.739 trillion VND ($293.67 million USD), with more than 90% of this cost covered by the COVAX Facility. The Vietnamese government will contribute 24 billion VND, complemented by municipal and provincial governments and private sources.

On 24 June 2021, the Ministry of Health established a Steering Committee for the nationwide COVID-19 vaccination campaign. The committee consists of five subcommittees:
* Subcommittee on Receiving, Transporting, and Preserving Vaccines
* Subcommittee on Immunization
* Subcommittee on Safety of Vaccination
* Subcommittee on Quality Supervision of Vaccines
* Subcommittee on Information Technology Application in Vaccination Management and Communication
along with a permanent office for the Steering Committee.
The National Steering Committee for the COVID-19 vaccination campaign is headed by the Minister of Health. The command center of the vaccination campaign is located at the Ministry of Defence, led by a Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the People's Army.
It is expected that the campaign will utilize eight vaccine storage warehouses, with one warehouse in each military district and another at the High Command of Capital Hanoi. Upon arrival at the airport, vaccines will be immediately transferred to the military warehouse, from where they will be transported by military vehicles to 19,000 vaccination points nationwide.

By locality



Adverse event following immunization
Of the 69 medical staff at Gia Lai Field Hospital who administered AstraZeneca vaccine on 9 March 2021, eight had mild side effects and one female nurse had severe side effects. Five minutes after injection, this nurse (with a history of bronchial asthma) experienced symptoms of perioral numbness, vomiting, dizziness, chest tightness and difficulty breathing.

The health ministry has asked local health authorities which face serious post-injection reactions to set up a professional council to evaluate the causes. There has not been a single case of severe blood clots reported in some European nations.

On 7 May 2021, Vietnam recorded the first death of a person vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine. She was a 35-year-old medical staff in An Giang Province. This female health worker was vaccinated with AstraZeneca vaccine in the morning of 6 May at the vaccination site in Tan Chau Regional General Hospital. Before the injection, she was screened and explained about post-injection reactions. After the injection, she had anaphylactic shock reaction. According to the conclusion of the An Giang Department of Health, the cause of death is anaphylaxis on the basis of non-steroidal allergy (anti-inflammatory painkiller).

By 25 November, four workers had died. Thanh Hoa authorities stopped injecting the remaining 43,000 doses of Vero Cell in storage and investigated the cause of this incident.

Public opinion and vaccine effectiveness
A poll conducted from October to December 2020 found that Vietnam had one of the highest vaccine acceptance rate in the world. 98% of people surveyed responded they would definitely or probably get vaccinated when a COVID-19 vaccine becomes available.

A survey conducted in mid-October 2021 at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City (where severe COVID-19 patients are treated) showed that 45% of the 349 patients had mild symptoms, while the rest had severe symptoms.

When comparing mild and severe symptoms in vaccinated and unvaccinated patients, 74% of the unvaccinated group had severe symptoms. 40% of those in the vaccinated group (who received one or two doses) had severe symptoms. 49% of those who received one dose experienced severe symptoms, while only 12% of those who received the second dose did.
