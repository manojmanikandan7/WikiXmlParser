		<segment id="id67270412">BriLife, also known as IIBR-100, is a replication-competent recombinant VSV viral vectored COVID-19 vaccine candidate. It was developed by the Israel Institute for Biological Research (IIBR). The IIBR partnered with the US-based NRx Pharmaceuticals to complete clinical trials and commercialize the vaccine. A study conducted in hamsters suggested that one dose of the vaccine was safe and effective at protecting against COVID-19.
