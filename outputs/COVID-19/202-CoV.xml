		<segment id="id68602519">202-CoV is a COVID-19 vaccine candidate developed by Shanghai Zerun Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Walvax Biotech. It is one of several candidates under development by Walvax.

 Development 
In May 2020, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation awarded Shanghai Zerun Biotechnology a $1,000,000 USD vaccine development grant to &quot;support research and development for COVID-19 response&quot;.

In July 2021, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced that it had partnered with Shanghai Zerun Biotechnology and its parent company, Walvax Biotech, to develop COVID-19 vaccine candidates against both the original strain of SARS-CoV-2 and its newer variants. As of October 2022, CEPI had provided up to $25.1 million USD towards 202-CoV, but had ceased further funding. The chimeric protein candidate remains in Phase I clinical trials.
