		<segment id="id67543997">mRNA-1283, sold under the brand name mNEXSPIKE, is a COVID-19 vaccine candidate developed by Moderna.

Compared to prior mRNA vaccines, this candidate has a storage temperature of 2-5 Â°C, compatible with vaccine storage in a standard refrigerator, rather than low temperature freezers.  Additionally, the vaccine will be packaged in prefilled syringes, reducing burden on healthcare workers and potentially increasing access.

 Clinical Trial  

In December, Moderna started a clinical trial which would evaluate the vaccine's ability to provoke an immune response and its safety. As of May 2024, the vaccine candidate is in Phase 3 clinical trials, with an estimated completion date of late August 2024.  Preliminary results from this trial indicated the vaccine produced a strong immune response, especially in patients over 65, who are at greater risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19.

mRNA-1283 was approved by the Food and Drug Administration on May 30, 2025, under the name &quot;mNEXSPIKE&quot;, for use in adults 65 years or older and individuals 12-64 years old with at least one comorbidity.
