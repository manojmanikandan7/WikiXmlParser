		<segment id="id64635178">Due to its severity, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused countries to send aid, as part of the international responses and management regarding the pandemic. Types of materials aided includes (but are not limited to) masks, medical supplies, personal protective equipment, money, and test kits. It started with aid to China as the virus spreads primarily there, and then internationally as it spreads globally. The destination of the aid ranges from hospitals, COVID-19 healthcare workers, research on the vaccine, to societies vulnerable. People donating includes the government of said country, notable people, organizations and institutions, charities, as well as regular people.

Aid to China

Some Chinese students at American universities sent aid, including 50,000 N95 masks on 30 January. The humanitarian aid organization Direct Relief sent 200,000 face masks and other personal protective equipment to the Wuhan Union Hospital the same day. On 5 February, the Chinese foreign ministry said 21 countries (including Belarus, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Egypt, and Iran) had sent aid to China, as well as Bill and Melinda Gates announcing a $100 million donation to the WHO to fund vaccine research and treatment efforts and protect &quot;at-risk populations in Africa and South Asia.&quot; Interaksyon said the Chinese government had donated 200,000 masks to the Philippines on 6 February after Philippine senator Richard Gordon shipped 3.16 million masks to Wuhan. On 19 February, the Singapore Red Cross announced it would send $2.26 million worth of aid to China.

Several countries donated masks, medical equipment or money to China, including Japan, Turkey, Russia, Malaysia, Germany, and Canada. The U.S. State Department said on 7 February it had facilitated the transportation of nearly 17.8 tons of medical supplies to China. The same day, U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo announced a $100 million pledge to China and other countries to aid their fights against the virus, though on 21 March China said it had not received epidemic funding from the U.S. government and reiterated that on 3 April. Several corporations have also donated money or medical equipment to China.

China also aided the things needed as other countries have the virus spread faster and their country's graphs lowered. They, along with Cuba and Russia, sent experts and medical equipment to Italy in order to fight their virus outbreak, with China sending three medical teams and donated more than forty tons of medical supplies to Italy. Businessman Jack Ma sent 1.1 million testing kits, 6 million face masks, and 60,000 protective suits to Ethiopia for distribution by the African Union. He later sent 5,000 testing kits, 100,000 face masks and 5 ventilators to Panama. However, in August 2020, a corruption scandal emerged over Ma's medical donations to Africa.
