		<segment id="id78381821">Does WP:MEDRS apply to medical information about individuals?

In a previous discussion on this talk page, some editors concluded that no, WP:MEDRS does not apply to diagnosis (see ); however, this was a brief discussion with few comments and no formal closure. The issue was also raised on the Julian Assange talk page, and different views on the relevance of WP:MEDRS were expressed (see ). In two RfCs on Trump's mental health ( and ), the consensus was &quot;Do not bring up for discussion again until an announced formal diagnosis or WP:MEDRS-level sources are provided&quot; [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Donald_Trump/Current_consensus], implying that WP:MEDRS applies to medical diagnoses. I suspect that this issue has arisen elsewhere (e.g. regarding the athlete Imane Khelif ). The intersection between BLP and MEDRS has far-reaching implications for content (e.g., should we remove from Vladimir Putin the statement ?) that are hard to foresee. Gitz (talk) () 10:52, 27 August 2024 (UTC)
Firstly, to state the obvious, even if WP:MEDRS didn't apply, both WP:RS and WP:BLP would. Which implies that we shouldn't be making statements regarding any diagnosis concerning a living individual without (a) very good sourcing, and (b) a legitimate reason to consider such diagnosis to be of real enduring significance to public life of the individual concerned. In such a context, I'm finding it hard to see how a non-medical source could be used for sourcing in very many circumstances, beyond possibly the subject themselves stating that they had been diagnosed with something. Wikipedia certainly shouldn't be republishing tabloid speculation without good cause, even if framed in text attributing it to said tabloid sources. 

As for whether WP:MEDRS should apply, I'm doubtful that it could in practice. Very few medical diagnoses will involve peer-review etc, or be discussed in systemic reviews. Quite possibly what we need is an amendment (or rather clarification) to 'WP:BLP policy, making it clear that speculation about a living individuals' medical status does not belong in articles except in very exceptional circumstances, and that repeating poorly-sourced 'diagnoses' is an unacceptable breach of the requirement to respect the privacy of individuals etc, regardless of how it is attributed or framed. AndyTheGrump (talk) 12:34, 27 August 2024 (UTC)
Yup, and I think common sense applies. The yardstick is whether or not the statement implies anything about biomedicine. Saying Taylor Swift had a cold (say) does not; saying a celebrity was diagnosed with Morgellons would imply that was a real condition, so would. Bon courage (talk) 13:30, 27 August 2024 (UTC)
Agreed. MEDRS does not apply to an individual's diagnosis, but BLP/RS does. In the Trump case you quote, there's an &quot;or&quot; as an announced formal diagnosis in a regular RS would be fine. We should generally strive for the best sourcing available, so MEDRS-level sourcing is to be encouraged generally. Bondegezou (talk) 14:12, 27 August 2024 (UTC)
I agree with all the comments above, but I'd like to understand if there's anything specific to medical diagnoses (e.g. the high level of expertise required to make one) that makes their coverage different from other sensitive areas of a BLP such as, say, sexual orientation. If this is the case, then perhaps a few lines could be added to either WP:MEDRS or WP:BLP to make it clear. Otherwise, the usual WP:BLP + RS apply, including WP:BLPGOSSIP, and if multiple news organisations report, for instance, that according to The Sun Putin may have Parkinson's, we can do the same. If they report that a public figure may have some medical condition (something that does imply questionable biomedical statements: not Morgellons or any other /) we can include this. Gitz (talk) () 15:32, 27 August 2024 (UTC)
IF The Sun, a British tabloid that is deprecated by RSP at , speculates that a public figure has a medical condition, and this gets repeated by other media companies, then we should probably not include that.
Spend a while thinking about what some celebrity articles (Britney Spears?) would look like if the standard was &quot;One unreliable source said it, and a bunch of media companies decided that they wanted some of that traffic&quot;. WhatamIdoing (talk) 17:14, 27 August 2024 (UTC)
I agree that the example from Putin is a bit extreme - we should probably remove that content from the article. But what about articles like Claims of Vladimir Putin's incapacity and death and Age and health concerns about Donald Trump? These subjects are notable and the content is potentially contentious. It would be impossible to write these articles if MEDRS-compliant sources were required. This suggests that WP:MEDRS does not apply to diagnoses of individuals, but only to content that presupposes or explicates biomedical knowledge. It seems that the purpose of WP:MEDRS is not to protect the privacy of living persons, but to ensure that reporting on biomedical topics reflects scientific consensus. Gitz (talk) () 08:48, 28 August 2024 (UTC)
Context: Gitz was banned from Imane Khelif article for  and  violations. See  Bluethricecreamman (talk) 16:07, 27 August 2024 (UTC)
 This &quot;context&quot; is irrelevant: the issue is of general interest and does not concern me or my partial block. I opened this thread because 331dot suggested that if I felt the policy needed clarification (which I do), this should be sought at WT:MEDRS rather than in the unblock request. But this discussion has no direct bearing on my block: even if everyone agreed that WP:MEDRS does not apply to individual diagnoses, my block would still remain in place. Gitz (talk) () 11:00, 28 August 2024 (UTC) .
Further Context Gitz had an unblock request denied at  as they did not provide a convincing reason why they should be unblocked from Imane Khelif. TarnishedPathtalk 11:14, 28 August 2024 (UTC)
Do you just want to provide &quot;further context&quot; or do you also have an opinion on the topic of this thread? I remember you arguing that we need MEDRS-level sources to include a diagnosis in a BLP if it belongs to the GENSEX topic area (or something like that). Gitz (talk) () 15:29, 28 August 2024 (UTC)
On the Trump RFC outcomes:  The community is allowed to set higher rules for an individual article, particularly when repeated discussions are wasting the community's time and wearing on its patience.  &quot;Come back when you've got a MEDRS source&quot; is not very different from &quot;One-year moratorium on this subject, because the answer is not changing&quot; or &quot;All future discussions will be subject to  rules, because we've wasted enough time on throw-away accounts&quot;. WhatamIdoing (talk) 17:10, 27 August 2024 (UTC)
Yes, I understand. Let me expand on what you've said. In a talk page discussion, when an editor says &quot;we need WP:MEDRS sources for this statement&quot;, this might mean either: 1) &quot;WP:MEDRS applies here&quot;. Based on our discussion, this is wrong if the statement is about an individual's diagnosis as opposed to general biomedical knowledge. To include content about a diagnosis in a BLP, we need sufficient coverage from generally reliable sources to ensure due weight, but MEDRS-level sources aren't strictly necessary; 2) Or, &quot;Given the contentious and complex nature of this topic, we should require MEDRS-level sources - the usual NEWSORGs are not sufficient&quot;. This would be a suggestion, not a policy requirement; it may gain consensus on the talk page, but doesn't reflect the standard use of MEDRS. Gitz (talk) () 09:46, 29 August 2024 (UTC)
I think there's a danger of over-thinking this. For Wikipedia to say any living person has a serious medical condition there would need to be a proper diagnosis and (in reality) that private information would need to be made public in a decent, reputable . Speculation about a condition, or armchair diagnosisif ever duewould need to come from a MEDRS source of some sort. Bon courage (talk) 12:02, 29 August 2024 (UTC)
I think that if there is a consensus on this approach, then we should write it down somewhere in unambiguous terms, because I keep coming across BLPs that do not follow it. From the article about a recently deceased woman, Tamara Press: ; from the article about her sister Irina Press: . Sources are the [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1463233/Irina-Press.html Telegraph], [https://web.archive.org/web/20080824220307/https://www.straightdope.com/columns/080822.html thestraightdope.com], [https://transgriot.blogspot.com/2011/11/olympic-gender-drama-press-sisters.html TransGriot], [https://web.archive.org/web/20200417174500/https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/pr/irina-press-1.html sports-reference.com]. Nothing here remotely resembles a &quot;proper diagnosis&quot;, which in the case of the Press sisters was never made. At best, we should write something like &quot;The Press sisters retired in 1966, coinciding with the introduction of required gender verification in track &amp; field. This led to widespread, yet never proven, rumors regarding the Presses' genders&quot; (from the last cited source). Gitz (talk) () 19:20, 1 September 2024 (UTC)
I'm not sure that there is a problem with this (other than the last sentence probably needing to say sex instead of genders).  &quot;She was accused of...&quot; is not the same as &quot;She had...&quot;  We don't need a medical journal to say that some athletes get accused of having the &quot;wrong&quot; type of body, or that the accusations, even if completely unfounded, can lead to real-world consequences for the accused athlete.  In such cases, the article content should focus on the fact that the accusations historically happened, without implying that the accusations are medically true. WhatamIdoing (talk) 20:13, 1 September 2024 (UTC)
Agree, that example does not seem to be about 'diagnosis' or 'serious medical conditions'. Bon courage (talk) 20:20, 1 September 2024 (UTC)
Seems like the answer to the question in the title to this section (Does WP:MEDRS apply to medical information about individuals?) is already covered by .  A relevant excerpt of examples of what is not covered by MEDRS:
; Notable cases
 If the patient is still alive or is recently deceased, the  rules apply.
; Popular culture
 Examples of people with the disease in literature, video, or songs
I don't see a need to further clarify the issue. Mr. Swordfish (talk) 14:47, 3 September 2024 (UTC)
I had noticed this page, which is indeed quite relevant to this discussion. However, it is only an explanatory essay (). So, if I'm not mistaken, there's nothing to stop a local consensus being reached that diagnoses in a particular BLP (because it's particularly controversial, because the diagnosis is difficult, because news organisations don't seem reliable enough...) require MEDRS-level sources. But in general there seems to be no doubt that MEDRS does not apply to individual diagnoses: the medical conditions of a living person can be covered with the usual WP:RS and the usual policies and guidelines, including WP:WIKIVOICE and WP:INTEXT (if the diagnosis is controversial or just &quot;rumours&quot; or &quot;accusations&quot;). Gitz (talk) () 15:14, 3 September 2024 (UTC)
There's nothing in MEDRS that says BLPs are &quot;biomedical information&quot;, either.

I'm not familiar with the backstory here but isn't the problem from the other directionthat is with editors wanting to say that Dave the Doctor has said Paul Politician obviously has dementia or that Alice the Athlete is a man, actually? Bon courage (talk) 16:58, 3 September 2024 (UTC)
Yes, I think that the point is whether WP:MEDRS prevents these editors from making this case, or whether it's just a normal dispute about WP:RS and WP:WEIGHT. Do they need Dave the Doctor to have published his theories in a reputable medical journal, or is it enough that Dave's views have been covered by many news organisations? Gitz (talk) () 17:12, 3 September 2024 (UTC)
You mean articles like Age and health concerns about Donald Trump#Allegations of mental illness by medical professionals?  I don't expect editors to restrict themselves to MEDRS' ideal in such articles. WhatamIdoing (talk) 01:41, 4 September 2024 (UTC)
O God that exists eh? An &quot;ideal&quot; MEDRS source is never going to exist for such material but I do think a MEDRS source of some sort is needed for diagnosis of a medical condition in a BLP, a source sufficient to support the weight of the claim made. I suspect the real issue here is AP2/GENSEX and editors wanting to advocate positions, which is something this WikiProject cannot fix.  I see we also have Age and health concerns about Joe Biden which delightfully has &quot;No signs of cognitive decline or dementia were noted.&quot;. It seems to be attempting to source stuff to the Whitehouse's published presidential physical exam, which would be some sort of MEDRS, FWIW? Bon courage (talk) 03:55, 4 September 2024 (UTC)
Of course it exists.  These armchair diagnoses got so much attention in the press during the previous elections that I heard the APA put out a warning to its members about it being unethical to claim you've diagnosed someone who isn't your patient (and illegal to disclose your diagnoses if he is).  It would be  to exclude it, but impossible to source statements like &quot;He's scientifically proven to have _____&quot;.  Therefore the contents end up being some variation on &quot;Alice claims he has _____&quot;, and editors fight over negotiate about which claims are necessary to include and how to phrase them.
A published presidential exam would be a primary source, which is not the MEDRS ideal.  Based on the media kerfuffle around one of Trump's published reports allegedly having been written by his (political) staff, we should probably insist upon  attribution for such sources. WhatamIdoing (talk) 04:00, 4 September 2024 (UTC)
For sure. Bon courage (talk) 04:02, 4 September 2024 (UTC)
What has prompted this discussoin is editors, Gitz included, wanting to include material in an article that includes speculation about a medical diagnosis in the absense of reliable evidence. TarnishedPathtalk 00:12, 4 September 2024 (UTC)
You need a MEDRS-quality source to say, e.g., that human sexual differentiation exists on a spectrum rather than a binary, and therefore at some level we are all intersex.  You do not need a MEDRS-quality source to say that Imane Khelif has been accused of having a medical condition that could render her ineligible for competing in women's sports. WhatamIdoing (talk) 01:34, 4 September 2024 (UTC)
But what about that she has all the signs of having that condition, so the diagnosis surely follows? Bon courage (talk) 03:45, 4 September 2024 (UTC)
I haven't followed this, but I saw a headline about 5α-Reductase 2 deficiency, which doesn't necessarily come with visible signs.   WhatamIdoing (talk) 04:14, 4 September 2024 (UTC)
I am not clear what you mean, , but doesn't  apply there? We shouldn't be drawing conclusions. If RS have drawn conclusions, we report what RS said, subject to normal BLP rules. Bondegezou (talk) 11:55, 4 September 2024 (UTC)
My assumption was it would be sourced. I have no interest in this particular case (and have not followed it) but, hypothetically, if Doctor Dave says something about biomedical about Athlete Alice (or Paul Politician, or Celebrity Caleb) along the lines of &quot;I can see from observation X that they have condition Y&quot; I don't think that's okay to relay that if it just comes from a lay source, as much for reasons of BLP/NPOV as for weakness of the sourcing. Bon courage (talk) 12:02, 4 September 2024 (UTC)
Exactly, and in the content dispute that has brought about this discussion (Imane Khelif) we have some pundits, some of whom happen to have degrees in adjacent areas and one or two that are subject matter experts, either engaging in commentary (in sources) which are presumptive or speculative about the subjects medical conditions when it would be unethical for them to discuss a patient diagnosis when they are not the treating doctor or illegal if they are. Editors, such as the one who started this discussion, have tried to push the comments of those pundits as evidence that there is reasonable discussion about the subject's diagnosis and not a whole bunch of misinformation. TarnishedPathtalk 12:37, 4 September 2024 (UTC)
I don't want to go into the specifics of the case as this is a general discussion, but some background information might be helpful. In 2023 Imane Khelif was disqualified by the International Boxing Federation (a Russian-led, much-criticised sport organisation) because (they claimed) she has XY chromosomes. She waived her appeal against that decision and never released a medical test showing that she has XX chromosomes. In 2024 the International Olympic Committee took the athletes' passports at face value and did not carry out gender testing. So some sports journalists and commentators took it for granted that Khelif has XY chromosomes. Some sources have reported either that she is intersex (Italian press) or that she may be intersex (BBC, New York Times - all major English-speaking NEWSORGs). Even if that were the case, it doesn't mean that she went through male puberty and had a competitive advantage at the Olympics: certain forms of DSDs don't provide any advantage. However, some (more or less WP:BIASED) &quot;experts&quot; ventured a speculative diagnosis of 5-ARD (which would give her a competitive advantage) based on observations such as visual evidence of high levels of testosterone and the like. On the Imane Khelif talk page, there was a broad consensus (myself included) that she should not be described as intersex, not even hypothetically or with attribution (&quot;some have argued that ... she may be&quot;). The point of contention in  is whether to include in the lead that she's been the subject of public debate about her eligibility to compete with women (and also about the soundness of the IOC policy of &quot;stick to the passport, no testing&quot;). In the context of that discussion, I was partially blocked for making [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=1241727178 this comment]. Gitz (talk) () 13:20, 4 September 2024 (UTC)
Well there you have it. On such multiple-s, sourcing and behaviour needs to be impeccable or sanctions will likely follow. Personally speculating on a Talk page about somebody's medical condition(s) is really irrelevant to this discussion and not anything WP:MED or MEDRS can influence. FAFO. Bon courage (talk) 13:34, 4 September 2024 (UTC)
Fair enough. This thread, however, is significant if the issue comes up again in talk page discussions, as it's likely to happen. In my view, there is a clear consensus that WP:MEDRS does not apply to individual diagnoses (as per ), unless they based on or express controversial biomedical theories. If I were not involved, I would venture to close it with this statement. Gitz (talk) () 13:43, 4 September 2024 (UTC)
Well yeah, where that is a proper 'diagnosis' and not pundit speculation and/or in a weak source. Bon courage (talk) 13:47, 4 September 2024 (UTC)
a) A reliable sources don't say she waived her appeal. A reliable sources say she couldn't continue due to not having the funds. 
b) The onus isn't on her to disprove the IBA which is unreliable and discredited. 
c) Italian sources posting that she is intersex are obviously engaging in disinformation on the basis of nationalism. 
d) any expert who isn't her doctor speculating about medical diagnosis is engaging in unethical behaviour. They can't claim high levels of testosterone when they are not her doctor and there are is no reliable evidence. 
e) the point of the RFC is to insert language into the article which paints the picture that there has been legitimate concerns, when there has not. Legitimate concerns are based of reliable evidence/facts and there is an abundant lack of those. TarnishedPathtalk 01:17, 5 September 2024 (UTC)

As per the rest of what you wrote, M.Bitton summed it up. TarnishedPathtalk 03:28, 5 September 2024 (UTC)
@Bon courage, I think I disagree with you about .  To illustrate why, I'm going to give you my own totally non-RS diagnosis about a BLP:  Bryce Dallas Howard has a significantly elevated risk of skin cancer due to her genetics.
How can I, a lay person, make such a strong medical claim about a person I've never met, much less examined, and actually don't know anything about except that her name turns up in lists of actresses with naturally red hair and green eyes?  It's very simple:  Every single human with naturally red hair and green eyes has a significantly elevated risk of skin cancer.
We wouldn't want to put this in an article about her (unless, e.g., she announced that she had skin cancer, or got involved in skin cancer prevention advertisements), but that's because it'd be UNDUE, not because it's untrue.  But this is such a lightweight claim that any barely passable source should be considered sufficient.
(Why did I pick that as an example?  Because a few years back, the California legislature has decided that students should not be exposed to their own genetic information as part of a class, and a professor gave that as an example of an unintended consequence.)
I don't think that all medical claims need the same level of sourcing.  Sometimes a person's appearance alone is sufficient; often it's not.  And some conditions are more stigmatized, which, as you indicated, has BLP and DUE implications. WhatamIdoing (talk) 06:56, 9 September 2024 (UTC)
Okay, so would you agree if the prohibition applied only to &quot;non-obvious&quot; statements? Bon courage (talk) 07:50, 9 September 2024 (UTC)
I think the decision needs to be multi-factorial.  &quot;Obviousness&quot; is one factor (e.g., &quot;He has a bad sunburn&quot;).  Part of the difficulty here is that what's obvious to &quot;me&quot; isn't obvious to everyone.
Self-disclosure should be another.  People do sometimes lie about their health, and misdiagnoses happen, so a press release saying that Chris Celebrity can't eat gluten should never be taken as the final word, but generally you assume that a qualified healthcare professional was involved.
Did you ever work on the Terry Schiavo article?  I remember a physician-turned-politician saying that he was convinced she was conscious on the basis of a very brief video clip.  It turned out that the video clip was carefully chosen because if you saw those few seconds alone, she looked like she was watching a balloon move.  (The autopsy report said she was totally blind as a result of brain damage.)  So I think you also want some judgement call about credibility.  Someone looking to score political points is less credible than someone who isn't.  Someone with relevant expertise is more credible than ordinary people.  Someone with more information is more credible than someone less information.   Someone whose voice was elevated by a high-quality publisher/source is more credible than someone whose claim only got published because a junky source thought it'd drive traffic.
And then sometimes we have to throw this all away and say:  So much has been written about speculations on Donald Trump's mental and physical health that the speculation should be covered one way or the other.  The question there is not whether the speculation is true (e.g., &quot;Is he really a narcissist?&quot;), but whether the speculation is impactful (e.g., &quot;Did the claim that he's supposedly a narcissist have any effect on whether people are likely to vote for him?&quot;). WhatamIdoing (talk) 22:03, 9 September 2024 (UTC)
Yes, there are people who have been 'cured' of cancer but where the diagnosis was questionable in the first place. I don't know about Terry Schiavo. I agree sources should always be credible. Bon courage (talk) 05:34, 10 September 2024 (UTC)

I agree with what others are saying. I'm not sure that whoever said a MEDRS is required for saying an individual has a medical condition has really thought it through. We have other guidelines that deal with speculative, negative information about individuals. We likely have countless biographical articles that note people got cancer or had epilepsy or died of a stroke that are sourced to newspapers, and those aren't MEDRS. Contentious extraordinary claims require high quality sources. Wrt historical figures, even medical journals can be prone to armchair diagnoses of dubious quality.  -- Colin°Talk 18:30, 3 September 2024 (UTC)

We have a lot of articles that cite newspapers or obits to say &quot;Alice died at the age of 67 from cancer&quot;, which are entirely acceptable and not MEDRS' ideal.  See Angelina Jolie#Cancer prevention treatment for an  that discusses one individual's personal medical information without citing a single medical journal, reference book, or anything similar.  Instead, it relies almost entirely on news stories (or worse). WhatamIdoing (talk) 01:38, 4 September 2024 (UTC)
I don't think anybody's arguing (are they?) that MEDRS is needed to relay the knowledge that somebody has a medical condition. What's at stake is the sourcing required to make the determination that somebody has (or might have) such a condition. Right so; to repeat: For Wikipedia to say any living person has a serious medical condition there would need to be a proper diagnosis and (in reality) that private information would need to be made public in a decent, reputable WP:RS. Speculation about a condition, or armchair diagnosis – if ever due – would need to come from a MEDRS source of some sort. I don't think any change of  is necessary. Bon courage (talk) 01:31, 5 September 2024 (UTC)
If I've understood the distinction you're drawing, then we need:
* Pretty much any reliable source to say that Chris Celebrity has been diagnosed (e.g., by their own doctor) with scaryitis.  See, e.g., Charles III#Health.
* MEDRS-level article to say that, according to people who have never examined them, Chris Celebrity appears to have scaryitis.  See, e.g., Retrospective diagnosis#Examples.
* And (perhaps? are we agreed?) multiple decent sources (e.g., news and magazines) to say that Chris Celebrity has been the subject of speculation about health conditions, but these should not say that the speculations are either true or definitely false.  See, e.g., basically all of Age and health concerns about Donald Trump.
WhatamIdoing (talk) 07:22, 9 September 2024 (UTC)
Yeah something like that. In the second case obviously a strong MEDRS isn't needed to say (e.g.) somebody 'sounded hoarse' while singing; but to say their gait was characteristic of a neurological condition would need something with some MEDRS chops. Bon courage (talk) 07:33, 9 September 2024 (UTC)
For that second category, I'd expect &quot;some MEDRS chops&quot; to be generally on the lower side (perhaps a peer-reviewed primary source), and I think we need to use sensible judgment, so that things that are more common and obvious don't require much, but wild speculation requires stronger sources. WhatamIdoing (talk) 07:41, 9 September 2024 (UTC)
I think Chris's surname is unhelpful. None of the people at Retrospective diagnosis#Examples are &quot;celebrities&quot; and I would hope medical journals would have better things to do than speculate on the Kardashians or the latest Love Island contestants. The [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1671667/?page=1 Marfan's syndrome] source is sadly typical of superficially &quot;MEDRS&quot; sources, where a famous name is dropped in the introduction to a more serious article that isn't about them at all. Presumably journal editors/reviewers permit this kind of speculation as &quot;harmless&quot; and don't stop to think &quot;but some Wikipedian might cite this&quot;.
I'm not sure there is good evidence that for historical figures, supposedly MEDRS sources are any better than a serious history book. Possibly a serious historian has dug up detailed descriptions of their illness and described them to a medical expert like any scholar might about any fact outside of their expertise. So some Oxford University Press history book could well diagnose an illness or cause of death and I actually think historians would be more professionally motivated to get their history right vs some random consultant neurologist attempting an entertaining introduction to their latest review. -- Colin°Talk 14:29, 10 September 2024 (UTC)
Health of Abraham Lincoln lists several possible diagnoses.  We would presumably accept a med school textbook saying that he might have had Marfan's (or, perhaps more likely, depression), and perhaps a similarly serious work of history would also be appropriate.  I think it's worth thinking over, but right now, I'm having trouble explaining why a scholarly history book feels okay, but the &quot;peer-reviewed literary analysis&quot; mentioned at  concerns me.  Perhaps the latter is closer to the concept of using a primary source to debunk a secondary one.  I'm still thinking about it. WhatamIdoing (talk) 03:21, 15 September 2024 (UTC)
Maybe the thing to think about is what would the peer reviewers (and editors and publishers) be concerning themselves with? A neurological paper, outlining the state of understanding of a condition and its treatment, is concerned with whether that is an accurate and comprehensive medical review, not whether the introduction correctly identifies some long dead historical figure. Whereas presumably a university press history book is concerned with getting history right.
A literary analysis would seem to be utterly unconcerned with truth, facts, or indeed the real world, but seeks to view a piece of writing under various conceptual frameworks and thought processes. It seems that two literary analysis papers could produce entirely contradictory conclusions about a work, and that would be just fine as long as the analysis is self consistent. It seems to me that using it to say something about the real world is as much a conceptual error as using an academic theology paper about some Hindu script's story about a god, is evidence that this god does or does not exist. -- Colin°Talk 18:34, 15 September 2024 (UTC)
In policy terms, I think we'd call that &quot;appropriate&quot;, as in   A gold-plated scientific source is not appropriate for information about movie ticket sales, and a source that's appropriate for box office success is not appropriate for scientific claims. WhatamIdoing (talk) 03:07, 16 September 2024 (UTC)
That's probably too vague a word to be useful. I think the problem we had with that literary analysis was that even non-literary-analysis claims (like factual claims, some of which were inaccurate) were held to be true because it was published in a scientific journal and had been peer reviewed. Elsewhere we have seen what I would regard as opinion pieces but not always labelled as such, because they are more some kind of intellectual academic thought piece. Again, there's a misconception that the author's thoughts are thus held to be factual rather than &quot;Hmm, that's an interesting and coherent argument you made&quot;. Understanding these different kinds of academic works, and their limitations, is outside of my education. I don't know who might know better. But I think it might be useful if wiki had some kind of guideline on the different sorts of academic works, and what peer review means for each of them, to help people know what is &quot;appropriate&quot;. -- Colin°Talk 07:22, 16 September 2024 (UTC)

Another area where this sort of question comes up is around Lucy Letby, the nurse who was twice found guilty of murder/attempted murder. There has been considerable media discussion about the safety of those convictions, often revolving around expert issues of medicine and statistics. How do we ensure good sourcing? There's an ongoing discussion at  and input would be welcome. I feel parts of the article spend too much time on discussing individual commentaries by experts that are getting close to , for example. Bondegezou (talk) 11:27, 8 September 2024 (UTC)

Well I'm not going there, but I'd have thought Wikipedia should stick to a summary: i.e. that's she's been convicted but doubts have been raised about the safety of that conviction, without going into the weeds about breathing tubes, statistical analysis and so on. Bon courage (talk) 12:27, 8 September 2024 (UTC)
I'd agree with that. That is certainly not the current approach being taken! It is 100% in the weeds, lots of &quot;this expert said this&quot;, a huge Lucy_Letby#Doubts_about_the_convictions section. 7667 word article with 28% on the Doubts section. Bondegezou (talk) 13:20, 8 September 2024 (UTC)
I'm supposing that is one of those articles where  goes out the window while the media is pumping out volumes of stuff. Bon courage (talk) 13:30, 8 September 2024 (UTC)
NOTNEWS is opposed to Wikipedia creating original news reports.  It's got nothing against citing the news or keeping articles up to date.  I think this is more of a  situation:  Just because you can find a source that quotes someone who says ____ is/isn't evidence of guilt/innocence doesn't mean that an encyclopedia article needs to include it.  We need more bottom-line summaries (&quot;She was convicted, though some experts have doubts&quot;) and less blow-by-blow detail (&quot;Well, Dr. Expert says that discoloration alone isn't proof of air embolism, but Dr. Authority said that discoloration wasn't considered alone&quot;). WhatamIdoing (talk) 07:33, 9 September 2024 (UTC)
I'm thinking of 's &quot;not all verifiable events are suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia&quot;, but sure this overlaps with a long of other NOTs. Bon courage (talk) 07:36, 9 September 2024 (UTC)
If either of you, or anyone else, would like to input those, or other, thoughts at , that would be appreciated. Bondegezou (talk) 12:34, 9 September 2024 (UTC)
Per Bon courage, yes it has got something against citing the news or keeping the articles up to date. It has multiple statements to the effect of &quot;Wikipedia doesn't want everything you read about in the news&quot; in it. But as Bon courage notes, editor enthusiasm is hard to contain while it is an ongoing story. And for an encyclopaedic POV, it is awful because the deluge of stories is based around editorial policy/position rather than what the current best sources say. We are at the mercy of whether some newspaper editor wants to run with the Evil Nurse angle or the Miscarriage of Justice / Cover Up angle. Which angle sells more papers or suits our political agenda? -- 14:03, 10 September 2024 (UTC) Colin°Talk 14:03, 10 September 2024 (UTC)

Improving the &quot;referencing a guideline&quot; illustration


Check the quality range illustration used in the  section.

 posted this in 2016. I do not think it has been discussed anywhere. 

I question that it puts &quot;Health technology assessments&quot; as the highest quality guideline. I live in the United States and am unfamiliar with this concept. I know this concept is not used much in Wikipedia. At  I asked for an example of one of these assessments.

I propose deprecating or updating this image. If we were to re-make it or present this guide in any other form, I support keeping everything else in place and just removing HTA.

I might also switch &quot;national guidelines&quot; with &quot;professional societies&quot;, because in the past 10 years or so, multiple major governments have recommended health policies which conflict with medical professional society recommendations. My feeling is that when this happens, Wikipedia editors have prioritized expert physician statements over political statements when they differ. Examples of areas where politicians and medical professional societies take differing positions include on health issues for infectious disease like COVID, labor rights and occupational health and safety, LGBT+ health issues, health effects related to climate change, and access to healthcare in poverty conditions when patients cannot pay for recommended care.

It is fairly common for guidelines like these to be established without completely connecting to the  standard of evidence, which is a meta analysis published in a peer reviewed journal. Often guidelines either interpret a study beyond what the paper about a study actually says, or they may not clearly even connect to research at all. They are still consensus statements from groups of experts at authoritative institutions, and pass , but they are not what usually comes into Wikipedia.

This image is Wikipedia's editorial policy and not much discussed. When something is proposed without evidence or discussion, then we can update and change it just as casually, and I think that is the situation we have here. 

I was just having a conversation with  about this at  regarding PCORI statements. I am not proposing any ideological changes to what is already established here, but we do need updates sometimes.  Bluerasberry (talk) 20:19, 11 January 2025 (UTC)

 In the United States, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) manages a [https://www.ahrq.gov/research/findings/ta/index.html Technology Assessment Program], which produces Health technology assessments. Although AHRQ has produced relatively few assessments, and many of these are now outdated, the available assessments look very thorough and reliable. I don't see any problem with mentioning these assessments in the guideline and using them as sources if relevant and up-to-date.  Boghog (talk) 21:23, 11 January 2025 (UTC)
 Thanks, I know AHRQ. If I am reading that page correctly, they have done one assessment since 2020, and it is about one particular treatment for sleep apnea. They have a list of reports between 1990-2020, and by line count there are 160 of those reports. These may be good reports but given that there are so few of these, I question whether we should recommend these as the best kind of report from a medical or scientific organization, which is what that image is doing. 
This section MEDORG is supposed to be about when we accept medical info from outside the usual scholarly review articles. Right now it is framed for what kinds of organizations make claims we can accept. Could there be another dimension for what kinds of documents they produce, like guidelines, health technology assessments, and any other claims? Do you have any insight into what other categories of high-quality, non-scholarly-journal, expert publications exist besides these two?  Bluerasberry (talk) 22:15, 11 January 2025 (UTC)

 Boghog (talk) 10:45, 12 January 2025 (UTC)

 Wow, thanks! I will think of a way to add some of this to health technology assessments.
Let me take some time to think about all this. I am still skeptical. I clicked on a few of these, and in the ones I checked, I still see the same thing - major national organizations typically publish fewer than 1 of these per year.
One interesting one that I found was [https://www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/2024-07/hta-policy-and-methods-review-hta-pathways-and-processes-clinical-evaluation-methods-and-horizon-scanning_0.pdf an HTA on HTAs], and it even has a CC license, so maybe I can archive that in Commons and share it in the wiki article. Thanks for the great reactin, will get back.  Bluerasberry (talk) 14:28, 12 January 2025 (UTC)
 - I think a few points are relevant to mention here. 
1) A lack of volume of HTAs doesn't really detract from stating that they are generally the most reliable. Inherent to the HTA process is conducting meta-analysis, systematic review, and combining this with ethical and often economic perspectives using a standardized protocol. It is inherently time-consuming, and there will therefore not be as many as other source-types. 
2) The fact that AHRQ in particular publishes so few HTAs is because funding has been successively cut as their findings were not appreciated by certain congressional groups. This has happened under multiple administrations, both because of a personal spat that a congressman had with one of the reports in the 1990s/2000s, and then again in the late 2010s with some health care lobby groups. This says absolutely nothing about the quality.
3) I agree that the diagram is somewhat simplistic, but this should be elaborated upon in text. The fact is that not all HTAs, like any source have the same quality. Something by NICE and something by a regional HTA body will not be the same, just like every review isn't the same. This doesn't detract from how the methodology is generally the best.
There is also the University of York - Centre for Reviews and Dissemination - HTA Database [https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/CRDWeb/], which allows you to search for HTAs. 
CFCF (talk) 16:02, 22 January 2025 (UTC)
That website points users to https://database.inahta.org/   It looks like about a thousand HTAs are listed for each year recently, with 23,000 total listed.  At a glance, they are mostly not on hot-button politicized topics.  For example, searching for transgender finds only one (on phalloplasty), and the MeSH term gender dysphoria finds only three (from UPenn, Sweden, and Spain).[https://database.inahta.org/search?limit=&amp;terms=%22Gender+Dysphoria%22%5Bmh%5D&amp;client=user]  There are 20 on cannabis use.[https://database.inahta.org/search?limit=&amp;terms=%22Cannabis%22%5Bmh%5D&amp;client=user#]  There are only 13 on abortion (nine of which are not in English),[https://database.inahta.org/search?limit=&amp;terms=%22Abortion%2C+Induced%22%5Bmh%5D&amp;client=user] and another 13 on miscarriage.[https://database.inahta.org/search?limit=&amp;terms=%22Abortion%2C+Spontaneous%22%5Bmh%5D&amp;client=user] There are none on assisted suicide and only [https://database.inahta.org/search?limit=&amp;terms=%22Euthanasia%22%5Bmh%5D&amp;client=user one] on euthanasia.
As an example of filtered results, there are 34 about COVID-19 from the US.[https://database.inahta.org/search?limit=&amp;terms=%22COVID-19%22%5Bmh%5D&amp;client=user&amp;filter-language=&amp;filter-country=United%20States]  That's just 15% of the total for that category. WhatamIdoing (talk) 20:07, 22 January 2025 (UTC)
The issues with AHRQ haven't been on topics that are controversial among the general population, rather specific findings which call into question either lucrative treatment practices, or treatments that are near-to-heart for specific congressional delegates due to personal views (such as on back pain). This NY Times article is a decent overview, if not very in-depth [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/opinion/trump-medicine-data-hhs-ahrq.html].
If anything the concept is thoroughly &quot;unsexy&quot; and uninteresting for the general public - which means that cuts can be made without much concern. The issue has been ongoing for quite some time [https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/why-the-threatened-ahrq-is-vital-to-the-hospital-industry/440269/]
 Also, you are right the INAHTA database has replace the York University one (even though the latter still works to some degree). CFCF (talk) 13:06, 23 January 2025 (UTC)
P.S. Also strange that the database only found those three on gender dysphoria, as there are at least two more that I know of by the Swedish SBU: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37069492/ A systematic review of hormone treatment for children with gender dysphoria and recommendations for research] ([https://www.sbu.se/en/publications/sbu-assesses/hormone-treatment-of-children-and-adolescents-with-gender-dysphoria/ Hormone treatment of children and adolescents with gender dysphoria]) &amp; [https://www.sbu.se/sv/publikationer/sbu-bereder/hormonbehandling-vid-konsdysfori--vuxna/ Hormonbehandling vid könsdysfori – vuxna (in Swedish)] 

CFCF (talk) 13:14, 23 January 2025 (UTC)
Those two might not have the keywords that I searched for. 
I think that editors might be happy to use these if they were more aware of how easy it is to find them.  For example, @Oolong would probably appreciate https://database.inahta.org/article/19028 which says that early intervention Applied behavior analysis is probably not cost effective. WhatamIdoing (talk) 19:37, 23 January 2025 (UTC)
P.S. - it seems that MeSH-search doesn't work so well in the database, and that those two were not registered as HTAs because they intentionally left out ethical and economic aspects - so they are just, if you will, high quality systematic reviews. CFCF (talk) 21:58, 23 January 2025 (UTC) 
Before I get too involved in the details here - let me be clear also in this discussion that I have worked with and for SBU, with funding from Wikimedia Sweden as well as being a Wikipedian in Residence. (This was formerly very clear on my userpage, before my hiatus - and nothing I have made attempts to hide. I have now reinstated this disclosure).
Adapting the guideline to be clearer would seem a good idea. In general I think the use of visual aids, including the multitude that I made years ago - remain okay. One can discuss rearranging the order - but as a rule I think it holds. As for the comment by you , that both national and international guideliens have been shown fallible through the pandemic, yes I agree. However, I think any change needs to be very carefully thought through. To some extent content by national expert agencies remains a cornerstone of Wikipedia - and most material is still very high quality. With regard to HTAs, I really don't see these as impacted by any controversy from the past years. In essence the strength of the HTA process lies in the method (e.g. [https://www.sbu.se/en/method2/ SBU method]). As long as we are also using the pyramids for hierarchies of evidence, and clarify in text that all of that is just a general guide - I don't see why we would remove this specific visual aid from MEDRS either.
In general I find HTAs tend to fly under the radar from the general public, because the questions they raise are often very technical, somewhat narrow, and mostly of value for policy-makers and health financing groups.
As a first point of clarity, I would probably suggest highlighting the rise in the past 5+ years, of commercial HTAs (such as legit vendors as far as I can see such as IQVIA and perhaps Clarivate, but also some commercial actors stating that they do HTAs without a clear process). Mostly this seems benign, with the bigger issue being that these can be very hard to access, costing in the range of 5-50.000 USD to read. I don't really think this poses a problem for Wikipedia, but it could potentially in the future if misuse of the HTA-term becomes an issue.
Some good guides for language are from the [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32021R2282 EU Commissions regulation 2021/2282 on HTAs] and the [https://www.who.int/health-topics/health-technology-assessment WHO page on HTAs], which also has several resolutions on HTAs. The language there, including definitions, should be CC-BY or PD. 
CFCF (talk) 21:49, 23 January 2025 (UTC)
P.S. A terminological point - this is the EU definition:

The point to be made here is that technology in this sense is a very broad term which should include pretty much any treatment.CFCF (talk) 21:54, 23 January 2025 (UTC)
CFCF, I've heard several editors express concerns recently that are less about &quot;controversy from the past years&quot; and more about &quot;the NIH and CDC during the next four years&quot;, though for editors specifically working in trans-related topics, the Cass Review seems to have caused a lot of pain and fear last year. WhatamIdoing (talk) 00:06, 24 January 2025 (UTC)
I've changed the indenting for clarity here - and intend to respond. This is an intricate question, and I will get to it. CFCF (talk) 07:17, 24 January 2025 (UTC)
Fundamentally, you raise important questions, and I’ve spent some time thinking about it. Recent developments—specifically the unprecedented gag order on federal agencies—are noteworthy and may signal a need for adressing the issue in the future. However, we should be cautious about reacting too quickly. This particular restriction is significant but also fairly limited in scope, and it is still too early to understand the broader effects of what follows.
If I may elaborate on a few points, especially regarding why I view this as potentially relevant for MEDRS more broadly but less so for HTAs: By definition, these assessments aim to be apolitical and methodologically robust. Their credibility rests on the quality of the systematic review and other established processes involved. Unless there is evidence of compromised methodology, I see no immediate need to reassess their reliability. Of course, if anything changes substantially, we can address it then.
With regard to the Cass Review: Although I am not intimately familiar with it, the very existence of an article dedicated to it suggests two things: (1) it was influential, and (2) it was controversial. Both factors are indicated by how editors found sufficient motivation to produce a detailed entry. At a glance, it seems appropriately discussed at Puberty blockers, where its findings—and the criticisms—are laid out.
This brings me to what I view as the core duty—of Wikipedia: to present the best possible sources in an  unbiased way. The current coverage of the Cass Review appears to meet that standard, detailing both the findings and criticisms. Whether we agree with its findings remains slightly beside the point, and steers close to criticism of  - which I disagree with.
Regarding concerns about political interference in expert agencies like the CDC or NIH: I remain cautiously optimistic about the independence of these institutions, given their long administrative traditions. While budget cuts could certainly constrain the scope of their work (as happened with AHRQ), there is little indication that their existing outputs would be twisted to say something other than what evidence-based methodologies would conclude. A more likely chilling effect, if it does occur, might be the decision not to investigate certain issues in the first place.
On a more general note, not all government outputs are created equal. In the U.S., for instance, there is a distinction between: Politically shaped outputs, such as Congressional Oversight and Investigations reports (often produced by offices staffed by political appointees), and Technocratic or expert-driven outputs, such as reports by the Congressional Research Service or by independent agencies.
A similar setup exists in many other countries. Sweden’s Government Public Inquiries (SOU) come in different flavors: some are penned by political appointees, while others come from state agencies and are less likely to be politically slanted. The UK also has a multi-layered system involving Quangos, agency reports, commissions, etc.
I think covering these distinctions may be helpful, and I'm happy to discuss how we could weight them. CFCF (talk) 16:37, 25 January 2025 (UTC)
Another point, getting back to you  - NIHR and SBU are both partners with PCORI - so there is interest among HTA bodies for patient-centered outcomes through something called EViR (The Ensuring Value in Research Funders’ Collaboration and Development Forum).
I don't think this should change the fact that patient organizations are below the cut-off for MEDRS - rather I wonder whether generic descriptions of patient-centered-outcomes actually constitutes biomedical statements, and whether MEDRS at all needs to apply unless there is a statistical/treatment statement (or similar). Just stating that people find a specific outcome relevant doesn't need MEDRS in my book. I don't see that question being raised in .
With regard to the specific statement about incidence of side-effects there - I do find that the it probably needs a MEDRS source. I am on the wall as to whether PCORI should be authoritative editorial board or patient-interest-group. However, I think we are right to be very sceptical of patient-interest-groups in general when it comes to statistics or treatment. Not least from personal experience in research and government work. The groups are often very well intentioned, but lack statistical and medical knowledge, as well as often being unable to understand priorities and crowding-out effects, and sometimes not even questioning whether their statements make much sense. (For example, I had to stop one patient-interest group from stating in a summary of my paper that 50% of the sample had poor outcomes, because we had binarized the outcome variable to use it in a specific regression model and had set 50% as worse and 50% as better, by definition. They had missed that their statement, which they wanted to relay to a news agency really read &quot;The half of the sample with worse outcomes, made up 50% of the sample.&quot;). Of course there are better and worse organizations, but as a general rule - I think that for MEDRS, the heuristic still holds. CFCF (talk) 19:00, 25 January 2025 (UTC)
Had one more thought - maybe you're right that PCORI is a research group - and this is where the distinction lies. I also got thinking about CRUK, which I think is authoritative whereas some professional bodies are less reliable, such as the U.S. ME/CFS Clinician Coalition. It's not straightforward... that is without even getting into psuedo-professional bodies, that only say they are made up of professionals, but really aren't. And then there are organizations that are professional interest groups in fields they don't work in, such as International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (an admirable cause, but likely not MEDRS).

Another thing that strikes me is that we do not consider Umbrella reviews at all. I am leaning towards redrafting and updating some parts of the guideline - what do you think , ? CFCF (talk) 18:16, 26 January 2025 (UTC)
Have you considered writing a  page?  Or  or something like that? When and how to use or prefer different kinds of reviews (e.g., Umbrella review and Scoping review) might be a useful thing to write down.  And along those lines, perhaps another page for various health-related government reports.  A list of some key names to know might be useful.
About patient outcomes, I have some concerns about our autism content (which, overall, is IMO pretty bad), as it can be difficult for editors, especially editors who happen to hold a particular POV, to differentiate between &quot;patients want this&quot; and &quot;this advocacy group, which promotes a particular POV, published the results of an unvalidated, non-random survey that said their biased and self-selected sample wants this&quot;.

I am quite pressed for time, I think I might consider it on the tacit assumption that it would be linked here. But it really doesn't detract from the need to update parts of this page. CFCF (talk) 23:16, 6 February 2025 (UTC)
Also very important point on advocacy groups. That one bears thinking about. CFCF (talk) 23:46, 6 February 2025 (UTC)
Advocacy groups run the spectrum from nonsense to political activism to purely mainstream conventional medicine.  It is a complex landscape. WhatamIdoing (talk) 04:26, 14 February 2025 (UTC)

NIH


Can the Robert F. Kennedy Jr. NIH and its affiliates be trusted with information? Should NIH 2025+ be deprecated? It's part of Bizarro World now. --Hob Gadling (talk) 11:40, 13 March 2025 (UTC)

Probably all US &quot;science&quot; now since it's biased by the funding criteria in advance. Bon courage (talk) 11:52, 13 March 2025 (UTC)
No organization is infallible, and  is still a core content policy.  So far, the effect of the Trump administration has mainly been to remove information, rather than to put up untrustworthy information.  But if/when that becomes a problem, we can address it at that point in time.
As for funding criteria:  The US funds a disproportionately large share of the world's medical research.[https://www-nature-com.wikipedialibrary.idm.oclc.org/articles/d41586-025-00754-4]  Consequently, changes here could have really significant effects across the world.  However, given how long it takes for a drug to get from bench to bedside, the results might not be seen for another decade. WhatamIdoing (talk) 22:05, 13 March 2025 (UTC)</segment>
