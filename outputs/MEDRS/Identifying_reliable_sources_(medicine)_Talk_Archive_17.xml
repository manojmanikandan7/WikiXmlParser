Problems with Systematic review usage
The current lede mentions Systematic review, the 1st article cite in the lede links to a page which appears to be based on publications from 1996 about Evidence based medicine (scope is patient care), and does not include most of the content given in the lede of SR The second cite of the SR lede points to https://wwwyorkacuk/media/crd/Systematic_Reviewspdf CRD‚Äôs guidance for undertaking reviews in health care, the 3rd cite goes to this publication http://wwwcebmaorg/wp-content/uploads/Pettigrew-Roberts-SR-in-the-Soc-Scpdf Systematic Reviews in the Social Sciences A PRACTICAL GUIDE, which explains, &quot;In the book we use the term ‚Äò‚Äòsystematic review‚Äô‚Äô to cover both those reviews that include a statistical summary of the included studies (a metaanalysis), and those that don‚Äôt While we also use the phrase systematic ‚Äò‚Äòliterature‚Äô‚Äô reviews, not all evidence which may be useful for a review will of course appear in the published ‚Äò‚Äòliterature‚Äô‚Äô Because of this, the term ‚Äò‚Äòresearch synthesis‚Äô‚Äô (or ‚Äò‚Äòevidence synthesis‚Äô‚Äô) is becoming increasingly common We have used the term ‚Äò‚Äòsystematic review‚Äô‚Äô in preference, as it is still so widely used, but we do not assume that only ‚Äò‚Äòpublished‚Äô‚Äô literature can be reviewed&quot; Hence the current lede of SR is entirely at odds (see WP:OR) with Identifying reliable sources (medicine) We should rather mention something about meta analysis, and literature reviews from peer-reviewed journals unless the SR article can be fixed User:Prokaryotes|prokaryotes (User talk:Prokaryotes|talk) 22:03, 16 August 2015 (UTC)

Suggest you take it to that articles talk page -- User:CFCF|CFCF User talk:CFCF|üçå (Special:EmailUser/CFCF|email) 22:30, 16 August 2015 (UTC)
 I did, but since this policy here overlaps with SR, and User:SMcCandlish|SMcCandlish suggested above to change the term as well, i brought it here for discussionUser:Prokaryotes|prokaryotes (User talk:Prokaryotes|talk) 22:33, 16 August 2015 (UTC)d
I mean the problem isn't with this page, but at the article The What is a systematic review? page you linked is a good introduction and explains why we are so intent on keeping this wording here -- User:CFCF|CFCF User talk:CFCF|üçå (Special:EmailUser/CFCF|email) 22:46, 16 August 2015 (UTC)
 Ok, i agree the paper is much less confusing User:Prokaryotes|prokaryotes (User talk:Prokaryotes|talk) 23:23, 16 August 2015 (UTC)

 The new wording &quot;Primary sources should almost never be used for medical content&quot;  

With https://enwikipediaorg/w/indexphp?title=Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources_%28medicine%29&amp;diff=670330129&amp;oldid=669100773 this edit, User:Alexbrn|Alexbrn changed &quot;Primary sources should generally not be used for medical content&quot; to &quot;Primary sources should almost never be used for medical content&quot; Given the various discussions on this talk page about there being cases where primary sources are allowed, whether it's because of what WP:MEDDATE states about there being areas where &quot;little progress is being made or few reviews are being published&quot; or because an editor chooses to provide a primary source in conjunction with the secondary source, I felt that we should perhaps discuss if this wording is what we definitely want to go with in the lead of WP:MEDRS For an example of a medical topic significantly lacking review articles, see clitoromegaly   User:Flyer22|Flyer22 (User talk:Flyer22|talk) 14:59, 8 July 2015 (UTC)
I'm as big a stickler for using reviews as the next person, but recognize that there are times when primary sources are not only appropriate, but the only sources to use I'm not sure this change is an improvement User:Yobol|Yobol (User talk:Yobol|talk) 13:05, 9 July 2015 (UTC)
Agree this new wording is not an improvement for the reasons previously given User:Ward20|Ward20 (User talk:Ward20|talk) 17:56, 9 July 2015 (UTC)
My position is &quot;Primary sources should almost never be used for medical content before discussion and consensus on the talk page&quot; User:Doc James|Doc James (User talk:Doc James|talk ¬∑ Special:Contributions/Doc James|contribs ¬∑ Special:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 18:19, 9 July 2015 (UTC)
I agree with this wording too If a topic does not have secondary sources, we generally don't consider it WP:NOTABLE to include an article on it in the first place &quot;Almost never&quot; still does not exclude primary sources, but basically shows that someone is going to need to show a really unique case related to sourcing to use them If someone can somehow demonstrate that a topic has weight for coverage, but we don't have great secondary sources and should instead carefully rely on some primary sources, I don't think it should be hard to demonstrate that I don't see issues with the wording with that in mind User:Kingofaces43|Kingofaces43 (User talk:Kingofaces43|talk) 00:47, 10 July 2015 (UTC)

 I am good with the new language or Doc James' version I like the economy of the new language  Doc James' longer version could go in the body but I would change the new language to &quot;content about health&quot; instead of &quot;medical content&quot; User:Jytdog|Jytdog (User talk:Jytdog|talk) 00:52, 10 July 2015 (UTC)
Thinking about it more, I think looking at the body and lede this way may be the way to go Alexbrn's original addition above (adding in content about health instead) makes for a good stern piece in the lede Further along in the body, Doc James' addition could  go in the Respect secondary sources section a bit later to show that a primary source is a huge exception to the rule and requires some work to use if that does happen User:Kingofaces43|Kingofaces43 (User talk:Kingofaces43|talk) 00:59, 10 July 2015 (UTC)
Agree with the above suggestions User:Doc James|Doc James (User talk:Doc James|talk ¬∑ Special:Contributions/Doc James|contribs ¬∑ Special:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 03:09, 10 July 2015 (UTC)

Doc James's wording makes it seem like we should discuss using a primary source before adding it; as made clear above, first by me and then by Yobol, that should not always be the case Then again, I think what Doc James means is that we should almost always discuss using a primary source before adding it; I agree with what he means on that As for adding his wording lower on the page, https://enwikipediaorg/w/indexphp?title=Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources_%28medicine%29&amp;diff=670777052&amp;oldid=670520033#Definitions the &quot;Definitions&quot; section is already clear that use of primary sources for health content should be a rare case; it uses the word rare twice And the &quot;Respect secondary sources&quot; section is also very clear about not using primary sources, except occasionally How much more do we need to stress this? Either way, because of past discussions at this talk page about the use of primary sources for health content, I still feel that Alexbrn's wording is too strong For example, I've been clear that I sometimes like to provide the primary source in conjunction with the secondary source (which the &quot;A primary source may be presented adjunctively to a secondary source&quot; wording of the &quot;Respect secondary sources&quot; section currently allows); there is no problem with that since the secondary source is there for viewing The bolded &quot;generally&quot; wording in the lead was strict enough with regard to discouraging primary sources That was us enforcing the &quot;be wary of primary sources&quot; aspect of the guideline We keep tightening the &quot;primary source&quot; aspect, and it happens each time a WP:Med editor finds misuse and/or excessive use of primary sources Alexbrn's edit summary seems like recent misuse and/or excessive use of primary sources inspired him to add &quot;almost never&quot; But the misuse is not going to stop, no matter what wording we use We have no proof that the bolded &quot;generally&quot; wording was working; furthermore, it had not been there for long, and already we've moved on to &quot;almost never&quot; The next step after &quot;almost never&quot; is &quot;never&quot;; and, well, &quot;never&quot; shouldn't be the case All that stated, I agree with Jytdog that we should change &quot;medical content&quot; to &quot;health content&quot; 

And, Kingofaces43, what do you mean by &quot;adding in content about health instead&quot;? Alexbrn simply changed a small piece of the text; &quot;medical content&quot; is in the previous and current wording User:Flyer22|Flyer22 (User talk:Flyer22|talk) 04:19, 10 July 2015 (UTC)
My comment was about using &quot;health content&quot; instead of &quot;medical content&quot; as Jytdog pointed out User:Kingofaces43|Kingofaces43 (User talk:Kingofaces43|talk) 04:26, 10 July 2015 (UTC)

I was confused by your wording because the &quot;adding in content about health instead&quot; part seemed liked you attributed it to Alexbrn User:Flyer22|Flyer22 (User talk:Flyer22|talk) 04:33, 10 July 2015 (UTC)

Also, Kingofaces43, regarding your statement of &quot;If a topic does not have secondary sources, we generally don't consider it WP:NOTABLE to include an article on it in the first place&quot;, I don't think that the others were simply referring to no secondary sources When I mentioned clitoromegaly above, I mentioned that it is significantly lacking review articles It https://wwwgooglecom/search?q=Clitoromegaly+&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1 is reported in secondary sources, but review articles are obviously a different matter So when citing studies for that topic, we will be citing primary sourcesor secondary sources noting the primary studies And some other medical topics on Wikipedia are similar But you are correct that &quot;If someone can somehow demonstrate that a topic has weight for coverage, but we don't have great secondary sources and should instead carefully rely on some primary sources, I don't think it should be hard to demonstrate that&quot; User:Flyer22|Flyer22 (User talk:Flyer22|talk) 04:48, 11 July 2015 (UTC)
Often the first thing to come out is primary sources by those closely related to the topic at hand They are thus often promotional and IMO we would do well to, much of the time, wait for decent independent secondary sources Think of the topic CCSVI for example User:Doc James|Doc James (User talk:Doc James|talk ¬∑ Special:Contributions/Doc James|contribs ¬∑ Special:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 04:55, 11 July 2015 (UTC)

I don't dispute that User:Flyer22|Flyer22 (User talk:Flyer22|talk) 05:09, 11 July 2015 (UTC)

The problem with this wording is that it creates confusion for editors who happen to be working on topics that are new and emerging fields In these cases, primary sources might be the only sources available In developed aspect of a field where there are plenty of secondary sources, yes, primary sources shouldn't ever be used But not in other cases I'm concerned some of our editors whom can't see in shades of grey might use wording like this to edit war primary sources that are necessary unless we temper it a bit User:LesVegas|LesVegas (User talk:LesVegas|talk) 00:42, 13 July 2015 (UTC)

That is my concern, and the &quot;areas where little progress is being made or few reviews are being published&quot; and &quot;new and emerging fields&quot; aspects are why I started this discussion; we need editors to know that primary sources are not banned (WP:MEDRS is a guideline, not a policy anyway), and that there are legitimate exceptions to excluding them for biomedical content Some editors who were and/or still are less well-versed in WP:MEDRS didn't even know that History sections, and Society and culture sections, are usually exempt from strict WP:MEDRS-compliant sourcing WP:MEDDATE states as much of History sections User:Flyer22|Flyer22 (User talk:Flyer22|talk) 01:01, 13 July 2015 (UTC)

 I agree, that's quite a take-off from the rest of RS policy &quot;Should almost never&quot; is not very helpful expression, but more confusing instead If we want to add such definition, then we should also cover when the primary sources may be used So far, &quot;generally&quot; leaves room for personal discretion, and we already have policies saying that &quot;reliable secondary sources&quot; should be preferred when available For example, we might have a topic that has already established notability, but where some new findings emerge As we know, it takes time before secondary sources are actually available, so primary sources may be considered, being careful not to break WP:UNDUE of course Maybe a more common example would be that: we have a secondary source &quot;A&quot; making statement &quot;B&quot; The statement &quot;B&quot; is a bit ambiguous, so we may look up to the actual primary source that &quot;A&quot; is quoting to get a better picture, Cheers! User:Jayaguru-Shishya|Jayaguru-Shishya (User talk:Jayaguru-Shishya|talk) 19:25, 13 July 2015 (UTC)
That is not how you write policy/guidance in WP or anywhere  The idea is not micromanaging but setting broad and clear principles With the language we are discussing, it is clear that someone would have to justify using a primary source; the justification would be discussed at the article talk page and DR from there User:Jytdog|Jytdog (User talk:Jytdog|talk) 19:32, 13 July 2015 (UTC)

Reboot
It strikes me that much of the aversion to the &quot;should almost never&quot; wording is likely grounded in its prescriptive tone A more descriptive approach could be simply &quot;Primary sources are rarely useful for medical content&quot; Comments? User:LeadSongDog|LeadSongDog User talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl! 20:00, 20 July 2015 (UTC)
I see no issues there User:Kingofaces43|Kingofaces43 (User talk:Kingofaces43|talk) 21:09, 20 July 2015 (UTC)
In the hands of an expert editor, primary sources can be extraordinarily useful  We discourage them because they result in WP:DUE violations as a result of cherry-picking by POV pushers, not because they are intrinsically non-useful for medical content 
I think that we need to write a WP:MEDDUE section or page, and to tie our preference for secondary sources to that  User:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (User talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 08:19, 21 July 2015 (UTC)

I just noticed that https://enwikipediaorg/w/indexphp?title=Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources_%28medicine%29&amp;diff=672297123&amp;oldid=672052915 you reverted back to &quot;generally&quot; As for LeadSongDog's wording, I wouldn't mind &quot;rarely&quot;; I mentioned above that &quot;rare&quot; is stressed lower (past the lead) in the guideline As for WhatamIdoing's suggestion to write a WP:MEDDUE section, I trust that she could type up a decent or good section to address these issues User:Flyer22|Flyer22 (User talk:Flyer22|talk) 03:04, 25 July 2015 (UTC)

As an addendum I've just said to an editor that per MEDRS, primary sources are &quot;not reliable for health content&quot; They then apparently consulted MEDRS and responded thusly:https://enwikipediaorg/w/indexphp?title=Talk:Mate_%28beverage%29&amp;curid=6852331&amp;diff=674798044&amp;oldid=674797658

I see this again and again Whatever we think we're saying, the repeated message that readers seem to take away from this guideline is still that primary sources for health content are okay User:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (User talk:Alexbrn|talk) 06:13, 6 August 2015 (UTC)

Whether in a medical context or not, simply saying that primary sources are not/rarely/generally not/ useful isn't the point The point is  for which the primary sources are used Thus primary medical sources should not be used to establish the efficacy of a treatment ‚Äì no qualification needed But once the efficacy has been established, if the article sets out details of the treatment, primary sources may be the most reliable for these details (eg the chemistry and pharmacology of any drugs involved)
This is a classic example of the danger of trying to reduce an issue which ultimately depends on human judgement (ie determining the purpose for which a source is used) to a rigid set of rules It's bound to fail Provide guidance, examples, explanations, but don't try to provide infallible rules User:Peter coxhead|Peter coxhead (User talk:Peter coxhead|talk) 06:59, 6 August 2015 (UTC)
Broadly speaking, if new readers of MEDRS came away with the understanding you articulated, that would be great, particularly &quot;primary medical sources should not be used to establish the efficacy of a treatment&quot; (I would say &quot;establish or imply&quot; rather than just &quot;establish&quot;) But IME they often don't User:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (User talk:Alexbrn|talk) 07:09, 6 August 2015 (UTC)
 (Adding &quot;imply&quot; is clearly right) IME too they often don't But the solution isn't to keep writing more and more prescriptive statements, which just alienate experienced editors and confuse inexperienced ones User:Peter coxhead|Peter coxhead (User talk:Peter coxhead|talk) 08:02, 6 August 2015 (UTC)
I don't believe that User:Alexbrn|you (or anyone else) ought to say that primary sources are not reliable for health content  Some of them are:  if you see a press release from a politician that says he's been diagnosed with a medical condition, then that is a self-published primary source about health content  It is also reliable for a statement that Politician Paul said that he had been diagnosed with ____  This guideline is about WP:Biomedical information, which is not the same thing as health content 
I think that Peter's example is a good one  I'll add, though, that &quot;efficacy of a treatment&quot; is maybe as much as 10% of the information that a good encyclopedic article should cover  We may need to re-write MEDRS to better explain what to do about the content 
Also:  &quot;ideal sources&quot; (what MEDRS encourages) and &quot;reliable sources&quot; (the rock-bottom minimum that is required) are not synonyms  A primary source is reliable for quite a lot of material, even if it's ideal for relatively little  User:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (User talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 03:08, 22 August 2015 (UTC)
Yes, 'health content' is too broad a term in general I certainly didn't intend to outlaw the type of case you mention, the context in which I used the term was a dispute about whether Mate tea was a potentially effective treatment for certain conditions Note that para 3 of MEDRS currently scopes it as follows: &quot;This guideline supports the general sourcing policy at Wikipedia:Verifiability with specific attention given to sources appropriate for the medical and health-related content in any type of article, including alternative medicine&quot; - which further demonstrates that MEDRS is a bit of a mess User:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (User talk:Alexbrn|talk) 08:19, 22 August 2015 (UTC)
Thanks for the nudge  I've cleaned that up  User:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (User talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 15:48, 22 August 2015 (UTC)

 Do we allow sources that reference unpublished studies? 

Do we allow reviews as sources for claims, in which some or most of the studies referenced in the review are unpublished and unavailable to the public? An example might be an FDA review which refers to many unpublished studies provided by the drug company, but not accessible to the public User:SageRad|SageRad (User talk:SageRad|talk) 16:36, 30 August 2015 (UTC)
Conveniently, the sentence I reference above is applicable here, &quot;Do not reject a high-quality type of study due to personal objections to the study's inclusion criteria, references, funding sources, or conclusions&quot; (emphasis mine) Yes, sources that reference unpublished data can be used High quality sources such as the FDA should not be dismissed because editors themselves do not have access to the same data as the source User:Yobol|Yobol (User talk:Yobol|talk) 16:42, 30 August 2015 (UTC)
Hmm Thanks I find that disturbing, personally, as it flies against all notions of transparency and peer-review which are supposed to be the basis of resiliency and error-correction in science User:SageRad|SageRad (User talk:SageRad|talk) 18:29, 30 August 2015 (UTC)
{e/c} On the contrary, published data often have significant biases (see publication bias), so the addition of unpublished data to a secondary source such as a meta-analysis is often more neutral and accurate than only using published data Either way, the use of unpublished data has no real relevance to the reliability of a source, per WP:MEDRS User:Yobol|Yobol (User talk:Yobol|talk) 18:37, 30 August 2015 (UTC)
I question whether the FDA is a &quot;medical&quot; organization as per WP:MEDORG User:SageRad|SageRad (User talk:SageRad|talk) 18:32, 30 August 2015 (UTC)
Of course it is, just as much as the CDC or any major governmental medical/scientific body Those who dispute the conclusions of the FDA/WHO/CDC often dispute whether the FDA/WHO/CDC are reliable, but that says more about the biases of the individual editor and their dispute with the conclusion of the major medical body than it does about the reliability of the medical body themselves User:Yobol|Yobol (User talk:Yobol|talk) 18:37, 30 August 2015 (UTC)
There was an authenticated letter sent by a group of FDA employees in 2010 that read in part:
 many other FDA managers who have failed to protect the American public, who have violated laws, rules, and regulations, who have suppressed or altered scientific or technological findings and conclusions, who have abused their power and authority, and who have engaged in illegal retaliation against those who speak out, have not been held accountable and remain in place (http://wwwcbsnewscom/news/fda-corruption-letter-authenticated-lawyers-start-your-engines/ CBS News)
I have a problem with trusting governmental agencies, especially when they have a history of corruption and are using information that is not available to the public to pass judgments http://onlinelibrarywileycom/doi/101111/jlme12068/abstract This article in JLME also speaks to the regulatory capture of the FDA I am concerned about trusting a source that other reliable sources say is not reliable I'd say it should not be viewed as flawless or without reproach, and we should not place blind trust in the FDA especially when their primary sources are unpublished and therefore not peer-reviewable User:SageRad|SageRad (User talk:SageRad|talk) 20:07, 30 August 2015 (UTC)
Wikipedia is not a place to WP:RIGHTGREATWRONGS  The FDA is very much part of the scientific establishment that is the mainstream of scientific/medical thought in the world User:Jytdog|Jytdog (User talk:Jytdog|talk) 20:10, 30 August 2015 (UTC)
(e/c) There are no publisher of sources that are &quot;flawless&quot; or &quot;without reproach&quot;, and you can find examples of almost all high quality sources having some sort of black mark(s) in their record In general, the FDA is a reliable source for medical information especially as related to their field of expertise (food and drug regulation)  We are probably going past what the role of this talk page is for now, so unless there is a particular change you would like to suggest here, it's probably best to leave specific discussions of specific sources to the talk page of the article in question or at WP:RSN User:Yobol|Yobol (User talk:Yobol|talk) 20:13, 30 August 2015 (UTC)
 I'd like to be able to discuss general matters of this sort without being shut down Please stop the shutting down of conversations And i am not &quot;righting great wrongs&quot; Let us be able to speak about generalizations, with others, and let it stand for a while Let's allow people to speak here I'm completely serious in querying the reliability of the FDA and similar sources that use unpublished data to reach conclusions that are then represented as truth I understand that no source is &quot;perfect&quot;, but there is a built-in mechanism that enables peer review for most sources that we would accept as reliable In other words, most reliable sources are not typically relying on inaccessible data for their reportage User:SageRad|SageRad (User talk:SageRad|talk) 20:16, 30 August 2015 (UTC)
Countercultural conspiracy theories don't travel too far in discussions about policies guidelines WP is mainstream and conservative when it comes to sourcing and institutions that produce them  By &quot;conservative&quot; i don't mean right wing, I mean trusting the institutions that produce and disseminate scientific knowledge  User:Jytdog|Jytdog (User talk:Jytdog|talk) 20:23, 30 August 2015 (UTC)
(e/c) I get that you believe you are right, and I'm just expressing my own view that attempts to get the FDA disallowed as a reliable source of Wikipedia would be an incredible waste of time, as the vast majority of medical sources and medical expertise recognizes the FDA as a highly reliable source Best of luck trying to get a consensus around the dubious proposition that it can't be used as a source here User:Yobol|Yobol (User talk:Yobol|talk) 20:29, 30 August 2015 (UTC)
I posed a question, a topic for discussion, on the topic that this page is about If you have a problem with that, then don't take part in the conversation Please don't use such a tone as &quot;i get that you believe you are right&quot; what does that even mean? And i am not attempting to get the FDA disallowed as a source I am questioning the mechanics of some sources that are accepted as secondary sources, when they are not peer-reviewable, rely on secret documents, and have a documented history of corruption User:SageRad|SageRad (User talk:SageRad|talk) 20:42, 30 August 2015 (UTC)
Please show me any human institution that is free of corruption  Just one  Instances of corruption =/= rotton to the core, and you seem to be proposing the latter, which is just conspiracy theorizing  In general WP trusts the knowledge-producing institutions of our society  User:Jytdog|Jytdog (User talk:Jytdog|talk) 20:48, 30 August 2015 (UTC)

Of course, you're correct that no institution is inherently free of corruption, but that's a red herring because the point i was making was that there is a difference when a source uses inaccessible primary sources to reach a conclusion, and when that source has a documented history of corruption It's not a good combination We do need to think critically about credibility of sources, and i would hope there are no sacred cows This is the place where we talk about general principles about how we decide what sources to trust We cannot trust all &quot;knowledge producing institutions&quot; equally because they do not merit equal trust That is why we have guidelines about what is a reliable source and what is not, and why  User:SageRad|SageRad (User talk:SageRad|talk) 20:53, 30 August 2015 (UTC)
This talk page is for the concrete discussion of improvements to this page, not for a general philosophical discussion What is your concrete suggestion to improve this guideline?  You've spent a lot of time trying to belittle the FDA but then say you don't want it disallowed as a source  What exactly is your concrete proposal to improve this guideline? User:Yobol|Yobol (User talk:Yobol|talk) 21:02, 30 August 2015 (UTC)
Where does it say that? Who made that rule that this talk page is only for concrete proposals and not discussions of principle? Seriously, i've seen several very interesting discussions get shut down in the last couple of weeks here, and i don't like that Sometimes we need to have a general discussion to arrive at concrete discussions
My concrete suggestion if i were to propose one, is to state that secondary sources that are peer-reviewable are preferable to sources that rely heavily on unpublished data User:SageRad|SageRad (User talk:SageRad|talk) 21:07, 30 August 2015 (UTC)
You might try reading the very first sentence at the top of this page, which states, &quot;This is the talk page for discussing improvements to the Identifying reliable sources (medicine) page&quot;  Discussion should be centered around improving the page, not just a general philosophical discussion about sources (that belongs on user talk page, talk pages of specific articles for discussion of specific sources in context, or on RSN)  As to your proposal to deprecate sources that use unpublished data, I will oppose strongly based on my first comment above, which is that the published data is often biased, so better sources can be the one using unpublished data  I should also note that I find your determination that papers that use unpublished data are by definition not &quot;peer-reviewable&quot; as bizarre, but I think I've wasted enough of my time on this thread already, and will take my leave User:Yobol|Yobol (User talk:Yobol|talk) 21:14, 30 August 2015 (UTC)
Nobody is requiring you to take part in this discussion I'm interested to hear what others think as well I do believe that this question is a discussion on possible improvements to the guideline I don't see how a paper that cites unpublished data is reviewable by anyone who doesn't have access to the underlying data I'm puzzled by that User:SageRad|SageRad (User talk:SageRad|talk) 21:26, 30 August 2015 (UTC)
I would say that you have it exactly backwards  Reviews should absolutely take into account unpublished studies  If they do not then due to publishing bias they have a real chance of overestimating any effect  Also I see earlier you are referring to unpublished studies as &quot;secret documents&quot;  There is a world of difference between difficult to access because no one wanted to publish it and a secret document  Special:Contributions/2601:645:C201:3840:88CF:A3D4:4EFF:F687|2601:645:C201:3840:88CF:A3D4:4EFF:F687 (User talk:2601:645:C201:3840:88CF:A3D4:4EFF:F687|talk) 03:45, 31 August 2015 (UTC)

Yes  We expect the authors of reliable sources to determine which sources they use, many of which would fail rs for Wikipedia articles  For example in writing about a figure in the news, they may rely on what that person, his or her friends, enemies and acquaintances have said about them, high school year book stories, etc  It is similar to what a court does  They rely on the evidence of people whose testimony does not meet rs and determine the facts  User:The Four Deuces|TFD (User talk:The Four Deuces|talk) 01:26, 4 September 2015 (UTC)

 Industry Funded Studies 

Do we allow industry funded studies on Wikipedia articles? There has been a http://wwwncbinlmnihgov/pubmed/17214504 documented problem of funding bias with industry funded studies, so I was curious if MEDRS restricted such sources of information in some way User:LesVegas|LesVegas (User talk:LesVegas|talk) 02:10, 30 August 2015 (UTC)
In general, we do not disallow sources based on funding: &quot;Do not reject a high-quality type of study due to personal objections to the study's inclusion criteria, references, funding sources, or conclusions&quot; (emphasis mine)  There are all sorts of biases that can affect a study, we should be careful how we assess the sources so as to not disallow otherwise good studies based on issues that may have no relevance User:Yobol|Yobol (User talk:Yobol|talk) 16:31, 30 August 2015 (UTC)
We do also state Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources_(medicine)#Use_independent_sources But we should be using reviews independent of the primary source anyway User:Doc James|Doc James (User talk:Doc James|talk ¬∑ Special:Contributions/Doc James|contribs ¬∑ Special:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 21:20, 30 August 2015 (UTC)
Thanks for your reply, User:Yobol|Yobol If industry funded studies have shown to have bias (much more positive outcomes compared to neutrally conducted research), why should we allow it on our articles? Shouldn't we change what MEDRS says? I mean, why did we add that tidbit into MEDRS in the first place allowing any research despite possible shady funding sources which might skew its results, and why shouldn't we change MEDRS now to disallow such sources? Isn't it a real problem if a pharmaceutical company funds research showing excellent results for their product if neutral research shows mediocre ones? User:LesVegas|LesVegas (User talk:LesVegas|talk) 02:41, 31 August 2015 (UTC)
I think there are two issues here: 1) Doc James' point is well taken, most of the funded studies you are discussing are primary studies, which we should be avoiding anyways in favor of independent secondary sources such as reviews; avoiding primary sources in favor of secondary will help us avoid those funded sources already 2) the fact that something is funded does not mean it is automatically &quot;shady&quot; or suspect  There are plenty of good quality industry funded studies as well  We don't want to throw out the baby with the bathwater  User:Yobol|Yobol (User talk:Yobol|talk) 02:56, 31 August 2015 (UTC)
We just want to use the best available sources And yes often these are reviews of industry funded trials User:Doc James|Doc James (User talk:Doc James|talk ¬∑ Special:Contributions/Doc James|contribs ¬∑ Special:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 03:05, 31 August 2015 (UTC)
Yes, industry funded studies do eventually make up reviews and meta-analyses, so if there is a problem with industry funded sources, there's a problem with reviews that use them But I guess it is being argued that even though there is a well-documented history with industry funded research being unreliable with far too many results toward the positive side, it's too problematic for us as editors to determine what's reliable and what's not based on funding sources Some of it could be good and we'd throw out the baby with the bathwater as User:Yobol|Yobol said, so we really shouldn't be questioning it, just ensuring it comes from a source that meets all of our other requirements But is that really all we're supposed to do as editors? Really?  User:LesVegas|LesVegas (User talk:LesVegas|talk) 22:20, 31 August 2015 (UTC)

Should we toss out reviews if they review industry funded studies but don't seem to acknowledge the possibility of funding bias? I mean, if the reviewer just treats the industry funded studies like they're the highest quality in existence and seems oblivious to a well-documented problem in the field, there's no way that can be reliable, right? And the reviewers too would be suspect, right?  User:LesVegas|LesVegas (User talk:LesVegas|talk) 23:31, 31 August 2015 (UTC)
No Aside from that being WP:OR on our part, if a study has a problem (industry funded or not), that will be mentioned in the review of the methodology or specific claims made in the conclusions If there is an issue with funding or lab-specific related, the reviewers will say, &quot;Studies from lab Y, funding sources Z, etc all had inadequate methodology for assessing X&quot; This happens every now and then when labs are found doing shoddy work There are lot of times industry funded trials as designed and analyzed entirely properly, and reviews in that case wouldn't mention any issues from the get go The sometimes subtle difference that people miss is industry-designed studies Those are the studies where there isn't independence in terms of the scientists doing the actual work and interpretation User:Kingofaces43|Kingofaces43 (User talk:Kingofaces43|talk) 23:41, 31 August 2015 (UTC)
In a perfect world, reviewers pick up on problems with funding sources that skew results But since this is an imperfect world, if they miss problems in these studies, why exactly should we not disallow these reviews as sources?

Good quesion LesVegas, though even if funded a study can be useful, and it is not clear which studies are skewed or not But we can report on skewed results with follow up studies, as we do frequently However, there is a problem when studies are funded and then not published, but used for decision makingUser:Prokaryotes|prokaryotes (User talk:Prokaryotes|talk) 00:05, 1 September 2015 (UTC)
Addition to MEDRS for clarity
There have been documented http://wwwncbinlmnihgov/pubmed/17214504 issues with industry funded studies and even though they have shown to be overly positive and could even be unreliable, it is clear that, while possibly unreliable, these are allowed as several editors here have shown MEDRS saying we should not be performing a peer review ourselves And yet, this stance is difficult to reconcile with the stance some editors on Wikipedia have taken regarding studies that come from other countries, which have shown issues similar to possible bias seen in industry funded research As a result, I propose changing MEDRS which currently reads:
Do not reject a high-quality type of study due to personal objections to the study's inclusion criteria, references, funding sources, or conclusions
to:
Do not reject a high-quality type of study due to personal objections to the study's inclusion criteria, references, funding sources, conclusions, or country of origin
Since the country issue has been brought up repeatedly and editors have rejected research because of the country it was published in, I don't see any alternative but to amend MEDRS to what I did above If there are no objections (and I don't see why there would be, based on everyone's arguments for industry funded studies), I will make the change User:LesVegas|LesVegas (User talk:LesVegas|talk) 20:26, 1 September 2015 (UTC)

You misrepresent the discussions that have been held here about Chinese publications about acupuncture  Those are about a specific topic and specific country, and the generalization you want to make here is not helpful  Your persistent efforts to portray this as a bias fall flat when you look at the publications about the general poor quality of acupuncture research publications in China  User:Jytdog|Jytdog (User talk:Jytdog|talk) 12:37, 2 September 2015 (UTC)

I think it may be helpful to remove &quot;funding sources&quot;: there's certainly been some questioning of cigarette/e-cigarette material where the publications are industry-funded, but I do worry that this question - essentially of whether a source is a WP:IS or not - is too tricky to codify in a few words, especially if we're going to get into questions about Chinese/Russian research eg - so would leave the change at that It's also often struck me that the sentiment in the current MEDRS text sits uneasily with WP:FRIND for fringe topics User:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (User talk:Alexbrn|talk) 13:08, 2 September 2015 (UTC)
Arthur, I appreciate your intellectual honesty and your desire for consistency here I can see both sides to allowing industry funded studies on the article On the one hand, correlations have been shown with industry funding bias regarding http://wwwncbinlmnihgov/pubmed/?term=16893480 psychiatric medications http://wwwncbinlmnihgov/pubmed/21494667 failure to warn about cancer risk, and have shown http://wwwncbinlmnihgov/pmc/articles/PMC3374868/ a huge statistical increase in &quot;positive findings&quot; for various pharmaceuticals over those funded by other sources such as non-profits or the government On the other hand, there could be other factors at play, and not all industry funded research isn't tainted so we can't throw the baby out with the bathwater, and so on The same can be said for Chinese or Russian research as well It's never been shown to be as simple as &quot;fraud&quot; or &quot;lies&quot; It could be that acupuncture performed on Chinese people by Chinese doctors in China has a more powerful effect than it does on unbelieving Westerners in the US when it's performed by caucasians It could be that they perform the acupuncture stimulation differently, or use differently sized needles It could also be that they conduct studies differently for ethical reasons, choosing a control group that receives medication instead of sugar pill, and that's why we see different results If things like that are the case, it's much harder to dismiss it as simply unreliable Russian research is also performed quite differently than US/European research as well, confounding the issues I'm sure all around the world these things we see different results for different reasons Ultimately, things just need to be consistent in our guideline here so that editors don't get confused User:LesVegas|LesVegas (User talk:LesVegas|talk) 23:02, 2 September 2015 (UTC)
I added &quot;country of origin&quot; because I doubt editors here would want to remove funding sources in order to remain consistent, and I am also in that camp now I really think there are far too many variables at play with these things and as Yobol said we ultimately can't throw out the baby with the bathwater User:LesVegas|LesVegas (User talk:LesVegas|talk) 00:40, 4 September 2015 (UTC)

On the merits of the proposal:  We shouldn't add this  One of the important differences between &quot;acupuncture in China&quot; and &quot;industry-funded research&quot; is that we have a wealth of other sources about acupuncture, but for some subjects, there are no sources that are entirely independent of &quot;industry funding&quot;  If we banned all sources from China, we could still write a decent article about Acupuncture; however, if we banned all sources that either received &quot;industry funding&quot; (broadly defined) or were based on sources that received industry funding, we could not write any articles about experimental drugs or new drugs  For example, the FDA just approved rolapitant, and I have just looked up all of the registered clinical trials  Every single one of them was sponsored by a commercial drug manufacturer  You will not find a source that provides biomedical information about rolapitant, that meets MEDRS's quality standards, and that does not use data produced through &quot;industry funding&quot;  This gap is why the two cases (one subject in one country vs entire industries) are not comparable  User:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (User talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 06:14, 4 September 2015 (UTC)
User:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing, as usual you make an interesting point here Two problems I see: one, that we have no checks or balances on industry funded sources the way MEDRS is currently written We have many independent studies on soft drinks, but research making health claims about soft drinks that's funded by Coca-Cola is still as allowable as anything else There's no cutoff whatsoever Ultimately, we just need some consistency, somehow Two, have Chinese sources ever been proven inferior, biased or less reliable to Western sources on any subject? The critical literature looks pretty much the same with Chinese sources for acupuncture as it does for industry funded sources, although with better explanations for discrepancies in findings, such as different ethical standards the Chinese have, (for instance placebo controls aren't allowed in China because half the study group wouldn't receive treatment) So for those two reasons, there is a huge logical issue preventing consistent application of MEDRS here We just need to fix it in some way I'm open to whatever, but MEDRS needs to be remedied for universal consistency, somehow User:LesVegas|LesVegas (User talk:LesVegas|talk) 12:19, 4 September 2015 (UTC)

This is becoming tendentious  the sources discussing the poor quality of Chinese research on acupuncture (including self-reflective sources by Chinese authors) were Wikipedia_talk:Identifying_reliable_sources_(medicine)/Archive_14#Systemic_bias_1|discussed to death on this board not long ago  I don't want to be mean, but it is time to WP:SHUN this WP:POINTY and incompetent (eg discussion of placebo) effort LesVegas has been claiming systemic bias https://enwikipediaorg/w/indexphp?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=617351739 since his first month here - before he understood any of the policies and guidelines, letter or spirit, and LesVegas still does not understand what we are up to here  User:Jytdog|Jytdog (User talk:Jytdog|talk) 15:18, 4 September 2015 (UTC)

I also see the need for this But I think it's neither pragmatic nor is it possible to create such a list Plus, I think some editors are likely to edit war anything that's not on the official list right off Wikipedia What I think might be more workable is to tighten our guidelines for what journals are acceptable and what journals aren't Can we come up with a better list of guidelines, based on principles of what an unreliable journal versus a reliable one are? The ones we have are a bit too vague, I think User:LesVegas|LesVegas (User talk:LesVegas|talk) 16:45, 30 June 2015 (UTC)
As I suggested on Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Medicine, I agree with Las Vegas that a clearer guideline would be more useful than a list A list of the highest quality journals could be created, but couldn't the contents be summed up nearly as well with a generalized 3 - 5 point criteria for inclusion?User:Dialectric|Dialectric (User talk:Dialectric|talk) 17:24, 30 June 2015 (UTC)

I am concerned that such a list will be misunderstood, as others note above, as a binary yes-no type of list  We'll get editors who insist that since they read claim A in a journal on the list, it must be added to our Wikipedia article; we'll get editors who insist that because claim B isn't from a journal on the list, it must be removed from Wikipedia  Both attitudes will be problematic  We already have a similar difficulty with editors who don't understand ‚Äì or wish to abuse ‚Äì the 'try to use sources from the last 5 years' rule of thumb  This will likely be even more messy
Sometimes bad papers appear in 'good' journals  Reputable, sturdy, solid science involving unsexy topics or with unflashy results ends up in middle-of-the-road or lower-impact journals‚Äîregrettably, often side-by-side with dramatic, sexy results produced by crappy science  (With a high variance, the product of &quot;study importance&quot; and &quot;study quality&quot; is proportional to a journal's impact factor)
Evaluating the quality of a journal article is difficult  Doing it with competence requires, literally, years of experience and training  While I appreciate the impulse to try to help editors understand the standards for sourcing on Wikipedia, there is a limit to what we can do with rules of thumb and examples and suggestions  There isn't a magic six-point checklist that will let someone with little or no experience reading and evaluating scientific literature to learn to do so in five minutes (or five hours, or even five months)  An extraordinary amount in such an evaluation depends on context and contextual knowledge User:TenOfAllTrades|TenOfAllTrades(User_talk:TenOfAllTrades|talk) 19:47, 30 June 2015 (UTC)

A list of high quality journals does not equal these sources are useable Sources are reliable per the content they support and not because they are deemed to be high quality While it might be helpful to have a list of high quality journals that list in no way determines reliability per Wikipedia content (User:Littleolive oil|Littleolive oil (User talk:Littleolive oil|talk) 01:33, 1 July 2015 (UTC))
But if a list of &quot;high-quality journals&quot; is created, even if it is festooned with disclaimers about not being an absolute complete list, then it absolutely will get abused to say that X must be included because it was published in a journal on The List, and Y must be excluded because it was not published in a journal on The List
Also, does anyone¬†else remember a discussion at WPMED a few years back, in which a bunch of mostly pre-med students tried to figure out what &quot;common&quot; or &quot;typical&quot; textbooks were being used for one specialty (gynecology, I think)?

 Mid Quality sources 

I have noticed a trend in the last few threads debates that focus on defining the source in question as either &quot;low-quality&quot; or &quot;high-quality&quot; and not considering whether it might be &quot;mid-quality&quot; I think we all agree that high-quality sources are preferred, and that low-quality sources should be avoided But what about mid-quality sources? What often happens is that supporters of the mid-quality source try to elevate it to high-quality status while opponents try to demote it to low-quality status I think it important to assess sources realistically so perhaps we need some discussion on how to present mid-quality sources Blueboar (talk) 12:33, 6 September 2015 (UTC)

I think the reason we don't speak of mid-quality sources is because there of is such a divide between the low and high quality sources It might seem confusing but what we are saying is basically that we accept high quality and top of the line Cochrane-level sources Mid-quality sources would be primary sources such as RCTs and well-performed single studies‚Äìcheck out the pyramids I added above We don't discuss these so much because Wikipedia doesn't allow them (or at least strongly discourages them) -- CFCF üçå (email) 21:51, 6 September 2015 (UTC)
You know, this is an interesting query well worth exploring I think what we'd first have to do would be define what a mid-level source is Is it peer-reviewed, but not in a highly well-known journal like JAMA? Does impact factor have any bearing on level? Or is it less about the publication and more about the type of study? So are meta-analyses superior to systematic reviews for identical claims? Do higher level sources use established reporting standards for their field? I would think that despite what mid-level sources are, we might still allow them but give them less weight obviously excellent sources What that would probably mean for the article is that we should only use high-level sources in the lede while mid-level sources could be used elsewhere High level sources might ought to be listed first in a paragraph, while mid-level sources would come later All of that would, of course, be dependent on what we agree mid-level sources even are LesVegas (talk) 22:39, 6 September 2015 (UTC)

You also argued in those threads for inclusion of Chinese sources on acupuncture in some way like this  I do understand that both and LesVegas and likely Herbxue are pleased to find an opening in what Blueboar wrote above, for what you already wanted; likewise it is reasonable that Blueboar should be informed of the conversation into which he/she is walking User:Jytdog|Jytdog (User talk:Jytdog|talk) 14:54, 7 September 2015 (UTC)

We should not be judging the quality of something based on whether it is published in a &quot;highly well-known&quot; journal, nor should impact factor have any bearing There are hundreds (thousands?) of reputable journals applying the same level of peer review and oversight We should reject fringe journals etc, but as a scientist I give exactly the same weight to something whether it is published in something like JAMA, Heart or Gut, or if it is in a less well-known, lower impact factor journal like International Journal of Social Research Methodology, Knowledge-Based Systems or Informatics in Primary Care (all IF &lt; 1) User:Bondegezou|Bondegezou (User talk:Bondegezou|talk) 17:04, 14 September 2015 (UTC)
User:Bondegezou|Bondegezou, I believe that some of our editors unfortunately believe that IF &lt; 1 defines &quot;fringe journal&quot;  It can be difficult to identify fringe journals if you're not in the field, so some of them try to take shortcuts like that  User:DGG was meditating on a page at Wikipedia:Impact factors (since redirected by User:LeadSongDog to WP:Scholarly journal) to explain the limitations of that approach 
User:Blueboar, I'm not sure that I can agree with User:CFCF's statement that mid-quality sources are primary sources, or that we are really that close to banning them  One of MEDRS's structural problems is that it was written primarily to handle treatments for major diseases  It applies poorly to the other (90%) article contents for major diseases, and to the 90% of diseases that aren't so &quot;popular&quot;  ;-)  Fixing that is going to require encouraging editors to use their best judgment, instead of imposing one-size-fits-some rules such as &quot;you must only use secondary sources&quot; or &quot;six-year-old sources are bad&quot;  User:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (User talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 04:41, 23 September 2015 (UTC)

Obviously, it depends on the topic In an area where the are first rate journals, it is safe to assume that the second-rate journals publish the less important work Within a popular,  field, for the same type of journal, the IF can be a good guide to this In narrow fields, where relative few people work, the IFs of all the journals will be low, and we simply have to use the best material It can take a certain amount of knowledge of the literature in the area to figure this out  A mechanical approach to reference selection or article writing doe not work well User:DGG| DGG (User talk:DGG| talk ) 04:53, 23 September 2015 (UTC)


 Request for Comment: Country of Origin 
{{Archive top|result= RFC result: Yes   We cannot override WP:V or WP:RS  And per User:AlbinoFerret|AlbinoFerret's succinct comment  

There were strong views and evidence from both sides but no consensus on whether diffs given showed &quot;country of origin&quot; (of a study, journal or author) being presented and used as a valid basis for whether a source met RS  

There was consensus however that &quot;country of origin&quot;, per se, is not a valid reason to reject a source (and no more valid than &quot;funding sources&quot;) hence for the change  

(In some cases editors seem to have misspoken and referred simply to country of origin when they perhaps meant to refer to sourced findings regarding sources affiliated with a country of origin  This change should discourage with that)  

(This addition should NOT be read as a political correctness|PC ban on any mention of country of origin (or funding source, etc) when necessary to refer to studies with hard data (as contrasted to stereotypes) that have identified a systematic problem that is normally identified with an affiliated country of origin, as mentioned by  User:Richard Keatinge|Richard Keatinge  Likewise, this addition should NOT be read as a changing the longstanding policy that sources from publications known to routinely publish and fail to retract material proven unreliable may be excluded)

Should we change MEDRS, which currently reads:

Do not reject a high-quality type of study due to personal objections to the study's inclusion criteria, references, funding sources, or conclusions

to

Do not reject a high-quality type of study due to personal objections to the study's inclusion criteria, references, funding sources, country of origin, or conclusions

Support Wikipedia should never get into the business of discriminating against high quality sources because of where that research might have been conducted or published However, this has happened before, where multiple Cochrane reviews were rejected while trying to replace an old source with them, partly on the basis that &quot;https://enwikipediaorg/w/indexphp?title=Talk%3AAcupuncture&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=667090507&amp;oldid=667089872 all but one of its authors were Chinese,&quot; and therefore, they must be biased This is not an isolated incident either, with some editors https://enwikipediaorg/w/indexphp?title=Talk%3AAcupuncture&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=677538132&amp;oldid=677534853 rejecting all sources published in China not on the basis of case by case analysis of the source's quality, but stating they're published in China and assume they must all be unreliable  Low quality sources that, for instance, are not peer-reviewed, should always be rejected But MEDRS does not yet make it clear whether or not high-quality foreign sources should ever be rejected on the basis of country of origin, whether it be the authors of a publication or place where high quality research is published And interestingly, MEDRS currently allows for industry funded research not to be rejected on the basis that it's industry-funded, while it says nothing about a particular country's research And yet, despite whatever potential problems could exist, it is very clear that industry funded research can be very problematic to add into Wikipedia Just recently, http://wwwwashingtonpostcom/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/08/10/coca-cola-is-funding-obesity-research-with-a-biased-message-nutrition-experts-say Coca Cola came under fire for funding scientific research showing that Coca Cola doesn‚Äôt cause obesity And bad as that may be, MEDRS currently doesn‚Äôt allow us to prohibit such research It states:

'Do not reject a high-quality type of study due to personal objections to the study's inclusion criteria, references, funding sources, or conclusions'

There are also many well-documented problems with industry-funded research in the way of http://wwwncbinlmnihgov/pubmed/?term=16893480 psychiatric medications http://wwwncbinlmnihgov/pubmed/21494667 failure to warn about cancer risk with certain drugs, as well as showing http://wwwncbinlmnihgov/pmc/articles/PMC3374868/  a huge statistical increase in &quot;positive findings&quot; for various pharmaceuticals

However, just because there is a documented problem with some industry funded research, that doesn‚Äôt mean there is a problem with ‚Äò‚Äô‚Äôall‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô industry funded research And oftentimes, new drugs only have industry-funded research for sources No other sources can be found Reasons like that are why it's not permitted to reject high quality sources on the basis of them being industry-funded 

At the same time, some editors currently reject some sources on the basis of them being published in another country One such example is with acupuncture where http://wwwncbinlmnihgov/pubmed/9551280 a 1998 research report showed that in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Russia/USSR, China and Japan higher reports of positive findings occurred when compared to England In some ways findings like these could possibly mirror the problems in industry-funded research And at the same time, as with industry-funded research, it‚Äôs difficult to discount all of it on the basis that there is a chance some of the more positive findings might possibly be due to publication bias Further complicating the issue is that more positive findings might be due to cultural differences in scientific research between various countries, such as http://wwwncbinlmnihgov/pubmed/24683249 ethical dilemmas with using placebos where the Chinese have shown statistical deviations from non-Chinese trials, creating conditions where placebo alone is not ethically justified as a control There are many other possible confounding factors similar to this which may explain differences for findings between various countries once found within this specific modality Undoubtedly, this seems to cloud the issue But making the issue more problematic, for us as editors, is that some of the research mentioned in the Vickers source might not even be of high quality, thus causing making any argument against high quality research moot 

Adding &quot;country of origin&quot; seems to put the wording more in line with Wikipedia‚Äôs project https://enwikipediaorg/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Countering_systemic_bias Countering Systemic Bias, as well as our WP:BIAS policy By ensuring Wikipedia editor-level peer review doesn‚Äôt extend to country of origin, it also makes it consistent with our current stance on liberal allowance of sources no matter what types of funding may be received 

UPDATE For anyone who thinks this issue isn't happening at all or was just one isolated incident, let me show proof it is still happening Within the past few days, an editor rejected research in a high quality journal, http://journalslwwcom/md-journal/pages/aboutthejournalaspx Medicine,  https://enwikipediaorg/w/indexphp?title=Talk%3AAcupuncture&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=680063145&amp;oldid=680007631 because the &quot;authors are Chinese&quot; Like it or not, rejecting sources based on ethnic origin of authors is a real problem We need to examine sources, rejecting or accepting them based on their own merits and nothing else  User:LesVegas|LesVegas (User talk:LesVegas|talk) 20:01, 8 September 2015 (UTC)

There have been incidents where high quality sources were rejected for reasons that could've been prevented with amended language, such as this I modified my first comment, adding in one example of such a rejection, although there have been others Therefore, it appears it is needed Let me know if you still think this way after reading the link User:LesVegas|LesVegas (User talk:LesVegas|talk) 03:16, 6 September 2015 (UTC)
Question What does &quot;country of origin&quot; in the proposal refer to? The country where the study was conducted, nationality of researchers or subjects, or country where the publishers of the journal or book are located? The first two are fine but perhaps unnecessary as CFCF says above (can LesVegas point to instances where such criterion was cited and prevailed?) If the last, I'll be opposed to the change since assessing the quality of journal and its publishers is crucial for assessing medical and other sources, and neither high-quality nor sham publishers are distributed uniformly across the globe, and we on wikipedia cannot solve this WP:RIGHTGREATWRONGS|real world problem by simply turning a blind eye to it User:Abecedare|Abecedare (User talk:Abecedare|talk) 01:04, 6 September 2015 (UTC)
Good question &quot;Country of origin&quot; is all-encompassing, meaning country of author, country where research was conducted and where it was published Keep in mind, this RfC is asking about high-quality peer-reviewed publications that meet every other standard of quality in MEDRS User:LesVegas|LesVegas (User talk:LesVegas|talk) 03:16, 6 September 2015 (UTC)

Agree with Doc James I have seen zero examples of any attempt to reject high-quality foreign sources on the basis of simply being from another country The Chinese studies about acupuncture published in Chinese journals were rejected not because they were published in China, but rather that they were not high quality journals with a reputation for reliability There are plenty of fringe journals pushing pseudoscience in the US and UK, and plenty of good, peer-reviewed science gets published in China --User:Guy Macon|Guy Macon (User talk:Guy Macon|talk) 01:48, 6 September 2015 (UTC)
User:Guy Macon|Guy Macon , you might check out the diff below where an editor rejected one such source on this very basis You can't get much higher quality than Cochrane Reviews, and you can't get much lower editing than to reject one all because &quot;all but one of its authors are Chinese&quot; It's sad we have seatbelt laws and equally as sad we have to tell editors not to reject high quality sources because of things like where they're published, but I'm afraid that's the case It's exhausting to waste time on such silly matters and doesn't hurt anything to add it in because we're talking about high quality, peer reviewed sources here anyway User:LesVegas|LesVegas (User talk:LesVegas|talk) 02:34, 6 September 2015 (UTC)

DES, thanks for replying  LesVegas and others have been pushing and pushing and pushing to include Chinese sources on acupuncture in our article - the issue has been discussed a zillion times but keeps coming up, and it gets frustrating, and people write things quickly that are easy to misconstrue when diffs are cherry-picked, as LesVegas has done with KWW's statement User:Jytdog|Jytdog (User talk:Jytdog|talk) 14:07, 6 September 2015 (UTC)
User:Jytdog, would a rule saying, &quot;do not exclude based solely on country of origin&quot; make it harder for you to exclude low-quality or otherwise problematic sources?  I'm not familiar with this particular dispute, but it sounds like those sources are no good regardless, so this shouldn't make any difference  Would it help if another line were added elsewhere saying, &quot;Sources that have not survived peer review may be excluded&quot; or &quot;sources from publications known to routine publish and fail to retract unreliable material may be excluded&quot;? User:Darkfrog24|Darkfrog24 (User talk:Darkfrog24|talk) 14:34, 6 September 2015 (UTC)
The background facts are:
a1) our article on Acupuncture has been highly contested for a long time and is subject to DS per Arbcom - the core dispute is between science-based editors and believers in acupuncture (as with many alt-med topics); 
a2) some acupuncture believers actually try at some level to deal with the relevant Wikipedia policies and guidelines (NPOV and particularly PSCI, FRINGE, MEDRS); 
b1) Research (and reviews) produced in China about acupuncture (and other TCM) overwhelmingly come to positive conclusions about the efficacy of TCM for various diseases and conditions, and they come to positive conclusions way more often than research and reviews produced in the West  
b2) This discrepancy is explained by believers (in published sources) in various ways (eg Westerners don't do TCM properly or there are special facts about TCM that make it impossible to conduct sound scientific research on it); scientists have explained this discrepancy in published sources by pointing to the immature level of development of Chinese scientific institutions 
c1) When you put a) and b) together, you get some acu-proponents pushing to use reviews originating from Chinese scientific institutions to support content in our article about the benefits of acupuncture (content that is not supportable with, or even contradicted by, other sources), and science-based editors tending to reject that content and its sourcing - especially when no other sources are brought (see the first bullet of  WP:REDFLAG)  This has been discussed extensively on this Talk page as well as on the article Talk page and the consensus has been to treat sources about TCM originating from China as &quot;suspect&quot; for the time being  - not excluded, but not &quot;green flagged&quot; as high quality  This RfC was posted by an acu-proponent  You can see my response to it below User:Jytdog|Jytdog (User talk:Jytdog|talk) 15:05, 6 September 2015 (UTC)
Jytdog, what is your opinion on rejecting Cochrane Reviews because its authors are Chinese? Are there no publications in China that are reliable? Do you have a source that all are unreliable and engage in publication bias? Do you think there could be other possibilities for differing results, such as http://wwwncbinlmnihgov/pubmed/24683249%20ethical%20dilemmas%20with%20using%20placebos ethical dilemmas with placebo controls in more instances? And since scientists have documented the same http://wwwncbinlmnihgov/pmc/articles/PMC3374868/ issues you complain about in Chinese research, as with industry-funded research, why do you hold a different standard for Chinese sources? User:LesVegas|LesVegas (User talk:LesVegas|talk) 15:22, 6 September 2015 (UTC)

 oppose The framing of serious issues with Chinese research publications on acupuncture as &quot;discrimination&quot; is the worst kind of red-herring, bad-faith, manipulative argument imaginable, especially when Chinese scientists themselves point out the problems  This RfC is the pits  There are solid sources describing the problems:
 Li J, et al The quality of reports of randomized clinical trials on traditional Chinese medicine treatments: a systematic review of articles indexed in the China National Knowledge Infrastructure database from 2005 to 2012 BMC Complement Altern Med 2014 Sep 26;14:362 
 
 
  
The quality will surely improve with time but LesVegas' effort to wave a magic wand and make the actual problems disappear under the banner of &quot;discrimination&quot; runs hard against everything we try to do at WP:MED with regard to using high quality sources User:Jytdog|Jytdog (User talk:Jytdog|talk) 04:37, 6 September 2015 (UTC)
Jytdog, this RfC is about high-quality sources, not low quality ones which are clearly not allowed But your inability to differentiate between these two categories and continue stereotyping all Chinese studies and Chinese authors the way you just did isn't surprising since you posted https://enwikipediaorg/w/indexphp?title=Talk%3AAcupuncture&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=677538132&amp;oldid=677534853 that scientific institutions in China aren't independent or mature, and therefore all of their journals are unreliable Frankly, comments like that are why RfC's like this exist But back to the discussion at hand You never addressed high quality sources, which is what this RfC is pertaining to You are opposing low quality ones, which we all should oppose on the basis of things like lack of peer-review and things of that nature But opposing them simply because they are Chinese isn't acceptable, don't you think? User:LesVegas|LesVegas (User talk:LesVegas|talk) 04:57, 6 September 2015 (UTC)
You continue to mischaracterize the situation and to employ circular reasoning  The systemic problems with Chinese research on acupuncture  are well documented and so the assumption going in, is that they are not high quality; per Guy's diff they are &quot;suspect&quot;  The burden is on the person bringing any such source to show that the specific source is high quality Per WP:REDFLAG one way that could be done would be to show that sources that are high quality say the same thing This is not racism, it is dealing with immature level of development of Chinese scientific institutions, just like it is not racist to say that the institutions of Chinese law in the fields of environment and intellectual property are not mature  The air quality in Chinese cities is often poor; copyright infringement is rampant in China; Chinese publications on acupuncture almost always have favorable outcomes   Those are simple statements of fact, reflecting a society in development They are not essentialist, racist statements - they are existential statements of fact and will change over time, as the situation in China changes  So WP:DROPTHESTICK And I suggest you be much more careful in deploying this tactic of cherry-picking diffs and trying to discredit editors as racist  User:Jytdog|Jytdog (User talk:Jytdog|talk) 13:50, 6 September 2015 (UTC) 
Jytdog, just the other day you said &quot;https://enwikipediaorg/w/indexphp?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AIdentifying_reliable_sources_%28medicine%29&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=678844952&amp;oldid=678844685 we do not perform peer review on sources and should never reject industry-funded sources that almost always have positive findings But Chinese research? Nope, https://enwikipediaorg/w/indexphp?title=Talk%3AAcupuncture&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=677538132&amp;oldid=677534853 Chinese scientists aren't independent or mature I'm not trying to characterize you as racist, but frankly by defending one standard for industry-funded studies, and enforcing another for Chinese research while stereotyping all Chinese research as unreliable, never to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, makes it difficult for me not to find a diff that characterizes you any other way But let me allow you the opportunity to prove that you're not racist Simple question: why should we allow one standard for industry funded research despite documented publication bias issues, and another standard for Chinese research, rejecting the notion that we should evaluate Chinese sources or Chinese authors on a case-by-case basis like we do everywhere else? User:LesVegas|LesVegas (User talk:LesVegas|talk) 15:01, 6 September 2015 (UTC) 
Your mischaracterization of what I wrote and of MEDRS is malicious, incompetent, or both  This is not about conducting peer review, which involves critiquing the quality and extent of the experiments that were done, the presentation of the resulting data, and the conclusions drawn from the data This has nothing to do with research funding  And I said nothing about &quot;Chinese scientists&quot; - I addressed institutions User:Jytdog|Jytdog (User talk:Jytdog|talk) 15:14, 6 September 2015 (UTC) (strike; should not have written that  my apologies  User:Jytdog|Jytdog (User talk:Jytdog|talk) 15:48, 6 September 2015 (UTC)) 
Oh but it is about conducting a peer review based on industry funding Those have the same documented issues you complain about in Chinese research, although I would argue, worse, since there are more confounding factors between Eastern and Western cultures (like different scientific ethics) and those can explain reasons for discrepancies in results between East vs West, not simply publication bias Simple question: why should we not reject research on the basis that it's industry-funded, but we should reject research because it's Chinese, instead of evaluating it on a case by case basis?

 Jytdog, this is not about peer review in the publication process I hope you aren't WP: IDHT'ing Yes, scientific papers are peer reviewed before being published in reputable journals But the peer review we are talking about is that &quot;Wikipedia editors should not perform peer review&quot;, specifically, in this instance, by rejecting high-quality sources on the basis of industry funding behind piece of published research Again, please answer the question: why should we not reject research on the basis that it's industry-funded, but we should reject research because it's Chinese, instead of evaluating it on a case by case basis? I really hope you can answer it User:LesVegas|LesVegas (User talk:LesVegas|talk) 16:09, 6 September 2015 (UTC)

Previously uninvolved editor here: 1) Even if the sources were rightly excluded, &quot;they're Chinese&quot; should not be numbered among the reasons for this; their own failings should be enough  Question: Why would &quot;don't exclude based on country&quot; make any difference?  2) Aside from this acupuncture issue, is the argument of exclusion-based-on-country a common enough problem to merit explicitly banning it?

Oppose While I agree that certain fringe journals are focused in particular countries, I don't think we should be determining reliability overall by country of origin However, that can be a first red flag on certain topics for a deeper look That's why I would oppose this language as I don't think it is needed If a question on reliability comes up, there will be other qualities we look at for journals as well There is also potential this language could be abused from a WP:BEANS approach (acupuncture does come to mind), so I think it's better that this is one thing left unsaid, but consensus in discussions on the idea that country or origin alone can't be used can always be linked if someone brings it up User:Kingofaces43|Kingofaces43 (User talk:Kingofaces43|talk) 16:35, 6 September 2015 (UTC)

Strong oppose The focus should remain on the quality of the research and the reliability of the source Either the research is good, or it is not Either the source is reliable, or it is not In what possible way does &quot;country of origin&quot; factor into anything, except to imply that some countries are doing poor quality research and publishing in unreliable sources, and must therefore be held to a lesser standard? User:TechBear|TechBear | User talk:TechBear|Talk | Special:Contributions/TechBear|Contributions 20:39, 6 September 2015 (UTC)
I agree with you that the focus should always be on the quality of the sources themselves In MEDRS it states, &quot;Do not reject a high-quality type of study due to personal objections to the study's inclusion criteria, references, funding sources, or conclusions&quot; We aren't supposed to reject sources purely on those merits, just simply focus on the quality of the source itself, and yet MEDRS has to be explicit because I can only assume in the past editors have rejected high quality sources because of things like references, inclusion criteria, etc Given that editors have rejected clearly high quality sources on the basis of nationality of author or country of publication (as seen from the diffs I provided) why haven't we reached a point where we need to explicitly tell editors they need to be focusing only on source quality and nothing else, like country?

Support I have read most of this RFC and debated commenting Most of the responses do not answer the question The question is specifically about High quality sources High quality sources should never be excluded based on the country of origin or nationality of the authors Low quality sources will be rejected based on the fact they are low quality and this change will not allow them in regardless I have looked at the diffs and there is a problem in some instances, though how wide spread is hard to say User:AlbinoFerret|AlbinoFerret 15:59, 7 September 2015 (UTC)


A http://edzardernstcom/2014/05/and-this-is-why-we-might-as-well-forget-about-chinese-acupuncture-trials/ blog post by Edzard Ernst, a leading academic in this area, reads in large part:
  
&quot;In this case, you might perhaps believe Chinese researchers In this systematic review http://onlineliebertpubcom/doi/pdfplus/101089/acm20145346abstract, all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of acupuncture published in Chinese journals were identified by a team of Chinese scientists A total of 840 RCTs were found, including 727 RCTs comparing acupuncture with conventional treatment, 51 RCTs with no treatment controls, and 62 RCTs with sham-acupuncture controls Among theses 840 RCTs, 838 studies (998%) reported positive results from primary outcomes and two trials (02%) reported negative results The percentages of RCTs concealment of the information on withdraws or sample size calculations were 437%, 59%, 49%, 99%, and 17% respectively 

The authors concluded that publication bias might be major issue in RCTs on acupuncture published in Chinese journals reported, which is related to high risk of bias We suggest that all trials should be prospectively registered in international trial registry in future  

I applaud the authors‚Äô courageous efforts to conduct this analysis, but I do not agree with their conclusion The question why all Chinese acupuncture trials are positive has puzzled me since many years, and I have quizzed numerous Chinese colleagues why this might be so The answer I received was uniformly that it would be very offensive for Chinese researchers to conceive a study that does not confirm the views held by their peers In other words, acupuncture research in China is conducted to confirm the prior assumption that this treatment is effective It seems obvious that this is an abuse of science which must cause confusion 

Whatever the reasons for the phenomenon, and we can only speculate about them, the fact has been independently confirmed several times and is now quite undeniable: acupuncture trials from China ‚Äì and these constitute the majority of the evidence-base in this area ‚Äì cannot be trusted&quot;  

This gives us a convenient way of identifying a large section of the literature as pseudoscience sensu stricto, and not to be regarded as RS User:Richard Keatinge|Richard Keatinge (User talk:Richard Keatinge|talk) 16:17, 7 September 2015 (UTC)
Richard, I am glad you are giving this more analysis than others have I have asked myself the same question- why have variations been noted? While publication bias is one possibility, there are others For instance, placebo controls are rarely done and for ethical reasons control groups receive actual treatment of some sort Another possibility is that in China they are performing acupuncture differently The first time I ever had acupuncture was when I was in China, and after an accident, and I can tell you it was a very different treatment than any of the acupuncture I have had since returning to the US It is also very different from Japanese acupuncture, or Korean, all of which I have experienced The Chinese acupuncture I experienced used thicker needles and they adjusted them in such a way that elicited very strong stimulation It was also done in a hospital, by medical doctors, so I knew in the back of my mind this was legitimate and this gave a different experience overall The thing is, there are many variables But worst case scenario, statistics have shown a 24 percent increase in positive findings of Chinese research versus Western research regarding acupuncture That's still lower than the stats on industry-funded drug trials when compared to independently-funded sources, and yet we have explicit language in MEDRS that we shouldn't reject high quality sources because of funding So why shouldn't we be consistent?

oppose it is an attempt to run around the essential purpose of MEDRES: that we only use the highest quality sources where there is evidence that medical sources from a particular country do not measure up to the standards generally required we should NOT be using them -- User talk:TheRedPenOfDoom|TRPoD aka The Red Pen of Doom 17:05, 7 September 2015 (UTC)
Support:  Adding country of origin to the policy/guideline is appropriate; nothing prevents anyone from applying a rigorous critique to the quality of a particular source It is important not to mass-categorize entire groups of authors or publications simply by where they originate  It, for example, an academic journal from nation Foo publishes bad science, it can be assessed on its own merits or lack thereof, not the ethnicity of those producing it User:Montanabw|MontanabwUser talk:Montanabw|(talk) 23:41, 12 September 2015 (UTC)

 Oppose quote The framing of serious issues with Chinese research publications on acupuncture as &quot;discrimination&quot; is the worst kind of red-herring, bad-faith, manipulative argument imaginable, especially when Chinese scientists themselves point out the problems  This RfC is the pits There is an awful lot of bad faith characterisation in this thread Of course country, nationality etc should not in itself be a criteria, but if the problem really did exist (which I'm not convinced of by the instances given), this wording would do nothing to solve it but simply distract from the central question of the quality of the source in a POINTY manner User:Pincrete|Pincrete (User talk:Pincrete|talk) 19:04, 19 September 2015 (UTC)
There were several instances, one where Cochrane Reviews were being suppressed because of Chinese authorship as well as high quality journals such as Medicine where the same objections based on Chinese authorship were made Since this RfC was on high quality sources only, can you please clarify: when we have obviously high quality sources, do you think country of origin should be an issue at all? User:LesVegas|LesVegas (User talk:LesVegas|talk) 22:50, 19 September 2015 (UTC)
Re country of origin question Obviously not in itself I don't ordinarily edit in Med areas, (summoned by bot), however it is simply an established fact that some sources are less reliable than others in all areas (US Govt 'collateral damage' figures?) I don't see why 'country' would be identified any more than any other factor If there is real evidence of rejecting sources solely, or principally, on grounds of ethnicity or provenance, this is not the way to solve it I was not persuaded that there was such evidence You (and others) are repeatedly saying these are high quality sources, AS A FACT, but is that not what is disputed? User:Pincrete|Pincrete (User talk:Pincrete|talk) 14:20, 21 September 2015 (UTC)
I have never seen anyone dispute, for instance, that Cochrane Reviews or publications from Medicine, are not high quality publications unless they have Chinese authors in the studies they publish (which has been disputed) In fact, MEDRS says they unequivocally are high quality sources One aspect that has been disputed is that if they have authors who are Chinese, then that makes them unreliable My position is that country of origin shouldn't ever be used as an argument to exclude high quality sources What we instead should be focusing on as editors is if the source passes MEDRS's established high-barometer for reliability and that's it, never rejecting sources because of things like country of origin Do you agree? User:LesVegas|LesVegas (User talk:LesVegas|talk) 17:14, 21 September 2015 (UTC)
I was invited by a bot to make a comment, I am not either competent or willing to discuss the reliability of specific research The comment I made is that the examples given do not persuade me that research is being rejected solely or primarily on the grounds of ethnicity or nationality, and that further, if it were, this would not be an effective means of remedying the problem The provenance of any source, and its reputation for checking, is always a factor in assessing its reliability, whether we are discussing Russia Today, Fox News, Daily Mail, or a Govt statement I am in-expert on the protocols of medical trials, but even I know that allowing for 'placebo effect' is a cornerstone of such trials, yet you dismiss this factor above as 'Chinese doctors have an ethical objection' Fine, then such trials have not been conducted according to long-established medical standards IF the proof of 'racism' or irrational 'national prejudice' were as clear-cut as you appear to believe it to be, you should be taking this matter to a much higher 'court' in WP than this RfC I am not persuaded that you are correct User:Pincrete|Pincrete (User talk:Pincrete|talk) 07:47, 22 September 2015 (UTC)

Oppose closeI find it a little odd that nobody seems to want to answer why we have one standard for industry funded sources (written into MEDRS), and an entire other standard for Chinese sources where we can reject them on the basis of being Chinese and not on their own merits Nobody has dared answer that question, and here, less than 24 hrs after the RfC was filed, an attempt has been made to close it before anyone answers this obvious and frankly embarrasing inconsistency How paradoxical to then accuse me of not trying to seek the truth And please don't accuse me of demonizing Jytdog as racist He accused me of accusing him of racism, which is not the same thing at all He said I was finding diffs that made him look racist and I told him essentially that was his problem, not mine As for institutions, are they faceless, humanless entities or are they made up of human beings? So I suppose the institutions can be immature or not independent, but the scientists and publishers composing the institutions are mature and independent? Really? Especially when Jytdog and other editors are on record rejecting sources because they're Chinese, and not because of, say, lack of peer-review or lack of Medline indexing If you read Jytdog's many diffs in full context he makes it clear it is impossible for anything Chinese to ever be considered reliable I have not once seen him state, even here, otherwise And at the same time he defends the practice of not rejecting sources because of industry-funding that has been documented to skew results, but opposes all Chinese research on acupuncture for those same reasons I have asked multiple times for an answer, and he ignores it Please, somebody, can somebody answer it? If we can come to a consensus on how to reconcile that glaring issue, and we can come to a consensus that high quality sources shouldn't be rejected on the basis of ethnicity of author, nor should they be rejected purely because of where they're published, I'm fine with that When editors reject friggin Cochrane Reviews because authors are Chinese, we have a serious problem User:LesVegas|LesVegas (User talk:LesVegas|talk) 22:11, 6 September 2015 (UTC)

I have seen comments suggesting editors here never rejected sources because their authors are Chinese, despite diffs, so allow me to provide one more Just yesterday, an editor did just that, rejecting a high-quality source because it had Chinese authors, so clearly this is a serious and ongoing problem that must be dealt with This editor rejected research in a high quality journal, http://journalslwwcom/md-journal/pages/aboutthejournalaspx Medicine, https://enwikipediaorg/w/indexphp?title=Talk%3AAcupuncture&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=680063145&amp;oldid=680007631 because the &quot;authors are Chinese,&quot; and therefore assumed to be incapable of not being biased Like it or not, rejecting sources based on ethnic origin of authors is a real problem Sources in low quality journals should be rejected based on their own lack of merits Sources in high quality journals should be accepted on their own merits But sources should never be excluded for embarrasing reasons like this and it is a shame that in 2015 we have to have to write explicit language into our guidelines to keep behavior like this from happening User:LesVegas|LesVegas (User talk:LesVegas|talk) 20:18, 8 September 2015 (UTC)
I think you're grossly oversimplifying a significant issue It has been recognized for some time that research in certain countries tends to be uniformly positive about acupuncture, to the extent that it raises serious questions about publication bias This line of thought is not‚Äîas you try to portray it‚Äîa form of racism among Wikipedia contributors The relevance of national origin of research has been expounded both qualitatively and quantitatively in the reputable scholarly literature, going as far back as http://wwwncbinlmnihgov/pubmed/9551280 Vickers et al, 1998, who found that trials from China, Japan, Hong Kong, and Taiwan were uniformly positive about acupuncture and urged caution in integrating these almost-certainly-biased results into systematic reviews or meta-analyses More recently, a http://onlineliebertpubcom/doi/full/101089/acm20145346abstract systematic review conducted by Chinese authors in 2014 found striking evidence of publication bias in studies on acupuncture reported in Chinese journals I think it's worth having a serious discussion about this, but your post is pretty much the opposite of serious discussion User:MastCell|MastCell¬†User Talk:MastCell|Talk 17:56, 21 September 2015 (UTC)
User:MastCell|MastCell, I'm all for having a serious discussion on this and hope you are too For the record, I never claimed racism was a factor here, and my rather long-winded complex posts, if you read them, should show that I haven't oversimplified anything In fact, we have written into MEDRS not to deny sources based on how they're funded, and yet we have extensive documentation of publication bias regarding industry funded research No such bias has ever been proven with Chinese research, merely speculated as one of many possibilities for difference in findings Why would we treat Chinese research different than industry funded research? A subject which, by the way, has much more extensive documentation of bias! That said, when editors reject Cochrane Reviews because they have Chinese authors, or reject obviously high quality Western-published journals because they have Chinese authors, maybe they're just belligerent POV pushers rather than racists But they put their POV above all else and that's a problem  User:LesVegas|LesVegas (User talk:LesVegas|talk) 21:25, 21 September 2015 (UTC)

User:CFCF|CFCF, I agree with most of what you said above Yes, it was a copyright violation And yes, the quote wasn't fully representative of the source And by the way, I didn't add the quote or source, that was another editor I had nothing to do with it beyond watch it get removed But the reasons it was removed were wrong Removing it or amending it for reasons you stated are perfectly fine I have no problem with that Editors shouldn't be supporting removal of sources because the authors are Chinese I hate to belabor the point, but you said above that it never happened and my diffs don't support it, so I just have to clear my name here User:LesVegas|LesVegas (User talk:LesVegas|talk) 02:27, 23 September 2015 (UTC)

LesVegas, I am not competent to assess the virtues or weaknesses of specific medical research, my opinion on that would be valueless However, specific pieces of  research are not the subject of this RfC, rather a general principle User:Pincrete|Pincrete (User talk:Pincrete|talk) 08:25, 23 September 2015 (UTC)

Question for Kww
User:Kww is mentioned repeatedly above, and it doesn't look to me like anyone has pinged him about this or given him a fair chance to explain his off-the-cuff comment that most of the https://enwikipediaorg/w/indexphp?title=Talk%3AAcupuncture&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=680063145&amp;oldid=680007631 &quot;authors are Chinese&quot; on a particular source  (Does that refer to their race?  Their citizenship?  Where they were trained?  Where they're currently working?  A quick guess based upon last names?  It could mean almost anything)  IMO it would be fair to let him have his say if he's interested  User:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (User talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 04:32, 23 September 2015 (UTC)

I don't respond much unless pinged The diff you are providing is JzG's, but I'll defend it The bias of Chinese medical journals and Chinese studies submitted to Western medical journals is well-documented For such sources to discover beneficial effects to acupuncture isn't particularly surprising, nor is it likely to indicate that acupuncture has any particular effect beyond placebo There are similar problems with sources related to ayurveda While I understand the slippery slope of racism, it's also important for us to note that associated with some of the rituals that are misrepresented as medicine there are one or two countries that have a vested interest in portraying that ritual as if it were effective As for Les Vegas's proposal above, I don't think anyone is attempting to remove sources due to a personal objection to the country of origin: it's due to well-documented and objectively provable objections to the country of origin‚ÄîUser:Kww|Kww(User talk:Kww|talk) 16:03, 23 September 2015 (UTC)
Thanks for the reply, User:Kww|Kevin; I appreciate it  Thanks also to John for pointing out that I had the wrong diff  I apologize for the sloppy post; I meant https://enwikipediaorg/w/indexphp?title=Talk%3AAcupuncture&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=667090507&amp;oldid=667089872 this diff  User:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (User talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:12, 23 September 2015 (UTC)
As for the corrected quote, note that my primary objection was that even taken at face value, the sources didn't support the proposition Les Vegas was making: &quot;not effective for a wide range of conditions&quot; isn't contradicted (or even particularly weakened) by evidence of positive effect for a narrow range of conditions I didn't get into a detailed analysis of the sources themselves I will say, however, that it's a fair bet that Z Zheng, CCL Xue, J Shang, X Shen, J Xia, X Zhu, L He, and J Song being among the reported researchers in a small handful of reviews represents a reasonable foundation to suspect bias If there was actually a meaningful claim being made, I'd scrutinize the sources more carefully‚ÄîUser:Kww|Kww(User talk:Kww|talk) 16:29, 23 September 2015 (UTC)
Thank you for the explanation Kww's answer goes right to the heart of the matter If authors have Chinese names, we should suspect bias even if it's in a Cochrane Review, as if Cochrane is incapable of vetting the material themselves, but we, the lowly Wikipedia editor are Frankly, I'm really not surprised User:LesVegas|LesVegas (User talk:LesVegas|talk) 20:04, 23 September 2015 (UTC)
Nor should you be What's surprising is that you would think that we should close our eyes to an indication of bias noted in reliable sources Note that I did not reject the sources outright, but was arguing primarily on the basis that your conclusions didn't follow from their statements even if we presumed they were completely accurate‚ÄîUser:Kww|Kww(User talk:Kww|talk) 20:54, 23 September 2015 (UTC)
Yes, I recall very well Your primary argument was that the Cochrane Reviews didn't support replacing a 6 year old claim with an update Your secondary argument was that they might be unreliable anyway because they have Chinese authors That's what is being disputed here Please note that the wording of the MEDRS amendment in this RfC says &quot;do not reject high quality sources because of x,y,zor country of origin&quot; It does not say do not reject high quality sources if they are being used to support a claim that isn't supported by those sources, or is more accurately supported by another source Policies elsewhere already cover those objections  User:LesVegas|LesVegas (User talk:LesVegas|talk) 21:41, 23 September 2015 (UTC)
If you had found material that actually supported an update, I would listen Once again, &quot;not effective for a wide range of conditions&quot; and &quot;is effective for condition x, y, and z&quot; are not contradictory They are barely related The original source surveyed the impact on over thirty conditions and you found a source that weakened the position on, at most, two of those conditions As for your propensity for misinterpreting sources and using them to support claims they don't support, I hope this debate makes that problem more obvious to a wider variety of editors Your motivation for requesting this change has been noted by numerous editors: you are upset that people want to see corroboration in other sources when you can only offer Chinese sources supporting a claim about acupuncture Given the noted bias problems, that's a quite reasonable demand If something is actually true, Western sources will eventually catch up‚ÄîUser:Kww|Kww(User talk:Kww|talk) 22:08, 23 September 2015 (UTC)
You're back to omnisciently assuming my motivations again Just for the record, my motives are simply to encourage editors to examine source quality and not reject them for paltry reasons like the last name of their authors User:LesVegas|LesVegas (User talk:LesVegas|talk) 22:21, 23 September 2015 (UTC)
Examination of source quality does require taking bias considerations into account Your requested modification is basically a demand to ignore one potential source of bias As for omniscience? No, pretty much any observer of your edits and discussions will come to a similar conclusion‚ÄîUser:Kww|Kww(User talk:Kww|talk) 22:38, 23 September 2015 (UTC)
&quot;Examination of source quality does require taking bias considerations into account&quot; is just another way of saying high quality sources that we never question anywhere else for any other claims might not be high quality at all if we see it has Chinese authors, whom we ought to be suspicious of because they might be biased Thank you for making your position clear, over and over again User:LesVegas|LesVegas (User talk:LesVegas|talk) 23:03, 23 September 2015 (UTC)
I support being suspicious of any biased source (including Coke-paid researchers on the effects of soda pop on obesity on which I didn't comment, apparently, ayurvedists on the benefits of heavy metal poisoning, Christians on the historical existence of Jesus of Nazareth, among many other examples a quick search of my edit history will uncover)‚ÄîUser:Kww|Kww(User talk:Kww|talk) 23:58, 23 September 2015 (UTC)
 Ok, I'm glad to see you are consistent I'm glad you brought up the Coke funding of obesity studies which is an example I have brought up here as well MEDRS currently states that editors shouldn't reject high quality sources based on their source of funding So that would mean Coke studies are perfectly ok to use, as are countless numbers of other industry funded research which has been shown to be far worse than Chinese studies on acupuncture Why should we have one guideline where we don't reject industry funded studies, but we do reject sources because they originate in China or have Chinese authors? To me, I wouldn't even have raised this issue if I didn't see an inconsistency in our guideline where we allow carte blanche acceptance of industry funded, obviously tainted and conflicted research, but we reject Chinese sources because they might be tainted I have never accused anyone here of being racist I honestly believe editors here are good people, some just have blindspots and I know I do too But frankly, if we continue to greenlight biased industry funded research but disallow Chinese sources, that is racist If editors here want to consider Chinese sources suspect, while I deeply disagree with that, I can understand the point But we had damn well amend MEDRS to treat industry funded sources the same way We're not going to have two standards here User:LesVegas|LesVegas (User talk:LesVegas|talk) 04:00, 24 September 2015 (UTC)
You shouldn't attempt to fix the inconsistency in the wrong direction: two wrongs don't make a right and all that‚ÄîUser:Kww|Kww(User talk:Kww|talk) 04:15, 24 September 2015 (UTC)
The question of industry funding was discussed at length very recently on this very page There, WP:DNFT was invoked and I think it now applies here too Time to close User:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (User talk:Alexbrn|talk) 04:24, 24 September 2015 (UTC)
You can ignore a problem or inconsistency, you can IDHT, but editors shouldn't be insulted for pointing out problems And previously, that was invoked by an editor who much of the Wikipedia community has complained about for GMO advocacy and personal attacks and I have no reason to doubt that his invoking DNFT wasn't a great illustration of both his advocacy and insults I can certainly see why a GMO advocate doesn't want to limit industry funded sources in any way This same editor also believed Chinese sources should be limited rather inconsistently But I expected much better from you, Alexbrn, than to ignore and insult and hope this embarrassing inconsistency just goes away And as much as I deeply disagree with Kww on this issue, I at least have to respect and admire his consistency here And we should be consistent, one way or another While I think the best way with our policies is to allow high quality sources regardless of industry funding or country of origin (because it's too hard to say that because some have been bad, all are bad), we cannot have one set of guidelines for some sources and another set of guidelines for others I know it's uncomfortable for some editors to admit this partisan application, but If we bury our heads in the sand and pretend it's not inconsistent, that won't magically make it consistent User:LesVegas|LesVegas (User talk:LesVegas|talk)
You've illustrated the problem quite nicely: there's no particular correlation between the conflict of interest inherent in the Coca-Cola funded obesity research and the general agreement of all responsible researchers that GMO as currently practiced presents no health or public safety issues While I abhor the inconsistency, I can understand why people would see a slippery-slope problem on the funding issues After all, most good research is funded by people connnected with science, and science pretty much rules out the anti-vax, anti-GMO, pro-ayurveda, and pro-acupuncture camps, giving those people an incentive to object to nearly all research as being biased in one way or the other‚ÄîUser:Kww|Kww(User talk:Kww|talk) 00:05, 25 September 2015 (UTC)
Well, I don't claim to be an expert on the latest in all things biotech, but I know Monsanto funds much biotech safety research and even when&quot; purely independent research&quot; is touted in the press it's often funded by The American Society for Nutrition whose http://wwwnutritionorg/our-members/our-corporate-members/our-sustaining-members/ own website says is funded by Monsanto They fund the science all over the place And this idea that industry-funded research was only a problem with Coke today and big tobacco in yesteryears is not accurate at all What I do know is there is well documented issues with pharmaceutical industry funded research in the way of http://wwwncbinlmnihgov/pubmed/?term=16893480 psychiatric medications http://wwwncbinlmnihgov/pubmed/21494667 and in failing to warn about cancer risk with certain drugs, as well as in showing http://wwwncbinlmnihgov/pmc/articles/PMC3374868/  a huge statistical increase in &quot;positive findings&quot; for various pharmaceuticals just to name a few They were all connected with &quot;science&quot; yet clearly have shown worse issues than the Chinese because they're not explainable by a slew of confounding factors from an entirely different culture and a medicinal art many researchers have openly admitted is very difficult to study anyway I see no argument for why we should treat Chinese studies differently than those paid for by Monsanto, Merck or the Marlboro Man User:LesVegas|LesVegas (User talk:LesVegas|talk) 19:29, 25 September 2015 (UTC)
It's a balancing act: whether an individual drug does or does not create a cancer risk is something with gradations of bias that can range from damning (a study by the manufacturer that contradicts all other studies would need to be treated with great suspicion, for example) to minor (a study by a research group funded by multiple sources, including the manufacturer, which falls in line with similar studies by groups not involving the manufacturer) In the case of Chinese studies of acupuncture, we're dealing with a group that tends not to publish negative results, refuses to use standard placebo-based methodologies, and comes to conclusions that researchers using more rigorous research techniques cannot reproduce There's no reason to suspect that the results are accurate, and every reason to suspect that the results are due to flawed research and reporting There's nobody arguing to exclude all Chinese research, just to avoid relying on a known trouble spot: Chinese studies of treatments based on Chinese folk remedies and superstitions Is there anyone objecting to Chinese studies of pharmaceutical treatment of tuberculosis or anything like that? I think not‚ÄîUser:Kww|Kww(User talk:Kww|talk) 23:01, 25 September 2015 (UTC)
Actually, negative results in China weren't seen in 1998, they are now But sure, in more recent times it's noted with different results seen in US studies Some of that could be publication bias, some of that could be due to other factors Fact is, we don't know But http://wwwncbinlmnihgov/pmc/articles/PMC3374868/  industry funded pharmaceutical results are also seen to have much better results than independent research shows and those are comparing results within the same country We have one variable to deal with there, not countless, so it makes publication bias much more likely a factor than is the case with the Chinese I'm talking hard facts and statistics here, not your opinions of Chinese culture or your opinions of alternative medicine, but documented facts alone And by the documented facts alone, even in the worst case-scenario with the lowest quality published research in China, Chinese studies on acupuncture have actually less possibility of publication bias than industry funded pharmaceutical studies do from the standpoint of variables Any reasonable person examining facts alone and not swayed by opinions or POV must agree with this And yet we specifically allow industry funded pharmaceutical studies on Wikipedia, and some of these same editors want to reject Chinese studies on acupuncture User:LesVegas|LesVegas (User talk:LesVegas|talk) 16:59, 26 September 2015 (UTC)

Do we all understand the outcome here?
So we have a bit of a procedural issue with RFCs, which is that one editor lists almost all the expired RFCs at WP:ANRFC, so that some busy WP:NAC can carefully add a colored box and a closing statement to each of them  I think this is an ongoing WP:NOTBURO problem, a waste of time for most RFCs, and sometimes even an insult to the participants' good sense and ability to understand their own conversations, but let me ask just to be sure:

Does anybody here need any outside help in figuring out whether or not this discussion shows support for the proposed addition of the words &quot;country of origin&quot; to that sentence in this guideline at this time?  

If nobody actually needs any help with understanding the outcome, then perhaps we can prevent him from wasting someone's time with telling us what we all already know  User:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (User talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:49, 6 October 2015 (UTC)

I think that would likely be because Albino's comment stated that multiple editors were ignoring the fact that we are talking about high quality sources and some editors opposed low quality sources, which wasn't the purpose of the RfC User:LesVegas|LesVegas (User talk:LesVegas|talk) 12:53, 24 October 2015 (UTC)
This is not true  The statement in the guideline is about high-quality types (emphasis in the original) of sources, not about high-quality sources  A meta-analysis is a high-quality type of source, but it can be a low-quality source (eg, if it's outdated, poorly done, or irrelevant)  User:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (User talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 21:32, 28 October 2015 (UTC)
Yes, there are meta-analyses that are poor quality because of age, journal integrity, etc, but they are not poor quality simply on the basis of where they are published or the country of origin of its authors That was the purpose of the RfC, and no, just as we cannot exclude sources because they receive industry funding, we also cannot exclude them because of country of publication Not one single editor addressed why we don't reject industry funded sources on the basis of known bias, but we should ban sources based on speculative and unconfirmed publication bias due to country of origin Not one editor Note that Elvey mentioned as much in his close as well There were multiple factors here really User:LesVegas|LesVegas (User talk:LesVegas|talk) 19:23, 29 October 2015 (UTC)

A couple were mentioned during the RFC I did point out I was unsure if it was widespread, but even if it isnt very widespread its a bad thing that should be stopped It hurts the project in rejecting even a few high quality sources and makes the project look bad focusing in the ethnic angle I think those editors who are concerned this will allow low quality sources in shouldt worry, low quality will always be excluded Just point out the problems with the source that make it low quality and dont point out where they came from Doing that give those pushing them a reason to argue User:AlbinoFerret|AlbinoFerret 14:46, 26 October 2015 (UTC)

While that may be what you want in the section, it does not say what the closer said Here is the section:
&quot;This addition should NOT be read as a PC ban on any mention of country of origin (or founding source, etc) when necessary to refer to studies with hard data (as contrasted to stereotypes) that have identified a systematic problem that is normally identified with an affiliated country of origin, as mentioned by Richard Keatinge Likewise, this addition should NOT be read as a changing the longstanding policy that sources from publications known to routinely publish and fail to retract material proven unreliable may be excluded&quot;
 What it appears  is saying , and Elvey can correct me if I am wrong, is this close is not a ban on discussing problems with sources in a discussion of a source that talks about them It doesnt appear to be a loophole to insert arguments about a source, based on a country, just because other crappy sources have come from there What might be better to say is &quot;It is better to look at the quality of a source, if the source is of low quality it should be excluded&quot; User:AlbinoFerret|AlbinoFerret 20:58, 26 October 2015 (UTC)

Thats because the RFC has already said that country of origin is not a valid exclusion I assumed that country of origin is added to the list of other things that should not be considered The whole purpose of that section appears to be to tell people to look for high quality sources, then some things that should not be considered I propose adding a sentence at the bottom to direct editors to, instead of looking at the country or funding, to look at the quality User:AlbinoFerret|AlbinoFerret 21:07, 26 October 2015 (UTC)

Albino Ferret is right, in fact, it would violate the spirit of every single RfC done across wikipedia if we always added a reference tag and then just put whatever summary those opposed wanted Adding in a summary of whatever you want to be read as a caveat is gaming an RfC outcome Besides, the RfC wasn't about &quot;should we say 'country of origin' and then have these caveats?&quot; it was about the wording, &quot;country of origin&quot; specifically And, to that, the answer was &quot;yes,&quot; it needs to be added in But since the consensus reading did mention other specifics and since some editors are persistent in wanting something else, I figured a link where readers could see the full consensus read/closing comments would be the best compromise  User:LesVegas|LesVegas (User talk:LesVegas|talk) 21:25, 26 October 2015 (UTC)
The outcome of the RfC is not constrained to be binary It's intended to gauge consensus, and the closer found consensus to include 'country of origin', but with the caveat that it might be a legitimate consideration where &quot;hard data&quot; demonstrate a concern about biased literature User:MastCell|MastCell¬†User Talk:MastCell|Talk 22:52, 26 October 2015 (UTC)

We're trying to get some clarification of some of the major issues with the close and a possible new clause, it isn't something we will do on a whim‚Äìwe need to have a agree on what (if anything) to include We should wait until clarification of what  meant in the close summary Currently the meaning of the text is very murky, and as such it may be challenged for not adequately summarizing the consensus User:CFCF|CFCFUser talk:CFCF| üíå Special:EmailUser/CFCF|üìß 23:15, 26 October 2015 (UTC)


(Late reply)  User:Elvey|Elvey, I'm trying to figure out what the relevance of your statement about &quot;overriding WP:V and WP:RS&quot; is  Imagine that you are trying to decide whether a source is reliable  Do you believe that considering the country of origin, eg, to avoid citing the notoriously bad Soviet science, would somehow a constitute &quot;overriding&quot; WP:V?  Could you point to any sentence in WP:V that would be violated or &quot;overridden&quot; by doing that? 

Also, I have read Albino's comment, and you seem to have overlooked a critical difference between what the guideline says and what Albino wrote  The sentence in the guideline talks about high-quality types of sources (eg, a meta-analysis is a high-quality type of source; a case study is a low-quality type of source)  Albino talks about high-quality sources‚Äîa quality that takes far more into consideration than the type of the source  &quot;High-quality types&quot; and &quot;high-quality sources&quot; are not the same thing  It's possible to have a low-quality meta-analysis, and just like it's possible to have a top-quality case study  User:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (User talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 21:32, 28 October 2015 (UTC)

I don't dispute that it's possible to have a low-quality meta-analysis  What's clear is there was consensus that &quot;country of origin&quot;, per se, is not a valid method to identify a low-quality meta-analysis --User:Elvey|Elvey(User talk:Elvey|t‚Ä¢Special:Contribs/Elvey|c) 02:27, 29 October 2015 (UTC)


What does &quot;overriding WP:V and WP:RS&quot; is? It seems to mean that MEDRS is wrong and that MEDRS overrides WP:V and WP:RS to exclude sources that meet WP:V and WP:RS Therefore, http://journalsplosorg/plosmedicine/article?id=101371/journalpmed0020409 country of origin such as from China are good even if they are poor quality and bias User:QuackGuru|QuackGuru (User talk:QuackGuru|talk) 21:51, 28 October 2015 (UTC)

You didn't respond to my comment about your extreme, odd interpretation of what I said  I feel grossly misrepresented, and an apology would certainly have been welcome  &quot;We cannot override WP:V or WP:RS&quot; means just that  Surely none of you dispute that &quot;We cannot override WP:V or WP:RS&quot;  There was consensus that &quot;country of origin&quot;, per se, is not a valid reason to reject a source   I claim neither WP:V nor WP:RS contain any sentence consistent with allowing &quot;country of origin&quot;, per se, as a valid reason to reject a source  

Again: You need to drop the stick  Insisting my close not clear by misrepresenting what I said with an extreme, odd interpretation is not going to fly, and you've just done that for the second time in this section, this time by claiming I've said MEDRS is wrong  STOP  It's disruptive and uncivil  I said no such thing  Not liking the close is not a valid reason to reopen it  I don't see any clarification request that hasn't been adequately addressed by AlbinoFerret or myself  Re-closing  --User:Elvey|Elvey(User talk:Elvey|t‚Ä¢Special:Contribs/Elvey|c) 02:27, 29 October 2015 (UTC)
No, you haven't answered my question  There are two basic ways to approach this  Either your comment about overriding WP:V and WP:RS is:
 pointless blather, with just as much relevance as you saying &quot;Don't kick puppies&quot; or &quot;Be nice to your neighbors&quot; in the middle of this (in which case, you should just remove it), or
 you actually meant to communicate something relevant, that editors need to know and understand (in which case, you need to explain what you meant, because everybody's confused)  
The obvious assumption is that you meant what you said  What you said seems to be that (when relevant/appropriate/etc) editors should not take notice of published academic research that says (for example) Soviet psychiatric research is a bunch of garbage (and garbage because it came out of a country that had difficulties with the concept of apolitical science), because you believe that doing so would be based on &quot;country of origin&quot; and that discarding sources on the grounds of country of origin somehow override WP:V and WP:RS  
Is that what you meant?  User:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (User talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 03:24, 29 October 2015 (UTC)
I'm not sure what Elvey meant, but I know some editors here have already exhausted this editor (a volunteer, as we all are) with complaints, so I'm willing to take a stab at it from my reading of Elvey's close Documented issues with poor science conducted by a particular piece of research are a valid reason to exclude that individual piece of research because it doesn't meet the barometer of a high-quality source, per WP:V and WP:RS anyway Excluding such research, however, because it is Russian or Soviet and they had scientific issues and therefore it all must be garbage science, is not an appropriate reason for rejecting it In other words, what are the reasons that individual piece of research is invalid? And if it is documented invalid, it isn't high quality anyway Funding sources have a well documented history of much worse; Elvey mentioned in their close that country of origin wasn't worse than funding, per consensus (since nobody seemed to tackle that question I raised) User:LesVegas|LesVegas (User talk:LesVegas|talk) 19:38, 29 October 2015 (UTC)
This was the previous proposal: &quot;While country of origin per se is not a suitable reason to reject a source, it is appropriate to consider in cases where reliable sources have identified systematic problems in the medical literature associated with specific regions or countries&quot;
It is known that there is publication bias from http://journalsplosorg/plosmedicine/article?id=101371/journalpmed0020409 Chinese journals We cannot claim &quot;country of origin&quot; is not a problem given the evidence User:QuackGuru|QuackGuru (User talk:QuackGuru|talk) 20:24, 29 October 2015 (UTC)
That's a 2005 source, and it does illustrate publication bias in some fields For those fields it notes, it may apply to Chinese sources published prior to 2005 User:LesVegas|LesVegas (User talk:LesVegas|talk) 23:00, 29 October 2015 (UTC)
User:LesVegas|LesVegas, your reply does not address my question at all  So far as I can tell, there is nothing in WP:V or WP:RS that requires us to accept sources that have characteristics which editors deem suspicious  However, it leads me to a question for you:  Imagine that (it's 1985 and) you are looking at a source produced by the well-documented mess that was Soviet psychiatry on the question of people with schizophrenia who claim to be political prisoners  Do you think that specific source could be excluded:
(a) because it was produced by the Soviet psychiatric system, which is an extraordinarily well-documented disaster (and therefore the odds are very high that it, too, is bad) or 
(b) only if that individual source were called out, by name, in another reliable source, as an example of bad research?
Another way to put this:  If a source was produced by a Soviet psychiatric institution, is it &quot;tarred with the same brush&quot; as the rest of the field, or &quot;innocent until proven individually guilty&quot; of politically manipulated science?  User:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (User talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 00:39, 30 October 2015 (UTC)
 User:WhatamIdoing, you're right in that WP:V and WP:RS don't require us to use sources from countries with issues, but they also don't require us to exclude them on that basis These policies simply tell us what a high quality source is and what it is not The way I read the close is based on the content of the RfC expressed over and over again, which is we have our rubrics for determining what a reliable source is That's the WP:V and RS part So we use WP:V and WP:RS to determine if it is a high quality source These rubrics do not allow us to exclude sources that meet WP:RS standards because of their country of origin, much as they don't allow us to reject sources because of industry funding issues And the way I see it, the issues with the Soviet disaster likely produced journals that wouldn't meet MEDRS standards anyway, certainly being called out by reliable sources If this occurred today, you would undoubtedly find a slew of journals being slammed by academia for problems Having occurred so long ago, I'm sure there's some, but the point is moot because those journals are so old they wouldn't be reliable sources anyway per WP:MEDDATE User:LesVegas|LesVegas (User talk:LesVegas|talk) 19:06, 30 October 2015 (UTC)
I think your going to have to clarify your thought process here - I can't tell how your different statements are related And neither RS nor MEDRS are about finding high quality sources, they're about finding acceptable quality sources for Wikipedia, with MEDRS focusing on medicine User:CFCF|CFCFUser talk:CFCF| üíå Special:EmailUser/CFCF|üìß 19:23, 30 October 2015 (UTC)
MEDRS is WP:RS but specific to medical claims We don't use low quality sources What other statements do you not understand? User:LesVegas|LesVegas (User talk:LesVegas|talk) 19:38, 30 October 2015 (UTC)
 the clarification that I asked you about is from an earlier discussion, that some want to add a loophole to the &quot;country of origin&quot; by stating it still can be considered with language like this as a note &quot;it is appropriate to consider in cases where reliable sources have identified systematic problems in the medical literature associated with specific regions or countries&quot; saying that the last paragraph of your close says that Is this what you wrote in that last paragraph of the close?

Reread Albino's comment  To what end do you seek clarification, and of what?  Clarification answers, AGAIN: &quot;We cannot override WP:V or WP:RS&quot; means just that Surely none of you dispute that &quot;We cannot override WP:V or WP:RS&quot; There was consensus that &quot;country of origin&quot;, per se, is not a valid reason to reject a source I claim neither WP:V nor WP:RS contain any sentence consistent with allowing &quot;country of origin&quot;, per se, as a valid reason to reject a source  No, I did not say that  There is no caveat in the close; just a clarification   --User:Elvey|Elvey(User talk:Elvey|t‚Ä¢Special:Contribs/Elvey|c) 02:37, 31 October 2015 (UTC)

Phrasing
We're having significant issues implementing the result of the RfC, in part because it was ill-formed, and in part because it had a very unclear close I think the situation demands more discussion in order to sort out the proper phrasing Before staring a new RfC or anything similar I think we should tally our suggestions: 

This is the last suggestion: 


I think the major issue with this is bloat ‚Äì we're basically wasting time explaining the obvious here Is it needed at all, and why not forgo it entirely? Since country of origin pew say has never been proposed to be a reason to exclude sources, why should we waste valuable space when it's going to need such a lengthy explanation that the clause really it doesn't mean anything at all?

The wording is ambiguous It does not improve or clarify anything User:QuackGuru|QuackGuru (User talk:QuackGuru|talk) 01:42, 31 October 2015 (UTC)
All this talk about country of origin is misguided because it does not matter what this guideline says‚Äîif there is a reason to consider country of origin when assessing the reliabity of a particular source for verification of particular text, the country will be considered A guideline cannot prohibit common sense Naturally anyone saying &quot;that source has to be rejected because it came from China&quot; can be ignored, but there may well be reason to be cautious about some types of research which a guideline cannot rule out User:Johnuniq|Johnuniq (User talk:Johnuniq|talk) 02:36, 31 October 2015 (UTC)

This is insane  I asked what clarification question was given no answer, but got no reply  Archiving --User:Elvey|Elvey(User talk:Elvey|t‚Ä¢Special:Contribs/Elvey|c) 02:37, 31 October 2015 (UTC)</segment>
