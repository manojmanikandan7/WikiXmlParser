Here is a draft replacement for the sections , , and . It attempts to take all the above discussion into account. It's a bit rushed and wordy, and could stand some improvement, but I thought I'd get it out the door sooner rather than later. Comments are welcome in #Comments on Draft replacement for Periodicals, Books, Online below.  () 00:59, 21 October 2008 (UTC)

Sections of draft replacement

Each of the sections of the draft replacement are intended to be top-level sections in . They are 3rd-level sections here, so that it's nested properly in the talk page.  () 00:59, 21 October 2008 (UTC)

Search

Search engines are commonly used to find biomedical sources. Each engine has quirks, advantages, and disadvantages, and may not return the results that you need unless used carefully. It typically takes experience and practice to recognize when a search has not been effective; even if you find useful sources, you may have missed other sources that would have been more useful, or you may generate pages and pages of less-than-useful material. A good strategy for avoiding sole reliance on search engines is to find a few recent high-quality sources and follow their citations to see what your search engine missed. It can also be helpful to perform a plain web search rather than one of scholarly articles only.

Pubmed is an excellent starting point for locating peer-reviewed medical sources. It offers a free search engine for accessing the MEDLINE database of biomedical research articles offered by the National Library of Medicine at the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Although PubMed is a comprehensive database, many of its indexed journals restrict online access; an additional site, PubMed Central, provides free access to full text. There are basic and advanced options for searching PubMed. Clicking on the &quot;Review&quot; tab will help you narrow your search to reviews. The &quot;Limits&quot; tab can let you further limit your search, for example, to meta-analyses or to freely-readable sources.

Other useful search engines include:

*The Cochrane Library contains a database of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and is a key resource in evidence-based medicine. Its reviews are generally considered to be of very high quality.

*Google Scholar covers all scholarly sources. It is useful not only as a sanity check for Pubmed searches, but also to cover topics outside Pubmed's core purview, such as the sociological or cultural aspects of medicine.

*Google Books can also be quite useful for medical searches: it can let readers peek at a few sentences in books even when full access is not granted, and can help editors find reliable sources quickly, either by looking at the book's references or by citing the book itself.

*EMBASE is a high-quality index that often generates better results than Pubmed. Unfortunately, it is proprietary and requires a subscription.

*CINAHL is a proprietary index on nursing and allied health care.

Accessing sources

A Wikipedia article should cite the best and most-reliable sources regardless of whether they require a fee or a subscription. When all else is equal, it is better to cite a source whose full text is freely readable, so that your readers can follow the link to the source. Some high-quality journals, such as JAMA, publish a few freely-readable articles even though most are not free. A few high-quality journals, such as PLoS Medicine, publish only freely-readable sources. Also, a few sources are in the public domain; these include many U.S. government publications, such as the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

When searching for sources, it is wise to skim-read everything available, including abstracts of papers you can't fully access, and use that to get a feel for what reliable sources are saying. However, when it comes to actually writing a Wikipedia article, it is generally not a good idea to cite a source after reading only its abstract, as the abstract necessarily presents a stripped-down version of the conclusions and omits the background that can be crucial for understanding exactly what the source says. You may need to visit a medical library to access the full text, or ask somebody at the  to either provide you with a copy or read the source for you and summarize what it says; if neither is possible, you may need to settle for using a lower-impact source or even just an abstract.

Citations as documentation

Citations should document precisely how to access sources. Normally, medical citations should contain a Pubmed identifier (PMID). It is good practice to also supply a digital object identifier (DOI) if available. A common practice is to supply a uniform resource locator (URL) to a source if and only if its full text is freely readable. If the  template is used, all this information can be supplied with the &quot;pmid=&quot;, &quot;doi=&quot;, and &quot;url=&quot; parameters, respectively. It is also helpful to mention whether a source is also available on Pubmed Central; with  this can be done with the &quot;pmc=&quot; parameter. For example:
 
produces this:
 
If a source is available in both HTML and some other form, normally the HTML form should be cited, as it is the most likely to work on a wide variety of browers.

Biomedical journals

As mentioned above, the biomedical literature contains two major types of sources: primary publications describe novel research for the first time, and review articles summarize and integrate a topic of research into an overall view. In medicine, primary sources include clinical trials, which test new treatments; secondary sources include meta-analyses that bring together the results from many clinical trials and attempt to arrive at an overall view of how well a treatment works. It is usually best to use reviews and meta-analyses where possible, as these give a balanced and general perspective of a topic, and are usually easier to understand!

Peer-reviewed medical journals are a natural choice as a source for up-to-date information for medical articles. They contain a mixture of primary and secondary sources, as well as less technical material such as biographies. Although almost all such material will count as a reliable source, not all the material is equally useful. Journal articles come in many types: original research, reviews, editorials, book reviews, correspondence, biographies and eulogies. Research papers are  primary sources; although they normally contain previous-work sections that are secondary sources, these sections are typically less reliable than reviews. A general narrative review of a subject by an expert in the field makes a good secondary source that can be used to cover various aspects of a subject within a Wikipedia article. Such reviews typically contain no original research but can make interpretations and draw conclusions from primary sources that no Wikipedia editor would be allowed to do. A systematic review uses a reproducible methodology to select primary studies meeting an explicit criteria in order to answer a specific question. Such reviews should be more reliable, accurate and less prone to bias than a narrative review. However, a systematic review's focus on answering one question limits its usage as a source on Wikipedia.

The 2003 Brandon/Hill selected list includes 141 journals suitable for a small medical library. Although this list is no longer maintained, the listed journals are of high quality. The core general medical journals include the New England Journal of Medicine, The Lancet, Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), Annals of Internal Medicine, British Medical Journal (BMJ), and Canadian Medical Association Journal. Core basic science and biology journals include Science, Cell, and Nature.

Medical textbooks published by the academic press are excellent secondary sources. Ensure the book is up-to-date, unless a historical perspective is required. Doody's maintains a list of core health sciences books, which is available only to subscribers.

Popular press

The popular press is generally not a reliable source for science and medicine information in articles. Most news articles fail to discuss important issues such as evidence quality, costs, and risks versus benefits. Articles in newspapers and popular magazines generally lack the context to judge experimental results. They tend to overemphasize the certainty of any result, for instance presenting a new experimental medicine as the &quot;discovery of the cure&quot; of a disease, or an every-day substance as the &quot;cause&quot; of some dreaded disease. Newspapers and magazines frequently publish articles about scientific results before those results have been peer-reviewed or reproduced by other experimenters. Such articles may be based uncritically on a press release, which can be a biased source. They also tend neither to report adequately on the scientific methodology and the experimental error, nor to express risk in meaningful terms.

A news article should not be used as a sole source for a medical fact or figure. Editors are encouraged to seek out the scholarly research behind the news story. One possibility is to cite a higher-quality source along with a more-accessible popular source, for example with the &quot;laysummary=&quot; parameter of .

On the other hand, the high-quality popular press can be a good source for social, biographical, current-affairs and historical information in a medical article. For example, popular science magazines such as New Scientist and Scientific American are not peer reviewed but sometimes feature articles that explain medical subjects in plain English. As the quality of press coverage of medicine ranges from excellent to irresponsible, common sense and the general guidelines presented in the  and  should be considered in determining whether a popular press source is suitable for these purposes.

Popular science and medicine books are usually tertiary sources, but there are exceptions. Self-published or books published by vanity presses are generally not subject to any form of independent fact-checking or peer review and may not be .

I have not been involved and have added some comments similar to those above.--[[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 21:51, 24 March 2009 (UTC)
Popular press accuracy

(This follows up on the #Medicine and the popular press thread above, which was getting a bit long.)

Above, TimVickers suggested inserting this text somewhere:
Although some articles in the popular press are accurate, many others are inadequate, misleading, or even completely wrong.
I have a few ideas for making the proposal more concrete and better-supported by the cited source, Dentzer 2009 (). I just now reread the above thread and Dentzer, and with all this in mind, I suggest that in , we make the following change (deletions struck out, insertions italicized, and changing the preceding comma to a period):
and Although medical news articles often deliver public health messages effectively, they too often convey wrong or misleading information about health care, partly when reporters do not know or cannot convey the results of clinical studies, and partly when they fail to supply reasonable context.[]
This captures Dentzer's thrust more accurately (albeit at more length), and mentions a positive thing she has to say about the news, which seems to be the main point of contention here.
 () 18:47, 27 March 2009 (UTC)
I'm concerned we are placing too much emphasis on trying to work out and reproduce the opinions and words of one author in one paper, which is an opinion piece, not a product of research. The article is not just concerned with accurate reporting (though she does give examples of misleading or incorrect reporting) but whether the underlying health message is being conveyed successfully. The wrong message may be conveyed even if the reporting of the &quot;new&quot; story is accurate, because it is incompletely described, or is not placed in context with other research or health concerns. The statement that &quot;Often these [public health] messages are delivered effectively&quot; is actually the least convincing opinion in the article and she cites no research to back it up. Perhaps nobody questioned that the word &quot;effectively&quot; means &quot;to have an effect&quot;. Public health messages are largely ineffective, and I'm sure there's lots of research on the subject. Indeed, newspapers are guilty of effectively spreading anti-health messages such as those from the anti-vaccination lobby, or over-simplistic messages such as the antioxidant theory encouraging the consumption of red wine, or waste-of-time-and-money messages such as the high coverage of many CAM &quot;therapies&quot;. We must also remember that &quot;medical news articles&quot; with the highest readership are found in glossy women's magazines, tabloids, and television news. The author of that paper, along with the folk on this talk page, probably read a better quality of news than average. ° 20:06, 27 March 2009 (UTC)

Colin, I agree that we are placing too much emphasis on the Dentzer piece which you correctly point out is an opnion piece, not supported by data or research. If you want peer-reviewed research supported by data, you can follow the links on Schwitzer's web site.  () 20:52, 27 March 2009 (UTC)

Eubulides, I read an article in the BMJ about doctors who murder patients, which cited several examples. 

Would you agree that doctors all too frequently murder patients?  () 20:54, 27 March 2009 (UTC)

I don't know about Eubulides, but I would not agree with the statement &quot;doctors all too frequently murder patients&quot;. What a ridiculous example. Nbauman, you are seriously in danger of self-highlighting the sort of misunderstanding and misreporting of statistics that we are criticising journalists for. It is a cliché that &quot;one avoidable death is a death too many&quot;, but fortunately the world doesn't get paralysed while we wrap it in cotton wool.  ° 21:34, 27 March 2009 (UTC)

A recent change gave reporter inexperience as the reason for poor medical stories, claiming the cited article excluded &quot;seasoned reporters&quot;. It does nothing of the sort. That is a logical error like saying that &quot;weekdays are dry&quot; based on a source that says &quot;often weekends are ruined by rain&quot;. ° 21:18, 27 March 2009 (UTC)

Nbauman - stop edit warring. You were bold. It got reverted. Now discuss. Your reinsertion of text which is neither supported by the cited article nor supported by consensus of WP editors is extremely bad form. I strongly encourage you to have the decently to self-revert and engage in consensus seeking here before making contentious changes. ° 21:37, 27 March 2009 (UTC)  does not apply outside of article space, and you yourself regard it merely as an &quot;opnion piece, not supported by data or research&quot;. ° 21:39, 27 March 2009 (UTC)

Colin, did you read Dentzer's article before making that change? She says: 

Often these messages are delivered effectively by seasoned [experienced] reporters who perform thoughtfully even in the face of breaking news and tight deadlines. But all too frequently, what is conveyed about health news by many other journalists is wrong or misleading. 

We agreed that &quot;seasoned&quot; means &quot;experienced.&quot; 

So Dentzer said that &quot;other journalists&quot; are wrong or misleading, not experienced journalists.  () 21:44, 27 March 2009 (UTC)
Four statements: [1] There exist seasoned reporters who have delivered messages effectively. [2] There exist other journalists who have conveyed wrong or misleading information. [3] Wrong and misleading information is conveyed by inexperienced journalists. [4] Wrong and misleading information is not conveyed by experienced journalists.  1+2 implies neither 3 nor 4. Please go read up on logic before suggesting I didn't even read the article. ° 23:24, 27 March 2009 (UTC)

Colin, please go back and re-read the word &quot;other.&quot;  () 03:03, 28 March 2009 (UTC)

&quot;Other&quot; means &quot;those journalists not in the first set&quot;. The first set is defined as &quot;seasoned reporters who have delivered messages effectively&quot;. The first set is not defined as &quot;all seasoned reporters&quot;. For that, the author would have had to write &quot;Seasoned reporters deliver health messages effectively.&quot; You are seeing (because you want to) an implication that strictly isn't there. However, I suspect Dentzer didn't worry about whether her statement would be logically analysed or mined for implications, because as I pointed out earlier, her use of the word &quot;effectively&quot; is careless. ° 10:44, 28 March 2009 (UTC)

 I strongly disagree with the recent change &quot;news articles too often can convey wrong or misleading information about health care particularly when they are written by by inexperienced reporters&quot;. Not only is it ungrammatical, it focuses on what is a secondary topic of Dentzer's article (lack of training) and misses her main point (lack of context in news articles). Also, it removes a &quot;too often&quot; that is an important point in Dentzer, and should be a point here. I agree with both Colin and Nbauman that this thread is focusing too much on Dentzer and too little on what the guideline should say. I frankly am dismayed by Nbauman's debate tactics on this talk page; they are not conducive to collaboration. Let's work out a change on the talk page first, and not edit-war the project page.  () 21:57, 27 March 2009 (UTC)
Perhaps more importantly, this is not a mainspace article on Role of popular press in health care.  This page is advice from Wikipedia editors to other Wikipedia editors.  We don't need sources to &quot;prove&quot; that our advice is to use high-quality secondary scientific sources for statements of scientific fact, and we don't need to split hairs over the ideally and comprehensively neutral way to represent one person's published opinions.  
There is no consensus for change.  Nbauman remains offended that we're not showing enough respect to his favorite colleagues, and will probably always remain offended by our supposed scientism.  None of the other involved editors want to lower our standard to accommodate his POV.  I think we need to  at this point.   () 22:56, 27 March 2009 (UTC)

Agree completely.  Scientific journals are the best source.  This type of question can be decided by a vote if needed.--[[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 22:59, 27 March 2009 (UTC)

Vitamin E
* An interesting example of a recent popular press distortion comes in the form of NYTimes recent coverage of vitamin E. For example, they painted a misleading picture of the aftermath of the SELECT trial [http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/28/disappointing-news-on-vitamin-e-and-selenium/] (which our selenium article reflects fixed). Much better commentary appears in Gann's accompanying editorial on the SELECT trial [http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/301/1/102] or in the article's discussion itself [http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/301/1/39]. The most striking difference is that while earlier trials were focused on selenium-deficient people, the SELECT men were high in selenium. Selenium is toxic at higher doses. Big surprise. Similarly, NYTimes recently highlighted the &quot;increased mortality&quot; from vitamin E in an article titled &quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/24/health/24brod.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=vitamin%20E&amp;st=cse Extra Vitamin E: No Benefit, Maybe Harm]&quot;. As I pointed out in my [http://community.nytimes.com/article/comments/2009/03/24/health/24brod.html my comment], they hardly emphasize that the increased mortality occurred only at 400+ IU (27 times the RDA) and excluded the fact that at a meta-analysis found a non-statistically significant reduction in deaths at 100 IU. They also excluded the fact that meta-analysis was hesitant to generalize this to the non-elderly population. What they also don't mention is that, according to the latest NHANES, 90% of Americans don't get the RDA of 15 IU. From that perspective, basic vitamin E supplementation looks prudent, and indeed the ATBC trial found benefits for those with higher serum levels. Despite the issues with NYTimes coverage, it was added to the orthomolecular medicine article by experienced medicine editor MastCell [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Orthomolecular_medicine&amp;diff=279464189&amp;oldid=279461721]. Although I pointed out the problems in E's coverage at that article's talk page, no one seems interested in providing a neutral overview of poor E. [[User:ImperfectlyInformed|II]] | ( - ) 23:35, 27 March 2009 (UTC)
**I'd rather not discuss specific content issues here, especially when they're as historically intractable as vitamin supplementation. From the perspective of , you're actually dismissing the New York Times article far too hastily. In fact, it does note that the excess mortality was seen with high doses. An entire subsection of the Times article is entitled &quot;Too Much of a Good Thing&quot;, and states:Recent studies have even suggested that at the high doses many people consume, vitamin E could be hazardous. In November 2004, the American Heart Association warned that while the small amounts of vitamin E found in multivitamins and foods were not harmful, taking 400 International Units a day or more could increase the risk of death. ([http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/24/health/24brod.html])That's followed by a fairly detailed breakdown of recent studies on the subject. So I think the Times piece is actually an example of responsible mainstream-media reporting, which is one reason I cited it. Another reason is that the citation occurred in orthomolecular medicine, which specifically involves very large doses of vitamins and where the potential harms of such megadoses are relevant.I can't fault the Times for &quot;excluding&quot; a non-significant finding - I'd be more inclined to praise them for doing so. And the Times piece reaches the same conclusion as Gann's (excellent) editorial: Vitamin E pills aren't a magic bullet.   00:40, 28 March 2009 (UTC)
*Dentzer's point is that &quot;when journalists ignore complexities or fail to provide context, the public health messages they convey are inevitably inadequate or distorted&quot;. That's exactly what happened there, when the average vitamin E intake is around 7 mg/day [http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/content/full/136/4/1021]; the ATBC study (not covered) found benefits for moderate supplementation, and the meta-analysis found that &quot;low-dose&quot; vitamin E (still several times above the RDA) reduced deaths; the probability that it was due to chance was 20% -- not stat. significant, but not worth discarding either. Based on the literature, the article could also have reasonably been titled: &quot;Extra vitamin E: Good in moderation&quot;. It was quite easy to come away from that article thinking that vitamin E is scary and dangerous. Further, the results of the meta-analysis were challenged [http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/81/4/736?ijkey=46a05d7ed0a5df5a2fdab71c5b00526a42dddce0]; anyway, to get back on topic, I actually think Dentzer is being somewhat selectively cited, but the section is fine overall. One thing to keep in mind is that papers can sometimes be extremely technical; in those cases a lay summary is necessary. As far as OMM, I'm disappointed you didn't notice the major problems in the vitamin E section (not the least the statement that &quot;initial hopes for OMM were based on observational studies&quot; -- implying that mainstream, rather than OMM fringe, was responsible for the RCTs), and hopefully you'll comment the next time I bring it up. By the way, looking at Gann again, I'm not so impressed by the way he attributes the results of earlier studies to chance when they were clearly different populations. [[User:ImperfectlyInformed|II]] | ( - ) 07:10, 28 March 2009 (UTC)
* Agree with MastCell that this thread on Vitamin E doesn't belong here; presumably it belongs in .  () 16:38, 28 March 2009 (UTC)

Scientific evidence for guideline

WhatamIdoing, you've got it exactly backwards. I have always been a strong critic of medical journalism, and I agree with most of Schwitzer's work because Schwitzer is based on evidence. Much medical reporting is terrible. I don't know if &quot;most&quot; of it is terrible, but I'll go with the evidence. 

I'm flattered when I see articles like Dentzer's, because I'm one of those experienced journalists she talks about. I write for doctors, my work is edited and reviewed by doctors, and if I didn't get the story right in every respect, my work would be tossed out pretty fast. 

My difference with you and the other editors here is that I believe that evaluations and criticisms of medical journalism should be based on the same kind of scientific evidence that we use in medicine and elsewhere in science. That's what I'm offended at -- your abuse of science and contempt for scientific method. You're not using high-quality secondary scientific sources at all. 

You're making wild claims about journalism based not on scientific evidence, like Schwitzer's work, but on your own personal prejudices. I won't speculate on the psychological roots of those prejudices, but you can't support your broad overstatements with facts. 

You cherry-pick articles like Dentzer's to find excerpts that you think support your position, and quote them selectively and misleadingly, even though you misunderstand the whole essay. 

I've seen something similar, where alternative medicine advocates will pick out excerpts of medical articles to support their argument that all doctors and all drug companies are harming people. 

Your basic fallacy is to condemn all journalism in the popular press, when the scientific data displays a much more interesting pattern: some of the popular press is accurate and some is not. So you're really missing the point. 

It's paricularly ironic that you claim to be supporting &quot;high-quality secondary scientific sources&quot;, when you're doing exactly the opposite. Except for Schwitzer, your entire guideline is based on personal opinion and personal prejudice and ignores those sources.  () 23:45, 27 March 2009 (UTC)

* I dunno, are any of the other Wikipedia guidelines or policies rigorously supported by scientific evidence? Although the scientific method is quite useful for resolving scientific disputes, one can't use it for everything.
* Hmm, come to think of it, shouldn't any effort to document (and perhaps even scientifically support) medical journalism be put into mainspace? I just now created the stub Medical journalism to do that. I get the feeling that if even 10% of the effort expended on this thread had been put into Medical journalism we might have a useful article there by now. (And no, that's not a scientific estimate....)

A secondary source dilema

Here is a dilema that I have noticed particularly with books. Whilst it is for obvious reasons preferable to use secondary sources wherever possible, is this always the case? One scenario I saw was when reading a high quality secondary source in a book which is widely used especially by medical students where it stated that benzodiazepines are GABA reuptake inhibitors or increase GABA levels for their therapeutic effects which is clearly false as they work at benzodiazepine receptors enhancing the effect of GABA at the GABAa receptor via benzodiazepine receptors. This scenario didn't happen on wikipedia but using it as an example of inaccurate info in books, but something similar happened in the past few days where on the surface seemingly high quality books on psychiatry and psychopharmacology were cited but on closer inspection the authors were employed by literally over 20 pharmaceutical companies and they had cherry picked 2 or 3 primary sources and then distorted the results of the primary sources and reinterpreted them and falsely represented the primary sources without any evidence but their opinion. So what would happen in that scenario? To be clearer though the sections of the books were not doing an extensive review of the literature but were basically touching a little on every aspect of psychiatry and psychopharmacology. So that brings up another question what happens if the secondary source is not doing a meta-analsysis or extensive review of the literature but are simply touching on one aspect of a condition or drug or syndrome etc? Also is a peer reviewed meta-analysis or review superior to a non-peer reviewed book? Is a peer reviewed secondary source published by people with ties to a drug company or some other conflict of interest equal to an independent peer reviewed secondary source? I guess my point and dilema is this. The use of secondary sources are viewed higher on wikipedia because they are seen as being an independent outside opinion but what if the author(s) are not independent and/or they can be shown to be distorting data? My main concern is secondary sources which are not peer reviewed as this area seems to be most open to abuse by those with a conflict of interest. Currently the recommendations is books which are not necessarily peer reviewed and open to abuse, opinion, synthesis, reinterpreting results, distorting facts are declared as &quot;excellent&quot; (secondary) sources. I disagree and think that the problems of books needs to be addressed. There are some good medical books which are high quality don't get me wrong but you see the dilema that I see and problem for misinformation getting inserted into articles. I think peer reviewed secondary sources trump non peer reviewed secondary sources and that many (but not all) books in general are not excellent sources of reliable citeable data. Infact I think primary sources are quite often superior to many books depending on the subject matter being quoted for reasons that I have just explained.--[[User:Literaturegeek|Literaturegeek]] | [[User_talk:Literaturegeek |T@1k?]] 23:32, 1 April 2009 (UTC)

I have striked out some of my text as on closer inspection I see that you differentiate between non-reliable medical books and reliable trusted publications, but still have some concerns mentioned above.--[[User:Literaturegeek|Literaturegeek]] | [[User_talk:Literaturegeek |T@1k?]] 15:54, 2 April 2009 (UTC)

 That's kind of a long question, and it sounds like this is really more of a question about a particular case, but in general the answer (I think) is that peer-reviewed sources are generally (although not always) preferred. Conflict of interest is of course an important issue, but in practice almost everybody has a conflict of interest of one form or another, and a review should not be disqualified simply because a reviewer has a conflict of interest.  () 16:45, 2 April 2009 (UTC)

[Edit conflict with Colin, posting at same time] Sorry for length of questions.
[http://books.google.com/books?id=NvT0l6iL5IQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Manual+of+Clinical+Psychopharmacology#PPA405,M1 This was the book] that I was talking about. Would this book be considered superior to an FDA review or Committee on Safety of Medicines review? This book is cited in an article and I have no intention of deleting it so I am not in a conflict with anyone per se. It was just when reading the book and comparing it to their sources I noted how they had distorted or even falsified the conclusions of the sources they were citing. Also they appeared to be giving best practice guidelines based on taking one or two primary sources out of context and also synthesising without any evidence in conflict. I guess I noticed a potential occasional serious problem with using books over more reliable peer reviewed secondary sources. Then of course the above example I mentioned where a trusted book source got the mechanism of benzodiazepines completely wrong is another example. I am not against using books and more often than not they do make good sources to quote and infact I used one today myself. I guess I am asking does a secondary peer reviewed meta-analysis or review source trump this example of a book? Or does FDA review or CSM review or department of health guidelines trump it?--[[User:Literaturegeek|Literaturegeek]] | [[User_talk:Literaturegeek |T@1k?]] 17:56, 2 April 2009 (UTC)

Don't overplay the &quot;independent&quot; aspect of secondary sources. The aspects of secondary sources we like are that they are written by experts and they have undergone some form of expert review (peer or editorial). When wikipedians choose primary sources we end up with the selection &amp; analysis of those primary sources done by nobodies, with no reputations to uphold, and (often) no serious review. So I find your concern about bias in the secondary-source authors to be a red-herring -- there is bias in the primary sources and there most certainly is often bias among wikipedians (which is undeclared, whereas conflicts-of-interest are declared in some sources).  A medical book published by a serious publisher will have undergone some form of review. If you have found mistakes in a student textbook, perhaps you should contact the publishers. ° 17:51, 2 April 2009 (UTC)

Colin, I think perhaps you misinterpreted me or perhaps it is my fault in how I worded the issue. I was not in anyway shape or form saying that primary sources are superior to secondary sources. I was raising an occasional isolated problem of what happens basically if a secondary source says something which is nonsense. For example should we change the mechanism of action of benzos to say they are reuptake inhibitors because a good quality book made a mistake? Or in such a scenario would a peer reviewed secondary source trump it so we can add accurate data? What happens if the book is demonstratly misrepresenting their sources etc. I was talking about isolated examples. These examples didn't happen in real life on wikipedia but I just noticed a potential from spotting several inaccuracies and thought that I would raise it. I have noticed this is less problematic in the peer reviewed literature especially secondary sources which have been published in medical journals. The inaccuracies I have spotted in sources (particularly books which often briefly skim a topic) are not necessarily POV issues but just a matter of an inaccurate factoids. Another one I have noticed is flunitrazepam is short acting when it is long acting.--[[User:Literaturegeek|Literaturegeek]] | [[User_talk:Literaturegeek |T@1k?]] 18:03, 2 April 2009 (UTC)

* One of the reasons that  strongly opposed the emphasis on reviews was that, in his words (if I recall correctly), they are often &quot;written by pharmaceutical hacks&quot;. These days the tide has begun to turn and, if you look hard enough, you can find unbiased information, as evidenced by the recent Cochrane review on St. John's wort () and the recent review on the NEJM on publication bias in antidepressants [http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/358/3/252]. Sources without conflicts of interest should be preferred in my mind, or at the least included, and we should probably have a section on it in this guideline. [[User:ImperfectlyInformed|II]] | ( - ) 18:41, 2 April 2009 (UTC)
This guideline covers the whole of medicine. Drugs and the pro/anti-pharma controversy is really a small part. Folk get worked up about conflicts of interest and bias when much of what we should be writing about on WP, and pushing towards FA, is bread-and-butter non-controversial medicine. We must always bear this in mind when giving and suggesting changes to guidance on sources. Much of research is done and reviewed by honest folk earnestly trying to work out why we get ill and how to fix it. It is just a little wearying to keep hearing that secondary sources are full of bias, written by hacks in the pay of 20 pharmaceutical companies, and that if you'll only let me choose, weigh and interpret the primary sources instead, then I'd do a better job... ° 19:10, 2 April 2009 (UTC)

Speaking of misrepresenting primary sources, you appear again to be misrepresented me. I never said nor implied that I should resynthesise an authors opinion. I was asking what do we do in that scenario? Do we accept the demonstrately intentional or unintentional inaccurate factoids or opinions of a book which often briefly touched on one aspect of medicine,,, or does a peer reviewed secondary source such as a meta-anaylis or review or FDA, department of health etc etc trump it? I came here just to ask for guidance on what to do. Initially I misread the book guidelines on this project and striked out my text above but still wanted some guidance or discussion on what to do in these isolated scenarios I have mentioned. Instead I appear to be getting responses trivialising and mocking me as an idiot by distorting what I was saying and asking.--[[User:Literaturegeek|Literaturegeek]] | [[User_talk:Literaturegeek |T@1k?]] 19:28, 2 April 2009 (UTC)

Secondary sources are usually more reliable than primary sources. The fact that a handful are not just means that you should, in these cases, use several secondary sources to give a broad view of the range of opinions on the matter. What is not appropriate is for us to use primary sources to cast doubt on the conclusions of secondary sources - that is original research.  () 19:15, 2 April 2009 (UTC)

Thank you Tim this is what I was asking for, some guidance. Could you also give me your opinion on whether official national reviews by say the FDA or Department of Health, meta-analyis or review in a journal would be superior to a book? What happens if a book says for example SSRIs work by stimulating the release of serotonin when the truth is they block its reuptake or something like that? Do we delete the book ref and replace it with a more accurate secondary source? Or do we leave the mistake of the book in even though we know that it is false? I guess I would like this project to state whether reviews or meta-analysises (secondary sources) in medical journals are superior to a (secondary source) book if content is in dispute.--[[User:Literaturegeek|Literaturegeek]] | [[User_talk:Literaturegeek |T@1k?]] 19:28, 2 April 2009 (UTC)

Any source that is rather general and broad (such as a student textbook) is likely to be inferior to a more specific book or paper. It may well have attempted to condense a complex subject with a simple explanation that is in fact wrong. This may be the case for your benzo textbook. A specialist book aimed at medical professionals would be a better source, as would a relevant secondary article such as those you mention. Where you have several sources in disagreement then it may be relevant to note the disagreement among professionals within the article (as Tim suggests) or you could post a query on the article talk page or WP:MED talk page and ask for the opinions of others. You may find someone has access to a better definitive source. ° 19:51, 2 April 2009 (UTC)

Just to clarify it wasn't a &quot;benzo book&quot;, but a clinical psychopharmacology text book (see above) and also another medical text book. Anyway like I said the inaccurate data wasn't cited on wiki so I was raising a potential issue I had noted with isolated books saying inaccurate things eg benzos are reuptake inhibitors or distorting sources.

Ironically I was trying to do the same in my posting and had nothng to gain and the policy actually reads the way I thought it should read but I misread it initially.

Review status

I hope I can raise a query here without offending! But regarding the determination of 'review ' status for a paper, does listing as a review by the NIH generally differentiate it. To fit the criteria, Ideal sources for these articles include general or systematic reviews in reputable medical journals, Given A secondary source in medicine summarizes one or more primary or secondary sources and that not all reviews particularily narrative type necessarily label themselves as reviews, but the NIH might list them as such? Leaving aside of course arguments about various journals.  () 22:37, 20 May 2009 (UTC)

 PubMed, in my experience, is not 100% reliable in labeling reviews. Occasionally it labels an article as a review when it is not; more often, it fails to label an article a review when it is indeed a review. (If you can't tell whether an article is a review after reading the article, then you probably shouldn't be citing that article; reliable sources are not supposed to be so confusing....)  () 23:29, 20 May 2009 (UTC)

What the author is actually doing matters much more than how some person in the back office happened to code the database.  
I have also found errors in the presentation of articles, including straightforward case reports labeled as &quot;reviews&quot; and things that I thought were good reviews being unlabeled (well, and basically all older reviews aren't tagged as reviews, but you generally shouldn't be using those anyway).  
If you've got a question about a specific, then please feel free to share it with us.   () 05:38, 21 May 2009 (UTC)
Thanks multiple specifics, but in general I have also noticed that some papers say for instance an hypothesis, will on reading be largely a review of the relevant literature with a much smaller expansion of the hypothesis. Such papers are often listed as a review, but may not be tagged such, perhaps they are older as you suggest! I would assume it is safe to cite the review part generally but not necessarily the hypothesis part (unless under an Hypotheses heading). Other papers of course will also contain large reviews within them and I suspect that is why they are coded as review?  When a pubmed search is done for a subject with 'and review' included, these can be the only 'reviews' found, regardless of date, hence the need for clarification.  () 21:25, 21 May 2009 (UTC)
I believe (don't ask for a source) that PubMed classifies &quot;reviews&quot; based on a handful of numerical criteria: reviews have few authors and many citations, and so forth. In other words, PubMed uses a computed algorithm to determine which articles are &quot;reviews&quot;. I've written a couple which are not characterized as such by PubMed - probably I didn't use enough references :) Anyhow, I could be wrong since I can't find a source to support my statements, but I would suggest that editors may be as good or better position to determine which articles are &quot;reviews&quot; than PubMed.   21:31, 21 May 2009 (UTC)
If there is a difficult case, there is always the idea of looking at the journal and seeing where in the issue the article is listed and how the journal describes it.  () 21:53, 21 May 2009 (UTC)
Crazy talk! :P   22:06, 21 May 2009 (UTC)
Thanks again, so it seems it is a matter of the editor reading such sources and deciding which parts can be considered 'review' and which parts should not be so cited !  () 21:11, 22 May 2009 (UTC)
I think that what Tim is saying is that many journals explicitly publish reviews under a heading like &quot;Review Article&quot;. Some journals (e.g. the Expert Opinion series, or Current Opinions) publish only reviews, and say so explicitly. It's not so much a matter of making something up as looking closely at the source yourself.   21:40, 22 May 2009 (UTC)

Science by press release

Is it worth mentioning the {dangerous|idiotic|POV-pushing|your favorite adjective here} practice of citing popular media reports on studies that have not (yet) been published?  This practice isn't very common, but it seems to be most common in things that turn out to be lucrative for the scientist but false later, i.e., Andrew Wakefield's long-delayed publications in the MMR hoax. 

While I think relying on a news article instead of the proper paper is undesirable (and common), &quot;science by unsubstantiated press release&quot; is dramatically worse.    () 17:59, 23 May 2009 (UTC)

 Isn't this already covered?  says:
 &quot;Newspapers and magazines may also publish articles about scientific results before those results have been published in a peer-reviewed journal, or reproduced by other experimenters. Such articles may be based uncritically on a press release, which can be a biased source.&quot;
 If this doesn't state the point sufficiently clearly, what should be added?  () 18:05, 23 May 2009 (UTC)

Apparently, what we need to add is more attention on my part; I didn't see it in my brief skim-over, and it did seem odd that it wasn't there.  Thanks.   () 19:01, 23 May 2009 (UTC)

Second thought:  one possible way to highlight this issue is to expand &quot;Editors are encouraged to seek out the scholarly research behind the news story&quot; to include &quot;and to not use any source for which the scholarly research has not yet been published&quot;.  Also, a link to our article, Science by press conference, might not be out of place.    () 19:04, 23 May 2009 (UTC)

Too far. We should certainly be very wary, especially with controversial subjects, non-mainstream findings, product promotion, etc, but not all medical information is achieved via the scientific method and not all is published in journals. As this is a guideline, we should give advice but not absolute rules. BTW: perhaps Science by press conference should pass  before we link to it? ° 21:14, 23 May 2009 (UTC)
The statement is still just 'encouragement':  &quot;Editors are encouraged to seek out...and to not use...&quot;   () 21:50, 23 May 2009 (UTC)
As a possible citation, I recently saw a journal article which evaluated the content, quality, and accuracy of the material contained in various university-sponsored press releases. Needless to say, it was abysmal. Maybe someone else has this article at hand; if not, I'll track it down. I do tend to agree with Colin; we should discourage the citation of such press releases, but not absolutely forbid it since there are always exceptions and instances where it may be reasonable.   23:04, 23 May 2009 (UTC)

However, it's not in Journal citation Reports, although indexed by Web of Science, it is not in JCR, and has published an article trying to explain why its important anyway.   This is a serious indication that there are problems.  () 04:50, 29 May 2009 (UTC)



I have posted this at the RS/N, but want to make sure the medical matters contained are addressed by readers here. I have concerns about the way a source is being used. The way it is being used is consistent with the way it has been used in internet conspiracy theories regarding the supposed myriad dangers of aspartame, but I believe it grossly misrepresents the nature of the original source. I would appreciate more eyes on the matter. This is a medical and scientific matter, so to some degree  would apply to any interpretation of the scientific matters discussed in the source. The original source seems to bear evidence of being influenced by the fringe conspiracy theories, while fortunately noting the mainstream POV from governmental and medical sources. --  () 04:27, 28 May 2009 (UTC)

Perhaps a mention of major (international?) charities would also be appropriate:  they often have decent statistics and can be accurate sources for statements about whether a treatment is common or only used for refractory cases, etc.   () 15:49, 4 June 2009 (UTC)

 Clearly the CDC website is a reliable source, so I was bold and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reliable_sources_(medicine-related_articles)&amp;diff=294405198&amp;oldid=291953712 added] that to .

I was hoping someone else would have a brilliant idea about how to address that issue.  I've also been thinking about the advantages of &quot;permitting&quot; these websites (as if this really trumped ), but still &quot;recommending&quot; medical textbooks or high-quality reviews.  The hardy folks that deal with fringe topics are not going to be happy to have anything that suggests that www.QuacksRUs.org is a good source for medical information.  Perhaps a restatement of not using websites to debunk the literature would be in order.  () 21:57, 4 June 2009 (UTC)
Statements and information from reputable major medical bodies (CDC, NIH, WHO, Institute of Medicine, etc) should obviously be considered valuable encyclopedic sources. One would hope that  would be sufficient to enable appreciation of that point, but apparently it needs to be codified.Sadly, there is no language that will completely prevent some of our fellow editors from trying to sneak www.associationforsnakeoilstudies.com or rife.org into the encyclopedia under the same aegis as the CDC. I would suggest wording along the lines of &quot;information from reputable major medical and scientific organizations may be a valuable encyclopedic source.&quot; If we reach the point where the words &quot;reputable major scientific organization&quot; have lost their meaning, then it's time to abandon this ship anyway.   22:55, 4 June 2009 (UTC)

I don't see the relevance to this discussion (assuming your comment had some intent beyond scoring cheap points). That journal was not a &quot;reputable major scientific organization&quot;. It was a journal, and an obscure, low-profile one at that. Hopefully our existing guidelines would have led editors to properly weight material from that journal. On the other hand, sometimes shit happens. Wikipedia policies can't prevent real-world misdeeds. If someone had cited articles by Jayson Blair from the Times before his fabrications were revealed, it wouldn't make them a bad editor, just someone who was taken in like everyone else.   03:34, 5 June 2009 (UTC)

Proposed rewording for Websites section
Looking at it another way, the word &quot;Websites&quot; in the section header  is problematic. Whether info is on a website is reasonably independent of how reliable it is. After all, JAMA is a website, and it's generally reliable. Even medical books are now commonly accessed via websites. So I propose the following change, along the lines suggested above (and with some wording shamelessly stolen from MastCell's comments):
* After Books, insert a new section Medical and scientific organizations with the following contents:
 &quot;Statements and information from reputable major medical and scientific bodies may be valuable encyclopedic sources. These bodies include the U.S. National Academies (including the Institute of Medicine and the National Academy of Sciences), the British National Health Service, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), and the World Health Organization. The reliability of these sources range from formal scientific reports, which can be the equal of the best reviews published in medical journals, through public guides and service announcements, which have the advantage of being freely readable but are generally less authoritative than the underlying medical literature.&quot;
* Change the title of Websites to be Other sources, and make the following changes to its contents:
 &quot;Internet websites Press releases, blogs, newsletters, advocacy and self-help publications, and other sources contain a wide range of biomedical information ranging from factual to fraudulent, with a high percentage being of low quality. Peer-reviewed medical websites information resources such as WebMD and UpToDate, along with websites of government health organizations such as the CDC, can be useful guides about the relevant medical literature and how much weight to give different sources; however, as much as possible Wikipedia articles should cite the literature directly.&quot;

Casting it in stone

When considering studies for inclusion in clinical articles, I have usually kept a rule of thumb that phase II trials need to be absolutely earth-shattering to deserve inclusion. Even phase III trials need to be included with caution, because their findings don't necessarily mean that a procedure or substance will ever be used in a widespread fashion.

I was wondering if there was any scope for anchoring this rule of thumb into this guideline. After all, this applies to all medicine articles.  |  18:35, 21 June 2009 (UTC)

It seems you not only keep that rule of thumb, but have already generalized it to all other medical editors in the encyclopedia, as your [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pancreatic_cancer&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=297767901 recent edit summary] shows (&quot;there is longstanding consensus not to include phase II trials unless their results are absolutely earth-shattering&quot;). You probably won't be surprised that I don't share this &quot;consensus&quot;. Considering that consensus means general agreement within a group, and considering how small our group is, even a single disagreement rules out the word consensus. It's interesting that you provided no argument. I think most medical editors would disagree with your opinion. Clinical trials are not common for a fair amount of things. I imagine that many interventions don't even get to Phase III clinical trials. Should we make a rule where we keep out all negative evidence? Suggestive epidemiological and animal evidence can be, and often is, encyclopedic -- so why would actual controlled human data be non-encyclopedic? [[User:ImperfectlyInformed|II]] | ( - ) 19:24, 21 June 2009 (UTC)

Could you please take my post at face value rather than trawling my edit history? Also, please let other editors speak for themselves rather than putting words in anyone's mouth.
A phase II trial is, by its very definition, a small trial in diseased subjects and the first to evaluate for effectiveness. Very large numbers of treatments don't even make it out of the laboratory, and even then a large proportion is not developed further if there are no encouraging results at phase II-III level. It is therefore impossible to say that a treatment is &quot;promising&quot; even if phase II trials are positive, because they may still die before being marketed, let alone implemented widely.
I was referring specifically to clinical articles. I think it would be utterly dangerous if we started listing all agents being trialled currently in Alzheimer's disease, for instance, and create the completely erroneous impression that dementia is a treatable disease. Wikipedia should not be in the business of promoting treatments that have no certain future. I cannot understand how you could actually disagree with this premise.  |  04:17, 22 June 2009 (UTC)

Generally speaking, I think that such a rule could be created and would be widely supported, although I think it would require more than a single sentence to properly explain the limits.  For example, are we talking about this standard as applied to a disease article, or in an article about an investigational new drug?  Is this information under
Treatment
or under
Research directions
?  Are the rules different for rare diseases?  For diseases that currently have no adequate treatments?
Additionally, are we sure that this the right guideline for such a recommendation?
As for the timing:  I think that the vast majority of improvements to Wikipedia's guidelines stem from someone seeing an actual problem.  I'd be unhappy to discover that someone sat around thinking up hypothetical problems to &quot;solve&quot; in the guidelines.  That path leads to needless  and to guidelines that do not address editors' real needs.   () 04:45, 22 June 2009 (UTC)]]

Wikipedia already documents the substances undergoing clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease. The article is called Alzheimer's disease clinical research. In a highly-developed article like Alzheimer's disease, yeah, I can see why you wouldn't mention Phase II clinical trials. In less highly-developed articles like pancreatic cancer, the argument is less convincing. My rule of thumb is that most information can be presented on Wikipedia, although much of it should be presented in subarticles. [[User:ImperfectlyInformed|II]] | ( - ) 05:38, 22 June 2009 (UTC)
Wouldn't it be better to try to educate readers what the ramifications/limitations of the different phases are? Then clearly state that it is a  Phase II  clinical trial. I think that our goal should be to enlighten readers. There are no space limitations, and it would be a mistake to write an article with a 'message' in mind.  () 07:19, 22 June 2009 (UTC)

This is an issue of  rather than an in-or-out global rule. As WhatamIdoing says, rare diseases with no current effective treatment might well warrant the mention of any promising, solid research. I don't see what the pancreatic cancer article being less &quot;highly-developed&quot; has to do with it. WEIGHT is more of a content than a sourcing issue. I'm sure there is more we can say about balancing content wrt medical aspects.  anyone? ° 08:18, 22 June 2009 (UTC)

I think ImperfectlyInformed's reaction illustrates the need for guidance on the inclusion of phase I/II trials. This is not a current major issue but it happens constantly in numerous articles, sometimes driven by media reports and sometimes driven by editors who have read something in a journal and find it highly fascinating and surely worth including. More is not always better; this applies to huge topics such as Alzheimer's but I can't see why pancreatic cancer (which receives a fair bit of research attention) doesn't fall under such guidance. Again, just because a very small trial has found some marginally interesting results for &quot;some scary illness&quot; doesn't automatically mean we are including it, because in the larger subsequent studies such effects may well regress to the mean or shown to be marred by toxicity. I can say with confidence that many of the drugs in Alzheimer's disease clinical research will never hit the shelves. What was then the purpose of giving them so much airtime?  |  14:15, 22 June 2009 (UTC)

Ideally, I'd like to see this handled flexibly. In general, I do think we give too much weight to the latest abstract from ASCO, but that is a failing of the popular press as well, so it's difficult to break free of it. On the one hand, whenever a new study piques interest and gets written up in the popular press, someone will reliably add a lengthy segment about that study to Wikipedia. We should probably discourage this, because of , recentism, etc.On the other hand, the evidence base for specific medical practices varies widely. In some areas (pancreatic cancer being an example), interventions are often adopted wholesale on the basis of very limited data, and Phase III trials may or may not ever be done (certainly the impetus for a drug company to fund such a trial evaporates rather quickly once their drug becomes de facto standard-of-care).Basically, our articles should be in line with respected, expert medical thought and opinion, since our goal is to produce a serious and respectable reference work. If such opinion is based on Phase II trials, then it would be OK to cite them (hence I can't really get behind a cast-in-stone prohibition). On the other hand, we shouldn't be emphasizing the latest, greatest preliminary result at the expense of a balanced treatment of a topic. It might be OK to have a section in an article like pancreatic cancer where we discuss areas of active investigation - preclinical work and early Phase I/II results - with the clarity that this is the cutting edge and may or may not pan out. That would probably do readers a service - by informing them of current avenues of research - without misleading them into thinking that a single-institution, uncontrolled Phase II abstract definitively represents the wave of the future.   18:31, 22 June 2009 (UTC)

* It's definitely not a black-and-white issue. For a well-researched area like pancreatic cancer, though, it should not be hard to find reliable sources that review experimental and research therapies, and Wikipedia articles should rely on these secondary sources instead of citing primary sources directly. There are exceptions for groundbreaking primary sources that have not had time to be reviewed yet, but these exceptions should be quite rare (and shouldn't last longer than a few months).
* This particular case does not seem to be an exception to the rule. Dhillon et al. 2008 () is a reasonable primary source on one relatively narrow topic, but it has been reviewed multiple times (notably by Fryer et al. 2009, ), and Wikipedia should be citing these reviews, not the primary source.
* For rarer diseases such as (say) wandering spleen, primary sources may be the best we can do, and in that case they're OK.
* The  section already comments on evidence-quality rubrics, and perhaps advice about phase I/II trials could be folded into there. However, that section is already problematic, as it simply gives rubrics for assessing evidence quality, without making it sufficiently clear what the rubrics are for. When I first read that section, I misunderstood it to mean that Wikipedia editors should be using phrases like &quot;Class IIIb evidence&quot; in articles to summarize primary studies that articles cite, which (I hope!) was not the intent.
* I'm dubious about encouraging jargon like &quot;Phase II clinical trial&quot; in articles on diseases or therapies. Medical articles should avoid jargon like that. The main text of articles should concentrate on what's known, not on how we know it.
 () 19:09, 22 June 2009 (UTC)

Have we just confused early clinical trials with whether the reports about them are primary or secondary sources?  Many Phase II trials are described in secondary sources.   () 20:33, 22 June 2009 (UTC)
 Surely it's OK to cite a reliable review such as Fryer et al. 2009 () that discusses phase II trials, presumably along with other evidence. However, the original example given (Dhillon et al. 2008, ) is a primary source about a single phase II trial, and as I understand it the underlying dispute here is over whether it's OK to cite such sources.  () 21:20, 22 June 2009 (UTC)

Even early and inconclusive trials can have major implications for the companies. If even a phase I/II trial is reported outside the scientific journals, we may need to cover it. The terms need to be used in individual articles. They're the exact descriptors, and people know them--they're now widely used in newspapers, all the patients lobbies know them, and so does the financial world. What would help is to add a short descriptor each time they are first used in a article (for safety) (for possible effectiveness)  etc.  That will be enough to orient the person who first comes across these terms in an article. Our articles should be in line with serious respected opinion, yes, but they also extend into areas where there is not yet defined medical opinion.  If the article is written properly the status will be clear. (My basic rule is if it is well enough known that people will come to look for it in a general encyclopedia like this, it belongs here, which is approximately equivalent to the General notability guideline for things that the general or specialized newsmedia cover--such as new drugs.  I would include the publications of the major patient lobbies as responsible media.  () 04:45, 27 June 2009 (UTC)
 I dunno, I just now searched Google News for &quot;phase II clinical trial&quot; and found that almost all news sources that used that phrase were press releases, stock tip sheets, and other similarly unreliable sources. Wikipedia medical articles are not the right place to pass along this kind of material. Sure, there are exceptions, truly notable phase II results that cry out to be mentioned even though no reliable reviews have been published yet; but these should be rare, and they should be removed in short order as reviews of these oh-so-notable results come in.  () 05:19, 27 June 2009 (UTC)
I could imagine good reasons to mention a Phase II trial in an article about a biopharma company, and occasionally in an article about a drug, but I'm unconvinced that it should be mentioned in an article about a disease -- especially under &quot;Treatment&quot;.   () 17:15, 27 June 2009 (UTC)

Absolutely. My main point was with regards to discussing treatments in clinical articles. I think we need to think really carefully about whether we go along with the mindless hype of newspapers to write hysterically about every in vitro study (in the UK, the Daily Mail is especially good at this) or try to educate by providing balanced high-quality context-driven content.  |  07:24, 28 June 2009 (UTC)

So perhaps a new section might be in order.  What do you think of something like this:
Summarize relevant, currently accepted knowledgeResearch is underway in nearly all areas of medicine.  Although the results of a recent study might interest many people, from patients to investors, Wikipedia is  and includes only encyclopedic information, in  to its .  Medicine-related articles should present the current state of medical knowledge.  Editors should normally not include  and should avoid presenting early-stage research in ways that suggest it is widely accepted.  For example, the results of an early-stage clinical trial are unlikely to be appropriate for inclusion in the &quot;Treatment&quot; section of an article about a disease, because a possible future treatment has no bearing on current treatment practices.  However, the results might, in some cases, be appropriate for inclusion in an article dedicated to the drug or treatment in question, or to the researchers or businesses involved in it.  Such information might also be appropriate for a well-documented section on &quot;Research directions&quot; in an article about a disease.  If including this information in this situation, it is frequently helpful to the reader to clearly identify the level of research (e.g., &quot;first-in-human safety testing,&quot; &quot;Phase II clinical trial&quot;) to prevent misunderstandings. 
On the other hand:  perhaps MEDRS is the wrong place for this.  Perhaps instead it needs to be at .   () 22:59, 28 June 2009 (UTC)

Peer-review as MEDRS

I'd like some clarification on an issue that I'm not entirely sure is addressed by the main page (or perhaps I just didn't understand it).  Let's say Dr. Watson writes an article in a highly-reliable source like The Lancet, and this article is cited in a Wikipedia article.  His peer, Dr. Seuss, later writes a critical response to the original article, which also gets published in The Lancet.  The response is, presumably, considered editorial in nature being only one person's opinion.  Is it appropriate and/or desirable to include that response within the body of an article, assuming it's relevant?  Something along the lines of &quot;In an article in The Lancet, Dr. Watson wrote that all bunnies are fluffy, but this claim was countered by Dr. Seuss who dismissed Dr. Watson's claims.&quot;  This is basically the point of peer review is it not?

Just as a point of note, I'm not a doctor, researcher, or anything else of that nature, so I don't have a good understanding of the amount/quality of review that would go into any given article or response in order for it to actually be published in a reliable source like The Lancet.  Us computer nerds tend to just blog everything. :)  Thanks in advance for any clarification on this question. -- () 21:03, 12 July 2009 (UTC)

Letters to the editor are not exactly peer review but an extension of it. What is meant by peer review is that an article is reviewed by independent reviewers before it is published. Reviewers may advise the editor not to carry an article if it has flaws or doesn't meet the aims of the journal. Often, changes are suggested to make the article better once it is accepted.
Letters are usually not peer-reviewed, but the editor of the journal employs some form of discretion as to what gets published. It is very unusual for a letter writer to completely uproot the premise of a publication, and if that is the case then the editor will not have any alternatives but suggest to the original author to retract his/her article. If that doesn't happen then obviously the letter writer might have a dissenting opinion but is not necessarily more right or wrong that the original author. Truth told, if you are talking about reviews, the review writers are usually chosen on merit, while letter-writers are self-appointed.
For the purposes of , I think very good secondary sources are needed to give any weight whatsoever to letters to the editor. If a journal like The Lancet carries a review, they will have done their homework in deciding whether the article is worthy of that status.  |  22:41, 12 July 2009 (UTC)

Thanks for the clarification, JFW.  The issue came up recently in an article I was editing (though I wasn't involved), and I since I wasn't sure, I thought I'd clarify it for future reference.  Thanks again! -- () 23:26, 12 July 2009 (UTC)
Such letters work a lot like the letter to the editor pages at a regular newspaper:  even if the editors think the writer is a complete idiot, they don't want to be accused of &quot;silencing dissent&quot; or &quot;ignoring evidence&quot; (etc.).  So they publish letters that they disagree with, on grounds of keeping the dialogue open or keeping the readers interested.  
Even when I agree with the letter (e.g., it clarifies a point that was lost in a larger article) or it is written by people I respect, I don't think that they're high-quality sources for our purposes.  
Additionally, the letters most interesting to POV-pushers on Wikipedia are frequently written by people that are notorious for their fringe-y views.  A well-respected journal will expect its readers to recognize, and discount, the views of the &quot;Rush Limbaughs&quot; in their field -- but they'll still publish them for exactly the same reasons that a left-wing magazine might print a rant from a right-wing celebrity.

Medically unexplained symptoms

Question about when MEDRS is not MEDRS. I have interest in conditions with medically unexplained symptoms, i edit articles on Morgellons, chronic Lyme, Fibromyalgia, Chronic fatigue syndrome. The reviews on CFS and FM say, the cause is not known, but i use the phrase &quot;medically unexplained symptoms&quot; and other editors do not like. I think some editors think MUS is the same as &quot;functional somatic syndrome&quot; so they do not like that, but i do not think it is, it means medically unexplained. 

Editors say I need to proove MUS is used in the fibromyalgia literature, i am ok with it, and they say no article on fibromyalgia uses MUS, i am not ok with that! A week now, i am giving reference and more reference like at my sandbox  and the articles ,  and user talks, also with quotes, many from the reviews and articles I am giving have &quot;medically unexplained&quot; in abstract or title. Reviews on FM and articles use MUS or MUPS, reviews in the MUPS literature say FM and CFS, textbooks also. Reviews in the psych literature say MUPS and FSS and CFS and FM. There is more support for CFS and FM &quot;medically unexplained&quot; then most of the things in these articles. The editors are saying, these MEDRS are not good enough bc the articles they find in there searches have only a few citations. but the articles i am giving, some have in hundreds of citations, i do not know why they do not look at those.

The question, is there a total citation number before a MEDRS can be used, and how many MEDRS reviews does it take, for supporting a statement in article?? Thx [[User:RetroS1mone|RetroS1mone]] [[User talk:RetroS1mone|talk]] 11:53, 20 July 2009 (UTC)

 Sorry, there is no magic number. One needs to look at all the literature on a topic, assess its reliability, and attempt to reflect it in a balanced way. (I haven't looked at your particular case.)  () 18:46, 20 July 2009 (UTC)

The sources you list are, on their faces, good sources.  The list includes books, reviews, a meta-analysis, and other high-quality publications.  Of course, it's possible to misuse a good source, so you'll want to be careful about whether or not the source, taken altogether, really supports a specific given statement.

Assess evidence quality

Here is the first cut at a replacement for the  section, for discussion. It's too long and wordy, but I thought I'd get it out the door now and we can trim it later. The basic idea is to incorporate some of the discussion mentioned above, and to trim away some of the unnecessary detail that's in the section now.

----

Several systems exist for assessing the quality of available evidence on medical subjects, and these should be kept in mind while assessing whether a particular viewpoint is a majority or minority one, and in deciding what constitutes evidence-based medicine. The best evidence comes from meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and from systematic reviews of bodies of literature of overall good quality and consistency addressing the specific recommendation. Narrative reviews can help establish the context of evidence quality. Roughly in descending order of quality, lower-quality evidence in medical research comes from individual RCTs, other controlled studies, quasi-experimental studies, and non-experimental studies such as comparative, correlation, and case control studies. Although expert committee reports or opinions, along with clinical experience of respected authorities, are weaker evidence than the scientific studies themselves, they often provide helpful overviews of evidence quality. Case reports, whether in the popular press or a peer-reviewed medical journal, are a form of anecdote and generally fall below the minimum requirements of reliable medical sources.

If an notable important scientific result is so new that no reliable reviews have been published on it, it may be helpful to cite the primary source that reported the result. Although popular-press news articles and press releases often tout the latest phase II clinical trial, such trials are rarely notable important enough to mention in an encyclopedia. Any such results should be described as being from a single study, for example:
 &quot;A 2009 U.S. study found the average age of formal autism spectrum diagnosis was 5.7 years.&quot; (citing  )
After enough time has passed for a review to be published in the area, the review should be cited in preference to the primary study. If no review is published in a reasonable amount of time, the primary source should be removed as not reporting an notable important result. When in doubt, omit mention of the primary study, as per .

 and early-stage research should not be cited in ways that suggest wide acceptance. For example, the results of an early-stage clinical trial are unlikely to be appropriate for inclusion in the Treatment section of an article about a disease, because a possible future treatment has little bearing on current treatment practice. However, the results might, in some cases, be appropriate for inclusion in an article dedicated to the treatment in question, or to the researchers or businesses involved in it. Such information, particularly if citing a secondary source, might also be appropriate for a well-documented section on &quot;Research directions&quot; in an article about a disease. To prevent misunderstandings, the text should clearly identify the level of research cited, e.g., &quot;first-in-human safety testing&quot;.

Previous version of &quot;Address evidence quality&quot;

Several systems exist for assessing the quality of available evidence on medical subjects, and these should be kept in mind while assessing whether a particular viewpoint is a majority or minority one, and in deciding what constitutes evidence-based medicine.

Two of the most commonly used schemes are the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality one:

And the slightly simpler NHS one:


Case reports, whether in the popular press or a peer-reviewed medical journal, are a form of anecdote and generally fall below the minimum requirements of either scheme.

Sources cited within primary research

Primary research often, if not usually, includes introduction and discussion sections which cite other sources. Can these be then considered as &quot;secondary&quot; sources? - [[User: Tekaphor|Tekaphor]] () 14:26, 20 July 2009 (UTC)

Only according to . According to everyone else, those sources are often chosen selectively to remain relevant to the line of research in the article, and therefore less useful.  |  16:31, 20 July 2009 (UTC)

  says &quot;Research papers are primary sources; although they normally contain previous-work sections that are secondary sources, these sections are typically less reliable than reviews.&quot; It's better to use a real review, as a primary source often has an axe to grind and its previous-work section is typically not reviewed nearly as carefully as a real review would be.  () 18:45, 20 July 2009 (UTC)

Might as well also add that review articles can be primary sources.

Medical Hypotheses again

Hi everyone, i cannot believe, but Medical Hypotheses journal is discussed again as MEDRS , a single purpose account editor thinks it has a MEDRS review about Herpes causes CFS. I tried explain them, it is not MEDRS, but editor has very good arguments for MEDRS by calling me uninformed and a conservative, ha ha if they knew!!
I am sorry for bugging every body about it, pls can we say the journal is, is not MEDRS. Thx [[User:RetroS1mone|RetroS1mone]] [[User talk:RetroS1mone|talk]] 13:51, 30 July 2009 (UTC)

In fairness to Jagra, his contribution history shows that he is not an SPA.  His history over the last year has been almost exclusively CFS-related, but then again, there's been a lot of controversy on that page over the last year, resulting in one banned user and several formal and informal disputes.

In terms of the current debate over Medical Hypotheses, while I'm currently in dispute resolution with Retro on other issues, I consider myself to be neutral on this particular topic in that I am not involved in the addition or reversion of the material, nor do I have an opinion on its validity.  Retro has pointed out some relevant topics in the regular RS archives, and I think they speak fairly clearly to the issue (though I haven't examined them or the surrounding discussion in detail), but I think it would be reasonable to address the issue here as well, as editors here are likely to have better knowledge of medical journals and I do not see any previous discussion of this journal in the MEDRS archives, where I think many people would expect to find it. -- () 20:21, 30 July 2009 (UTC)

Proposal

We need some wording to disambiguate between different sources regarding alternative medicine. I propose something like the following:

;Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM)

Generally, much less reliable research has been conducted about the efficacy, safety, and legitimacy of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) than has been done for mainstream medicine. For this reason, reliable sources may be much more difficult to find and unreliable sources are often readily available. Whenever writing about a claim about CAM practices, it is vital that third-party, independent sources be used. Sources written and reviewed by the advocates of CAM are excellent for describing their own opinions, but extreme care should be taken when using such sources lest the more controversial aspects of their opinions be taken at face-value or, worse, asserted as fact.

 () 19:14, 10 August 2009 (UTC)

 This is a tricky area and obviously the simplest thing, which is what  currently does, is to say nothing, in effect holding CAM up to the same standards as everybody else. I see some problems with the proposal above:
* CAM is a broad area, and ranges from therapies like acupuncture (for which there is scientific evidence of effectiveness, for some conditions) to therapies like radionics (which is clearly pseudoscience and quackery). Any advice we give should not throw out whatever babies are in the bathwater.
* Many areas of medical controversy in medicine are not commonly characterized as CAM, and yet they still would benefit from advice along the lines of the above. These include sublingual immunotherapy, pluripotent stem-cell therapy, androgen replacement therapy, vaccination, and many other areas.
It would be better, I think, to rephrase the advice above so that it does not mention CAM, but does acknowledge and make suggestions for the problem of axe-grinding in poorly-supported areas.  () 23:07, 10 August 2009 (UTC)

 Perhaps a section discussing the interactions of  and ? -  () 03:03, 11 August 2009 (UTC)

I am deeply concerned that there is a tendency among some to disparage secondary references which cover mainstream thought while cherry-picking positive references and using them as sources for either outright assertions of fact which are disputed or as a means to inappropriately &quot;balance&quot; the general consensus of medical experts. It is no secret, for example, that certain therapies, supplements, and treatments do not provide the efficacy, safety, nor legitimacy that they claim. For example, today I went to the pharmacy and found that fully one-third of the products that were marketed as sleep aids were either homeopathic, naturopathic without claims being evaluated by a regulatory authority (sold as a &quot;supplement&quot;), or were downright lunacy (including one product which sold for $29.95 that consisted of a magnet attached to a strip of gauze that you were supposed to wrap around your wrist). I know that Quackwatch has articles on all of these products and names many of them by name. However, there are editors in good-standing here at Wikipedia who would make the claim that Quackwatch is not a &quot;good source&quot; per MEDRS. The argument they give is for  to Stephen Barrett. This type of argumentation seems entrenched and we need to address it Head-On (pardon the pun).  does not seem to sink in, and often people seem to think that PARITY means something it does not. To wit, parity of sources is supposed to allow for leniency in sourcing mainstream opinion about fringe ideas. Synergistically with WEIGHT, the idea is to be able to write NPOV with proper sourcing. Too often, certain editors at Wikipedia think PARITY means something like BALANCE. &quot;Oh, the homeopath says this and this medical doctor writing for an on-line magazine that's not peer-reviewed says this. Obviously these are equivalent sources and should be treated as he-said/she-said controversy.&quot; No, PARITY just gives editors permission to find sources outside the normal channels when the claims themselves are made outside the normal channels (e.g. not necessarily referenced by PubMed). In such cases, we rely more on the reputation of the sources and evaluate their potential biases before using them as authorities or  reported by such sources. This point does not seem to be elucidated on this page.
To be clear, most of the products I saw at the pharmacy do not have Wikipedia articles and are not directly mentioned anywhere in the encyclopedia. However, we need to think about what happens as these articles do get written: and eventually, unless Wikipedia goes belly-up, they will get written. Having a clause or two in this guideline that lets editors know that mainstream sources which directly address controversial or problematic medical-related subjects can be trusted would be very helpful. The basic issue right now is that we go into great depth here discussing topics about which there exist a moderate to extraordinary amount of research. We need to accommodate those subjects which are more marginal -- dare I say -- FRINGE.
 () 04:01, 11 August 2009 (UTC)

 I also am concerned with the all-too-common insertion of unreliable material or sources. For example, I just now removed a bunch of unsourced material claiming that water fluoridation is bad for you; see . I regularly have to remove similar fringe material from other articles I help maintain, ranging from Autism to Zostavax. In my experience CAM, while a big part of the problem, is not the whole problem; and furthermore, part of CAM is scientifically OK. With this in mind, it'd be better to adjust the phraseology of any proposal so that it does not focus on CAM, but instead focuses on antiscience, pseudoscience, fraud, axe-grinding, etc. Phrasing it in this more-general way will (1) apply more generally to problems in medical articles, and (2) avoid pointless arguments about whether this-or-that treatment is CAM. (Most chiropractors don't agree that chiropractic is CAM, for example; and aren't they the experts on what chiropractic is? That sort of argument.)  () 05:17, 11 August 2009 (UTC)

I see your point, Eubulides. In the cases you and I are citing there seems to be two common denominators: 1) a lack of reliable sourcing and 2) an agenda of declaring medical &quot;facts&quot; that are not supported by reliable sourcing. The issue is that occasionally such advocacy is notable enough to be written about in this encyclopedia. How do we handle this?  () 12:54, 11 August 2009 (UTC)

Here is a new proposal:

;Poorly sourced claims

While many medical subjects are covered by a plethora of reliable sources, there is a sizable number of  though  medical claims where little to no reliable research has been conducted about the efficacy, safety, or legitimacy of the statements made by proponents. In such cases, reliable sources may be much more difficult to find and unreliable sources can often be more readily available.

@ScienceApologist, re above proposal for poorly sourced claims:  that sounds fine to me as long as we're not construing it to say that Quackwatch can be cited as fact rather than attributed with an inline citation, or that it supersedes other MEDRS's.  Quackwatch is certainly fine to use, per , but you go too far with your argument [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:List_of_topics_characterized_as_pseudoscience&amp;diff=307215140&amp;oldid=307116766 here] when you hold Quackwatch as a superior source to the Institute of Medicine, viz:
&quot;But there are times that sources may contradict the mainstream science that Barrett references, or may hedge where Barrett is plain, or might avoid issues Barrett handles directly. In such instances, Barrett is clearly the superior source, and particular attribution to Barrett as though his opinion is singular would clearly be in violation of our guideline against particular attribution.&quot;[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:List_of_topics_characterized_as_pseudoscience&amp;diff=307215140&amp;oldid=307116766]
Quackwatch can be a valuable source, but it's not the best MEDRS out there, and certainly isn't as good as sources like the Cochrane Collaboration and other mainstream, peer-reviewed sources.  I doubt that I'd put it in the same tier as sources mentioned under , either, because (its advisory board notwithstanding) there's no apparent mechanism of peer review.

When a topic is not discussed by superior MEDRS's, Quackwatch can be an ideal counter to self-published,  claims; but when a topic is discussed by superior MEDRS's, Quackwatch can still be cited, but with less .  In that light, I agree with Eubulides' [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Reliable_sources_(medicine-related_articles)&amp;diff=307258272&amp;oldid=307222674 caveat above] about throwing out the baby with the bathwater.

I'm not sure that &quot;poorly sourced claims&quot; is the right title here.  A widely accepted fact could be poorly sourced (e.g, to someone's blog, because it was handier than a medical textbook that says the same thing), and this paragraph doesn't seem to address that.  This seems to deal more with controversial claims (everything from &quot;no data exists&quot; to &quot;a tiny minority thinks the Earth is flat&quot;).   () 20:24, 11 August 2009 (UTC)

Would a direct quote help?  () 21:22, 14 August 2009 (UTC)

;Controversial claims

While many medical subjects are covered by a plethora of reliable sources, there is a sizable number of  though  medical claims where little to no reliable research has been conducted about the efficacy, safety, or legitimacy of the statements made by proponents. In such cases, reliable sources may be much more difficult to find and unreliable sources can often be more readily available. Whenever writing about medical claims not supported by mainstream research, it is vital that third-party, independent sources be used. As described at our guidelines for : &quot;While... proponents are excellent sources for describing what they believe, the best sources to use when determining the  and  of fringe theories are independent sources.&quot; Sources written and reviewed by the advocates of such marginal ideas can be used to describe notable personal opinions, but extreme care should be taken when using such sources lest the more controversial aspects of their opinions be taken at face-value or, worse, asserted as fact.

← I think there is a real need for language like this. If anyone doesn't believe this is a problem, I'll point them to a series of articles demonstrating the issue. Combine the following:
* One poor-quality, obscure, but marginally useable source on a fringe medical topic.
* Complete lack of actual reliable sources on the topic as it is well below the fringe/notability horizon in the real world.
* One determined single-purpose account.
The result is a low-quality article which can never be anything other than a) credulous snake-oil promotion or b)  deconstruction of the nonsensical claim. And with one dedicated single-purpose editor (and a few of the usual suspects to chime in) the article can never be deleted through AfD. This is a real barrier to the goal of creating a serious, respectable reference work, so I would support some language clarifying the ways in which Wikipedia's core principles apply to such situations.   04:11, 15 August 2009 (UTC)

Along these lines, I've been thinking about Protandim, which owes its AfD survival to one (major) media article and a couple of PubMed-listed journal articles.  But, as is typical for new dietary supplements, the scientific articles are all written by proponents (e.g., people employed by the manufacturer).  Peer review does not turn a proponent into a third-party, independent source.  
On the other hand -- thinking about , and the unsupportable claims made by an editor at Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy that any research that is even slightly favorable is unacceptable because only money-grubbing surgeons that perform ETS write papers about it -- the fact that a person favors something, or gets paid for it, does not mean that the person is necessarily unreliable.  I'm not sure whether we can (or should) address this issue here.
More helpfully, given the number of people that ask at  about whether &quot;third-party&quot; means tertiary source, it might be worth linking the Wiktionary page in this text.   () 04:25, 15 August 2009 (UTC)
WhatamIdoing, these are fascinating issues you bring up. I was interested yesterday in thinking about how to write an article about Procera AVH which is essentially a dietary supplement hawked by self-described [http://www.brainresearchlabs.com/about/about.php &quot;brain fitness guru of our time&quot;,  Joshua Reynolds] and an Volunteer Clinical Professor of Medicine at UCLA Medical Center (one of 3300 medical doctors who volunteer a certain number of hours a month to be associated with the university), Robert Heller, MD. The company selling the product has been able to gain endorsements by a number of [http://www.proceraavh.com/about_sab.php medical doctors and masters of science(!)] and the supplement has been subject to clinical trials by [http://www.proceraavh.com/about_rab.php three PhD research scientists] who they explicitly call &quot;objective third party scientists&quot;. The infomercial describes the supplement as &quot;The Mental Edge&quot; and offers a guarantee that Procera AVH will &quot;eliminate brain fog, mental fatigue and forgetfulness.&quot; Looking for sources on this particular product I find mostly promotional stuff, a reference in the [http://www.skepdic.com/news/newsletter102.html Skeptdic Newsletter], and, ironically, perhaps the most neutral source is a Yahoo Answers site: [http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090722234244AAgdOFz]. How we would go about writing an article is a touchy subject indeed considering the lack of independent MEDRS-quality sources.  is somewhat deceptive here considering the fact that this particular company has carefully collected the endorsements of credentialed scientists and medical doctors who they explicitly describe as &quot;third party&quot; while the truly &quot;independent sources&quot; are all anonymous internet commentators. It's almost as if this company had anticipated Wikipedia's sourcing policy and has done their best to essentially prevent us from being able to write a truly neutral article on the subject. I must admit to being at an almost complete loss for even knowing where to begin. One possibility is that Procera AVH is not notable enough for an article, but I have a sneaking suspicion that if someone started an article on the subject it would not be deleted. Perhaps it is time to consider a  policy to address these issues directly. My feeling is that if the independent sources are of low quality, then it is likely that the subject itself is not notable enough for inclusion. I suspect the same thing applies to protandim.  () 16:50, 17 August 2009 (UTC)
Yeah, I think that's a pretty good idea -- just don't have an article on stuff like that, and let's clarify the intersection of  and MEDRS.  That would probably be the easiest way to go. In fact I bet I could find several &quot;masters of objective science&quot;, or whatever, right here on WP who would agree that such an approach is an excellent, holistic approach to headache-prevention (not notable enough for an article, of course, but probably dandy as part of a guideline ;-). regards,  () 02:42, 18 August 2009 (UTC)
Okay, I added a sentence to that effect. It mentions the possibility that poor independent sources can be used as an argument against the notability of the subject. This has potential revolutionary implications, but I am more-or-less confident it is the right mood since Middle 8 and I both agree broadly with its ideal.  () 12:44, 18 August 2009 (UTC)

i can't say I understand the intent of the last sentence. AIs it saying we have two equally valid choices, 1/ to use such sources as there are in a way that makes the limited reliability clear OR, at our option, 2/not cover the topics entirely? IUf so, I don't see it as giving much guidance about what course to follow.  My own view is that RSs for the purpose of notability can include even the most absurd material, as long as they have sufficient prominence. Otherwise we are in the unfortunate position of calling quackery what it is, but only if it's moderately respectable, and not covering the worst of it., which I do not see as NPOV treatment of the subject in general.  () 23:15, 18 August 2009 (UTC)
Well, give us an alternative. We've outlined scenarios where the independent and most reliable sources are clearly not going to look superficially as reliable as the ones that Wikipedia would identify as such. I remarked myself that I'm not sure what to do with such claims and pointed out that a new Notability guideline would be appropriate. Middle 8, who often does not see eye-to-eye with me seemed to think that the solution I had of simply saying that subjects which have poor sourcing are not notable is agreeable to him. So, I went ahead and added the last statement to illustrate that point. I'm not sure what else to do. I could remove the sentence but that will not remove the problem.  () 03:11, 19 August 2009 (UTC)
 Perhaps too much is being read into the last sentence? If, for example, the New York Times has a story on the latest unsupported medical fad, then I'm sure we'd all agree that it is a high-quality source (even if the fad is unsupported). Conversely, if the only 3rd-party sources on a medical fad are anonymous blogs, I'd be leery of covering the fad at all. In between, there are judgment calls, but I don't see how the current wording precludes judgment calls. I did see several opportunities for tightening up the text without (I think) affecting its gist or intent, which I [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AReliable_sources_(medicine-related_articles)&amp;diff=309325468&amp;oldid=309176477 installed]. The most major changes are to the title of the subsection (which I reworded to make it fit better with its sibling subsection titles), and to the lead sentence (which I trimmed heavily for focus), and to remove a footnote citation to Wikipedia itself (which was a bit odd; that's what wikilinks are for; and anyway would be a pain to maintain the self-quote).

 Sorry, but I can't interpret the previous comment. I don't know what it means.  () 16:26, 17 August 2009 (UTC)

This isn't the first time this question has been raised.  I've boldly taken a stab at it with this text:Most journals also publish pieces that are not scientific articles, such as editorials, op-ed pieces, commentaries, and letters to the editor. These sources may provide interesting ideas, but they are never peer-reviewed and are rarely even fact-checked, and therefore they should be treated with caution. In general, such pieces must comply with , including rejecting claims outside the author's expertise and requiring direct attribution of the claims to the source.
My short summary is &quot;mere assignment of a PMID does not make it a peer-reviewed article.&quot; If anyone has any improvements, please .   () 16:39, 17 August 2009 (UTC)

One issue is with the wording, &quot;they are never peer-reviewed&quot;. This is not technically true in the sense of informal peer review. I know of a number of journals which will essentially not publish letters-to-the-editor which are blatant mischaracterizations, for example. The peer-review may not be as rigorous as for a journal article, but there is a level of editorial control. I do not think that these sources necessarily correspond to self-published works. They are somewhere in between. This issue extends well-beyond MEDRS.  () 17:01, 17 August 2009 (UTC)
That definition of 'informal peer-review' only works if you assume that the editor of your local newspaper does 'informal peer-review' when selecting letters from readers to publish on the letters-to-the-editor page.  Editorial selection is not the same as either editorial control or peer review.  Wikipedia has a long-standing consensus that letters to the editor in The New York Times should be seen as ; I see no particular reason to say that a letter to the editor in an obscure medical journal should be given more standing than NYT.   () 18:14, 17 August 2009 (UTC)
I'm not so sure it's that black-and-white. There are some powerful editorials written in Science (journal) and Nature (journal) that are subject to more editorial control than many papers published in more obscure journals.  () 19:06, 17 August 2009 (UTC)
I'm willing to remove proper editorials from this paragraph:  anything actually written by the editor meets every possible definition of editorial control (although they're still not peer-reviewed).  I think what I've written is still true about op-eds, commentaries, and letters.   () 19:32, 17 August 2009 (UTC)

How about this? Some reputable journals also publish pieces that are not strictly journal papers, such as editorials, op-ed pieces, commentaries, and letters to the editor. These sources may provide interesting ideas, but they should be treated with caution as the peer-review status and accuracy of the text can be nebulous. In general, such pieces must comply with , including rejecting claims outside the author's expertise and requiring direct attribution of the opinions of the author to the source.  () 20:15, 17 August 2009 (UTC)


[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reliable_sources_(medicine-related_articles)&amp;diff=308504687&amp;oldid=307971563 This edit] inserted a paragraph saying that editorials etc. must have direct attribution of claims to the source. If I understand that correctly, it goes too far: if (say) a NEJM editorial says that the use of Lupron to treat autism is controversial, we need not have the article text say &quot;Mr. Schmoe wrote that the use of Lupron to treat autism is controversial&quot;. Also, if a letter to the editor by an article's author corrects information in that article, surely a citation to the letter suffices; we don't need intext attribution. Furthermore, the change caused the project page to be incoherent: in one paragraph it says that editorials are articles, and in the next paragraph it says they aren't. I'm not sure what this change is motivated by, but I suggest that it be discussed here further before installing.  () 16:47, 17 August 2009 (UTC)

I really, really hate the direction that people are taking with attribution. The countervailing arguments are twofold:  and . If a letter to the editor is written by an expert and the fact asserted is in concord with standard texts/reviews/etc. on the subject, then attribution of the fact to the letter-writer is, in my estimation, a violation of . For example, imagine a commentator writing something like, &quot;This particular supplement relies on claims that contradict basic physiology.&quot; We can verify whether the author of the editorial is correct in his or her analysis and if the statement is a fact, simply referencing the commentary is perfectly fine - especially since many people write more clearly in commentaries and editorials than they do in academic articles. Likewise, I think that the &quot;particular attribution&quot; game is obviously being done as a way to  out of uncomfortable facts. Perhaps we should relocate particular attribution to the  page since it is sometimes done amongst legitimate controversies (not just FRINGE issues)?  () 16:57, 17 August 2009 (UTC)
SA, I think you and I would do the same thing in practice.  My concern is primarily about citing commentaries and letters as &quot;facts&quot; when you can't find a better source because no better source exists, not when you're thinking that any source is probably good enough.  For example:  I'm worried about using these kinds of sources for &quot;balancing&quot; statements against a generally accepted claim made in a peer-reviewed article, and the only source you can find is a letter to the editor.  
For a live example, efforts to promote the POV of certain trans activists have recently resumed at The Man Who Would Be Queen; among other things, a publish-all-responses call for commentaries on a peer-reviewed history-of-the-scandal article has resulted in several trips to RSN ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard/Archive_21#Reliability_of_Articles.2C_Commentaries.2C_etc._that_appear_in_a_Scientific_Journal.][http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard/Archive_25#Reliability_of_Articles.2C_Commentaries.2C_etc._that_appear_in_a_Scientific_Journal.][http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard/Archive_27#Archives_of_Sexual_Behavior][http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard/Archive_29#Comments_by_an_expert_in_a_.22letter_to_the_editor.22_pure_opinion_Vs_plausible_expert_opinion_and_fact.]) over whether you can selectively quote the opinion of a non-academic physician about whether, e.g., having your children's names and school photos published with captions like &quot;Kate: a cock-starved exhibitionist, or a paraphiliac who just gets off on the idea of it?&quot; as retaliation for &quot;insulting&quot; the trans community (by publishing your current scientific views about transsexuality) has a chilling effect on academic freedom.   () 18:38, 17 August 2009 (UTC)
Good example. The ridiculous text that is passing for analysis at the article on Quackwatch might also be a good object lesson. In general, I think that any time people refer to &quot;balancing&quot; they are usually trying to controvert NPOV. I spent a good number of months trying to excise the word &quot;balance&quot; from NPOV for this very reason and now it doesn't appear. The real key is to remember  which seems to be the thorn in the side of most POV-advocates.  () 19:06, 17 August 2009 (UTC)

Eubulides, his text says &quot;scientific articles&quot;, where the current text says &quot;journal articles&quot;, you may change it to &quot;scientific studies&quot; if that definition sounds better. The motivation is on the link on the top of this section.-- () 17:40, 17 August 2009 (UTC)

(Unindenting, as the above is too hard to follow.) I have some concerns about ScienceApologist's above proposal (dated 20:15, 17 August 2009).  I am mostly concerned about Letters to the Editor.  Since these are the standard method by which errors in published work are discussed, I think it would be a mistake to craft a rule that permits an erroneous paper to be cited but not a Letter to the Editor describing the error.  Consequently, I think care is needed.  In particular, I don't think that we should classify this material as .  It's considerably more reliable than that.  At the very least, it will have received the attention of the Editor, who will have made the decision to publish (based, presumably, on merit).  And some journals (for example the International Journal of STD and AIDS) apply a full peer-review process for Letters to the Editor.  I suggest simply stating that such material should be treated with caution, that it may be worth determining what review process (if any) applies, and that extra care should be taken to watch for  that may require stronger sourcing.   () 13:55, 18 August 2009 (UTC)

Great point. The &quot;in general&quot; may not be a sufficient enough caveat to cover the examples you give. This proposal needs more work.  () 14:07, 18 August 2009 (UTC)
Critiques on possible problems of an specific study are also usually presented as letters to the editor; and as such I believe that are of specific relevance when presented in conjunction with the commented article; since the letter addresses possible specific problems of the first. Maybe it would be a good idea to specifically say something like When they have an specific article as its topic; although they can not be used to debunk its conclusions they can give some indication on its possible strong points or limitations.

Guidelines should not cover medical-physiological articles

There are good reasons for the existence of specific medicine-related reliability criteria. But the guidelines fail to explain them with the result that its application is too wide. 
* Medical articles can potentially affect people's medical treatment and health decisions. It is therefore important that all treatment related information in Wikipedia is not only reliable but also has medical consensus. Thus they should be based upon not only upon primary sources but also secondary sources from recognized publications that filter and discuss them. The medical community recognizes this need and so creates many reviews and textbooks that discuss such primary sources.
* But many  articles that are &quot;medically-related&quot; concern physiological processes and lack implications for any treatment or health related decisions. These need to be reliable but the issue of consensus is not relevant and reflecting this journals publish many fewer secondary reviews upon them. Moreover in many areas of physiology research progress is so fast that field reviewing has shifted from review articles to the review sections that make up the introductory sections of research papers. In addition since the issue of consensus is not so important as advancing a field of research, where reviews are written, editors often allow what might be called position reviews in which a particular viewpoint is presented in the context of a general advocacy. This makes many secondary sources in physiology less reliable than many primary ones which only report research findings. 
* It is therefore inappropriate that physiological articles should ideally be sourced upon reviews rather than reliable primary research journal ones. 
* The medicine-related guidelines should reflect this and limit the need for secondary sources only for treatment or health related articles with physiological ones having the same reliability requirements as other scientific Wikipedia articles.-- () 00:57, 23 August 2009 (UTC)

  currently says in its title that it's about &quot;medicine-related articles&quot;, in its nutshell that it's about &quot;biomedical articles&quot;, and in its lead that it's about &quot;medical articles&quot; which are a &quot;source of health information&quot;, and later that it's about &quot;medical and health-related articles&quot;. The intent here, as I see it, was to focus on medicine and articles closely related to medicine, not on articles that are about biology in general. There are of course gray areas, and physiology is one of them. At one extreme,  is certainly not intended to apply to the Plant physiology article; at the other,  certainly would have something to say about the Physical exercise article, which  links to. I sense that the previous comment, though written in general terms, is motivated by one or more specific examples; if so, it would be helpful to know what those examples are. Certainly it is not unique to medicine that secondary sources are preferred; see .  () 05:49, 23 August 2009 (UTC)

I disagree with both the assumptions and the conclusion here.  It's true that basic physiological processes aren't usually the subject of recent literature reviews, but there are other excellent secondary sources available, such as college and medical school textbooks.

Are there any essays, guidelines or policies that talk about pharmanoia, and the idea that sources shouldn't be trusted because of Big Pharma having sticky fingers in things?  I've been treating such arguments as spurious without a specific source criticizing a specific paper.  I'm also interested in whether there's something similar for when alt med advocates cite the pharmanoia argument to support the idea that vitamins are a panacea and preventive wonder for all things (also would be nice to have something to point to that states the alt med advocates often have their own conflict of interest, and are not immune merely because they aren't Pfizer).     Wikipedia's rules:[[WP:SIMPLE|simple]]/[[WP:POL|complex]] 20:47, 3 September 2009 (UTC)
There's obviously a borderline between healthy skepticism and abusive paranoia. Unfortunately, that dividing line is grounded in commonsense, which seems largely absent from many quarters of Wikipedia. Leaving aside the more loony and self-serving invocations of pharmanoia,  is a tricky issue. Journal editors obviously feel that such potential conflicts of interest are relevant (as do most journal readers) - hence the disclosure statements accompanying articles. However, if we translate that onto Wikipedia, it's grossly disproportionate to give one sentence to a study's findings and one sentence to the study's funding - that does not accurately reflect the weighting in the source, and it gives undue weight to the funding issue. I'm not sure what the right answer is, other than to punt it and handle it &quot;on a case-by-case basis&quot;.   21:03, 3 September 2009 (UTC)
I believe editorial judgment is the best guideline here :) Now, as for essays... MastCell, doesn't that vaguely resemble a challenge?  (·) 21:22, 3 September 2009 (UTC)

Aspartame controversy

I am in doubt about a reference that has been added. To me it sounds like dubious woo-woo advice by pushers of dietary supplements that isn't backed up with good evidence. The ref is being used to justify mentioning that aspartame can produce migraines. While there is a subset of individuals that are sensitive to it, the ref is being used to imply that it causes migraines, without qualifying the subset it applies to:

* [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aspartame_controversy&amp;diff=324387900&amp;oldid=322566342 The diff]

* [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19454881 The referenced article]

The edit seems to be pushing an unjustified and POV use of the source.  () 04:43, 11 November 2009 (UTC)
Sheesh. Why not simply reword the statement to read

In some people, aspartame may act as a migraine trigger, as may many other food additives and naturally occurring substances.

Medicinal clay

 They don't seem to appreciate me coming there instead of here. It seems that this is the closest thing to an &quot;WP:RS/N&quot; for MEDRS topics, so that's why I'm starting here. (We really should have a section of  for such matters: ) I expect alt med topics to contain non-mainstream sources, but they shouldn't have undue weight and shouldn't be misleading.

Hair analysis (alternative medicine)

This section seems to be one huge special pleading section with peacock language and undue weight given to alt med advocates like Haley and Blaxil from SafeMinds, and ancient claims made by Bowen. (Yes, believe it or not, Bowen does rant about Satan, Zionism, and the Illuminati, and in his letter to Martini explains why his medical license was [http://quackfiles.blogspot.com/2005/06/dr-jim-bowen-on-nutra-sweet-politricks.html revoked].) While the fringe position should be stated clearly, it shouldn't be allowed to deceive the public by making their claims seem plausible through a presentation marred by undue weight. --  () 00:10, 23 November 2009 (UTC)
What &quot;assess the evidence&quot; means

I've been looking through some conversations from earlier this year, and I have run across an area that  may need to provide a little more clarity.  It seems that this section is being occasionally (mis)understood as requiring editors to decide whether a study (or review) has sufficient data to support the conclusions that it draws. 

So what we mean -- and what I thought we said -- was that if you're faced with contradictory papers, or trying to decide whether something's important enough to include, then you prefer reviews and meta-analyses to original RCT reports, and that you prefer RCTs to case studies, and so forth. 

I'm seeing this invoked as a justification for :  I didn't think that their data sample was big enough to justify that conclusion... and the review cites Smith's trial for this fact, so that's just a single original paper... and Smith's paper is a little old, anyway, even though the review is recent... and probably the reviewer is twisting Smith's conclusions... -- even though we're citing the review instead of Smith.

I think that the problem might actually be in the section's title.  Could we consider renaming it to something less open-ended, like &quot;Prefer well-designed studies&quot;?   () 19:58, 19 October 2009 (UTC)

Wikipedia should be a tertiary resource and so if it comes down to determining whether a single paper is reasonable or not or which of a pair of contradictory papers Wikipedia should be citing, it is always best to go with secondary sources. In general, we should be encouraging editors to use  and avoid primary sources completely. The purpose of the encyclopedia is not to stay on the cutting-edge of medical wisdom but to provide a dispassionate and removed summary of the most conventional and staid wisdom about notable subjects. To that end, I'd say what we should retitle the section Use consensus summaries or something of that nature.  () 21:52, 19 October 2009 (UTC)

I very much agree with . Regards, —[[User:Mattisse|Mattisse]] () 22:20, 19 October 2009 (UTC)

Yes, of course.  But that point is fully covered in , and is not the point that I'm talking about.  My question involves the section that compares meta-analyses to individual trials, and individual trials to case studies, and case studies to pure speculation.  The title of this section seems to be misunderstood as encouraging editors to pass judgment on whether a secondary source has accurately represented the primary works that it discusses.    () 22:30, 19 October 2009 (UTC)

Not sure that the point is fully covered there, actually. Essentially all journal articles can be considered to be primary sources whether they are meta-analyses, RCTs, case studies, etc. A secondary source would review the state of the topic and report the consensus opinion. Those are the best sources to use. The issue I have with this section is that it does not go far enough in making sure that primary sources are avoided whenever possible. I guess you can say that I'm a fan of, &quot;When in doubt, ask for an expert summary.&quot;  () 22:47, 19 October 2009 (UTC)
 Again, I agree with  m having dealt with many medical/psychiatric articles recently where primary sources are considered ok. Not only primary sources, but old primary sources. Regards, —[[User:Mattisse|Mattisse]] () 22:56, 19 October 2009 (UTC)
Again, encouraging the use of secondary sources is not the point of this subsection.  No matter how fervently we all agree that secondary sources are wonderful -- and I believe that we do agree on that point -- our agreement does not change the content of this particular subsection to be about secondary sources instead of about study designs.   () 23:35, 19 October 2009 (UTC)

Why not just rename the section to &quot;Use high-quality sources&quot;? That matches the section's contents better anyway, and would help avoid the possible misunderstandings noted above.  () 23:25, 19 October 2009 (UTC)
Because an elderly self-published source is not a high-quality source even if it is a meta-analysis.  Study design is not the only factor that determines high-quality sources.  It is, however, the only factor addressed in this particular subsection.   () 23:32, 19 October 2009 (UTC)
 But the section is about more than study design. It also emphasizes reviews and other secondary sources that are not research studies in the usual sense. I'd rather not have the section header limit itself to &quot;studies&quot;, which sounds too much like primary research studies.  () 23:44, 19 October 2009 (UTC)
Agree. We should not be int the business of &quot;evaluating&quot; primary research studies.  Regards, —[[User:Mattisse|Mattisse]] () 00:06, 20 October 2009 (UTC)

Eubulides, I take your point about &quot;studies&quot;, although the major point of this section is clearly just that.  I'm open to alternative titles.  
Mattisse, with respect, we should be in the business of evaluating primary studies, because this guideline instructs us to do that.  If you do not stop to figure out what kind of paper you're looking at, you'll treat an outdated narrative review of three case studies as being far more reliable than the a recent very large randomized controlled trial on the same point.   is not the only valid consideration, and this guideline has always encouraged appropriate use of primary sources.   () 00:19, 20 October 2009 (UTC)

How about Consider study design? I think asking editors to conduct assessments of studies is wildly inappropriate, and maybe even insisting on &quot;preferences&quot; can be construed problematically, but exhorting people to consider the designs of studies when writing prose is okay in my book.  () 03:35, 20 October 2009 (UTC)
 The &quot;Consider&quot; is fine, but as mentioned above the section is about more than just study design. How about &quot;Consider the type of source&quot;? Also, in the 1st sentence the phrase &quot;assessing whether a particular viewpoint&quot; should be changed to &quot;considering whether a particular viewpoint&quot;.  () 16:33, 20 October 2009 (UTC)
&quot;Consider the type of source&quot; will be misunderstood as &quot;Classify it according to ,&quot; which would make this redundant with the previous section (which is all about PSTS issues).  
I don't think that there's really very much in this section that isn't directly or indirectly about study design.   () 02:53, 1 November 2009 (UTC)

 A lot of it is about study design, but some of it is about other kinds of sources as well (meta-analyses, reviews). How about &quot;Critically appraise sources&quot;? This title was inspired by the cited source Young &amp; Solomon 2009 (), &quot;How to critically appraise an article&quot;. The section's lead sentence should be altered to match the new title: &quot;Several systems exist for assessing the quality of available evidence on medical subjects, and these Sources for biomedical topics often vary widely in quality, and this should be kept in mind ...&quot;.  () 02:42, 3 November 2009 (UTC)
Too vague, and misleading.  Source has a technical definition on Wikipedia (see the footnotes at ), and what this section is about has nothing to do with that.  The main point of this section is:  A meta-analysis trumps a case study.  I want a title that specifically deals with the main point.   () 04:35, 3 November 2009 (UTC)
 That's an important point of the Assess evidence quality section, but it's not that much more important than the section's other points. The section also mentions systematic reviews (at the same level as meta-analyses), narrative reviews, and clinical experience, and none of these fit into the narrow rubric of &quot;study&quot;. As for the technical definition of source in , although the section focuses on articles, it also briefly talks about publishers and authors, so the word &quot;sources&quot; is not out of place here.  () 04:55, 3 November 2009 (UTC)
Perhaps I'm missing something obvious, but I can't find the words &quot;publisher&quot; or &quot;author&quot; anywhere in this section.  I see nothing in these two paragraphs that is unrelated to figuring out whether or not a given claim is based on high-quality data -- from &quot;meta-analyses&quot; at the top of the scale to &quot;speculative proposals&quot; at the very bottom.
I agree that a narrative review isn't technically a 'study'.  However, a systematic review generally is taken to be a study (of the previously published literature).  (It's not an &quot;experiment,&quot; but neither is a case report.)   () 19:29, 11 November 2009 (UTC)
 The words &quot;publisher&quot; and &quot;author&quot; are not in the section, but the topic of publishers is mentioned when the section talks about &quot;popular press or a peer-reviewed medical journal&quot;, and the topic of authors is raised when the section talks about &quot;expert committee&quot; and &quot;respected authorities&quot;. I take your point that the term &quot;study&quot; sometimes includes reviews; but often it doesn't, and it'd be better to avoid ambiguity here. How about &quot;Consider reviews and study design&quot;?  () 21:16, 11 November 2009 (UTC)
That phrase means two unrelated things to me.  
When we tell an editor to &quot;consider reviews&quot;, we mean &quot;consider relying on them -- they're usually pretty good sources for all sorts of purposes&quot;.  When we tell an editor to &quot;consider study design&quot;, we mean &quot;This paper is just a short case series, and that's pretty weak evidence&quot; (or &quot;That's a meta-analysis, which is strong evidence&quot;).  
IMO, the point of this section is the second, not the first.   () 22:27, 11 November 2009 (UTC)

New template

The [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reliable_sources_%28medicine-related_articles%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=323212269 new template] is interesting, on the one hand, but based on its sole use to date,[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Naturopathy&amp;diff=323211726&amp;oldid=323184655] I suspect that it may be no more useful than , and may be misused.  MEDRS doesn't presume to provide standards for strictly social facts, such as whether scientists &quot;should&quot; publicly oppose quackery, or whether a country devotes sufficient resources to health care for a given marginalized population, or what the polite term is for a given condition, or that sort of thing.  Instead, it cares mostly about physical facts, of the type that you can determine with a well-designed trial or three.  The other RS-related guidelines are quite sufficient for these non-scientific statements.

Does anyone else have any thoughts about this new template?   () 02:52, 1 November 2009 (UTC)
 I think I'll use it a lot, and it will help shorten edit summaries and explanations ! [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] () 02:54, 1 November 2009 (UTC)

 Its contents &quot;MEDRS violation?&quot; were too cryptic; almost nobody outside our little circle would know what that means. I  it to &quot;Reliable medical source?&quot;. Like SandyGeorgia, I think it could be useful; this is true regardless of whether it was used well or poorly in its first use. Also, I noticed that  says &quot;please do not use this template to create a new sub-template without discussing and justifying the need for it at &quot;, so I just now created a thread  to give that project a heads-up.  () 06:19, 1 November 2009 (UTC)
Scope of this guideline

This guideline implicitly defines its scope as all medical articles. While reasonable in principle this is probably not precisely what is intended, or at least should not be. I believe the situation is parallel to , which generally talks about biographic articles but really means biographic information in any article.

Here are two real examples of the problem. 

* Thalidomide doesn't have a section &quot;Thalidomide in popular culture&quot;, but it does have something that comes close: Thalidomide#Notable children affected. 
* List of common misconceptions#Human body and health contains medical advice about sugar/hyperactivity, wet weather/common cold, sleepwalking, vitamin A/eyesight and duct tape/warts.

The first problem is addressed by a paragraph in . It makes clear that for non-medical sections in medical articles there is a relaxed standard. It does not try to define this standard; clearly such an attempt would be out of proportion in this guideline. It would be more efficient to delegate this to .

I can't see that the more serious second problem is addressed anywhere: Medical information in List of common misconceptions seems to be outside the scope of this guideline! Therefore I propose adding a new section at the end of the lead:

&quot;For simplicity this guideline refers to medical articles. This is not meant to restrict or define its scope: This guideline applies to medical information in all articles.

  11:12, 2 November 2009 (UTC)

 You're absolutely right that the guideline is intended to apply to all medical facts and figures, regardless of whether the overall article topic is exclusively medical; this is already indicated by the guideline's title of medicine-related articles). But rather than introduce that disclaimer, I think it'd be better to systematically fix the language in the guideline to make this clearer; that way readers won't have to know about the disclaimer in order to understand the rest of the article. I  (it was a surprisingly small change).  () 18:10, 2 November 2009 (UTC)

 Not sure if this adds anything, but the  category is called &quot;Health and medicine&quot;, and there's also the &quot;Psychology&quot; and &quot;Biology&quot; categories.  [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] () 18:27, 2 November 2009 (UTC)

Hans, is there an active dispute that centers around this distinction, or is this purely hypothetical?   () 03:27, 3 November 2009 (UTC)

 Neither. I am afraid there may be a dispute at List of common misconceptions sooner or later. I feel rather strongly about us not distributing medical misinformation based on random newspaper reports. And as you know people tried to argue that MEDRS must be applied to our reporting of a political controversy in the past, at Aspartame controversy.   07:53, 16 November 2009 (UTC)

 Excellent thread Hans, and thanks to Eubulides for the simple fix. (I notice a couple places where more of this type of fix can be done. I'll take a whack at it.) MEDRS doesn't replace RS, but supplements it: &quot;These guidelines supplement the general guidelines at Wikipedia:Reliable sources...&quot; In any given medical article or article that contains biomedical information, MEDRS applies to the scientific nitty gritty details, not to the political, controversial, historical and cultural details. That is still covered by RS. That which is falsifiable will often come under the scope of this guideline. --  () 14:59, 16 November 2009 (UTC)

Need for  noticeboard

I have started [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard#Need_for_WP:MEDRS.2FN_noticeboard a thread] and hope readers here will chime in there:

We need a parallel noticeboard to deal with medical sourcing: . Currently such matters end up at  and , but that's unsatisfactory. We need a separate noticeboard which is watched by medical professionals who understand the complexities of medical matters and medical research, understand our RS policy, and understand the MEDRS guideline. What think ye?

 That discussion seems to have arrived at a consensus not to create a new noticeboard. There is longstanding consensus on this talk page that specific issues should be discussed on ,   or , so I suggest moving the next two threads off this page (where they are getting ignored) and onto one of the other pages.

 At least we all agree that this talk page shouldn't be used for that purpose, but when the other places say to come here, and the RS noticeboard is often useless for this purpose, we're left with the need for a WP:MEDRS/N. What should be done? It's frustrating when an obvious need is being ignored. The very fact that this MEDRS variation of the RS guideline exists at all reveals the need for a special place for MEDRS issues to be discussed. The closest thing that sometimes works is the , but it's not limited to medical subjects, and it doesn't have a cadre of editors who watch it who are specifically interested in RS issues. I agree that this talk page isn't really the proper venue, but until we establish a MEDRS/N, it's the closest thing available. When this door is closed, at least open another one. --  () 15:13, 2 December 2009 (UTC)

Conference abstracts

Is there any guidance anywhere on the use of conference abstracts and symposia?  My find function doesn't turn anything up, and who wants to read all that      Wikipedia's rules:[[WP:SIMPLE|simple]]/[[WP:POL|complex]] 13:38, 3 December 2009 (UTC)
See  for a related discussion. I don't think it resulted in any changes to the guideline. What is your opinion on the issues? ° 15:39, 3 December 2009 (UTC)
Interesting, but no real consensus on a change...  My understanding is conference presentations are essentially preliminary results that are &quot;reviewed&quot; by the presenters - you don't want to look stupid if you're wrong but you want to get your ideas out there (particularly if they are interesting).  I would be inclined to use such documents with extreme caution, particularly if it's .  If you're presenting a poster or abstract on 6 patients, but your ultimate N is 60, it's very easy to get skewed results.  I'd basically be inclined to use it somewhere between the preliminary results discussed in  and  and as soon as secondary sources were produced, replace it.  It's somewhat of a moot point, since we're supposed to use mainly review articles, but what do you do when the first publication was in 2008?  Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency is the reason I ask the question incidentally, and a good test case since it's reporting results from a symposium.     Wikipedia's rules:[[WP:SIMPLE|simple]]/[[WP:POL|complex]] 16:18, 3 December 2009 (UTC)
I'd deal with that by stating &quot;John Doe, of The University of Exurbs, presented some preliminary research at the 2009 ASCB meeting in San Diego which suggested that K-Ras controls p53 ubiquitination.&quot; I'd only include it if this was vital to the topic and was a real breakthrough (you'd need secondary sources for that conclusion eg newspapers or journal news articles). I would never use a source like that to state &quot;K-Ras controls p53 ubiquitination&quot;.  () 17:42, 3 December 2009 (UTC)
&lt;&gt; Abstracts are subjected to much more minimal peer review than publications. Generally, the authors are given a great deal of benefit-of-the-doubt that wouldn't be the case if they were submitting a manuscript for publication. This is true at the major meetings where I've submitted and reviewed abstracts, so I suspect it to be even more the case for smaller meetings. The idea behind an abstract is that the authors will present their actual data in detail at the meeting and this will stimulate interest/discussion from the meeting audience. They aren't really intended to be a final record of scientific truth. In particular, any abstract which is more than a couple of years old and has not been turned into a full-fledged publication should probably be viewed with at least gentle skepticism. [http://abstracts.hematologylibrary.org/cgi/content/abstract/108/11/1964 Here] is some interesting reading on the subject - in abstract form, no less.   19:02, 3 December 2009 (UTC)
I'll raise your OR with some anecdotal evidence. I misspelled the organism I was working on in my first conference abstract. It was published with that glaring error uncorrected.  () 19:29, 3 December 2009 (UTC)
I'm expecting  to come along any minute with some original research on abstract reliability, only his will have been published in an academic journal. (see  for the last time this happened) :-) ° 20:00, 3 December 2009 (UTC)
So there's no guidance on the subject that can help me with a current question, but is it worth drafting some?  Though I'm sure we can discuss on talk pages that &quot;X source is a conference abstract and therefore preliminary&quot;, it's always better/easier to point to something like .  Personally I'd be quite reluctant to use an abstract, and replace it ASAP with the actual article once published.

I would agree that they're primary sources, and (relative to the standards we normally expect of medical pages) fairly poor ones at that.  Not that they don't have a limited place...  Changes look good, even a mention to illustrate they aren't a &quot;first choice&quot; source is good.     Wikipedia's rules:[[WP:SIMPLE|simple]]/[[WP:POL|complex]] 23:42, 3 December 2009 (UTC)

I think that they ought to be considered .  Different conferences have different standards -- even multiple standards, depending on whether it's a simple poster or a keynote lecture -- but as a general rule, there's no editorial control.   () 23:55, 3 December 2009 (UTC)

Sorry to raise this thread from its deathbed, but it might be worth looking at how the Center for Integrative Medicine at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center approaches conference abstracts:
The problem with these [conference] abstracts is that they do not contain all the available details of the study methodology and data, and are not reviewed by experts in the same field (peer-reviewed) for how well the data supports the conclusions. In fact, it is not uncommon for such abstracts to be subsequently published in greater detail in peer-reviewed scientific and clinical journals with modified conclusions from the original abstract, or to be rejected for publication because the methodology or data was judged to not support the conclusions. Because of this problem with abstracts, the CIMER Web site has a policy for its content of only drawing conclusions from the most carefully reviewed information available in complete articles published in peer-reviewed journals. [http://www.mdanderson.org/education-and-research/resources-for-professionals/clinical-tools-and-resources/cimer/therapies/index.html]
This mirrors the approach (and reasoning) we should be using fairly closely, and might be a useful addition (or not). Anyhow...   21:32, 15 January 2010 (UTC)
 Thanks, I  with this edit: &quot;; often they have no review at all and are : they are often unreviewed , and their conclusions are often significantly changed or rejected for peer-reviewed publication.&quot;  () 22:53, 15 January 2010 (UTC)

Question about MEDRS, definitions and science articles

Hello all,

I'm more and more convinced that the definitions used in MEDRS are unjustifiably limited to medical articles.  The definitions found at  gives the impression that a peer-reviewed article on a scientific subject is a secondary source, when really if there is any debate the appropriate secondary source would be a review article.  Is there any discussion elsewhere that points to this?  For a celebutard's personal life, a news article is appropriate, but for a discussion of the impact of different drivers on human bipedalism, a review article would seem a better source than a journal article - where it is easy to cherry-pick sources to provide the illusion of being a respected hypothesis.  Any wikilinks to policies or guidelines that would be helpful to me?     Wikipedia's rules:[[WP:SIMPLE|simple]]/[[WP:POL|complex]] 13:14, 21 January 2010 (UTC)
I agree that we should seek to extend the MEDRS definitions (or something similar) to all science articles, perhaps as . As this is certainly going to be controversial amongst certain crowds, care should be taken to broach the topic in an unimpeachable way in order to avoid being interminably bound up in wikilawyering. I'd suggest that  is the place to discuss it and that , ,  and  should all be notified of the discussion. Before doing so, you may want to draft a strawman in your userspace. You may find it helpful to read , , the mainspace article Scientific consensus, and their talkpages.  [[User talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl]] 19:08, 21 January 2010 (UTC)
 was attempted at one point. Please feel free to revive it.  () 20:02, 21 January 2010 (UTC)

WLU, the sort of review articles that you're talking about are journal articles:  they're just not the only possible kind of journal articles.  Have you asked the folks at PSTS to address this?   () 20:19, 21 January 2010 (UTC)

 I have tried to follow up at this by making  to  that explicitly mention original research papers as examples of primary sources, and review articles as secondary. I've also followed up with discussion at . I don't know if these changes will stick (I'm no expert on the arcane points of Wikipedia policy).  () 21:02, 21 January 2010 (UTC)

You'd be surprised how inexperienced and wrong many contributors to policy talk page discussions can be. Please, the more of our brightest and most experienced medical editors who offer help tweak and keep an eye on those pages, the better. It can be a hard battle but if we let folk undermine our policies upon which our guidelines are built, then everything falls apart.
I would like to add one point: PST should be judged not just by what type of source it is, but by what facts are being drawn from it. For example, any source can be a primary source for some piece of information (like the fact that so-and-so published such-and-such and when). Any discussion on PSTS that fails to acknowledge that is being too simplistic IMO. ° 22:31, 21 January 2010 (UTC)
Thanks for the many replies and wikilinks - I'll read through them.  My apologies for not responding to all the posts on this one, I got caught up on editing a couple articles and this completely slipped my mind.
WAID, I agree that review articles are journal articles, but the guidance provided here about review articles, textbook chapters and summaries by official bodies taking precedence over single pieces of research was a powerful revelation to me as an editor and struck me as being the best way to ensure DUE weight.  I haven't asked anyone at PST to respond, and I should have, thanks for the idea.
Colin, I also agree.  However, there's a vast gulf between &quot;X said Y about Z&quot; and &quot;There is general agreement that A is the cause of B&quot;.  Like reporters &quot;balancing&quot; views on vaccination with notorious deniers and celebrities, by reporting &quot;X said Y about Z&quot; it gives significant weight to the idea that X is an expert on Z and that Y is true.  For new editors (and particularly) for POV-pushers, cherry picking (particularly in fringe areas) can easily lead to Medical Hypotheses being cited as a source about AIDS denialism.  More explicit guidance on what a secondary source is and why it takes precedence would be quite helpful.  This whole thing was brought about by a  on bipedalism trying to force the idea that the 'wading hypothesis' (a fringe with the fringe theory of the aquatic ape hypothesis) is a serious contender to explain bipedalism.  Single sources were cited to support this across multiple years, but realistically the theory was not considered serious or useful by paleoanthropologists (though possibly changing ).  So, is citing single sources saying &quot;X said Y about Z&quot; a good idea in this case, or an example of undue weight on an unproven, unaccepted hypothesis?  In my mind an emphasis on secondary (i.e. review) sources in this case would neatly solve this problem.  In this case I would say the facts were accurate, but still disproportionate.  Perhaps this is a point to be made at WP:UNDUE rather than WP:RS...    Wikipedia's rules:[[WP:SIMPLE|simple]]/[[WP:POL|complex]] 13:55, 25 January 2010 (UTC)
 I am likewise concerned about the application of MEDRS but for the converse reason, and that is the editing policy of some editors to classify article X as a &quot;medical article&quot; and therefore treat any information as falling under MEDRS at their convenience.  As far as I can see the scope definition for MEDRS is given in the opening two sentences: &quot;Wikipedia's articles, while not intended to provide medical advice, are nonetheless an important and widely used source of health information. Therefore, it is vital that biomedical information in articles be based on reliable published sources and accurately reflect current medical knowledge.&quot;  To me, a reasonable interpretation of this would be:
# It applies to any Wikipedia article which includes biomedical information, however
# It only applies to the accuracy of that biomedical information.  Elsewhere straight  applies.
So for example the statement that &quot;Actor X is HIV positive&quot; is making no medical claims about HIV, so MEDRS does not apply here (though there is a host of other policies and guidelines which do govern the inclusion of such content).  If this is not the case then we need to tighten up the guideline wording.  I am not a medical expert, but I do expect that MEDRS be sufficiently clear in its scope that even any competent editor can sensibly interpret it. --  () 00:09, 26 February 2010 (UTC)
 Yes, the intent of the opening sentence is to apply to the biomedical information in an article, independently of whether the article's topic is itself biomedical.  () 00:27, 26 February 2010 (UTC)
Moreover, even if the the article's topic is itself broadly biomedical, it shouldn't be applied to remove information that is not MEDRS but is valid for the article.  For example one might argue that a specialist subject such HIV-1 is entirely MEDRS in scope, but the AIDS covers history and social aspects which are clearly outside MEDRS.  One the other hand in the case of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome which is also both an medical subject and also has social and other aspects, editors in the past have successfully argued to exclude RS material because it falls outside MEDRS.  Of course we should exclude biomedical on MEDRS criteria, but for non-biomedical content RS and not MEDRS should apply. --  () 01:46, 26 February 2010 (UTC)
 Sorry, but I'm afraid that things are not as black-and-white as the previous comment suggests, as it's not always the case that &quot;material&quot; is clearly biomedical or clearly non-biomedical. Furthermore, in controversial areas like CFS and AIDS it's even more important than usual to employ high-quality sources, and the advice given in  is particularly good advice to use in such areas. For the history of AIDS, for example, the question of where AIDS started and how it spread is clearly biomedical, as are many social aspects of AIDS involving transmission of disease.  () 04:15, 26 February 2010 (UTC)
Clearly we don't live in a world of black and white, but the whole purpose of having policies and guidelines is to help us move towards more objective discriminants.  For example,  states that in the case of submitting content &quot;The burden of evidence lies with the editor who adds or restores material&quot;.  What I hate is when some editor justifies that his revert or whatever is &quot;because of MEDRS&quot;, but when you ask a perfectly reasonable Q such as &quot;what aspect of this content breaches what specific aspect of MEDRS&quot;, the editor doesn't give a direct reply and instead just repeats &quot;it's MEDRS silly&quot; or words to that effect.   This whole idea of having a trump card up your sleeve to drag out when convenient without explanation doesn't work for me.  In such grey areas, the editor citing MEDRS must be willing to define what elements of the content fall under MEDRS and also which specific aspects of MEDRS are breached.  Otherwise it isn't a sound edit and it therefore doesn't deserve to stand. --  () 15:32, 26 February 2010 (UTC)

We expect editors to use their best judgment, and to apply guidelines like this one with 'common sense and the occasional exception.'
Have you read the last half of the section on popular press?  It gives several examples of information that are often not best sourced to the peer-reviewed scientific literature.   () 20:59, 26 February 2010 (UTC)

Medicine or medical?

This guideline appears to be about medical articles, but it's titled &quot;medicine&quot;.   () 17:05, 21 March 2010 (UTC)

No, it's not.  It's title is &quot;medicine-related articles&quot;.  There is a difference between a 'medicine article' and a medicine-related article'.   () 22:30, 21 March 2010 (UTC)

Assessing the evidence

We talked about this a while ago and never got very far.  My bold change rearranges a bit, but it's the first and last paragraphs that are (mostly) new.  

I didn't get very far with wordsmithing, so if you've got any ideas about how to improve it, please go ahead.   () 00:32, 27 March 2010 (UTC)
