		<segment id="id66838654">Very good introductions of primary papers as MEDRS


I'm not really suggesting a policy change here, just noting something interesting and asking for feedback. One thing I've noticed about the form of papers in some fields is that they tend to provide an introductory literature review of the related topic. These can be very good, though tend to be &quot;thematic&quot; rather than &quot;systematic&quot; so if a recent systematic review exists a reader should probably look at this as well. What do we think about these introductions - they do place other papers in context and if you can find, say, a systematic review from 2003, or a very good introduction from a primary paper then is it actually better to use the review from 2003?  () 04:45, 20 January 2021 (UTC)
This has been discussed before, so you may find something in the archives. The guideline currently says . This is indeed a secondary-source / secondary-literature portion of the paper, wrt our overall sourcing policies, just not a very good one. My understanding is that when the research paper is peer reviewed, that section is not critically examined, other than for obvious whoppers perhaps. There are other people here who may know more/better. The intro could indeed be focused just on one area of the subject that the research seeks to confirm or reject, and not give a balanced picture. The wording may not be as careful as a dedicated review. Of course, any review can be biased or badly written. I don't think it is straightforward to always decide whether to favour systematic vs narrative or by date, as the context can matter and they serve different roles. If what the article is saying is non-contentious and hasn't changed for many years, nobody should care all that much if the review is old, and it may be no newer one has been done simply because there is no new research to systematically review. -- ° 10:01, 20 January 2021 (UTC)
&quot;Thematic&quot; is a great description of those sections.   () 16:57, 21 January 2021 (UTC)

Possible-over broad application of this guideline
This guideline is being cited to prevent New York magazine from being used  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard#Are_New_York_Magazine_and_Infection_Control_Today_reliable_sources_for_the_idea_that_COVID-19_leaked_from_a_Chinese_lab?] because of claims by some editors that a discussion of the historical origins of a disease are biomedical information, and therefore subject to this policy, rather than . It would, once the dust settles, be prudent to decide when this guideline applies, and to narrow its scope if necessary, so that it clearly reflects its intent, which seems to be to prevent harm to those who rely on Wikipedia for medical advice, rather applying it as a catch-all to all medical information, even information which could have no conceivable influence on the treatment or medical actions of any individual.  () 08:37, 18 January 2021 (UTC)
Many times, people asking and responding to reliable source questions are over-simplifying things. While sometimes it is possible to name a publication (The Daily Mail, for example) and get consensus they are not a reliable source for nearly anything, other times one must narrow things a bit to what kind of article it was, whether the author was a staff writer or guest, what the article actually claimed vs what we actually claim, etc. A guest opinion piece offering a controversial hypothesis is quite a different kind of piece from an obituary on Phil Spector, who got arrested for entering the Capitol without an invite, political speculation on who Trump might pardon...
I believe MEDRS is simply the consequence of applying project-wide consensus on reliable sourcing, original research, apportioning weight to our coverage of topics, etc. Whether or not one believes MEDRS applies to X or Y doesn't shift things, since the fundamentals can still be determined in any individual case from core policy/guideline: all it does is get us to the answer a bit quicker sometimes. I think some editors have misunderstood the scope of MEDRS and are confusing things that are politics or economics or history just because Covid.  But also there's a lot of political agenda pushing going on. And when one is in a fight, it is tempting to want black and white rules, rather than admit it can be complicated. I don't think this particular issue is complicated at all: a novelist writing a radical opinion piece in a weekend magazine is not a reliable source for all that much really, and  is core policy. -- ° 15:40, 18 January 2021 (UTC)
If I understand you correctly, you agree that MEDRS is NOT the correct guideline to use when evaluating the New Yorker article, but that in your opinion, the article fails on the basis of . That’s certainly a valid argument, even if one doesn’t agree with the conclusion. My primary concern here  is the over-broad application of MEDRS, which doesn’t appear to contradict your position.  () 02:12, 19 January 2021 (UTC)
No I didn't say that. Determining the origin of a novel virus is medical science, so would come under MEDRS. I don't think this is a good example of something that fails to be in scope for MEDRS. I suggest that if you want a discussion about what is in scope or out of scope, then that would be a lot easier, and less likely to generate unhelpfully polarised responses, if the source=&gt;text question wasn't one that clearly failed WP:V too, and wasn't a political hot potato. I think those cases where people are misapplying MEDRS, the guideline doesn't itself need changed: it is those editors who need to remember that not everything about covid is medical science. -- ° 08:58, 19 January 2021 (UTC)
The story about SARS-CoV-2's origin as an accidental lab leak is now being pushed with a Feature story from a magazine best known for reviewing consumer electronics.  
Aside from the difficulty that the facts don't line up, these are remarkably illogical stories.  They usually explicitly say, out of one side of their mouths, that it's not a man-made virus, and then they write three thousand words about how COVID-19's origins could be a lab leak, at least if you ignore most of the facts and don't know anything about viruses.  One wonders how the virus got into the lab that it supposedly leaked from in the first place, if the same story says that it neither originated inside the lab nor outside of the lab.  I would not recommend using such a confused, illogical source under any circumstances.  () 16:56, 21 January 2021 (UTC)
That's right - the &quot;natural lab leak&quot; story just doesn't seem to make any sense. In general it is dispiriting how un-tethered from decent sources much of the Talk page argument on this topic is.  has it right,  is just our usual sourcing standards on steroids. When we have several good sources that directly address the question of the virus' origin, it just baffles me why editors want to swerve around and use something weaker instead. Actually, it doesn't baffle me: the reason is that this is a POV-battle between some editors, with politics lurking in the background.  () 17:04, 21 January 2021 (UTC)

Text shuffling at Choosing sources # Biomedical journals
Hi all, I reorganized some text in  in an effort to make the section flow better. The old section discussed reviews, then primary publications, then reviews again, then primary publications again, then back to reviews. The hope here was to bring like material together. I find this kind of edit difficult to parse on the diff viewer (since it shows large chunks of text deleted and added), so here's a side-by-side view so folks can check what was done more easily:



|}

I suggest the following statement concerning Primary Sources (PS) to be revised OR completely eliminated from the intro as contradictory to  and both dogmatic, confusing and misleading relatively to the title under which this article exist, and generally flawed. Just for comparison:

 The Title: 
 The Guide: «Primary sources should generally not be used for medical content» — Ruthlessly and indiscriminately excluding a whole range of potentially useful primary sources.

Too many contributors took this statement as unquestionable rule or misapplied it even though it's neither strictly a policy (), nor a firm guide. Not just only it's contradictory to the said goals but it's directly in violation with  (from  policy, and many other useful advises: , ) which clearly state that primary sources may be used with care. The most recent and fresh example is here: ; the contribution amended contained mostly primary sources. It was inevitably and ruthlessly amended even though  under this guideline they are perfectly reliable to the information they were given.

If revised I suggest to lift the restriction on PS and allow to add primary-sourced information strongly on discussion and -basis (if challenged) unless such information is clearly misleading or if PS used are used to back up statements clearly out of scope of the former. [[User:Alexander_Davronov|AXONOV]]  

EDIT: If you are not truly interested in this discussion or judge lightly and superficially please avoid getting involved.

*No. I don't support this at all.  () 17:56, 20 March 2021 (UTC)
I've been working off and on in the area for about 14 years. Wikipedia  has determined that it's focus is on the summary of biomedical information, an overview of the research, and because there are readers who use Wikipedia for biomedical information, primary sources- new research that has not been replicated is a risk for readers looking for medical information. This has been discussed many many times and nothing has convinced me that we should throw out WP: MEDRS.  () 18:18, 20 March 2021 (UTC)
  I seek either to loosen or detail the quoted guide line which indiscriminately prohibits everything that deems to be primary without due concern for actual statements these PS are used for. On the other side, where do think all those researchers coming here out of curiosity would find clues for their future study seeing no (notable based on consensus) frontline studies/reporting mentioned? Should be always resort to consensus based contributions in case of PS-backed up contributions? --[[User:Alexander_Davronov|AXONOV]]   20:09, 20 March 2021 (UTC)
Exactly. I don't support loosening the guide at all. This is a collaborative-based project so yes we resort to consensus.  Please read the other comments here which explain when primary sources could be considered.  () 20:31, 20 March 2021 (UTC)
   Well but this is not subject to any guideline so guidelines cannot be used to justify reverts. You may question  by requesting more related sources but this is often unwarranted as statements aren't seriously bold.--[[User:Alexander_Davronov|AXONOV]]   21:27, 20 March 2021 (UTC)

*Oppose. The tilt to prefer secondary sources for biomedical content is one of the wisest s Wikipedia has. Without it Wikipedia could (for example) be complicit in health scams like the MMR autism scandal, and numerous others. MEDRS does not absolutely prohibit primary sources, so the proposal is a bit disingenuous in any case.  () 18:21, 20 March 2021 (UTC)
   I totally agree with this but I hardly see it as good justification to disallow indiscriminately a whole range of sources. It has nothing to do with identification of reliability as it falls directly under  which clearly disallow making any research here so it should be applied respectively. (Under OR I mean leap-logic conclusions based on speculative researches, kind of casuistry, facts-broadening etc.)--[[User:Alexander_Davronov|AXONOV]]   20:09, 20 March 2021 (UTC)
Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, a tertiary text. It is thus primarily built on secondary sources. If we bypass those and start picking out primary sources which secondary sources have ignored, then we become an ersatz secondary text and that indeed, is a species of , which is to be avoided. We are meant to reflect accepted knowledge, and that is predominantly found in high-quality secondary and tertiary sources. 20:15, 20 March 2021 (UTC)
  Of course we should not trash anything. That's the -venue. The secondary sources are always preferred but aren't required under any threat of punishment. Some too vehemently defend rules which are rather more harmful than the harm they were intended to prevent.--[[User:Alexander_Davronov|AXONOV]]   21:27, 20 March 2021 (UTC)

*The statement about primary research articles not being generally suitable as sources has widespread support, and has done since the guideline was created in 2006. Many people, coming from a scientific background where they are expected to review the primary research literature, find this confusing. They want to write their own literature reviews as Wikipedia articles. They may even think they know better than the people who do write reviews and get them published, and that process is too darn slow! The kind of things Wikipedia lets people use primary sources for, could theoretically also be used for these primary research papers: that in 2017 some researchers did a study with a number of participants and claimed certain results and published them in 2019. In that sense it is similar to citing a book for the facts that Joe wrote a book about plants and published it in 2021. But just like we can't cite that book to claim &quot;Joe's book on plants is the authoritative reference to which all others are compared&quot;, we can't cite a primary research paper and claim drug X cures disease Y. So people try to slip the details of a study, as a proxy for its conclusions, into Wikipedia all the time. The problem is, on its own, we don't know if the medical/scientific community consider that study or its findings to be notable or even agree on its conclusions: do they affect clinical practice or accepted thinking about a disease, say? , policy, requires editors consider the weight of some fact/opinion in the secondary literature. MEDRS is the application of policy to medical article sourcing, and editors adding text sourced solely to primary research papers are nearly always violating policy. -- ° 18:29, 20 March 2021 (UTC)
   This problem deserves to be addressed IMO but the way it's done here is a bit overkill. I suspect it's resulted from misunderstanding of difference between policy and guideline and purposes of different policies in general.--[[User:Alexander_Davronov|AXONOV]]   20:09, 20 March 2021 (UTC)
That's unlikely to be the problem, since  is pretty minimal.  () 02:05, 22 March 2021 (UTC)

   Well notability criteria is a subject to  guideline so the one should be followed respectively. The thumb rule is evidence of coverage. [[User:Alexander_Davronov|AXONOV]]   20:09, 20 March 2021 (UTC)

* The fact that your reverted edit in a featured article cited primary sources does not mean that this was the only reason why it was deservedly reverted. Exceptional, consensus-based inclusion of information from primary sources is perfectly allowed; adding them before discussing them or asking for consensus would mean opening Wikipedia to endless questionable material. Also, nobody takes anything lightly or superficially here, so your &quot;EDIT&quot; was uncalled for.  () 19:26, 20 March 2021 (UTC)
  This one is to deter those who have little time or interest in reasonable objection. The questionable things here are covered by  policy and reasonably disallowed to be introduced.--[[User:Alexander_Davronov|AXONOV]]   20:09, 20 March 2021 (UTC)
Alexander, you disclosed the problem when you said &quot;potentially useful&quot;. Potentially useful as long as every Wikipedian editor was as intelligent, educated, wise, correct, well read, neutral and fair as me. The rules Wikipedia has are very much a result of its open editing policy: anyone can edit. If we selected editors among those who could be trusted and who had the appropriate qualifications and experience to write articles about the state of medical research/knowledge/practice, and for whom citing the primary literature was merely a professional courtesy, we wouldn't need MEDRS. -- ° 21:35, 20 March 2021 (UTC)
  Well I totally agree but at least for some cases we could leave the door a bit open so the primary stuff can be allowed to be discussed and iron-rule wouldn't be an easy excuse for those who want to prevent everything non-secondary-tertiary etc. without having decent cause. [[User:Alexander_Davronov|AXONOV]]   21:40, 20 March 2021 (UTC)
 doesn't have an &quot;If editors on the talk page agree, then they can ignore this policy&quot; exemption. If secondary sources do not give that primary research weight, then neither should we. And we have to live with the restrictions that imposes on us: we will not be as quick to report the latest research. One can buy a newspaper for that. -- ° 21:47, 20 March 2021 (UTC)

* It's of no use to argue the MEDRS guideline here. First, every editor who commented disagrees with you;  no one thinks there should be changes, and that's a consensus. Second, a change to this guideline would require larger community input. None of us here can give anyone &quot;permission&quot; to change a community supported guideline even if we wanted to.  () 22:13, 20 March 2021 (UTC)
   That's doubtful. It took less than that to introduce challenged provision into this Guide in 2014. Why should it take more than that? There is no reason. --[[User:Alexander_Davronov|AXONOV]]   20:46, 21 March 2021 (UTC)

*And I will add my voice to those opposing this for basically the reasons given above. There is a huge quantity of primary research studies out there, many of which contradict each other and/or are not replicated. Only academic experts are qualified to sort this out and to write literature reviews. If we water down the guidance here then it opens the door to major inaccuracies and  violations via editors (even accidentally) cherry-picking certain studies and presenting them as truth.   03:12, 21 March 2021 (UTC)
*A likely belated oppose changing MEDRS primary guidance - the OP here appears to be attempting to form an argument that MEDRS violates Wikipedia principles, but has formed no such argument and merely says people abuse it. If people are abusing a guideline to inappropriately revert policy-compliant edits (which I haven't seen any evidence of here), the correct solution is to form a consensus that the edit is permitted by policy and as such is not outweighed by the guideline. I also take issue with saying that this &quot;ruthlessly and indiscriminately exclud[es] a whole range of potentially useful primary sources&quot; - because yet again, no evidence supporting such claim has been provided. MEDRS guidance on primary sources is primarily to clarify three sections of  - which is a policy - specifically &quot;not directory&quot; (not a directory of studies published on a topic), &quot;not textbook/scientific journal&quot; (not a collection of studies on a topic), and &quot;not indiscriminate&quot; (WP is selective in what it covers both in terms of article topics and content, and does not simply include information because it exists). So, at its base, any semblance of an argument the OP here is attempting to make is hot air at best. This isn't to mention that the OP seems to claim that this guideline prohibits primary sources for medical content - which it doesn't - it just makes clear that most information can be reliably sourced to secondary sources, and that which can't better be damn important to include if it can only be sourced to primary sources. To put it simply, if information doesn't violate , it can almost always be sourced to secondary sources, which policy states are preferred, and as such, the use of primary sources for medical topics is almost always unnecessary. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez (/) 03:33, 21 March 2021 (UTC)

*Oppose MEDRS is good and makes sense. The world needs more things that are good and make sense, not fewer.  () 19:14, 24 March 2021 (UTC)

Intermediate note
I the wake of claims made above I made a little research on history on challenging Primary sources use prohibition. If you are interested here is some back-story:--[[User:Alexander_Davronov|AXONOV]]   20:46, 21 March 2021 (UTC)
* 


I'm sorry you went to this trouble. You will not be able to change this guideline to suit your desire to use primary sources unless you have community agreement. There are, as multiple editors have said above, times when, with consensus, a primary source can be used, but the guideline says, with care-caution. None of the discussions you've posted above indicate that a single editor with out agreement  changed the guideline in any substantial way. Editors who suggested changes did so because they had some agreement and discussion. Doc James, a highly experienced editor in this area, as you saw, tightened the guideline but did so knowing he had some agreement. You have no agreement/ consensus here to change anything and in fact you have multiple opposes. I'd really suggest you edit for awhile to get the hang of a collaborative community and environment; it can take awhile to realize that no single editor has the power to make changes against community consensus-community meaning multiple editors from a few to many depending on the circumstances. The MEDRS guideline protects against research that has not yet been reviewed-viewed in context of other research, replicated, shown to have some veracity in light of other research.  () 22:04, 21 March 2021 (UTC)

More evidence of abuse
It seems like the body of facts that  is highly abused just can't stop growing. Here is another case in which somehow the provision bubbled up in completely unrelated article: . I see it as serious problem which warrants clarification to this flawed guideline. My edits were literally reverted as I was adding more reliable sources along with primary one. This corrupt practice of undue reverts must be ended. I will allow this discussion to dangle for a bit longer than when said provisions were adopted in 2014. At least I expect parties who edit -linked articles occasionally have a voice here. --[[User:Alexander_Davronov|AXONOV]]   21:45, 23 March 2021 (UTC)
 What about this is &quot;abuse&quot;?  () 22:47, 23 March 2021 (UTC)
  This is a subsection of the ongoing discussion of the  provision starting at above. I provided additional case which clearly shows that  is abused to justify removal (reverting) of content which is &quot;deemed&quot; as poorly sourced (not always holds being true). --[[User:Alexander_Davronov|AXONOV]]   23:22, 23 March 2021 (UTC)
, you've been given advice on the  page to use instead the secondary sources that cite the primary ones. Yet on Malassezia you persist in writing about primary research studies, citing only those primary research studies. We don't do that. Your opinion regarding the importance of the studies (in the HTML comment: &quot;This is really interesting work worth noting it&quot;) is irrelevant. You need secondary sources to establish . -- ° 10:21, 24 March 2021 (UTC)
 I often see no people's efforts to actually showing me issues with sources in relationship with specific content or specific provisions of specific guidelines. I also see no evidence there was primary sources anywhere. I see no evidence of utter need to remove (revert anything in bulk) - save to exceptional cases.  Meanwhile, on other side, I see tons of evidence of controversy surrounding  and its flawed provision used to justify removing Wikipedia content with no due discretion or willing to discussion. Moreover, I see that the guideline's own supplemental  is constantly violated here (unsurprisingly).All this warrants serious changes and revision of the . Are you going to ignore all of this? If so, I'm going to call more parties  independent from  community as it seems that guideline established by it is seriously abused preventing others from constructive contributions or just even discussing matters. All new comers seems to be treated with contempt. In this guideline I propose to clarify that reverts of a big chunk of sourced statements must be followed by a clear explanation of reasons of such with specific links and details. Otherwise it should be considered no more than minor  act and punished accordingly. --[[User:Alexander_Davronov|AXONOV]]   11:02, 24 March 2021 (UTC)
The text you added to Malassezia talked about and referenced a primary research study, and cited the primary research paper that resulted from this (though you seem to have ended up with two references to the same paper). The &quot;Science Daily&quot; link is churnalism: at the bottom it says &quot;Story Source: Materials provided by NYU Langone Health / NYU School of Medicine.&quot;, in other words, a press release from the institute about their latest research. Please find a review paper, or textbook, or other respected secondary source for this material. I don't know how you can say &quot;I also see no evidence there was primary sources anywhere&quot;. I note that you are  on that article, and that this does not usually end well. I suggest you try to listen carefully to what multiple parties have advised, rather than making claims that a long-standing guideline is fundamentally flawed. -- ° 11:26, 24 March 2021 (UTC)
   Stop trying to take this discussion into a different venue. If you feel truly impartial do it please in respective discussion:  because this is a bit different topic. The problem discussed here doesn't concern whether sources were legit or not. It's about misapplication of  in order to abuse the right to remove sourced (non-verifiable as per , in bulk or not) content as &quot;unreliable&quot; from Wikipedia without burden of actually providing details on why and where, in which provision, for which text etc.. --[[User:Alexander_Davronov|AXONOV]]   12:43, 24 March 2021 (UTC)

If your problem is not so much with policy as what you perceive as editors abusing policy or guideline, then I suggest a visit to  to report the miscreants.

But that statement is about manufacturing process, not a scientific fact.  The other issue  raised with earlier text that said &quot;need&quot; rather than &quot;may still benefit from&quot; was that  is just an essay.  While some guidelines and policies do reference essays, we do need to be careful the reader isn't mislead or directed to some page that doesn't reflect community consensus and isn't widely accepted. There's also  to consider. We already link to , which is an , and not official guideline, and quite lengthy itself. If it isn't a biomedical claim, then for sure some other policy may apply, for example . Do we need to spell that out here? -- ° 16:06, 17 May 2021 (UTC)
Yes, accepted (tho maybe we could find another more &quot;scientific&quot; non-biomed claim?). I also agree that CREEP is a really relevant consideration. My (rather soft) rebuttal on this could be that this was a distinction that had me flummoxed (and to some extent still uncertain, as in the spurious manufacturing technology claim). And I've also seen the distinction raised several times on talk pages. So it sort of feels felt helpful to me, though others of course may disagree it turns out to be even more quirky than I'd thought. [Adding: While fully accepting the community-consensus points raised by Alexbrn and Colin, which I'd never really thought about before, fwiw, I have to admit to my ongoing editorial confusion on the subject - ouch!].

oppose spelling it -  is bloated enough. The  is already linked from the See also. [[User:Alexander_Davronov|AXONOV]]   19:01, 17 May 2021 (UTC)
I agree with the IP's edit summary notes that this shouldn't be a vote. Perhaps  could unbold his comment. See . I'm not sure how &quot;as in the spurious manufacturing technology claim&quot; helps the discussion: it reads a bit like an accusation of bad faith on my part, but perhaps you mean something else? I agree we could find an example that is clearly scientific but non-biomedical. And we could also find an example that fitted . Is that worth doing here, particularly when we have  to go into detail. For what it's worth, I think the example &quot;They are purple and triangular...&quot; is superfluous, contrived and not encyclopaedic in tone. So that could go. IP, I'm not opposed to mentioning SCIRS with an example, though not much convinced it is needed either, but I think that attempting to find the right words or agree on it being needed is better done on the talk page, than edit summaries. 
SCIRS is (quite openly) a copy/paste job of MEDRS with tweaks. Anyone reading it after MEDRS will be frustrated with deja-vu. I agree there are discussions about what is or is not in-scope for MEDRS, but they tend to occur more in conflict areas and get more attention/oxygen than represents actual every day editor confusion. An example of something fitting SCIRS might perhaps be so obvious the reader wonders why they need to be lectured about it, or so hair-splitting that the reader wonders why anyone would care, given both guidelines take a similar approach towards applying core policies. And some things belong so much in multiple domains that many guidelines or policies apply to different degrees (e.g., the whole Covid lab leak debacle is a right old mix of politics, biomedical science, politics, forensics, politics, crime, politics, current affairs and eventually political history). -- ° 20:26, 17 May 2021 (UTC)
@, thank you very much for taking the time to give your thoughts so clearly (something I really appreciate). Believe me, absolutely no &quot;spurious&quot; accusation was intended in my own artless stream of thoughts (misunderstandings being another notorious forum pitfall). You raise several points, some of which are frankly beyond my own limited ken of WP internal culture (not my preferred field). As I tried to indicate above, my intention was to address a real source of confusion that that I've experienced, and that I felt other contributors to MED content might conceivably share. But I seem to have been naive, and I'm also very aware of the invasive potential of CREEP... And, personally, I feel I should step back from this particular question. As regards the fictional Mr Foster and his spurious pills, fwiw, my own take was that it's the key guidance that really needs to be crystal clear (and if humour is a valid tool, so be it?). I agree that  is a lengthy page, but again (just speaking personally) I've found it genuinely helpful to clarify current guidance. By contrast, I sort of thinked I understanded the ruole of SCIRS, but now I din't...  () 11:03, 18 May 2021 (UTC)
If you are still looking for an example of non-biomedical content, then &quot;The high proportion of unsaturated fatty acids are also responsible for the relatively poor shelf life, as they cause sea buckthorn oil to turn rancid quickly&quot; (sourced to a review article in a journal whose head a Wikipedian disliiked) was once disputed as being promotional(!).  () 05:42, 25 May 2021 (UTC)
Now, I wish you'd wiki-linked sea buckthorn oil, as I wanted to look that up to see what it was. I'm still not convinced MEDRS needs to contain (lengthy!) sentences that aren't biomedical and have different sourcing needs. The explanatory supplement seems a more appropriate place for dealing with that kind of thing, and MEDRS concentrate on how to source biomedical claims. As an aside, I see the reference you refer to and it does read a bit promotional of this wonder oil. However, the fact claimed is part chemistry, part food/cosmetic retail/consumer issue, and not really a medical one despite being a medical journal. Other than that the author of a medical paper is assumed to be clever, is that really so much better a source than, say, a cookery book? Would editors who care about science facts prefer the source was some chemistry or consumer-product science/engineering source? I suppose the fact that certain fats go rancid quickly isn't controversial. -- ° 09:07, 25 May 2021 (UTC)
I think we assume that chemists know something about chemistry, and that the peer-review process, however flawed it may be, is more likely to uncover scientific problems than the book-publishing process.
I don't think the oil is used much for cooking, so a cookery book is probably not a relevant alternative.  It's mostly used in cosmetics.  IMO a book about cosmetics (especially if it focused on manufacturing) would also be reliable for this claim.  It is not controversial and there's no &quot;medical&quot; content in it.
That article also had a dispute over whether journal articles were reliable sources for the color of the substance, and I believe that at least two editors learned that skin tone is about color and not analogous to medical concepts such as muscle tone.  () 02:38, 27 May 2021 (UTC)

grantome

Is it OK to use grantome.com to cite an NIH grant abstract?  () 15:22, 12 June 2021 (UTC)
It's a search engine returning primary sources, so would be rather odd to use - where's the , would be the question? This sort of question would anyway be better asked at  (if noticeboard input is wanted); this page is for discussing changed to the  guidelines.  () 17:03, 12 June 2021 (UTC)


Unreliable social science research gets more attention than solid studies

Social science is unscientific by definition. Wikipedia is too politically biased to be useful for medics.  () 22:57, 22 June 2021 (UTC)

Social and behavioral sciences are not unscientific, they're just not hard sciences. And Wikipedia errs to the side of caution. E.g. a MD commented on Quora that Wikipedia chooses for one therapy method and declares it as the true therapy, while for MDs there are eight or nine different therapeutic options.  ()  23:32, 22 June 2021 (UTC)

I fail to see how what you describe is &quot;erring to the side of caution&quot;. What if Wikipedia chose the wrong one out of the nine therapies to declare as the one true therapy? Or, even if that one therapy were the best one for a plurality or majority of patients, what harm might be done to those of the minority that read that that therapy is the only option there is, not knowing that there are actually 8 or 9 other therapies available, one or more of which might with better for those individuals? meseemyth that erring on the side of caution would be to AVOID taking any particular hard stand on any particar treatment, and to just present all of the treatments neutrally.
