Hi all - we have an article about IVIG (and several individual brands of it,) but we don't seem to have an article about sub-cutaneous immunoglobulin.  Would anyone be interested in drafting such an article with me? I should have all the necessary journal access, and any that I don't should be coming up in the next couple weeks.  I admit that I do have a bit of a direct personal interest in the matter as I have CVID and am on igg infusions myself, but in any case view this as a pretty big article set to be missing.  Many newly diagnosed patients turn to Wikipedia for guidance (whether or not they necessarily should,) and IVIG vs SCIG is one of the bigger choices a newly diagnosed patient in need of some form of IGG will have to make.  () 01:17, 20 November 2015 (UTC)
Aside from mode of delivery and pharmacokinetics, IVIG and SCIG are quite similar. Perhaps they should be subsections of an article about immunoglobulin supplementation? Otherwise, there will be substantial duplication; the juxtaposition will improve understanding, IMHO.  —  () 01:47, 20 November 2015 (UTC)
I tend to agree with you, and will probably start a draft (which I'll link here) of such an article in my userspace tomorrow.  SCIG and IVIG are two subsets of immmunoglobulin supplementation, and that commonality is more significant than the mode of administration.  Best,  () 02:05, 20 November 2015 (UTC)
Immunoglobulin supplementation is also a redlink.  Is that the ideal name?  (Also, keep  in mind.  It's nice to have some solid med stuff there when we can.)   () 22:29, 20 November 2015 (UTC)
I was debating between Immunoglobulin supplementation and Immunoglobulin therapy.  I have the very beginnings of a draft started  - feel free to poke at it as you please.  the article about IVIG wasn't in very good shape to begin with, so it will likely take me some time to get the draft in to such shape that it wouldn't embarrass me to make this article live, heh.  I also still lack access to a few journal networks (UpToDate full access + Dynamed + Elsevier would all be nice - at least a couple of those are coming - but having access to EBSCO etc at least gives me decent access.)  I'd like to get a reasonably comprehensive and medrs compliant article up before I move it in to livespace. Our IVIG article isn't exactly stellar, and we had no mention of SCIG or IMIG anywhere pretty much.  () 02:49, 23 November 2015 (UTC)
I think you've made a good choice in the title, as it's more inclusive of both supplementation and other therapeutics (e.g. immunomodulation). This will be a busy week for me, but I'll return when I can. Also, I have access to just about everything, so while I cannot share the copyrighted papers with you, I am happy to paraphrase and discuss sources. —  () 04:34, 23 November 2015 (UTC)
*I've gotten a good start to the article (which is saying something, because bluntly, IVIG sucks.)  Once I've rewritten another section or four, I'll probably put it live and redirect IVIG to it.  And, why not, DYK it - I don't think I've even bothered to DYK enough stuff to hit the QPQ requirement yet, lol (though I shall certainly QPQ anyway.)  ()

Well, there's been a lot of committed activity on this topic and the NCGS material has now spread widely through some of our articles. The POV is being markedly recalibrated (e.g. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gluten-free_diet&amp;curid=708662&amp;diff=690480254&amp;oldid=690269730 in this lede to the edit]). By my understanding NGCS is something of a controversial condition the classification, diagnosis and treatment of which is rather up in the air. By contrast it seems to me Wikipedia is now rather certain on the topic. Could probably do with a look from better-qualified editors than me to judge.  () 17:26, 13 November 2015 (UTC)

There are doubts about pathogenesis, diagnosis protocol, and treatment, but it doesn't mean that the disease doesn't exist. Wikipedia doesn't have &quot;its own POV&quot;, Wikipedia must reflect the reality. If knowledge progresses, Wikipedia moves with it. Best regards. -- () 20:35, 13 November 2015 (UTC)

WikiProject Medicine participants may be good administrators

Participants here often create a lot of content and have to evaluate whether or not a subject is notable. I can imagine that the pharmaceuticals area may have issues with undeclared paid editing and sockpuppetery. Detecting and handling this must give you good experience.

Gun control

I wanted to seek the opinion of other WPMED editors regarding whether claims about gun control being effective/ineffective at reducing gun deaths fall under the purview of MEDRS. If so, we should remove a fair number of the sources in the article gun control because they are primary.   02:36, 11 November 2015 (UTC)
As a relative outsider I would think not. More a legal issue than a medical one. • • •  : 09:06, 11 November 2015 (UTC)

* MEDRS isn't the only sourcing page that prefers secondary sources to primary, or scholarly sources to mass media, or relatively recent sources to outdated ones, any of the other qualities that we think of as meaning &quot;MEDRS-compliant&quot;.

As WhatamIdoing says (I think). Not covered by MEDRS, but secondary sources preferable. , when adding material specific to the US, you need to make that clear.   () 16:26, 11 November 2015 (UTC)
MEDRS would seem to be a non-issue here. As Johnbod mentioned, a topic like this really should use secondary sources as it is a topic where we should [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Controversial_articles#Raise_source_quality raise source quality]. I'd be concerned if the article mostly used primary sources without even thinking of MEDRS. That being said, I'd consider this under MEDRS in a similar fashion as I would to say an occupational hazard topic. In a statement like, &quot;Does X affect the rate of Y?&quot; when Y is something clearly medical related such as death, it's a medical topic whether it's dealing with a pathogen, physical hazard, or something with a social mix.  () 16:37, 11 November 2015 (UTC)
Hmm - follow that logic too far &amp; most military histry would be under MEDRS. Something like the effect of different types of bullet is under MEDRS, but otherwise that people die when shot is not, nor are medical sources generally going to be the most appropriate for covering the issues.  () 17:13, 11 November 2015 (UTC)
There is nothing wrong with using MEDRS compliant sources in the article on gun control. Added on here [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gun_violence&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=690189725&amp;oldid=688730748] [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 20:55, 11 November 2015 (UTC)

...except Doc James moved the goalposts. The original question was abut removing sources from articles about gun control if they did not meet the MEDRS standard -- a very controversial and contentious idea. Doc James changed it to using sources that meet the MEDRS standard where such sources exist, which everyone agrees is a good thing. -- () 22:08, 11 November 2015 (UTC)
There is nothing wrong with using MEDRS-compliant sources in that article.  There is, however, a problem with using exclusively medical sources when the subject is multi-disciplinary.  &quot;A neutral, balanced article&quot; does not result from using solely &quot;medical journals&quot; (and MEDRS is explicit that non-medical academic journals are not &quot;ideal&quot;) when the subject is legal, social, and philosophical, in addition to being medical.  I don't think that Doc James meant to imply that solely medical sources should be used in such an article.  Instead, I believe that he meant to say only that there is nothing wrong with using up-to-date, reputable, scholarly, secondary sources—from all the relevant disciplines, not just from medicine—in that article.   () 16:54, 12 November 2015 (UTC)
Well, let's hope so!  () 03:11, 14 November 2015 (UTC)
*So to reiterate: Obviously, as WAID said, the subject of gun control is not solely medical but multi-disciplinary. But as far as claims like &quot;a study in Social Science &amp; Medicine found that gun ownership was more strongly associated with gun suicides than with gun homicides.&quot; are concerned, do these types of claims qualify as medical enough to be required to pass MEDRS? That is the only question I want to hear answers to here. Thanks.   03:21, 15 November 2015 (UTC)
** Technically, &quot;Study X&quot; is always reliable for a statement that (accurately) says &quot;Study X found _____&quot;.  What you really need here is , which hasn't been written yet.  That's one of MEDRS' structural problems:  we aren't recommending independent-secondary-reputable-journal-etc. sources to determine whether or not the statement is verified by the cited source; we're recommending these to avoid providing undue emphasis to tiny minority POVs or results that may have been due to chance (p=0.05 = 5% chance that the study results were random—or higher, if the lab quietly did the study several times until they got the results that they expected).

I don't know enough about this area to know what's what, but I thought I'd bring it up here for a little more scrutiny from those who might.  For example, the page N-localizer seems largely devoted to this author, and the use of this particular technique/device has been added by this particular user across a number of pages related to radiology; oddly, a pubmed search for N-localizer only brings up two articles, written by this author, one of which appears to be trying to push against what they feel are &quot;misconceptions&quot; about who actually invented the technique/device...

A few thoughts.
*It's a bit troubling that the only three recent – and by &quot;recent&quot;, I mean &quot;from within the last decade&quot; – sources used for the article are authored by Russell (R.A.) Brown (once as sole author (2013) and twice with J.A. Nelson), the individual who really sdeems to want to have his contribution to this invention recognized.  Two of those papers are in Cureus, which has its own issues with a dubiously-speedy peer review process and generally poor reputation for quality control (see, for example, [http://scholarlyoa.com/2015/08/20/some-strange-goings-on-at-cureus/ Jeffrey Beall's blog], and note that Cureus is not MEDLINE indexed and does not have an impact factor).
*Without being an expert in this area, it's not immediately obvious whether this Wikipedia article represents a useful, primarily-historical perspective on the development of an important medical device, or whether it is a selective retelling which over-emphasizes the importance of (mostly) one individual.  Our articlee on the N-localizer is extremely light on information about current use of the device.
*With respect to MEDRS and sourcing, much of the sourcing in the article should be looked at with respect to whether or not it provides useful and balanced historical context, rather than whether or not it represents MEDRS-checklist-compliant current health information.  The near-exclusive reliance on Russell Brown's publications is likely problematic from the standpoint of assessing NPOV.  Current textbooks in stereotactic surgery would probably be very helpful to provide context.
*While the term N-localizer is seldom used in PubMed-indexed articles and abstracts, it appears that devices of which it forms a part get better coverage; see [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?cmd=search&amp;term=Brown-Roberts-Wells Brown-Roberts-Wells]: a type of stereotactic frame.  (Compare roughly similar number of cites for [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Leksell+frame Leksell frame], another type of stereotactic frame.)  I haven't investigated whether or not the term N-localizer is widely employed in these articles.  
*One wonders if this information should be merged (very selectively and briefly) to another article, perhaps stereotactic surgery or (eventually) a new article on stereotactic frames.
*It seems likely that  – who has contributed extensively to Russell A. Brown and added many citations to his work in this and other articles over the last couple of years – is somehow related to Brown.
Overall, I can't tell for certain if this is a case of someone who wants to  and seeks more recognition for a relatively minor invention, or if this is a genuinely major but overlooked development—but I have suspicions. () 15:14, 25 November 2015 (UTC)

I would be very reluctant to use any (purported) medical image that had so little information about its provenance or veracity. () 01:09, 16 November 2015 (UTC)
While I agree with  the following web-app which analyzes for image manipulation http://29a.ch/sandbox/2012/imageerrorlevelanalysis/ doesn't show anything that indicates photoshop use. Either someone who is very professional at what they do changed this image as a raw, but the low resolution/quality seems to indicate a consumer camera was used to take this image – why it likely is real. [[User:CFCF|CFCF]]  21:01, 22 November 2015 (UTC)

That sort of analysis, while very helpful if it detects a problem, is much less robust if it doesn't detect one.  While the low resolution/quality certainly could suggest a poorly-operated consumer camera, low-end phone camera, or webcam, it's not necessarily a mark of veracity.  A competent digital faker would start with a high resolution image, make whatever changes they wished to that original image, then add a bit of blur, a bit of noise, and downsample their image to a lower resolution before jpeg compressing it.  All of those steps are easy to do using widely-available, widely-used, free tools – or Photoshop – and taken together they do a very good job of hiding the variations in background noise that would normally be a signature of a pasted-together image.  I fear that you significantly overestimate the difficulty of carrying out such manipulations.
Of course, that's not the only way to do it.  You wouldn't see any sign of digital manipulation if the appearance were created with, say, stage makeup.  It would be a 'real' photo of fake anatomy.  (I'm always a little bit...disappointed?...when I see biochemistry and molecular biology papers retracted because the author got caught digitally cut-and-pasting bands in a Western blot.  Any halfway competent scientific fraud should be smart enough to just spike their experimental samples with a little bit of their positive control; the result would be utterly indistinguishable from the real result, and they could produce all the fake results they needed in a day's work.)
All that said, in a case like this I actually get stuck long before I even get to the question of photo manipulation or fakery.  The image purports to show an atypical unilateral presentation, which may or may not be a good thing for a Wikipedia article.  Because the image uploader has no other contributions and provides no information whatsoever about the image beyond the bare claim that it represents gynecomastia (and has even lost any useful EXIF data from the image), we don't have any supporting documentation about how the patient was diagnosed or how the image was produced.  The uploader may have uploaded the image entirely in good faith and still gotten the diagnosis wrong.  (I note that the only practising physician who has commented on this image – Doc James – has expressed strong reservations about it.)
As a further aside, I wonder about whether appropriate consent was obtained to submit this image to Commons; the original uploader described the subject as a &quot;young male&quot;, and it makes me very twitchy indeed when I see poorly-documented photos of (likely) minors with medical conditions. () 01:07, 23 November 2015 (UTC)
I said nothing to the effect of it being a good image, representative of the condition, or even appropriate for Wikipedia - all I expressed was that the image is less likely to have been photoshopped - noting that the image may have been altered, just not by a novice.

You know...I know everyone is pretty busy but I would like to share with you what I just deleted from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention article:

CDC zombie apocalypse outreach campaign

On May 16, 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's blog published an article instructing the public on what to do to prepare for a zombie invasion. While the article did not claim that such a scenario was possible, it did use the popular culture appeal as a means of urging citizens to prepare for all potential hazards, such as earthquakes, tornadoes, and floods.

According to David Daigle, the Associate Director for Communications, Public Health Preparedness and Response, the idea arose when his team was discussing their upcoming hurricane information campaign and Daigle mused that &quot;we say pretty much the same things every year, in the same way, and I just wonder how many people are paying attention.&quot; A social media employee mentioned that the subject of zombies had come up a lot on Twitter when she had been tweeting about the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster and radiation. The team realized that a campaign like this would most likely reach a different audience from the one that normally pays attention to hurricane preparedness warnings and went to work on the zombie campaign, launching it right before hurricane season began. &quot;The whole idea was, if you're prepared for a zombie apocalypse, you're prepared for pretty much anything,&quot; said Daigle.

Once the blog article became popular, the CDC announced an open contest for YouTube submissions of the most creative and effective videos covering preparedness for a zombie apocalypse (or apocalypse of any kind), to be judged by the &quot;CDC Zombie Task Force&quot;. Submissions were open until October 11, 2011. They also released a zombie themed graphic novella available on their website. Zombie-themed educational materials for teachers are available on the site.



..pretty crazy, right? Can someone let me know just how long this section has been in the article?? I am not going to type in capital letters or anything but how is it that so many other editors were editing other articles but were not even remotely interested in collaborating in removing vandalism after I posted a request above? Are we perhaps overly-fascinated with solving the MEDRS crisis? It's things like this that will undo the good that we have done in donating our time in providing good medical content. We should all be a little concerned.

If you really want to see something fascinating, check out the fake CDC website these people set up. Check out their references at the bottom of this talk page.

Can I be quite frank, when I post to the Project Medicine talk page, I think I am just talking to myself half the time. This is about the most frustrated I have been since I started editing.
The Very Best of Regards,  () 02:30, 29 November 2015 (UTC)

Hi Barbara, this is actually a real thing that the CDC does. Their goal in this campaign is to cause people who wouldn't ordinarily pay attention to disaster preparedness information to hear about how to prepare in case of a real emergency. It looks like vandalism but it's definitely not.  () 02:37, 29 November 2015 (UTC)

Actually, very few WP talk pages are as much read as this one. There, that's three people responding. Shouldn't we put it back, maybe with a yet more explicit explanation of CDC's reasoning?  () 02:39, 29 November 2015 (UTC)

 What do you mean &quot;both pages&quot;? Do you mean that the Wikipedia article somewhere says that it was taken from World Heritage Encyclopedia?

WHE has a lot of articles which seem to be copied exactly from Wikipedia without attribution and which claim copyright ownership. I do not know what you mean to say by talking about a link to the license or noting that there is a CC-source. What I am expecting to see is a notice on WHE that the content was taken from Wikipedia and that the copyright holders are the Wikipedia contributors.

&quot;Cock and ball torture&quot;
I believe the article Cock and ball torture, and in particular the section Cock and ball torture#Safety, could do with some attention from medical editors, as I think parts of it are definitely matters of medical concern. Given the wide variety of sex-problem-related human experience that is observed in emergency rooms worldwide every day (for example, the extraction of rectal foreign bodies, the emergency removal of metal cock rings, or even more exotic things like damage due to scrotal infusion) I think it's likely that there is relevant medical literature in this area. --  () 11:05, 26 November 2015 (UTC)

Lane and I have done one article as an example which can be seen here Gout. It is a lot of work to do this for a single article as one needs to plug all the data into Wikidata.

It's 30% overall, sitewide.  The most popular pages may have a different profile.
If you want this to be useful/visible to everyone, then you can't use the navbox templates or CSS classes (styling), and you need to make it re-size sensibly for different screen sizes (both widescreen desktop systems and narrow smartphones).   () 00:17, 4 December 2015 (UTC)
 so how would we do that? [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 04:48, 4 December 2015 (UTC)

The solution is to not use , or refer to any of its classes.  This is a hard-coded table, but something like this ought to work:


The details can be tweaked, but this is just a quick demo to show the overall concept.  Since it's just two columns (unlike , which follows it on Gout), it should adapt fairly well to narrow screens.  Perhaps if someone has a smartphone, you'll look at it and see whether it's readable.   () 05:28, 4 December 2015 (UTC)
Yes that appears to work. We will need to build a template based on the above if one does not already exist.[[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 05:48, 4 December 2015 (UTC)
 A natural next step would be to have these values pulled from Wikidata instead of stored locally. I am having a discussion about how to do that at  - I do not immediately know how. The starting example that we have in  cannot be replicated exactly because if you look at  in the ICD-9 field there are multiple values when this box should only display 1, perhaps just the first one. This was not an issue with the other box.  suggests Lua code to select the data we want. All of this pushes the limit of my understanding and I will not have time to teach myself this within the next few days. I want to learn this but I do not know where to begin, and still I am looking at the examples I have coming to understand how this works.

Including brand names

There is a minor disagreement at Clear aligners concerning whether an article on a medical product should list no/some/all brands. For example,  removed two major brand names from the lead (brands discussed in the article), and added five brand names to the body of the article. A comment  suggests that it is routine to add all brand names under which a drug is sold. Questions: What is the background regarding brand names for drug articles? Any thoughts on how brands should be handled at clear aligners?  () 05:38, 5 December 2015 (UTC)
IMO the brandnames should at least occur in the body of the article. The first brandname should occur in the lead. This is what we do for meds. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 06:47, 5 December 2015 (UTC)
Thanks, but to spell that out, you are saying that all brands should be included in the article? What about a topic with twenty brands? Is there a discussion somewhere about that because it reverses what I have seen elsewhere. I'm thinking of articles about some topic where there are a few major organizations active, and a dozen others. It is normal (although I can't recall where at the moment) to list the major players and reject others as spam with &quot;&quot; (write the article first) often being used in the edit summary.

Immunoglobulin draft potentially good enough to replace what is out there currently

It looks like the last version of this section has been archived, so I figured I'll just start another one instead of reverting the archive bot.  Pretty much all of ENWP's content about immunoglobulin therapy (which includes several RoAs: intramuscular, subcutaneous, and intravenuous) is located at one article - IVIG.  I have a draft  and although I know it doesn't address all problems in the current article (there are whole sections I haven't touched yet,) I suspect it would be preferable to the current article.

Psoriasis-Genitalia Pathology Examples Acceptable?

Hi everyone, there's been a bit of debate at psoriasis regarding whether or not a picture of genitalia affected by psoriasis is appropriate (or necessary).

I don't see anything on the talk page at the moment.  One potential issue is that the article says that the typical site is within skin folds, &quot;around the genitals (between the thigh and groin)&quot; rather than on non-folded skin, and that's [[:File:PenilePsoriasis.jpg|not what's shown in the picture]].  Also, how certain are we that this looks like (reasonably typical) inverse psoriasis?   () 01:18, 29 November 2015 (UTC)
The user who removed the image (I think, it was originally an IP that removed it, but then I heard from ) left me a message on my talk page and I replied on his. You're right though that perhaps this should be moved to the talk page but I thought it would be good to get wider consensus. The question is more about whether a picture of genitalia demonstrating it being affected by psoriasis is appropriate/needed or not. If another image is better, that's definitely fine.

Various IP addresses keep trying to remove it so perhaps getting the article under semi-protection is in order?  () 06:42, 29 November 2015 (UTC)

 Is it appropriate? Maybe, although it does highlight the psoriasis, personally I couldn't see it very clearly. Also, the article is already thriving with images. If it would be an article with around 6-8 images or less, then I would surely keep the image, however there are 11 images.  () 09:10, 29 November 2015 (UTC)

I have little medical expertise. I am the owner of a penis, to which I am attached, but that is as close as I come to knowledge, here. 
All I can see on the image  is a pale patch. Are there not many medical conditions that lead to skin looking like this? Is this a valuable image for this article, or is it merely useful for a more general article on skin/genital skin issues?

To address what WAID said above, this page [https://www.psoriasis.org/about-psoriasis/specific-locations/genitals] and this page [http://www.dermnetnz.org/scaly/genital-psoriasis.html] from the National Psoriasis Foundation and DermNetNZ do support the idea that inverse psoriasis is the form that most commonly affects the genital region (including (but not limited to) the inguinal region). However, it does sound like the lesions expected would probably be red rather than white (although I suppose either is possible), so perhaps a different image of penile psoriasis would be more representative. This article [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24559568] also indicates that they would be expected to be red (erythematous) rather than white and does have one picture of psoriatic balanitis.

Clitoral Erection and Clitoral Erectile Dysfunction

I recently edited the article on Clitoral Erection by adding a sentence about Clitoral Erectile Dysfunction. Specifically, I stated there is a hypothesis that lack of stimulation during early brain development may cause atrophy of the relative brain areas that control clitoral erectile function, resulting in permanent clitoral erectile dysfunction, although empirical research is necessary for confirmation. I also included a reference to a paper on academia.edu (https://www.academia.edu/s/559e1d73ea) that describes the hypothesis in more detail and offers some documentation. I made no other claims except that the hypothesis exists and its existence may be verified outside Wikipedia.

My contribution was quickly deleted by an editor who referred me to Wikipedia's Medical Source Guidelines, WP:MED I asked on that persons Talk page why my contribution had been deleted, and the person stated &quot;...the source you added is not up to medical standards.&quot; I disputed that criticism and then my contribution was also called &quot;Fringe&quot; and &quot;Editorializing,&quot; even though my contribution contained no claims of certainty or even probability, and included no words like &quot;clearly&quot; etc. WP:MED Guidelines do also say: &quot;Neither of these pages are 'laws', but are intended to give, inspire, and organize our contributions. They should never prevent anyone from writing and improving medical articles!&quot; 

So why wasn't my contribution modified for improvement instead of completely erased without warning?  () 18:38, 6 December 2015 (UTC)
Very likely because it was from a unusable source, and there are no reliable sources that would support your statement. [[User:CFCF|CFCF]]  18:46, 6 December 2015 (UTC)

CFCF Thanks for your input. But the content I added didn't make any assertions of fact other than to report that there is a hypothesis, and I provided a reference that anyone can check to verify that the hypothesis exists. If the reference was the real issue, then why wasn't my edit marked or modified (e.g. remove the reference and note &quot;needs citation&quot;) rather than deleted completely and as quickly as possible? Wikipedia encourages contributors to &quot;be bold.&quot; If someone objects to a particular edit by modifying it, that's editing. But if someone responds to a potentially controversial topic by silencing the whole topic, that's not editing - it's censorship.  () 12:07, 8 December 2015 (UTC)

Boldness is only part of Wikipedia's guideline.  The more complete guideline is :  bold-revert-discuss.  In other words, be bold, but be prepared for your edit to be reverted, and be ready to discuss whether it is appropriate.  In this case the issue is whether the hypothesis is notable enough to justify covering it in our article.  The best evidence for notability is attention paid to it by other reputable published sources.  It's  very unlikely that a forum discussion on a web site will be considered notable.  See  for the general policy on sources for medical articles.  () 14:36, 8 December 2015 (UTC)

Looie496 This discussion here has the appearance of being a technical question concerning Wikipedia policy, and despite the potentially controversial nature of the hypothesis of clitoral erectile dysfunction and its possible cause - if it becomes widely known the careers of some political opportunists and profiteers in the child sex abuse prevention and rescue business would be in jeopardy, as well as casting doubt on the traditional and cherished practice of anti-sex education in early childhood - I will give critics the benefit of the doubt by assuming their intentions are constructive and impartial and their statements of their motives for deleting my edit are sincere. However, I will note that Drcrazy102 has suggested that I should have initiated a discussion on the Clitoral Erection Talk page (which I had already done), but Flyer22 Reborn and other supporters of the deletion have largely confined their comments to Flyer22 Reborn's Talk page (or attempted to redirect the discussion to that page) rather than defending the deletion on the Clitoral Erection Talk page.

Second, while I am one of the editors who seek to keep pro-child sexual abusers off Wikipedia (), I was not thinking of a child sexual abuse angle when you added that.

The fact that some idea exists does not make it an encyclopedic topic, not even as a subtopic of another article.  If there are no reliable sources indicating that the idea has been backed by real research, or that it has attracted noteworthy commentary or controversy, in , then it's not encyclopedic information; it's no better than a random blog post.  Even if some new idea appears in a refereed journal, if it's a  research/hypothesis paper that attracts no coverage in followup research or in literature reviews, it's basically just noise.  There are literally tens of thousands of academic journals. Nowhere near every single hypothesis that passes just enough peer-review sanity checking to see print in one of them is magically transformed into something that  be included in Wikipedia, and certainly not an idea that warrants a new article (for which we have a particularly high standard covered at ) on this alleged dysfunction.

Major expansion at Fetal rights - NPOV?

A recent major expansion of Fetal rights was performed [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fetal_rights&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=692582622&amp;oldid=688202852], and subsequently hidden behind a [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fetal_rights&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=691850092&amp;oldid=691849886 m]-tagged edit. I have not had time to go through the entire text. I am informing this page of it because it seems to have slipped under the radar, and especially the removal of tags marking issues with the page is troubling. I question that these were removed without discussion, and that the current edition really is without the following issues: 


[[User:CFCF|CFCF]]  17:22, 29 November 2015 (UTC)
From a quick look at this mammoth edit, my concern would be that this makes the article more a secondary piece, rather than the tertiary one it should be.  () 17:33, 29 November 2015 (UTC)
CFCF, I'm not sure what &quot;under the radar means&quot;, unless it means that – for once – someone edited an abortion-related article without instantly creating an edit war, but are you aware that any NPOV-related tag can be removed by anyone unless there is an actual discussion going on about it?  &quot;In the absence of such a discussion, or where it remains unclear what the NPOV violation is, the tag may be removed by any editor&quot; is the formulation at , and it applies to all related ones.  Also, one does hope that a major expansion (Look!  An actual history section!  Citing history sources from highly reputable university presses!) would have resolved any remaining problems.

It used to be on my . I took it off at some point. And because that article is a magnet for the abortion debate, I'd prefer not to get back involved with it. I have enough contentious articles to worry about.  () 23:23, 30 November 2015 (UTC)
To me it is unclear how I would be advocating for an edit-war . All I've done is comment that a user with self-expressed strong anti-abortion views expanded the article with what has been identified by what now is a few editors as questionable content - while at the same time getting rid of POV-tags. [[User:CFCF|CFCF]]  23:43, 30 November 2015 (UTC)
I don't think that you're advocating for an edit war.  I do disagree that this edit happened &quot;under the radar&quot;, when it was out there for anyone to look at.  Sure, it didn't get an immediate public response (which I grant is unfortunately unusual for abortion-related articles), but that doesn't mean that we should imply that anything secretive or underhanded.  Removing the POV tags is completely appropriate whenever you believe that you have solved the problem.  That's what you're supposed to do!  (And harmless at worst, since four-year-old POV tags almost never produce any constructive behavior.) 
If you have a problem with the article content – rather than the identity of the contributor – then I encourage you to improve it, or to post specific, actionable suggestions on the talk page.

List of synonyms in lead

What do people think of this method of removing synonyms from the lead?  () 14:56, 1 December 2015 (UTC)

If it said &quot;known under several synonyms&quot; in parenthesis or something like that after Geographic tongue I am okay with it, when an article has maybe 5+ synonyms in lead and the synonyms redirect to the article... but as it stands now the reader will not know what information is hidden in the note. Kind regards  () 15:45, 1 December 2015 (UTC)

It should be possible to create a template that utilised the information provided by a redirect to generate a synonym in the lead. The difficulty might be when a redirect wasn't followed. Essentially; if a visitor was redirected to an article that had multiple synonyms, the template would parse &quot;Article name, also known as searched synonym (among others), [lead continues]...&quot;, If no redirect had been followed, the template would parse &quot;Article name, also known by several synonyms, [lead continues]...&quot; (where any italic text is injected by the template).

There are doubts about pathogenesis, diagnosis protocol, and treatment, but it doesn't mean that the disease doesn't exist. Wikipedia doesn't have &quot;its own POV&quot;, Wikipedia must reflect the reality. If knowledge progresses, Wikipedia moves with it.&quot;

First off I want to apologize. When I relaunched the MCOTM I really did want to stick with it but some personnel family matters came up right after it began. That said, for those who participated, what are your thoughts? Did you think the MCOTM was beneficial to the Transverse myelitis  article as a whole? [Here https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Transverse_myelitis&amp;oldid=673477707] is the before and [here https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Transverse_myelitis&amp;oldid=688582387] is it today. Overall, I think the article was improved very much, but still needs more work before it can be considered for a good article nomination. My thought is we should discuss what went wrong and what went right to determine if MCOTM is something we should keep doing. Until then, I think we should keep transverse myelitis as the article as the article of the month. So, what are your thoughts, questions, and concerns?

Agreed, but very few suggestions were put forward when MCOTM asked for candidate articles in need of serious work.

Sodium_picosulfate

Hi, I've added a bit of mechanism info to the Sodium_picosulfate article. I don't typically edit medical articles, so it'd be useful if someone from this Wikiproject could cast their eye over it to check if I've made any errors. Thanks!  22:16, 14 December 2015 (UTC)
That looks pretty good overall, but I suspect that you are used to real-world ideas about sourcing.   We usually prefer recent secondary sources (e.g., review articles or book chapters) instead of the original or canonical sources, especially when the original sources are from the previous century.   () 01:36, 15 December 2015 (UTC)
Speaking generally, I would be inclined to argue that in situations where we have both 'canonical', 'landmark', or 'original' historical studies and recent reviews which support/endorse the earlier work, we ought to be citing both.  It's good to give credit to original discoverers and to provide historical context, instead of just a single present-day snapshot.
In the case of this particular article, one could reiterate the citation of reference 6 (Adamcewicz et al., 2011) to support the 'historical' references 7 (Forth et al., 1972), 8 (Jauch et al., 1975), and 9 (Regev et al., 1998)—at least if refs 7, 8, or 9 are original sources for those facts, or if they represent highly-cited 'landmark' works in the literature.  () 04:17, 15 December 2015 (UTC)
To be honest, the open-access review (Adamcewicz et al., 2011) was the first thing that I found and was thinking of just using it for the whole section. The reason that I added the primary literature was for a bit more detail on e.g. the prodrug metabolism or formulation (e.g. the review is actually a bit vague on the prodrug aspect). I'll double up for now, but I'm happy to drop the primaries if it turns out I'm in the minority opinion.  09:26, 15 December 2015 (UTC)
Sounds reasonable to me.  While I've always been a staunch advocate of robust and up-to-date sourcing, I've also always pushed back against the particularly militant down-the-memory-hole editors who try to prevent Wikipedia from acknowledging the existence of pre-2010 (in two weeks, pre-2011) scientific literature.
