 Subcutaneous Immunoglobulin 

Hi all - we have an article about VIG (and several individual brands of it,) but we don't seem to have an article about ub-cutaneous immunoglobulin.  Would anyone be interested in drafting such an article with me? I should have all the necessary journal access, and any that I don't should be coming up in the next couple weeks.  I admit that I do have a bit of a direct personal interest in the matter as I have VID and am on igg infusions myself, but in any case view this as a pretty big article set to be missing.  Many newly diagnosed patients turn to Wikipedia for guidance (whether or not they necessarily should,) and IVIG vs SCIG is one of the bigger choices a newly diagnosed patient in need of some form of IGG will have to make. ser:Kevin Gorman|Kevin Gorman (ser talk:Kevin Gorman|talk) 01:17, 20 November 2015 (UTC)
Aside from mode of delivery and pharmacokinetics, IVIG and SCIG are quite similar. Perhaps they should be subsections of an article about immunoglobulin supplementation? Otherwise, there will be substantial duplication; the juxtaposition will improve understanding, IMHO.  — ser:soupvector|soupvector (ser_talk:soupvector|talk) 01:47, 20 November 2015 (UTC)
I tend to agree with you, and will probably start a draft (which I'll link here) of such an article in my userspace tomorrow.  SCIG and IVIG are two subsets of immmunoglobulin supplementation, and that commonality is more significant than the mode of administration.  Best, ser:Kevin Gorman|Kevin Gorman (ser talk:Kevin Gorman|talk) 02:05, 20 November 2015 (UTC)
mmunoglobulin supplementation is also a redlink.  Is that the ideal name?  (Also, keep P:DYK in mind.  It's nice to have some solid med stuff there when we can.)  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 22:29, 20 November 2015 (UTC)
I was debating between mmunoglobulin supplementation and mmunoglobulin therapy.  I have the very beginnings of a draft started ser:Kevin_Gorman/ig|here - feel free to poke at it as you please.  the article about VIG wasn't in very good shape to begin with, so it will likely take me some time to get the draft in to such shape that it wouldn't embarrass me to make this article live, heh.  I also still lack access to a few journal networks (UpToDate full access + Dynamed + Elsevier would all be nice - at least a couple of those are coming - but having access to EBSCO etc at least gives me decent access.)  I'd like to get a reasonably comprehensive and medrs compliant article up before I move it in to livespace. Our VIG article isn't exactly stellar, and we had no mention of SCIG or IMIG anywhere pretty much. ser:Kevin Gorman|Kevin Gorman (ser talk:Kevin Gorman|talk) 02:49, 23 November 2015 (UTC)
I think you've made a good choice in the title, as it's more inclusive of both supplementation and other therapeutics (e.g. immunomodulation). This will be a busy week for me, but I'll return when I can. Also, I have access to just about everything, so while I cannot share the copyrighted papers with you, I am happy to paraphrase and discuss sources. — ser:soupvector|soupvector (ser_talk:soupvector|talk) 04:34, 23 November 2015 (UTC)
*I've gotten a good start to the article (which is saying something, because bluntly, VIG sucks.)  Once I've rewritten another section or four, I'll probably put it live and redirect IVIG to it.  And, why not, DYK it - I don't think I've even bothered to DYK enough stuff to hit the QPQ requirement yet, lol (though I shall certainly QPQ anyway.) ser:Kevin Gorman|Kevin Gorman (ser talk:Kevin Gorman|talk)

Well, there's been a lot of committed activity on this topic and the NCGS material has now spread widely through some of our articles. The POV is being markedly recalibrated (e.g. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gluten-free_diet&amp;curid=708662&amp;diff=690480254&amp;oldid=690269730 in this lede to the edit]). By my understanding NGCS is something of a controversial condition the classification, diagnosis and treatment of which is rather up in the air. By contrast it seems to me Wikipedia is now rather certain on the topic. Could probably do with a look from better-qualified editors than me to judge. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 17:26, 13 November 2015 (UTC)

 WikiProject Medicine participants may be good administrators 

Participants here often create a lot of content and have to evaluate whether or not a subject is notable. I can imagine that the pharmaceuticals area may have issues with undeclared paid editing and sockpuppetery. Detecting and handling this must give you good experience.  Well, these are considerations at ikipedia:Requests for adminship.

So, please consider taking a look at and watchlisting this page:

*ikipedia:Requests for adminship/Optional RfA candidate poll

You could be very helpful in evaluating potential candidates, and maybe even find out if you would be a suitable RfA candidate.

 Gun control 

I wanted to seek the opinion of other WPMED editors regarding whether claims about gun control being effective/ineffective at reducing gun deaths fall under the purview of MEDRS.

* MEDRS isn't the only sourcing page that prefers secondary sources to primary, or scholarly sources to mass media, or relatively recent sources to outdated ones, any of the other qualities that we think of as meaning &quot;MEDRS-compliant&quot;.

MEDRS would seem to be a non-issue here. As Johnbod mentioned, a topic like this really should use secondary sources as it is a topic where we should [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Controversial_articles#Raise_source_quality raise source quality]. I'd be concerned if the article mostly used primary sources without even thinking of MEDRS. That being said, I'd consider this under MEDRS in a similar fashion as I would to say an occupational hazard topic. In a statement like, &quot;Does X affect the rate of Y?&quot; when Y is something clearly medical related such as death, it's a medical topic whether it's dealing with a pathogen, physical hazard, or something with a social mix. ser:Kingofaces43|Kingofaces43 (ser talk:Kingofaces43|talk) 16:37, 11 November 2015 (UTC)

There is nothing wrong with using MEDRS-compliant sources in that article.  There is, however, a problem with using exclusively medical sources when the subject is multi-disciplinary.  &quot;A neutral, balanced article&quot; does not result from using solely &quot;medical journals&quot; (and MEDRS is explicit that non-medical academic journals are not &quot;ideal&quot;) when the subject is legal, social, and philosophical, in addition to being medical.  I don't think that Doc James meant to imply that solely medical sources should be used in such an article.  Instead, I believe that he meant to say only that there is nothing wrong with using up-to-date, reputable, scholarly, secondary sources—from all the relevant disciplines, not just from medicine—in that article.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:54, 12 November 2015 (UTC)

A few thoughts.
*It's a bit troubling that the only three recent – and by &quot;recent&quot;, I mean &quot;from within the last decade&quot; – sources used for the article are authored by Russell (R.A.) Brown (once as sole author (2013) and twice with J.A. Nelson), the individual who really sdeems to want to have his contribution to this invention recognized.

*Without being an expert in this area, it's not immediately obvious whether this Wikipedia article represents a useful, primarily-historical perspective on the development of an important medical device, or whether it is a selective retelling which over-emphasizes the importance of (mostly) one individual.  Our articlee on the N-localizer is extremely light on information about current use of the device.
*With respect to MEDRS and sourcing, much of the sourcing in the article should be looked at with respect to whether or not it provides useful and balanced historical context, rather than whether or not it represents MEDRS-checklist-compliant current health information.  The near-exclusive reliance on Russell Brown's publications is likely problematic from the standpoint of assessing NPOV.  Current textbooks in stereotactic surgery would probably be very helpful to provide context.
*While the term N-localizer is seldom used in PubMed-indexed articles and abstracts, it appears that devices of which it forms a part get better coverage; see [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?cmd=search&amp;term=Brown-Roberts-Wells Brown-Roberts-Wells]: a type of stereotactic frame.  (Compare roughly similar number of cites for [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Leksell+frame Leksell frame], another type of stereotactic frame.)  I haven't investigated whether or not the term N-localizer is widely employed in these articles.  
*One wonders if this information should be merged (very selectively and briefly) to another article, perhaps tereotactic surgery or (eventually) a new article on tereotactic frames.
*It seems likely that serlinks|Kirigiri – who has contributed extensively to ussell A. Brown and added many citations to his work in this and other articles over the last couple of years – is somehow related to Brown.

I would be very reluctant to use any (purported) medical image that had so little information about its provenance or veracity. ser:TenOfAllTrades|TenOfAllTrades(ser_talk:TenOfAllTrades|talk) 01:09, 16 November 2015 (UTC)
While I agree with |TenOfAllTrades the following web-app which analyzes for image manipulation http://29a.ch/sandbox/2012/imageerrorlevelanalysis/ doesn't show anything that indicates photoshop use. Either someone who is very professional at what they do changed this image as a raw, but the low resolution/quality seems to indicate a consumer camera was used to take this image – why it likely is real. ser:CFCF|CFCFser talk:CFCF| 💌 pecial:EmailUser/CFCF|📧 21:01, 22 November 2015 (UTC)

That sort of analysis, while very helpful if it detects a problem, is much less robust if it doesn't detect one.  While the low resolution/quality certainly could suggest a poorly-operated consumer camera, low-end phone camera, or webcam, it's not necessarily a mark of veracity.  A competent digital faker would start with a high resolution image, make whatever changes they wished to that original image, then add a bit of blur, a bit of noise, and downsample their image to a lower resolution before jpeg compressing it.  All of those steps are easy to do using widely-available, widely-used, free tools – or Photoshop – and taken together they do a very good job of hiding the variations in background noise that would normally be a signature of a pasted-together image.  I fear that you significantly overestimate the difficulty of carrying out such manipulations.
Of course, that's not the only way to do it.  You wouldn't see any sign of digital manipulation if the appearance were created with, say, stage makeup.  It would be a 'real' photo of fake anatomy.  (I'm always a little bit...disappointed?...when I see biochemistry and molecular biology papers retracted because the author got caught digitally cut-and-pasting bands in a Western blot.  Any halfway competent scientific fraud should be smart enough to just spike their experimental samples with a little bit of their positive control; the result would be utterly indistinguishable from the real result, and they could produce all the fake results they needed in a day's work.)
All that said, in a case like this I actually get stuck long before I even get to the question of photo manipulation or fakery.  The image purports to show an atypical unilateral presentation, which may or may not be a good thing for a Wikipedia article.  Because the image uploader has no other contributions and provides no information whatsoever about the image beyond the bare claim that it represents gynecomastia (and has even lost any useful EXIF data from the image), we don't have any supporting documentation about how the patient was diagnosed or how the image was produced.  The uploader may have uploaded the image entirely in good faith and still gotten the diagnosis wrong.  (I note that the only practising physician who has commented on this image – Doc James – has expressed strong reservations about it.)
As a further aside, I wonder about whether appropriate consent was obtained to submit this image to Commons; the original uploader described the subject as a &quot;young male&quot;, and it makes me very twitchy indeed when I see poorly-documented photos of (likely) minors with medical conditions. ser:TenOfAllTrades|TenOfAllTrades(ser_talk:TenOfAllTrades|talk) 01:07, 23 November 2015 (UTC)
I said nothing to the effect of it being a good image, representative of the condition, or even appropriate for Wikipedia - all I expressed was that the image is less likely to have been photoshopped - noting that the image may have been altered, just not by a novice. ser:CFCF|CFCFser talk:CFCF| 💌 pecial:EmailUser/CFCF|📧 12:55, 23 November 2015 (UTC)

On May 16, 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's blog published an article instructing the public on what to do to prepare for a ombie (fictional)|zombie invasion.

According to David Daigle, the Associate Director for Communications, Public Health Preparedness and Response, the idea arose when his team was discussing their upcoming hurricane information campaign and Daigle mused that &quot;we say pretty much the same things every year, in the same way, and I just wonder how many people are paying attention.&quot; A social media employee mentioned that the subject of zombies had come up a lot on witter when she had been tweeting about the ukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster and adiation. The team realized that a campaign like this would most likely reach a different audience from the one that normally pays attention to hurricane preparedness warnings and went to work on the zombie campaign, launching it right before hurricane season began. &quot;The whole idea was, if you're prepared for a zombie apocalypse, you're prepared for pretty much anything,&quot; said Daigle.ite web|url=http://www.skepticality.com/centers-zombie-control-prevention|title=Skepticality Podcast|work=Centers for Zombie Control and Prevention|date=2011-10-25|accessdate=2014-03-08

..pretty crazy, right? Can someone let me know just how long this section has been in the article?? I am not going to type in capital letters or anything but how is it that so many other editors were editing other articles but were not even remotely interested in collaborating in removing vandalism after I posted a request above? Are we perhaps overly-fascinated with solving the MEDRS crisis? It's things like this that will undo the good that we have done in donating our time in providing good medical content. We should all be a little concerned.

If you really want to see something fascinating, check out the fake CDC website these people set up. Check out their references at the bottom of this talk page.

Both pages say &quot;Sourced from World Heritage Encyclopedia™ licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0&quot;, with the link to the license. Now, at the very bottom there's a copyright notice too, but I suspect that would be considered a nullity, as to the material taken from a CC source, under the circumstances. The copyright notice at the bottom is appropriate because WHE holds copyright on its version of the material (i.e. a derivative work of the Wikipedia version). ser:EEng|EEng (ser talk:EEng|talk) 18:49, 28 November 2015 (UTC)
|EEng What do you mean &quot;both pages&quot;? Do you mean that the Wikipedia article somewhere says that it was taken from World Heritage Encyclopedia? I am imagining that WHE copied its content from Wikipedia. Do you have reason to believe that Wikipedia copied from WHE? WHE has a lot of articles which seem to be copied exactly from Wikipedia without attribution and which claim copyright ownership. I do not know what you mean to say by talking about a link to the license or noting that there is a CC-source. What I am expecting to see is a notice on WHE that the content was taken from Wikipedia and that the copyright holders are the Wikipedia contributors. Instead, WHE is saying that they are the copyright holder and not acknowledging that they took the content from Wikipedia without complying with the terms of the CC license's requirement for attribution. Do you see something other than that? ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 19:20, 28 November 2015 (UTC)

It gets even stranger when you read the World Heritage website. Take a look at the name of the website: Project Gutenburg Self-Publishing Press. Not a good omen. Just pretend that there were no copyright confusion - the article on the page is basically one primary source. It is a journal article, potentially self-published. Editing is a hobby for me, but this fiasco of an article is making me queasy. If you look at the article's talk page, I have also described problems with the photo that is used in the article.

Thank you for unravelling this convoluted mirror and forks issue. Detecting a mirror site is not a skill that I have at this time but probably need to develop. In any event the WP article is in awful shape and I have begun to assemble better sources and editing out unreferenced content. I care about self-published books, articles, and other written content that has no editorial oversight, that's all. When I read 'self-published' I instantly discredit the source. In any case, the WHE will have revise their page to reflect the changes in the WP someday. Best Regards and Thank you for your comments,

Given the wide variety of sex-problem-related human experience that is observed in emergency rooms worldwide every day (for example, the extraction of ectal foreign bodies, the emergency removal of metal ock rings, or even more exotic things like damage due to crotal infusion) I think it's likely that there is relevant medical literature in this area. -- ser:The Anome|The Anome (ser talk:The Anome|talk) 11:05, 26 November 2015 (UTC)

It's 30% overall, sitewide.  The most popular pages may have a different profile.

The solution is to not use emplate:Navbox, or refer to any of its classes.  This is a hard-coded table, but something like this ought to work:
{|style=&quot;font-size: 86%; border: 1px solid gray&quot;

For example, pecial:Diff/693683247|this edit removed two major brand names from the lead (brands discussed in the article), and added five brand names to the body of the article. A comment alk:Clear aligners#SmileCareClub, ClearCaps and CrystalBraces &amp; tags|here suggests that it is routine to add all brand names under which a drug is sold. Questions: What is the background regarding brand names for drug articles? Any thoughts on how brands should be handled at clear aligners? ser:Johnuniq|Johnuniq (ser talk:Johnuniq|talk) 05:38, 5 December 2015 (UTC)
IMO the brandnames should at least occur in the body of the article. The first brandname should occur in the lead. This is what we do for meds. ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk · pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 06:47, 5 December 2015 (UTC)
Thanks, but to spell that out, you are saying that all brands should be included in the article? What about a topic with twenty brands? Is there a discussion somewhere about that because it reverses what I have seen elsewhere. I'm thinking of articles about some topic where there are a few major organizations active, and a dozen others. It is normal (although I can't recall where at the moment) to list the major players and reject others as spam with &quot;P:WTAF&quot; (write the article first) often being used in the edit summary. ser:Johnuniq|Johnuniq (ser talk:Johnuniq|talk) 08:43, 5 December 2015 (UTC)
We often have dozens of brandnames listed at the end of med articles. Their is no clear guidance on this right now. ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk · pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 12:40, 5 December 2015 (UTC)

 Immunoglobulin draft potentially good enough to replace what is out there currently 

It looks like the last version of this section has been archived, so I figured I'll just start another one instead of reverting the archive bot.

I have a draft ser:Kevin_Gorman/ig|here and although I know it doesn't address all problems in the current article (there are whole sections I haven't touched yet,) I suspect it would be preferable to the current article.

To address what WAID said above, this page [https://www.psoriasis.org/about-psoriasis/specific-locations/genitals] and this page [http://www.dermnetnz.org/scaly/genital-psoriasis.html] from the National Psoriasis Foundation and DermNetNZ do support the idea that inverse psoriasis is the form that most commonly affects the genital region (including (but not limited to) the inguinal region). However, it does sound like the lesions expected would probably be red rather than white (although I suppose either is possible), so perhaps a different image of penile psoriasis would be more representative. This article [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24559568] also indicates that they would be expected to be red (erythematous) rather than white and does have one picture of psoriatic balanitis.

 Clitoral Erection and Clitoral Erectile Dysfunction 

I recently edited the article on Clitoral Erection by adding a sentence about Clitoral Erectile Dysfunction. Specifically, I stated there is a hypothesis that lack of stimulation during early brain development may cause atrophy of the relative brain areas that control clitoral erectile function, resulting in permanent clitoral erectile dysfunction, although empirical research is necessary for confirmation. I also included a reference to a paper on academia.edu (https://www.academia.edu/s/559e1d73ea) that describes the hypothesis in more detail and offers some documentation. I made no other claims except that the hypothesis exists and its existence may be verified outside Wikipedia.

My contribution was quickly deleted by an editor who referred me to Wikipedia's Medical Source Guidelines, WP:MED I asked on that persons Talk page why my contribution had been deleted, and the person stated &quot;...the source you added is not up to medical standards.&quot; I disputed that criticism and then my contribution was also called &quot;Fringe&quot; and &quot;Editorializing,&quot; even though my contribution contained no claims of certainty or even probability, and included no words like &quot;clearly&quot; etc. WP:MED Guidelines do also say: &quot;Neither of these pages are 'laws', but are intended to give, inspire, and organize our contributions. They should never prevent anyone from writing and improving medical articles!&quot; 

So why wasn't my contribution modified for improvement instead of completely erased without warning? ser:Newnamenow|Newnamenow (ser talk:Newnamenow|talk) 18:38, 6 December 2015 (UTC)

CFCF Thanks for your input. But the content I added didn't make any assertions of fact other than to report that there is a hypothesis, and I provided a reference that anyone can check to verify that the hypothesis exists. If the reference was the real issue, then why wasn't my edit marked or modified (e.g. remove the reference and note &quot;needs citation&quot;) rather than deleted completely and as quickly as possible? Wikipedia encourages contributors to &quot;be bold.&quot; If someone objects to a particular edit by modifying it, that's editing.

Boldness is only part of Wikipedia's guideline.  The more complete guideline is P:BRD:  bold-revert-discuss.  In other words, be bold, but be prepared for your edit to be reverted, and be ready to discuss whether it is appropriate.  In this case the issue is whether the hypothesis is notable enough to justify covering it in our article.  The best evidence for notability is attention paid to it by other reputable published sources.  It's  very unlikely that a forum discussion on a web site will be considered notable.

Looie496 This discussion here has the appearance of being a technical question concerning Wikipedia policy, and despite the potentially controversial nature of the hypothesis of clitoral erectile dysfunction and its possible cause - if it becomes widely known the careers of some political opportunists and profiteers in the child sex abuse prevention and rescue business would be in jeopardy, as well as casting doubt on the traditional and cherished practice of anti-sex education in early childhood - I will give critics the benefit of the doubt by assuming their intentions are constructive and impartial and their statements of their motives for deleting my edit are sincere. However, I will note that Drcrazy102 has suggested that I should have initiated a discussion on the Clitoral Erection Talk page (which I had already done), but Flyer22 Reborn and other supporters of the deletion have largely confined their comments to Flyer22 Reborn's Talk page (or attempted to redirect the discussion to that page) rather than defending the deletion on the Clitoral Erection Talk page. ser:Newnamenow|Newnamenow (ser talk:Newnamenow|talk) 10:51, 9 December 2015 (UTC)

And very likely won't ever be given it. Second, while I am one of the editors who seek to keep pro-child sexual abusers off Wikipedia (P:Child protection), I was not thinking of a child sexual abuse angle when you added that.

I don't think that you're advocating for an edit war.  I do disagree that this edit happened &quot;under the radar&quot;, when it was out there for anyone to look at.  Sure, it didn't get an immediate public response (which I grant is unfortunately unusual for abortion-related articles), but that doesn't mean that we should imply that anything secretive or underhanded.  Removing the POV tags is completely appropriate whenever you believe that you have solved the problem.  That's what you're supposed to do!

 Tools for highlighting withdrawn academic papers on the talk pages of articles that cite them, etc. 

There is a proposal [https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/2015_Community_Wishlist_Survey/Miscellaneous#Tools_for_dealing_with_citations_of_withdrawn_academic_journal_articles here] that WMF develops some tools for dealing with citations of withdrawn academic journal articles.

It should be possible to create a template that utilised the information provided by a redirect to generate a synonym in the lead. The difficulty might be when a redirect wasn't followed. Essentially; if a visitor was redirected to an article that had multiple synonyms, the template would parse &quot;Article name, also known as searched synonym (among others), [lead continues]...&quot;, If no redirect had been followed, the template would parse &quot;Article name, also known by several synonyms, [lead continues]...&quot; (where any italic text is injected by the template).

First off I want to apologize. When I relaunched the MCOTM I really did want to stick with it but some personnel family matters came up right after it began. That said, for those who participated, what are your thoughts? Did you think the MCOTM was beneficial to the ransverse myelitis  article as a whole? [Here https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Transverse_myelitis&amp;oldid=673477707] is the before and [here https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Transverse_myelitis&amp;oldid=688582387] is it today. Overall, I think the article was improved very much, but still needs more work before it can be considered for a good article nomination. My thought is we should discuss what went wrong and what went right to determine if MCOTM is something we should keep doing. Until then, I think we should keep transverse myelitis as the article as the article of the month. So, what are your thoughts, questions, and concerns? ser:Peter.C|Peter.C • ser talk:Peter.C|talk • pecial:Contributions/Peter.C|contribs 17:49, 2 December 2015 (UTC)

 odium_picosulfate 

Hi, I've added a bit of mechanism info to the odium_picosulfate article. I don't typically edit medical articles, so it'd be useful if someone from this Wikiproject could cast their eye over it to check if I've made any errors. Thanks! ser:Evolution_and_evolvability|T.Shafee(Evo﹠Evo)ser talk:Evolution_and_evolvability|talk 22:16, 14 December 2015 (UTC)
That looks pretty good overall, but I suspect that you are used to real-world ideas about sourcing. miley|wink  We usually prefer recent secondary sources (e.g., review articles or book chapters) instead of the original or canonical sources, especially when the original sources are from the previous century.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 01:36, 15 December 2015 (UTC)
Speaking generally, I would be inclined to argue that in situations where we have both 'canonical', 'landmark', or 'original' historical studies and recent reviews which support/endorse the earlier work, we ought to be citing both.  It's good to give credit to original discoverers and to provide historical context, instead of just a single present-day snapshot.
In the case of this particular article, one could reiterate the citation of reference 6 (Adamcewicz et al., 2011) to support the 'historical' references 7 (Forth et al., 1972), 8 (Jauch et al., 1975), and 9 (Regev et al., 1998)—at least if refs 7, 8, or 9 are original sources for those facts, or if they represent highly-cited 'landmark' works in the literature.  ser:TenOfAllTrades|TenOfAllTrades(ser_talk:TenOfAllTrades|talk) 04:17, 15 December 2015 (UTC)
To be honest, the open-access review (Adamcewicz et al., 2011) was the first thing that I found and was thinking of just using it for the whole section. The reason that I added the primary literature was for a bit more detail on e.g. the prodrug metabolism or formulation (e.g. the review is actually a bit vague on the prodrug aspect). I'll double up for now, but I'm happy to drop the primaries if it turns out I'm in the minority opinion. ser:Evolution_and_evolvability|T.Shafee(Evo﹠Evo)ser talk:Evolution_and_evolvability|talk 09:26, 15 December 2015 (UTC)
Sounds reasonable to me.  While I've always been a staunch advocate of robust and up-to-date sourcing, I've also always pushed back against the particularly militant down-the-memory-hole editors who try to prevent Wikipedia from acknowledging the existence of pre-2010 (in two weeks, pre-2011) scientific literature. ser:TenOfAllTrades|TenOfAllTrades(ser_talk:TenOfAllTrades|talk) 12:31, 15 December 2015 (UTC)

Hello,

I am an employee at Manifest, a marketing agency representing Abbott Vascular. Last month I requested edits on Talk pages of several Wikipedia pages: ercutaneous coronary intervention, oronary stent, are-metal stent, rug-eluting stent, and ioresorbable stents.

I've stumbled upon yet another overlooked corner of Wikipedia – the field of erontology and egenerative medicine. The article on egeneration in humans may include some of the most egregious examples, but the following articles could do with a good looking over:
*europreservation
*egenomics
*ife extension
*egenerative medicine
*ejuvenation (aging)
Thanks, ser:CFCF|CFCFser talk:CFCF| 💌 pecial:EmailUser/CFCF|📧 20:22, 9 December 2015 (UTC)
To those add:
*ubrey de Grey
*trategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence
*ENS Research Foundation

 New image, a painting by dvard Munch in orderline personality disorder 

Unfortunately, a user reverted the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Borderline_personality_disorder&amp;oldid=695484715 inclusion (as seen here)] of the image. After that there was a discussion on the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Borderline_personality_disorder#New_Image:_painting_by_Edvard_Munch talk page]. However, the controversy could not be resolved. Therefore, third opinions would be most welcome. Thanks to all.--ser:Saidmann|Saidmann (ser talk:Saidmann|talk) 15:30, 17 December 2015 (UTC)

The caption for the new image has now been updated and extended, containing now three references. The case of the Munch painting is also compared to the case of a van Gogh painting in ajor depressive disorder. The connection between mental disorder and painting clearly is much stronger in the Munch case than in the van Gogh case. Opinions on this issue will be most welcome.

I was going through the article on one and a half syndrome and the page doesn't seem to specify what the ipsilateral side and the contralateral side suffer from.

 ost-Finasteride Syndrome Foundation 

Editors here may remember that the &quot;post-finasteride syndrome&quot; article was deleted as non-notable. It appears that there is an attempt at coatracking the legitimacy of this &quot;syndrome&quot; on this foundation webpage, more eyes would be appreciated. Not sure that this foundation webpage meets P:N criteria, either. ser:Yobol|Yobol (ser talk:Yobol|talk) 18:09, 14 December 2015 (UTC)

Will more editors please take a look to give their opinion?  AlexBRN's most recent reversion merely says &quot; Rv. to good, this ain't encyclopedic this stuff&quot; which is a very unhelpful comment.  The article is being accused of coatracking because many editors here don't want to acknowledge anything about post finasteride syndrome however when you have a foundation that's main purpose is dedicated to researching the syndrome the matter is nearly one in the same. Thanks. ser:Doors22|Doors22 (ser talk:Doors22|talk) 13:52, 16 December 2015 (UTC)
I did expand on my comment on the Talk page. Yeah, this is yet another attempt by you to coatrack your agenda into Wikipedia.
