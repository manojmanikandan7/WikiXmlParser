 External link being added to many bacteria articles 

Hi folks, I was wondering about links to this database [http://bacdive.dsmz.de/] being added to numerous articles about bacteria.  Here's one example: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Helicobacter_pylori&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=719869064&amp;oldid=717884214].  The two editors  adding the links, ser:L.C.Reimer and ser:AnnaVetci), appear to be authors of the paper describing the database: [http://bacdive.dsmz.de/?site=contact].  They seem to be promoting the website.  So far, they've added these links to over a thousand Wikipedia articles.  ser:CatPath|CatPath (ser talk:CatPath|talk) 16:55, 17 May 2016 (UTC)

 Would be good to check the value of this database. It is managed by DSMZ, and judging from their website they are a bona fide research institution in Germany.[https://www.dsmz.de/about-us/portrait-of-the-dsmz.html] [https://www.dsmz.de/about-us/portrait-of-the-dsmz/history.html].

Hi, I am one of the two editors inserting all the links. We are researchers, working for a german non-commercial research institute SMZ. We started this as a project to provide additional information for bacterial type strains (which are ~10,000), since many of these strains are poorly described. We are not able to improve thousands of wikipages, also the data of our database are complex and diverse and can not be incorporated into wikipedia. Though our links provide useful scientific data regarding various aspects e.g. taxonomy, morphology, physiology, growth conditions, media recipes, isolation source, molecular biology and so on. Before starting this, we looked up the guidelines and found for ikipedia:External links &quot;Some acceptable links include those that contain further research that is accurate and on-topic, information that could not be added to the article for reasons such as copyright or amount of detail, or other meaningful, relevant content that is not suitable for inclusion in an article for reasons unrelated to its accuracy.&quot; So, our content is absolutely accurate and on-topic and the amount of detail is too high to incorporate. That's why we thought, this would be the right way to do it. By inserting those links we stumbled over a lot of links to other databases, (as for example to ncyclopedia of Life or to http://www.bacterio.net/) which also provide additional information as we do. So we felt confirmed in our doing. I really would appreciate if you rethink about the roll back, since we really offer high quality research data as additional information to the wikipedia users and we do not have any commercial interest or advantage. I am open for questions. ser:L.C.Reimer|L.C.Reimer (ser talk:L.C.Reimer|talk) 05:30, 18 May 2016 (UTC)
I really don't see what the issue is here.  Inserting database links in articles seems completely fine.  We do it in every chembox, drugbox, and proteinbox/pbb on every page where those templates are transcluded anyway. ser:Seppi333|Seppi333 (ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert 2¢) 05:38, 18 May 2016 (UTC)

Thanks for posting here ser:L.C.Reimer.  In general the editing community welcomes P:BOLD efforts to improve the encyclopedia.  However, when engaging in a large-scale project like this, it always wise to at least give people a heads up, and even better to get consensus first.  This is discussed a bit in P:CAUTIOUS.   Just doing it raises concerns about spamming and promotionalism as well as the quality of the data in the link (that is the concern, User:Seppi333).   

It just so happens that there is another editor who is doing a similar thing but more radical - basically rewriting articles about proteins based on a database maintained at the lab where he used to work; many other kinds of problems arose there.  (being discussed ikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Molecular_and_Cell_Biology#Transporter_classification_database|here).  

 L.C.Reimer If would be great if you and your partner paused for a bit while we discuss what you are doing.  Is that OK? 

For folks who want to see what they are up to with this database, they published on the most recent iteration of the database.

 dit conflict I think there is a conflict of interest issue here.  It would have been better if the authors first cleared this with P:Microbiology.  Also it would have been better to implement this as a template with a link to a mprint (database) stub explaining what the database is about. Another problem is that the database concerns bacterial strains, where as Wikipedia has very few articles on strains.  Most of the links were added to bacteria species articles, hence these links in general appear over specialized. ser:Boghog|Boghog (ser talk:Boghog|talk) 06:02, 18 May 2016 (UTC)

I have questions about brand names being deleted from any/ and ALL prescription drug articles, not just this one. Thank-you for any help making this clear.

Might be good to have a rfc around this issue. My position is that one or two brandnames should be in the lead. Maybe three in the infobox and others can go in the society and culture section if people so choose to put them there and reference it. ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk · pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 23:04, 15 May 2016 (UTC)
I don't see any need for an RFC.  MEDMOS and PHARMOS both [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:WikiProject_Pharmacology/Style_guide&amp;diff=425914302&amp;oldid=421989293 say that brand names ought to be included in the article], ideally as a Brand names subsection under Society and culture when there are more than a couple.  Also, they say that the original brand name ought to be in bold-face type in the lead, along with the name of the original manufacturer.  We just need more people to be aware of the existing advice (and also to be aware that the advice isn't an absolute requirement.  There are some good reasons to vary the standard approach on occasion [e.g., when different forms have different trade names, then you might as well give the brand names with the forms, for concision; also, there's no need for a whole section on brand names if there's only a couple of brand names], and some GA articles on drugs are sensibly adjusting the suggested sections to better fit each case).  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 05:06, 16 May 2016 (UTC)
No the two MOS are not in sync.  WP:PHARM says list them all but MEDMOS advises away where it explicitly says &quot;Try to avoid cloning drug formularies such as the BNF and online resources like RxList and Drugs.com.&quot;.  There is no encyclopedic value to a CATALOG of drug names that you can find at dozens of sites.  I generally list the originator name and then &quot;there are many brands available worldwide&quot; and cite the laundry list at drugs.com.  I often do that in the context of writing a history section that talks about who discovered it when and where, and the series of relationships that were struck to bring the drug to market, and when it went generic.  I most recently did that a couple of days ago when i completely revised the rospium chloride article; the rospium_chloride#History|history took a few hours to work out and I am still not clear on the relationship between the 2 German companies.  There was also some interesting litigation around trademarks on names that I added content on here: rospium_chloride#Society_and_culture.  There is no encyclopedic value to a LAUNDRYLIST of names.  I am baffled that people are claiming there is and no one has articulated any encyclopedic value, nor why we should contravene the policy, P:NOTCATALOG.   ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 06:25, 16 May 2016 (UTC)
That's not what we actually meant when we said to avoid cloning drug formularies.  :-/  A drug formulary tells you chemical and clinical information about the drug, e.g., side effects and contraindications.  It does not (traditionally) tell you business information, such as the variety of trademarks or manufacturers (although online ones probably do, to help with earch engine optimization).
IMO the main value in that &quot;laundry list&quot; of names is helping people figure out if they're at the right page.  Every one of those names should have a redirect that points to the article, and it is standard practice to mention terms that redirect to a page (except for trivial variations).  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 13:22, 16 May 2016 (UTC)
The two sources cited in the MEDMOS, RxList and drugs.com both list all the tradenames, so I have no idea what you are talking about.  People can figure out if they are at the right article but clicking on the link to a reference that has the laundry list. Now you seem to be saying that we should be in the business of SEO, and that Wikipedia editors should waste their time copying lists of drug brand names into Wikipedia and then maintaining those laundrylists when people spam unsourced trademark-sounding names into the list, which happens all the time. You are not dealing with that.  You are just armchair quarterbacking and I have no idea what is at stake for you in this discussion.  ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 15:17, 16 May 2016 (UTC)
What's at stake?  How about a decent encyclopedia article that contains information beyond the medical POV?  Maybe we could even getting some shared agreement of what PHARMOS and MEDMOS mean, when they (both of them) say that there should normally be a subsection called Brand names, so that we can stop having disputes between editors who read the advice and added this business-related information, and editors who blank their efforts as spam.
Back on the original point:  a rug formulary is a list of ingredients and other information about how to make a drug.  See these [https://books.google.com/books?id=wxO0AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=181#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false two examples] from a [https://books.google.com/books?id=o-_DiFbjSRIC&amp;pg=151#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false traditional] drug formulary.  The lists ingredients, dosing, and sometimes side effects.  It does not list any brand names.  Now, it's possible that modern online drug formularies list brand names for SEO purposes (NB, I didn't say that Wikipedia should do SEO efforts; instead, I said that Drugs.com might be doing that).  However, traditional drug formularies didn't include that information.  MEDMOS gives a specific example on the subject of how not to be like a drug formulary, and that example is about creating laundry lists of side effects (=a component of traditional drug formularies).  MEDMOS doesn't say anything agains listing business information, nor about removing brand names (which ought to redirect to that article).  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 15:23, 19 May 2016 (UTC)

 RfC: Wikidata in infoboxes, opt-in or opt-out? 

There is currently an RfC at ikipedia:Village_pump_(policy)#RfC:_Wikidata_in_infoboxes.2C_opt-in_or_opt-out.3F which has the potential to have a major impact on how we use templates. The new emplate:Infobox medical condition(new) is a ß-version displaying a number of great uses of Wikidata for diseases and medical conditions — see for example out. Changing policy of Wikidata items to opt-in would undermine the entire venture and lose a potential source of quality data for article infoboxes.

Am trying to figure that out.  From what I can tell with &quot;opt in&quot; you would need to add some kind of flag to the infobox (or maybe to each field?) to allow WikiData in.   I think that is better, based on the little I know.  WikiData gets manipulated by SEO folks all the time (there are SEOs who market themselves as doing that for clients), there is all kinds of unsourced data in it from what I gather, and i have no idea how well or how carefully curated it is.  Also changes it makes to the actual infobox should show up in the history and therefore in watchlists, and they don't now. ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 23:03, 16 May 2016 (UTC)

  The statement &quot;WikiData gets manipulated by SEO folks all the time&quot; is misleading.  While there is no question that, like any other entity on the internet, SEO people do look at and try to leverage Wikidata, it is not a good argument against using it in the context of  building infoboxes on Wikipedia.  A lot more SEO energy goes into manipulating Wikipedia itself and, because its text and not just data, this manipulation can be much more subtle.  (e.g. See http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/08/wikipedia-editors-for-pay/393926/ ).  The other argument about unsourced statements is also misleading.  Yes, there are many unsourced statements on Wikidata - the great majority of these were taken directly from Wikipedia hence its a little backwards to suggest that Wikipedia text is by default more reliable.  That aside, there is no reason that unsourced statements need to appear in any infoboxes.  Infobox code can be used to check what references exist on claims and make sure they match the infobox creator's criteria for inclusion before being rendered.  --ser:I9606|Benjamin Good (ser talk:I9606|talk) 16:47, 20 May 2016 (UTC)
ser:I9606 My comment was not misleading; it is an absolutely valid concern.  What would address it, would be an explanation of what efforts are made in WikiData to patrol and ensure that changes made to WikiData are neutral and well-sourced.  We spend a lot of effort here at WP:MED just maintaining articles; we are acutely aware of efforts to create and manipulate WP articles for promotion.  So please address the concern instead of spinning away from it.   If you cannot, then I for one will just need to oppose opt-out. ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 17:05, 20 May 2016 (UTC)
Wouldn't it depend upon the type of data?  For example, I'm not sure how a GeneReviews id number could be non-neutral, and it's pretty much self-sourcing (the id number is all you need to build a URL to the entry in the database [we're doing that right now in infoboxes]).  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 20:50, 20 May 2016 (UTC)

When you need data on thousands of pages, it's better that we do a special-request one-time run. Massviews is capped at 500 pages because querying much more than that through the API is either going to leave you with incomplete data, or you'll have to wait a considerably long time -- for the entire WP:MED project perhaps an hour or more. Tag on mobile vs desktop views and you're doubling the execution time! Since you want monthly data, perhaps we could instead create a service to suit this need, so that it is ran only once per month.

 Help 

Hi. I could really use some help with managing an expert review of arkinson's disease. 

I need someone with medical or scientific literacy and access to an online medical library to find strong recent sources that support some of the changes my reviewers are recommending. In the areas of their individual expertise they have no problem identifying the best sources but when they notice errors outside their specific fields, they struggle. I have searched the freely available literature and found a lot but now I need the help of someone with paywall access. 
 
The review is basically complete but we can't bring it to the talk page without bringing sources too.

I've learned a lot from this experience, and look forward to sharing that once we're done. --ser:Anthonyhcole|Anthonyhcole (ser talk:Anthonyhcole|talk · pecial:Contributions/Anthonyhcole|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Anthonyhcole|email)  11:00, 22 May 2016 (UTC)

 Can freely licensed videos from institutions include copyrighted logos in end credits?

*File:American Chemical Society - What Chemists Do - Nathan Allen.webm

The merican Chemical Society has applied a free license to a video. I expect that in the future more organizations will consider sharing videos. It is fairly common for videos to include credits somewhere. It is also common for online video for the credit to be in the form of a logo, and perhaps a copyrighted logo.

As the Wikipedia community negotiates these kinds of institutional partnerships and gets video donations, are credits acceptable in videos? What about the inclusion of copyrighted logos? I started a discussion on Commons. Anyone may comment either here or there.

 hemical imbalance 

What do other people think about this title and the article in general? It's about the hypothesis that chemical imbalances cause depression. It seems like this article is turning this into a straw-nature vs nurture debate. There's also a bit of big pharma conspiracy theory. To the best of my knowledge, the mainstream view is that depression, like all mental illness, is caused by a combination of iopsychosocial factors. It's my understanding that a lot of psychiatrists no longer love the phrase &quot;chemical imbalance&quot; because it's an inaccurate analogy as to why the body's natural level of serotonin isn't working effectively, not that they reject the idea that neurotransmitters and serotonin are involved. My questions for others are: (1) Does it seem like this article is supposed to be about (a) neurological hypotheses for the cause of depression in general or (b) is it actually about the acceptance, or lack there of, of the phrase &quot;chemical imbalance&quot;? (2) If it's option A, is this the best title for the topic and should it be merged with iology of depression? ser:Permstrump|—PermStrumpser Talk:Permstrump|(talk) 22:46, 20 May 2016 (UTC)

Better than a freestanding article, but I'm not sure there should be anything at this title, even a redirect.

ing|Permstrump Jytdog turned the title hemical imbalance into a redirect to iology of depression#Monoamines (also the target of onoamine hypothesis). I agree with him that there shouldn't be an article with the title &quot;chemical imbalance&quot;, but think the term is too general to redirect to something specifically about depression. Skimming the Google results shows the term in use to describe anxiety, bipolar disorder, ADHD, and schizophrenia, among other more general descriptive uses. (Strictly speaking, any metabolic abnormality would fit the description.) I suggested that the page history of hemical imbalance be moved to the longer term hemical imbalance theory of depression or something similar, which would turn up as a suggested item in the drop-down as you type in the search box. I imagine the search results page would look similar to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=chemical+imbalance&amp;title=Special:Search&amp;fulltext=1 current status].

 e|Opabinia regalis thanks for the explanation! Your suggestion of moving the page history to &quot;Chemical imbalance theory of depression&quot; makes sense to me. I think you're right that people commonly say &quot;chemical imbalance&quot; to refer to things other than depression, so it wouldn't be obvious to most people that that's what they'd find in the page history of &quot;Chemical imbalance&quot;. I'll take a look at iopsychiatry controversy. I'm cringing at what I can already guess I'll find there.

I'm sort of late to this discussion, but I figured I'd just drop this here since this came up on my talk page at one point.  The more current &quot;monoamine hypothesis&quot; of depression is described below.ite book | author = Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE | editor = Sydor A, Brown RY | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 9780071481274 | pages = 355–360 | edition = 2nd | chapter = Chapter 14:Neuropharmacology of Neural Systems and Disorders | quote= Pharmacologic observations such as these led to a simple hypothesis: depression is the result of inadequate monoamine neurotransmission, and clinically effective antidepressants work by increasing the availability of monoamines. Yet this hypothesis has failed to explain the observation that weeks of treatment with antidepressants are required before clinical efficacy becomes apparent, despite the fact that the inhibitory actions of these agents—whether in relation to reuptake or monoamine oxidase—are immediate. This delay in therapeutic effect eventually led investigators to theorize that long-term adaptations in brain function, rather than increases in synaptic norepinephrine and serotonin per se, most likely underlie the therapeutic effects of antidepressant drugs. Consequently, the focus of research on antidepressants has shifted from the study of their immediate effects to the investigation of effects that develop more slowly. The anatomic focus of research on antidepressants also has shifted. Although monoamine synapses are believed to be the immediate targets of antidepressant drugs, more attention is given to the target neurons of monoamines, where chronic alterations in monoaminergic inputs caused by antidepressant drugs presumably lead to long-lasting adaptations that underlie effective treatment of depression. The identification of molecular and cellular adaptations that occur in response to antidepressants, and the location of the cells and circuits in which they occur, are the chief goals that guide current research. The work described toward the beginning of the chapter on mood-regulating circuits that involve the subgenual cingulate gyrus, for instance, represent a significant advance over a narrow focus on monoamine neuron function. ...Long-term adaptations in antidepressant actionThe several weeks latency in onset of the therapeutic actions of antidepressants contributes to distress and clinical risk for those with severe depression. In the search for treatments of more rapid onset, great effort has gone into trying to understand the delay in efficacy of current antidepressants. All current ideas posit that antidepressant-induced increases in synaptic monoamine concentrations cause slowly accumulating adaptive changes in target neurons. Two broad classes of theories have emerged: (1) Changes in protein phosphorylation, gene expression, and protein translation occur in target neurons that ultimately alter synaptic structure or function in a way that relieves symptoms; and (2) antidepressant-induced neurogenesis in the hippocampus and the incorporation of those new neurons into functional circuits is a required step in the therapeutic response. Before considering specific hypotheses, however, it is important to discuss obstacles in relating research in animal models to human depression. ...

The original monoamine hypothesis basically focused entirely on the level of the synaptic cleft - the area between 2 neurons. The more recent version (which reflects the underlined theory in the citation above) posits that antidepressant efficacy arises from the changes that they induce inside the postsynaptic neuron following chronic exposure, much like how addictive drugs induce a state of addiction following chronic exposure. ser:Seppi333|Seppi333 (ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert 2¢) 19:49, 25 May 2016 (UTC)

 Contraindications 

Every FDA label that I have ever read has listed a known hypersensitivity to the drug itself or any of the xcipients in a drug as a contraindication.  Sometimes it's literally the only contraindication for a drug, e.g., [http://www.alinia.com/images/Alinia-Prescribing-Information.pdf nitazoxanide (brand: Alinia)].

So, eta-Hydroxy beta-methylbutyric acid#Contraindications|should I do this even though I probably can't cite this exact statement?  I normally wouldn't care to add a statement like this to an article on a biologically active compound which isn't an FDA-approved prescription drug, but I intend to improve this article to FA status and figured it should conform to the MOS.

Fun fact #1:  &quot;Impact factor&quot; isn't even mentioned in MEDRS.  Neither the existence of an impact factor, nor any particular minimum threshold, is actually required by any guideline on reliable sources.  I think, considering their newness and lack of selectivity (what Co-factor Science diplomatically calls a &quot;mega journal&quot;), that we can safely assume that their impact factor, should anyone ever bother to calculate it, would be low. 
Fun fact #2:  [https://blog.cureus.com/tag/impact-factor/ Cureus' founder's blog] links to our article on mpact factors.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:40, 26 May 2016 (UTC)

I don't claim to be a MEDRS expert by any stretch, but it seems to me that the impact factor concept provides potent evidence of a journal's reputation, which is already a central component of MEDRS. In other words, impact factor is highly relevant even if it isn't explicitly referenced in the guideline. --ser:DrFleischman|Dr. Fleischman (ser talk:DrFleischman|talk) 17:40, 26 May 2016 (UTC)
If compared to a similar journal, you can get some idea of the number of scholars who cite the articles in the one versus the other, which is probably a decent marker of interest or relevance, or at least the fashionability of its subject matter.  That's not quite the same thing as &quot;reputation&quot;, since even edical Hypotheses has an impact factor above 1 (a commonly proposed threshold in such discussions).
The main problem is when editors use impact factors to compare non-comparable journals.  agazine circulation, the number of articles published each year, and the UTON bias significantly affect the impact factor, irrespective of actual quality.  Niche journals have lower impact factors than general medical journals, even when the niche journal is higher quality.  Review journals get more citations than original experiments (this bias works well for our purposes, of course).  An impact factor of 1.0 is decidedly weak for some types of journals, but rather good for others.  
I agree with Jytdog that people do talk about impact factors, usually when they're trying to provide a rational-sounding reason for rejecting a source they dislike.  However, these discussions frequently involve such ham-fisted, one-size-fits-all notions, and with no effort to determine whether the journal's average popularity among authors is relevant to the particular proposed claim, that the result is some poor decisions.  We're probably headed to the same place with impact factors that P:NSCHOOLS reached long ago:  some editors will assert that all elementary schools are non-notable, even if you have provided dozens of top-quality sources, but every high school in the developed world is notable, even if the only (semi-)independent source you've found is the neighborhood newspaper.  That doesn't demonstrate good editorial judgment.
I keep hoping that ser:DGG will write up a good explanation of the pitfalls at ikipedia:Impact factor, but I recognize that this is a time-consuming request.   ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 01:38, 27 May 2016 (UTC)
Just dealing with this journal, no journal  can as a matter of  definition   have an impact factor until it has been published for two full years--that is required before the computation can be done.  Whether this is a RS depends on the quality of the peer review which is promised.  
More generally, and very briefly:  the key thing about impact factor is that it is field-depoendent--it depends on the density of citations in a subject. Since articles  in clinical medicine   very heavily cite each other , high impact factors are to be expected. If we take the journals indexed by science citation index as the totality of the reputable journals, the most interesting statistic is where the journal stands in the list of those for the particular subject, and ISI specifically publishes those rankings.  
There are multiple factors which additionally need interpretation. Since all articles in a field cite the most recent review articles, review journals as distinct from primary journals have unusually high impact factors. Citation measures interest as much as merit--journals concentrating on topics heavily in vogue also have higher impact factors than they would otherwise warrant. These are questions of interpretation, rather than error, but there are also sources of error, such as a journal having one or two heavily cited articles not representative of the whole, and the various modes of self-citation that cause unrealistically high impact factors. ISI normally correct for these, or if extreme, removes the journal.  
It's just like judge RSs for WP, or judging whether a scientist is an authority:  judging the reliability of a journal is not mechanical, and takes judgment. One key non-impact related factor that is particularly pertinent in this field, especially with alt med, is that a few journals will quite deliberately publish what they know to be controversial articles in order to encourage discussion--the famous journal most noted for doing so every once in a while is Nature. ser:DGG| DGG (ser talk:DGG| talk ) 03:52, 27 May 2016 (UTC)

Dependence from long-term drug use may have both a somatic component, manifested by physical symptoms, and an emotional–motivation component, manifested by dysphoria.  While physical dependence and withdrawal occur with some drugs of abuse (opiates, ethanol), these phenomena are not useful in the diagnosis of addiction because they do not occur with other drugs of abuse (cocaine, amphetamine) and can occur with many drugs that are not abused (propranolol, clonidine).The official diagnosis of drug addiction by the Diagnostic and Statistic Manual of Mental Disorders (2000), which makes distinctions between drug use, abuse, and substance dependence, is flawed. First, diagnosis of drug use versus abuse can be arbitrary and reflect cultural norms, not medical phenomena.  Second, the term substance dependence implies that dependence is the primary pharmacologic phenomenon underlying addiction, which is likely not true, as tolerance, sensitization, and learning and memory also play central roles. It is ironic and unfortunate that the Manual avoids use of the term addiction, which provides the best description of the clinical syndrome.  Personally, I don't really care what the heading is titled so long as the subheadings are kept separate. An alternative would be to just remove the heading and increase the heading level of the subsections.  Keeping the discussion of addiction and dependence separate in an article reflects the distinction we've been making in OS:MED/OS:PHARM and in the drugbox fields for addiction vs dependence liabilities. ser:Seppi333|Seppi333 (ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert 2¢) 16:38, 26 May 2016 (UTC)

A storyline in the Incredible Hulk series in 2000 saw ulk (comics)|Bruce Banner dealing with the revelation that he has ALSThe Incredible Hulk vol.2 #12[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=720511764&amp;oldid=720437837]

Often people reference the comic itself or the tv show etc. IMO this is primary research? Wondering what others thoughts are? ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk · pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 15:37, 16 May 2016 (UTC)
agree this edit [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis&amp;diff=720511764&amp;oldid=720437837] does not enhance the Society and culture section of myotrophic_lateral_sclerosis...IMO(while the Research section could use help/edits)--ser:Ozzie10aaaa|Ozzie10aaaa (ser talk:Ozzie10aaaa|talk) 21:41, 16 May 2016 (UTC)
That edit is actually valid in terms of fiction and TV shows.  OS:PLOT says: q|The plot summary for a work, on a page about that work, does not need to be sourced with in-line citations, as it is generally assumed that the work itself is the primary source for the plot summary. However, editors are encouraged to add sourcing if possible. If a plot summary includes a direct quote from the work, this must be cited using inline citations per WP:QUOTE. Sometimes a work will be summarized by secondary sources, which can be used for sourcing. Otherwise, using brief quotation citations from the primary work can be helpful to source key or complex plot points. Presenting fictional material from the original work is allowed, provided passages are short, are given the proper context, and do not constitute the main portion of the article. If such passages stray into the realm of interpretation, per P:PRIMARY, secondary sources must be provided to avoid original research. Plot summaries cannot engage in interpretation and should only present an obvious recap of the work. 
 Feels terribly like OR to me but that is how those people roll.  There isn't a basis in policy/guideline to exclude it in the Society and culture section.  Maybe split off in a subsection about popular culture/media or something. ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 23:08, 16 May 2016 (UTC)
 |Jytdog makes a fair point about OS:PLOT, but there is something that feels weird about it. I think it arguably goes against OS:INUNIVERSE, unless there are independent sources saying the same thing. I'm not familiar with the comic, but if there aren't other sources saying the same thing, I wonder if the comic explicitly said he had ALS or if it was just heavily implied.

Oh no, that happened.  I remember buzz in ALS-land when that issue published. ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 21:42, 17 May 2016 (UTC)
 Hah, well then I would assume it could be backed up with a more reliable source. ser:Permstrump|—PermStrumpser Talk:Permstrump|(talk) 02:42, 18 May 2016 (UTC)

I have generally always stood by the principle that cultural allusions should be supported by a secondary source, ideally one that documents the impact on the public perception of a medical condition. Just saying that a disease is used a plot device is not encyclopedic in my view. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 09:46, 19 May 2016 (UTC)
If diseases as plot devices were notable, there'd be about 1 disease/popular culture reference for every episode of ouse (TV series) (177 total), which includes ALS. |7 ser:Seppi333|Seppi333 (ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert 2¢) 17:52, 20 May 2016 (UTC)
I just noticed Wikipedia literally has an entire list-class article dedicated to this: ist of diagnoses from House (TV series). ALS was a plot device in an episode titled &quot;Do not resuscitate&quot; (NR (House)). ser:Seppi333|Seppi333 (ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert 2¢) 21:57, 29 May 2016 (UTC)
 Yeah, see that. Shall we then exclude the series from all the &quot;In popular culture&quot; sections? Not sure whether the series left a lasting impression on popular culture - although, again, I am not based in the US. — ser:Kashmiri|kashmiri ser talk:Kashmiri|TALK 07:43, 21 May 2016 (UTC)
Wouldn't it be simplest and most consistent to base inclusion on notability in reliable sources?  If a RS indicates that a mention on House is notable, then include it. I see no consistency in having an arbitrary approach to one series. But, I don't watch TV so I may be overestimating the value of sourcing on this topic.  — ser:soupvector|soupvector (ser_talk:soupvector|talk) 15:58, 21 May 2016 (UTC)
The question is did whatever bit of popular culture have a meaningful impact on the disease? If no we should not mention it at the disease article. Could go on the article about the popular culture thing though. I see much of this as trivia unless if gets significant third party press. ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk · pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 17:38, 22 May 2016 (UTC)

From what I understand http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2082580/?ref_=ttep_ep4 is user generated thus would not be a sufficient source for [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eclampsia&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=721939409&amp;oldid=721556991]? ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk · pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 01:52, 25 May 2016 (UTC)
 IMDB is user-generated, so it shouldn't be used to establish WEIGHT for including the citation. I'm not sure how one would decide that though. ser:Permstrump|—PermStrumpser Talk:Permstrump|(talk) 02:18, 25 May 2016 (UTC)

 Specific question 

Hello all! I was going through mphotericin_B#Mechanism_of_action and I'm having trouble corroborating the following sentence: &quot;can lead to amphotericin resistance in species such as scedosporium prolificans without having to effect (?) cell wall ergosterol&quot;, within the two sources specified, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1211/0022357022359/abstract] and [http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmicb.2012.00286/full]. Any thoughts? Much appreciated. Oh and ping me if you can. Regards, ser:FoCuSandLeArN|FoCuS pecial:Contributions/FoCuSandLeArN|contribs; ser_talk:FoCuSandLeArN|talk to me! 23:58, 30 May 2016 (UTC)

 eply to |FoCuSandLeArN The [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3441194/ first source] contains these statements: &quot;q|An early study demonstrated that addition of free radicals scavengers, such as catalase and/or superoxide dismutase, protects C. albicans protoplasts from the lytic effect of AmB (Sokol-Anderson et al., 1986).&quot; and &quot;q|Acquired resistance to AmB is very low despite its widespread use. Secondary resistance has been described in C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, C. lusitanie, and C. haemulonii (Powderly et al., 1988; Ellis, 2002). In contrast, in the last years, there has been an increase in the incidence of infections caused by fungi intrinsically resistant to AmB, such as A. terreus, Fusarium spp, and Scedosporium prolificans (Cuenca-Estrella et al., 1999; Sutton et al., 1999; Khan et al., 2007; Rogasi et al., 2007). I think that the editor conflated the two and missed the point that cedosporium prolificans is described as intrinsically resistant to AmB, compared with andida albicans, which can gain resistance to AmB in the presence of anti-oxidative agents even though the membrane channel mechanism would remain unaffected. Perhaps you can amend our article to better summarise the source?
 The [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1211/0022357022359/abstract second source], relating the effect of oxorubicin on AmB action, is weak, by the way, and as a primary study really doesn't deserve a mention when considering mechanism of action and effectiveness (those topics benefit greatly from using a secondary source). Hope that helps. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 01:22, 31 May 2016 (UTC)
 |FoCuSandLeArN|FoCuS I could only understand about every other word, but I'm procrastinating some stuff that I need to be doing at home, so I figured I'd trim off some of the superfluous wording and add some wikilinks to make it easier to understand. I was wondering if the editor had misunderstood the same section that |RexxS pasted above (except I wouldn't have been able to articulate it as well), so I agree with RexxS that the sources do not corroborate the part of the sentence that you asked about. ser:Permstrump|—PermStrumpser Talk:Permstrump|(talk) 01:57, 31 May 2016 (UTC)

Does this seem to others to be a source we should be using? ser:LeadSongDog|LeadSongDog ser talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl! 20:24, 1 June 2016 (UTC)
Is it better than nothing, maybe. Is it a good source, No. ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk · pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 21:44, 1 June 2016 (UTC)
MedicineNet is [http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=12510 owned and operated by WebMD] and so is in the same category of non-peer-reviewed health-for-the-layperson publications from a medical organization like the [http://healthletter.mayoclinic.com/faq.cfm Mayo Clinic Health Letter] and [http://www.healthharvard.edu/newsletters/harvard_health_letter Harvard Health Letter.] On rare occasion, when sound secondary or MEDRS-quality sources aren't available, something like MedicineNet fills a temporary gap. Typical of such articles, the report on kinesio tape (almost pseudoscience &quot;alternative medicine&quot;, in my view) is written by one author and reviewed/approved by two MDs, which is really a thin layer of peer-review with inadequate skepticism. --ser:Zefr|Zefr (ser talk:Zefr|talk) 22:27, 1 June 2016 (UTC)
And possibly therefore reflective of current Western medical practice, although that's irrelevant for the context.  The source is being used to support this claim:  &quot;The tape is applied with the affected muscle in a stretched position, taping from the origin of the muscle to the insertion point. Once applied, it is rubbed to activate the pressure-sensitive adhesive&quot;.  That doesn't need a gold-plated source behind it.
Also, that in that diff, the WebMD-related source is being used to replace a link to a FAQ on the manufacturer's website, which probably constitutes an net improvement for the article.  We must not let the perfect be the enemy of the good, especially where somewhat spammy refs are concerned.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 23:01, 1 June 2016 (UTC)
