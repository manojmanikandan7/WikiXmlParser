 Health campaign citations 

Hello - I am a paid editor/project coordinator with the hoosing Wisely health campaign. I would like advice about proper citation formats because I am doing something which I have not seen done before and which could be scaled to a large number (300+ for this campaign?) of Wikipedia articles. I am bundling references and introducing them with a layman reference. I am requesting feedback on the appropriateness of the bundling, the introduction with the layman reference, the P:MEDRS appropriateness of the layman reference, and any other aspect of what I am proposing.

In oronary disease I posted some sample information from this campaign and I copied that information here below. Could I have feedback on this?

I inserted a medical society's message and then provided four P:CITEBUNDLE|bundled references. Three of the references are from review articles and are undoubtedly what Wikiproject Medicine normally uses. However, I introduced all of these references with a layman interpretation published by the merican Society of Echocardiography and reviewed by the BIM Foundation (which is associated with the merican Board of Internal Medicine). This &quot;layman interpretation&quot; is a two-page document; the first page gives plain-language explanations of health concepts, and the second page only gives referrals to what Wikipedia calls &quot;MEDRS&quot; sources.

I feel that the layman interpretation meets MEDRS because of this statement from the MEDRS intro: &quot;Ideal sources for such content includes general or systematic reviews published in reputable medical journals, academic and professional books written by experts in the relevant field and from a respected publisher, and medical guidelines or position statements from nationally or internationally recognised expert bodies.&quot; The layman statements are either secondary or tertiary sources written by the publishers of United States medical journals who are national experts, and indeed, who certify their field's specialists. In addition to meeting the criteria of being from experts, the layman explanations are position statements from those same nationally recognized expert bodies. The layman explanations are not published in any book or academic journal, and beyond that, a user suggested that I post to this board and get feedback on whether they are appropriate. This is somewhat self-promotional; hoosing_Wisely#Partners|here is a list of medical societies which want content from their fields to be on Wikipedia.

I support citing the layman statements only bundled with the scholarly articles, and I like that the medical societies who are wanting to develop Wikipedia are recognizing that to do so they must provide citations to scholarly review articles. I hope that all health education campaigns start providing citations like this, because I think that combining layman explanations with academic journals empowers the reader to start with an explanation they can understand and then seek more information in the journals if they can manage it. I feel that it is very difficult for a layperson to verify the accuracy of a Wikipedia medical reference which only leads to a journal because the journal article is never written for a lay audience, whereas in this scheme, anyone can verify the Wikipedia statement based on the lay text and plainly see that the lay text comes from an academic journal.

To what extent are the layman explanations welcome? How do Wikiproject Medicine members feel about my bundling multiple citations to support a statement? How would anyone here feel about broadly encouraging health organizations to publish statements of this sort - layman statements combined with non-layman references - for dissemination through Wikipedia and other channels? Thanks for your attention. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 16:20, 5 March 2013 (UTC)
l|cite journal has layman parameters. One can cite an ideal MEDRS then cite the freely accessible lay summary. I recommend not bundling. Though rarely useful, I haven't ever felt it was necessary to do it in an article I've edited here. I prefer placing citations directly behind the text it supports to maintain P:Text–source integrity. ser:Biosthmors|Biosthmors (ser talk:Biosthmors|talk) 16:44, 5 March 2013 (UTC)
My rationale for bundling is that the health campaign does bundling. P:Text–source integrity problems should not occur in this case because the format of the campaign is to give a sentence in lain English and then provide 1-4 citations for that statement. The medical society purports that the sources given were the basis for them making the lay statement. Take a look at [http://www.choosingwisely.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/ASE-5things-List_Web-feb.pdf an example source] - the layman information is connected to medical journals.
The laysummary parameter is interesting, but not quite appropriate in this case because the layman statement here is not a summary, but rather a single bit of information which the health campaign is emphasizing. Also, the laysummary parameter would not address the citation of multiple sources, and the medical societies are suggesting that multiple academic sources back most of their statements. Thoughts? ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 21:39, 5 March 2013 (UTC)
I like that the these documents were published, because I want people receiving the best treatment. But I think the single bit of information the health campaign wants to include in Wikipedia should be found in a standard ideal MEDRS. Then one can cite the accessible document with the layman parameter. Three and four citations are ikipedia:Citation overkill, in my opinion. Over at eep vein thrombosis I don't use three citations behind anything. That the health campaign does bundling isn't a valid rationale that fits with normal Wikipedia practices, in my opinion. Shouldn't we have a &quot;trust but verify&quot; approach when it comes to these documents? I think we need to dig into the ideal MEDRS' ourselves. I know the document says &quot;the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) identified these interventions&quot; but there isn't even a publication date on them. I wonder when the next clinical practice guideline is coming out and if any CPGs have been published after these sorts of documents. ser:Biosthmors|Biosthmors (ser talk:Biosthmors|talk) 22:29, 6 March 2013 (UTC)
Agree with Bios none of these conclusions are very controversial and all are supported by high quality references.

 Birth Control: Africa 

Greetings everyone! I am planning on editing the Birth Control page, subsection Africa. As of now the section only includes 3 sentences all of which are outdated. It is clear this section is underdeveloped and I am taking this opportunity to expand upon it. I understand that Africa is a big continent thus I will make sure to use facts that are relevant to the continent as a whole and if not I will make sure to note that. I also hope to include a new graphic image that may be more accurate. Some of the many sources I will be drawing from are &quot;Family Planning in Sub Saharan Africa: Progress or Stagnation?&quot; published by the Bulletin of the World Health Organization in 2011, &quot;Low use of contraception among poor women in Africa, an equity issue” , and ‘‘HIV Transmission During Pediatric Health Care in Sub-Saharan Africa: Risks and Evidence.’’published in the South African 
Medical Journal in 2004. Do you have any advice?

At the Areola article, I reverted the editor named Dr.breast because his edits were ikipedia:Verifiability|unsourced and provided P:UNDUE WEIGHT to certain aspects.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Areola&amp;diff=542517392&amp;oldid=542513496][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Areola&amp;diff=542517470&amp;oldid=542517392][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Areola&amp;diff=542517797&amp;oldid=542517470] I [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Dr.breast&amp;diff=542520174&amp;oldid=542519487 left him a Welcome template mentioning that], as well the P:Conflict of interest guideline. It's not yet clear if he will continue to try to contribute to the Areola article. But if he does, more eyes on that article from this project other than mine may be needed to continue to guide him in the right direction. ser:Flyer22|Flyer22 (ser talk:Flyer22|talk) 05:23, 7 March 2013 (UTC)

Some of this certainly belongs in other articles (or even in other websites, for the very detailed material), but he did refer to some studies for part of it, even though he didn't format them with the complex wikimarkup like you're used to seeing.  Of the content there, only the &quot;areolas get darker if you sunbathe&quot; bit and the variation in size of the areolas seemed especially relevant.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:21, 7 March 2013 (UTC)
You are right, the wet nurse story has distracted me from the the color changes. Some mention of it was already in Gray's anatomy, not sure if there has been much followup in modern research.

 ynecomastia 

I could use some extra eyes on the Gynecomastia article please. User Richiez is disputing (and editing, I am attempting to avoid an edit war here) that neonatal gynecomastia is from the transplacental transfer of maternal hormones. This is well-sourced information from medical journal review articles (recent ones) and Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine. I am happy to provide additional references if needed but help on this matter would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. ser:TylerDurden8823|TylerDurden8823 (ser talk:TylerDurden8823|talk) 22:15, 7 March 2013 (UTC)

Talk it out. This is one where it looks like you both have valid points and just need to hammer out technical details. With no sources in front of me (that can change in a few hours), the role of transplacental hormone exchange vs placental-derived striol is the issue. Discuss your sources on the talk page, and if you can't reach an agreement on wording, I'll chime in when I can. (A link to itch's milk might be in order.)ser:Novangelis|Novangelis (ser talk:Novangelis|talk) 22:33, 7 March 2013 (UTC)
I have yet to see a valid point on how neonatal gynecomastia is not caused by maternal transfer of hormones. Not a single source provided to support this claim let alone a reliable one. I have provided some and this user does not listen. I cannot assume good faith any longer after I took time to clearly explain this earlier and the user persists. I'm not sure where you got the idea of where the discussion is about transplacental hormone exchange vs. placental-derived estriol. If that's the issue, then user Richiez needs to make that much clearer. I have discussed sources on the talk page and have plenty more to use if needed. What do you mean a link to witch's milk might be in order? Do you mean a wikilink to it? Or do you mean something on the talk page? I'm not clear. Anyway, still requesting more eyes on the gynecomastia article. The user does not listen to me, ignores the evidence I have provided, and I am really trying to prevent an edit war. It would mean more if more voices discussed this on the talk page then just us. Here is one source (also on the talk page) just as a for instance: http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2276281 ser:TylerDurden8823|TylerDurden8823 (ser talk:TylerDurden8823|talk) 22:38, 7 March 2013 (UTC)

The Harrisson textbook that you are claiming to be your reference is apparently misrepresented, so what is your point. ser:Richiez|Richiez (ser talk:Richiez|talk) 22:52, 7 March 2013 (UTC)
EuropePMC.org is the urope PubMed Central.  It is basically the same as the US's PubMed. 
You might also want to look into arrison's Principles of Internal Medicine.  It is possibly the most popular med school textbook for the relevant field.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 01:13, 8 March 2013 (UTC)

I think we need a bit of common sense here. It is a completely benign phenomenon and apparently there has not been a single review article since 35 years looking at it. In this situation I believe it is best to avoid any incomplete/misleading/false statements and simply make no statement at all. ser:TylerDurden8823|TylerDurden8823 is citing one textbook as a source. The textbook does not list its sources and there is a whole lot of evidence I have listed in contrary of what the textbook says. ser:Richiez|Richiez (ser talk:Richiez|talk) 22:59, 7 March 2013 (UTC)
I see in your earlier paragraph on the article talk page (which I felt was fairly incomprehensible and disorganized, so you'll have to forgive me if I was confused by what you wrote. I could not tell if you were discussing witch's milk or gynecomastia this morning when I first glanced at that) you said you would rather remove the explanation than keep it if we cannot agree on this, but you said that the current explanation is wrong and it is not, at least according to current reliable sources. As I have said, there is room to say that it is incomplete but this is not the same thing. I have asked repeatedly for evidence of current review articles refuting the idea of neonatal gynecomastia stemming from transplacental hormone transfer and do not see any provided on the talk page under your comments. The paper about soy feeding (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18223379?dopt=Abstract) in females does not seem relevant given that gynecomastia is defined in the literature as benign enlargement of the male breast glandular tissue (not females) as defined in the source you yourself provided (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2770912/) citing that 60-90% of neonates have some gynecomastia. If your argument is that this paper did not specify male neonates, I see your point there, but it is still defined as benign enlargement of male breast glandular tissue. No correlation was found in boys in this study you cited (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12409513?dopt=Abstract) which is also not a recent review but a primary study from 2002. This (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3348660?dopt=Abstract) is an old paper from 1988, however, at least this one explicitly asserts that its hypothesis is that infant gonad secretions are responsible for the breast tissue remaining and not the maternal hormones. Regardless, it is an old source and is insufficient to refute newer reviews, which in all likelihood took these studies into account. The 1984 paper (here: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1628801/pdf/archdisch00728-0092.pdf) is interesting but it is an old and small study (again, I have a feeling newer reviews have taken these studies into account and still arrived at different conclusions). I cited a paper just above earlier (a review article) that is newer and says that neonatal gynecomastia is from maternal estrogens. I am happy to provide more on the gynecomastia talk page. Did you even try to open the europmc link? It's a review article paper. How is the Harrison's textbook misrepresented? I am reading it right now and I'll even quote it from page 2318 of the 17th edition volume II:&quot; Gynecomastia occurs as a normal physiologic phenomenon in the newborn (due to transplacental transfer of maternal and placental estrogens), during puberty (high estrogen to androgen ratio in early stages of puberty), and with aging (increased fat tissue and increased aromatase activity) but it can also result from pathologic conditions associated with an androgen deficiency or estrogen excess.&quot; Be specific about how that statement is being misrepresented by what I've said. ser:TylerDurden8823|TylerDurden8823 (ser talk:TylerDurden8823|talk) 23:20, 7 March 2013 (UTC)

 Elsevier Journals 

Here is an interesting passage &quot;Until recently, “international, scientific, peer-reviewed journal” has had a fairly specific meaning to the scientific community and society at large: it has meant a journal that checks submitted papers for scientific quality, but also for relevance and interest to its readers, and also ensures that it contains new findings that may advance science. These features render a journal trustworthy and worthy of readers' time and money. Many observers were therefore understandably disturbed when the journal publisher Elsevier admitted in 2009 that it had published six “fake journals” funded by pharmaceutical companies — in Elsevier's own words, “sponsored article compilation publications . . . that were made to look like journals and lacked the proper disclosures.” The company had intentionally exploited the word “journal” to give the impression that these publications were honest and reliable.&quot;[http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1214750]

There is. For convenience, you can simply look them up in the NLM, even if they are not Pubmed indexed.  On James' question, reliability is still dependent on the assertion being backed.

There are two kinds of fraud, and it appears that both have occurred. Biased selections of articles were copied into 'journals', which were then given to physicians for free. That's scientific fraud. In at least one case, a ridiculous meta review citing precisely two references was published. That's also scientific fraud, though of a very obvious nature. Someone in a forum claimed that at least one of these 'journals' was sold independently, which would have been financial fraud.

Merely calling something a &quot;journal&quot; does not create a claim that something is a peer-reviewed academic publication.  After all, The Wall Street Journal is neither peer-reviewed nor academic. 
Lousy papers are not fraud.  raud is when you tell ies about something.  Incompetence, laziness, and stupidity are not fraud.  So if you cite two sources, and those were the only ones you actually used, then that's truthful and not fraudulent.  If, on the other hand, you only use two sources, but you list a hundred because you think that looks more impressive, then that lie might constitute fraud.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:05, 7 March 2013 (UTC)

 ad hatter syndrome? 

Hi - putting on my occupational hat, ad hatter disease|as it were, it occurs to me that Wikipedia needs a link for ad hatter syndrome, which seems to be a somewhat more recognized term than the so-called &quot;mad hatter disease&quot;.

Thank you, Biosthmors.

On the other hand, the only usages of &quot;mad hatter disease&quot; I've come across in scholarly medical articles have been in quotation marks, suggesting to me that it's more of a popular usage (cf ad cow disease) than a recognized medical term.

The risk of non-intervention is not very well quantifiable.

Similarly the risks of intervention vary with the surgical method, environment of the surgery, and the time available for recovery which are not consistent globally, nor from person to person. Who pays may well be the least of the issues.

The mechanism to open &quot;new&quot; vessels is known since long long time ago: ntermittent claudication appears by anaerobic metabolism and actic acid#Exercise and lactate formation. This acid induces an important vasodilation. This helps to develop a collateral supply network. It is the use of something the human body already has to bypass a stenotic or occluded artery.

Given that age 11 is a very typical age for menarche, it's not at all surprising that some 11 year olds get pregnant.  I think I would limit the list to those under the age of 10, which means removing nearly 200 entries for 11 year olds and about 75 for 10 year olds.
Partly I see this as an issue of neutrality, because we will almost never have reliable sources for pregnancies in 10- and 11-year-old girls unless rape is being prosecuted.  Also, the sheer scale of the problem makes it unsuitable for a case-by-case list.  According to [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/7186620/Primary-schoolgirls-getting-pregnant-aged-10.html this news report], there are a couple of these pregnancies every year just in England and Wales.

Still not sure about removing age 10. Thing is, even though it's common for girls to be able to conceive at age 10 or 11, it's still not as common, or close to as common, for 10 and 11-year-olds (or 12-year-olds) to be as sexually active as older adolescents. At least in the Western world. The average age that a person loses his or her virginity in the United States and in the United Kingdom, for example, is age 17.[http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/FB-ATSRH.html][http://www.andosciasociology.net/resources/Sex.SamplePgs.pdf][http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_23/sr23_025.pdf][http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2006/jan/22/britishidentity.deniscampbell1] Most cases of girls becoming pregnant in these two countries at such young ages (such as 10, 11 and 12) is due to an older adolescent or adult having engaged them in sexual activity (which you partly addressed with the rape aspect).

 Can we avoid using &quot;Alternative Medicine&quot; in articles? 

On the Osteoarthritis page there is management called Osteoarthritis#Alternative_medicine. I have checked the page Alternative medicine and I completely agree with &quot;There is no coherent, consistent and widely accepted definition of alternative medicine.&quot; Is Wikipedia a collection of American knowledge, Western knowledge, or human knowledge? I hope the last one. As a source of human knowledge the word &quot;alternative&quot; will change depending on the culture. In the US, Chinese Traditional Medicine is &quot;alternative&quot; and in China it is mainstream. I propose avoiding the term completely like in the Rheumatoid arthritis where the term &quot;other therapies&quot; is used. Ideally, I would like to propose 3 categories 1) Proven treatments 2) Possible treatments 3) Unproven treatments. Category 1 would be for treatments with secondary sources supported by random controlled trials. Category 2 is for treatments that have 1 or more random controlled trials and lack a secondary source. Category 3 is for any other suggested treatments that lack any random controlled trials. What do you think?

Wikipedia's medical content is partly a collection of evidence based medicine or science based medicine. While the exact definition of alt med is unclear most people know it when they see it. We do not include content typically if it lacks a secondary source. And just because there is a RCT does not mean it &quot;works&quot; for anything. Further more there may be RCTs for one indication but not for other. 
Often we divide &quot;management&quot; into &quot;lifestyle&quot;, &quot;medication&quot;, &quot;surgery&quot; and &quot;alternative medicine&quot;.

I think that if our English-language sources usually call something &quot;alternative&quot;, then we can, too, and usually should.

Wrt TCM, although traditional medicine is important in China, its importance is largely the result of the political and economic system in place over the last 60 years. Modern (Western) medicine exceeds traditional medicine in China today both in terms of healthcare delivered and number of practising doctors.

We must be very careful with the section treatment. Wikipedia is not a treatment guide for diseases.

Nothing is well documented in &quot;alternative medicine&quot; statistics are dubious most of the time. And most of the time those &quot;treatments&quot; are only palliative.

If you don't mind a relative newby, who is not even a medical doctor, to put forth an idea, I'd like to contribute to this discussion.  I hate the term alternative medicine.  I don't even like complementary medicine.  Both sound as if they are something that medical doctors do not advocate.  At the same time, there is a great deal of recent, highly rigorous scientific evidence for many of the previously-denigrated practices such as acupuncture and tai chi and yoga and meditation - especially when dealing with topics such as pain management or chronic metabolic problems like diabetes or chronic immunological problems such as arthritis.  More and more doctors are coming around to the idea that lifestyle changes, nutrition counseling, and daily behavioral practices are excellent treatments (and even better preventatives) for many physical ailments.  Harvard Medical Center and the Mayo Clinic, I believe, use the term Integrative Medicine  (denoting the integration of the mind and body).  Also - one of the main differences is that Integrative Medicine is expected to have solid (or in the process of developing solid) evidence of efficacy.  Perhaps that term would work better?

Hi. I am bit unsure if this has any place on the English Wikipedia, but it could be an addition under &quot;Society and culture&quot;. Since there is only 43 living individuals with Hutchinson-Gilfords syndrom, would it have any value to the reader to mention that Danish TV (V 2 (Denmark)) have made a couple of documentaries about one of these children (I think they made tree so far)? Since it is the second biggest TV station in the country and there are not that many of them, most Danes actually know if you say &quot;Jesper, the boy that age premature&quot; or something like that who you referrer to (but then again we are only 5-6 millions).

Just search siderophages at Google scholar: you will find a numberless articles. They are present in lots of situations from death by suffocation until a marker of air pollution. They are present also in lungs of adult addicts...
Siderophages are macrophages (phage=eat). Macrophages exist to take within them noxious molecules. Where we can found blood outside vessels we can found siderophages. Even within a vessel with a thrombus, siderophages are there too. They are important to reabsorb a clot. So it doesn't exist such thing &quot;heart failure cells&quot;. You don't find them in the most recent Cardiology books like Hurst's or Braunwald. It is the first time I read about this. And believe me I know what cardiology is.

At the risk of committing a little p:SYN: &quot;Phore&quot; means &quot;bear&quot;. After a &quot;phage&quot; &quot;eats&quot; (envelopes) something, in this case emosiderin, it bears (carries) it until it has either been digested or expelled.

As an example eferoxamine|desferrioxamine B is a siderophore  is not a cell. iderophore is much more a chemical compound which can bound hemosiderin in its molecule.

Agree that not all siderophores (iron-bearers) are cells, and that some are just molecules, such as DFO-B. The &quot;heart failure cell&quot; discussions, however, are clearly refering to cells. Alternatively, MID|17975779 calls them &quot;hemosiderin-laden, iron-positive macrophages&quot;. In that context then we can say that siderophages can be nearly synonymous with siderophores (as elaborated above). Stedman's definitions might have been better if they were more nuanced, but for the purpose, they are essentially correct, and they certainly are citeable.

When I searched Google Books for &quot;heart failure cells&quot; (plural) I found a number of (mostly pathology) textbooks that describe them as macrophages holding iron-containing particles (siderophages per the first medilexicon.com meaning), originating in the alvioli and associated with heart failure and pulmonary edema. The term has been in use since the late ninteenth century. So, it appears that all heart failure cells are siderophages but not all siderophages are heart failure cells. 

I'm fairly comfortable with that interpretation.

Macrophages (siderophages) exist everywhere to clean the hemosiderin when, under capillary hypertension or a break-down of blood-brain barrier, red blood cells pass through the capillary wall and by rupture of its cellular membrane hemosiderin moves out the cell to the interstitial tissue. ser:DocElisa|Doc Elisa ser talk:DocElisa|✉ 08:02, 20 March 2013 (UTC)

I agree that siderophages are found anywhere leaked hemoglobin and macrophages are found, but when they are found originating in the alvioli and caused by left heart failure and pulmonary edema, those siderophages are referred to, in the 30 pathology textbooks I looked at last night, as &quot;heart failure cells.&quot; It is an old term, coined by a German doctor in the late 19th century, and it occurs often enough in both current and old literarure - and I assume in more languages than English - that we should probably have an article explaining it.

We do need to make it clear that it only refers to those siderophages originating in the alvioli, and caused by pulmonary edema and heart failure. I think the current version of eart failure cells does that. --ser:Anthonyhcole|Anthonyhcole (ser talk:Anthonyhcole|talk · pecial:Contributions/Anthonyhcole|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Anthonyhcole|email)  09:19, 20 March 2013 (UTC)

I'm not against you obviously. I'm cardiologist 65 years old and is the 1st time I read about this. Sidephages are present in pulmonary alveoli of addict people, in presence of big pollution, in alveoli of children who got a sudden death, etc. They are not a sign of heart failure. May be when they have been found for the first time scientist thought they were exclusive for heart failure but they aren't. Look at reliable books like Harrison's Internal Medicine, Braunwald, Hurst's cardiology: you can't find heart failure cells. In eart failure, talk about siderophages and if we said that some author call them heart failure cells I agree but make a special article about them is, I'm sorry, ridiculous. ser:DocElisa|Doc Elisa ser talk:DocElisa|✉ 12:02, 20 March 2013 (UTC)

Can I ask you to search for &quot;heart failure cells&quot; (plural) in Google Books? It returns 78 results to me here in Australia, mostly recent textbooks, most of those pathology textbooks, using the term. Google Scholar returns 500 scholarly articles using the term, mostly recent, but some from over the last hundred years. It could be that the term is only used among pathologists, I suppose. 

Many of the Google Book results define the term, and most of them make it clear they're just talking about siderophages originating in the alvioli caused by heart failure and pulmonary edema. None of them claims this is the only source of siderophages. Clearly, some serious specialist authors use the term, so I think we have a responsibility to explain what is meant by it, for readers who encounter it in one of those textbooks or scholarly articles where it is not defined in the text. --ser:Anthonyhcole|Anthonyhcole (ser talk:Anthonyhcole|talk · pecial:Contributions/Anthonyhcole|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Anthonyhcole|email) 13:30, 20 March 2013 (UTC)

 Is Alt Medicine, &quot;non evidence based&quot; or &quot;non-Western accepted&quot;? 

It seems that there is disagreement on the definition of &quot;Alternative Medicine&quot;.  I agree with the definition of &quot;non evidence based&quot;.  Some prominent Wikipedia doctors think it means &quot;non-Western accepted&quot;.  I reject the second definition as culturally racist.  I understand Wikipedia to be a source of human knowledge written for all humans, not written from a Western perspective.  Some herbal remedies are not accepted by many Western doctors despite there being reliable, secondary evidence based sources to support their use. It is a major disservice to put any of these treatments under the header &quot;Alternative medicine&quot; along with &quot;non evidence based&quot; treatments.  Furthermore, there are secondary, reliable evidence based sources that say some raditional Chinese Medicine, so it is unfair to put all raditional Chinese Medicine under the header &quot;Alternative medicine&quot;.  Those that are evidence based should be put under some non-offensive header and all non-evidence based can be put under &quot;Alternative medicine&quot;.  Can we agree that only &quot;non-evidence based&quot; treatments belong under the header &quot;Alternative medicine&quot;?ser:Sthubbar|Sthubbar (ser talk:Sthubbar|talk) 11:11, 24 March 2013 (UTC)
No, &quot;alternative medicine&quot; is not defined as only &quot;non-evidence based&quot;. It is defined as what P:RS|reliable sources call it, and reliable sources have many and often conflicting definitions for what &quot;alternative medicine&quot; includes. The fairness or unfairness of the situation is determined by what sources people provide, so if there is content there which you do not think should belong, challenge the sources and not the content. Right now, I think there are a significant number of sources classifying traditional medicines of many cultures as &quot;alternative&quot;. There seems not to be any one definition of alternative medicine with broad consensus. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 11:32, 24 March 2013 (UTC)

Blue Rasberry, why use such a term without one definition or broad consensus?  There are other, better terms.  &quot;Evidence based&quot; is clear and of little debate.  Evidence based is reliable, secondary sources.  We can chose &quot;Lack of evidence based&quot; or something else for other treatments, include &quot;Alternative medicine&quot; whatever that means because nobody can agree on what it means.

Doc James and others have repeatedly stated that the terms used are based on reliable sources.  While it would be accurate to describe many alternative medicine approaches as poorly-studied or non-evidence-based (and there could be a set of articles on evidence- vs non-evidence-based medicine), the term &quot;alternative medicine&quot; is widely used.

Blue Rasberry, come on.  How am I going to find a source for the term &quot;Other Treatments&quot;?  I don't expect to find a large organization called &quot;Org of other treatments&quot;.  I am proposing a neutral term that is not offensive.  I have given this analogy many times.  When I was young I used to have crayons with the color of &quot;Flesh&quot;. Nobody thought 2 seconds about how offensive that was because for the majority of people it was true.  Same with the word &quot;Alternative&quot;, I suspect for most everyone reading this it is not offensive because for them most of these treatments are &quot;Alternative&quot;.  How many people here grow up where everyone accepted acupuncture as standard medical procedure?  I suspect very few of you.  So, just by the luck of your birth, this treatment is alternative.

Sthubbar, your argument that certain therapies are &quot;mainstream&quot; elsewhere doesn't hold. Unless we are talking primitive tribes or fundamentalist religious folk, anyone who can afford it and has access to it tends to choose so-called Western medicine. This is true in China or Africa or the Amazon. This argument reminds me of the &quot;politically correct&quot; councils that ban the term &quot;brainstorming&quot; in case it is offensive to people with epilepsy (who had never considered the word offensive).

 Again, I hope I'm not intruding, but I have to take issue with your statement, Colin.  You said &quot;anyone who can afford it and has access to it tends to choose so-called Western medicine.&quot;  While there are many many ailments for which Western medicine has superior outcomes, there are also many ailments for which Western medicine has no effective treatment.  There are many people in many countries - including progressive countries such as the United States - who rely upon non-Western medicine to effectively treat their ailments.  Recent research shows the efficacy of behaviors and practices that were previously under the domain of &quot;alternative medicine&quot;, so that they cannot be considered non-proven (at least not anymore).  As I stated earlier in this talk page, I advocate the use of the term Integrative Medicine because 1) It is not an alternative, but rather should be part of any medical doctor's arsenal of proven treatments and 2) an integration of the body and the mind, which is often the source of effective treatments for some chronic ailments.  Integrative medicine focuses on nutrition, exercise, cognitive therapies, and meditative practices that modulate the neurological and metabolic systems so that they operate in better balance.  Doesn't that seem fair to you? ser:Cjrhoads|CJ (ser talk:Cjrhoads|talk) 23:16, 24 March 2013 (UTC)

 Fair? Only if it were true, which it isn't. If it's proven, it becomes mainstream medicine, and the mainstream sources will show it, including research journals. Until then it remains part of &quot;alternative&quot; medicine, whether it is used &quot;together with&quot; mainstream practices (&quot;complementary medicine&quot;) or as part of &quot;integrative medicine.&quot; It's still the same unproven methods, even when used in that manner. You see, this is a atch-22 (logic)|catch-22. There can be a short time period, after proof has been found, where a formerly &quot;alternative&quot; practice is still called &quot;alternative&quot; and also mainstream, but it quickly ceases to be called &quot;alternative.&quot; Now that's in theory, because in practice it is now pretty rare for a method to make that transition, and it will become increasingly rare, since pretty much all alternative methods have been researched (if there is any reasonable chance of them working) and found wanting. So we're stuck with the very apt definition provided by im Minchin: &quot;By definition, alternative medicine has either not been proved to work or has been proved not to work. You know what they call alternative medicine that has been proved to work? Medicine.&quot;([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtYkyB35zkk The source is well worth seeing!]) He pretty much sums up the opinions of most experts on the subject. arcia Angell states it in a longer manner, where she has already introduced her NEJM article by quoting Eisenberg's definition, which she considers &quot;not a very satisfactory definition.&quot; Then she continues:

* &quot;It is time for the scientific community to stop giving alternative medicine a free ride. There cannot be two kinds of medicine – conventional and alternative. There is only medicine that has been adequately tested and medicine that has not, medicine that works and medicine that may or may not work. Once a treatment has been tested rigorously, it no longer matters whether it was considered alternative at the outset. If it is found to be reasonably safe and effective, it will be accepted. But assertions, speculation, and testimonials do not substitute for evidence. Alternative treatments should be subjected to scientific testing no less rigorous than that required for conventional treatments.&quot;[http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199809173391210]

I live in China and I suspect that TCM will be replaced by Western medicine in China about the same time that Christianity is replaced by rational thought in America.  It makes no difference that people go to doctors that prescribe Western treatments.  The doctor often will also supplement with some sort of TCM for good measure.  Just like someone who goes to a doctor in America and supplements it with a prayer to God.  Patients are likely to attribute some of the cure to the prayer.

We do have a standard! See P:MEDMOS#Sections. However:

Clinical articles can achieve a level of consistency by limiting their top-level headers to those specified below. However, the spectrum of medical conditions is huge, including infectious and genetic diseases, chronic and acute illness, the life-threatening and the inconvenient. Some sections will necessarily be absent or may be better merged, especially if the article is not (yet) fully comprehensive.

The guidance we give is that you should re-order the sections on occasion.  For example, if a disease concept is historical, like eurosis or a Costa's syndrome, then you really need to put the History section first.  Sometimes Characteristics makes more sense, e.g., in a disease that produces stillborn babies (who, by definition, have zero symptoms).

Yes our article on MDD reflected this &quot;sort of&quot; last time I looked.

(outdent) Part of the problem was the manufacturers included people with mild and moderate depression which often isn't true biological depression and thus little effect was seen - they biased their results against their drug by including this group of people with mild-moderate depression. So they designed their trials poorly probably in part due to the fact that the neurobiology of biological depression (which is usually severe) was not known well at all and thus they didn't know how to best design their trials. Antidepressants do work for more severe (biological) depression and neuroscience is unravelling how antidepressants work, such as via suppressing neuro inflammation as a knock on effect of modulating the serotonin system - neuro inflammation plays a major role in depression. Now that more is known about depression I am sure the drug companies will be more careful in the future and will probably restrict their trials to people with severe depression/major depressive disorder. SSRIs suck for a lot of people anyway, about half the population get sexual dysfunction while taking them - better antidepressants exist. Of course the fact that these companies manipulated data in the first place is serious stuff and raises big concerns.--ser:MrADHD|MrADHD | ser_talk:MrADHD|T@1k? 21:02, 26 March 2013 (UTC)

 Hi guys, this Rigvir article struck me as odd as working within the field I had never heard of it. Earlier this week I looked for any independent source and like you I couldn't find anything. They appear to be marketing it in several European countries so I think the medicine should be regulated by the European Medicines Agency but nothing came up on a search of their site. The Latvian health authority's site also gave nothing so I'm not even sure this is a registered medicine at all.

Hmm.

 Do we need a WP:NTHERAPEUTIC? 

This is an issue that intersects with my vague interest in off-label use and how we present that information. Over the last week or so there has been a good deal of activity around oncolytic viruses, as noted above. One of the therapeutics at issue has, as the majority of its information, a bunch of clinicaltrials.gov entries and a data release by the manufacturer about the study. Normally, i would be inclined to send this to AfD, and if the article only contained its scientific component it would not be an issue.

Non-scientific/medical press though, frequently from the business world, often latches on to these things at very early stages, which can provide enough P:RS for a keep. (Not that I see this as inherently bad.) Further complicating this are the following trends:
*Business press has a tendency to hype a new therapeutic as promising
*There are already precedents for insider trading based on study results, suggesting a very strong monetary incentive to promote new therapies before they are approved
*The strong pro-PR and pro-paid-editing contingent on WP

Are there policies I'm missing regarding this sort of thing, that would apply to the medical and scientific notability of a new therapeutic, and provide guidance for editors working on articles about new therapies? I can sort of see the contours of a policy in P:MEDRS, particularly its guidance on primary versus secondary sources, but I feel like it could be clarified or made more explicit, specifically as it pertains to new therapeutics. This is of course particularly important in cancer, where there are thousands of ongoing trials. My sense is that sometimes cancer therapeutics don't get approval until long after they are in widespread use.

If this sort of thing is seen as being useful I will start an RfC, but I wanted to discuss it here first. --  [ ser:UseTheCommandLine|UseTheCommandLine ~/ser talk:UseTheCommandLine|talk ] # _  18:55, 28 March 2013 (UTC)
If an article is sourced solely or largely to press releases from the manufacturer and clinicaltrials.gov entries, then I would feel very comfortable sending it to AfD. We're not a clinical-trials directory, so clinicaltrials.gov listings aren't really evidence of notability for a standalone article. And press releases are, at best, useful as carefully framed adjuncts to independent, reliable secondary sources. As far as amending P:MEDRS, I'm wary of being too prescriptive, but would you be comfortable pointing out the articles that triggered your concern? ser:MastCell|MastCell ser Talk:MastCell|Talk 18:56, 29 March 2013 (UTC)

alimogene laherparepvec Is what prompted it, but it seems like it could describe a general case for things that are seen as cutting-edge or unproven science, but have nevertheless gotten some RS press. At that point, I think it's fine to send it to AfD, but in case it does get kept, having clear guidelines on how to separate out the notability and sourcing of the science versus the lay press will be helpful for other editors. I'm not thinking of us here, but the newer editors who may not be totally plugged into the WP:MED folks.

FT505 and W 501516 are similarly non-notable in terms of medicine and MEDRS sourcing, from my perspective. The latter is particularly contentious. --  [ ser:UseTheCommandLine|UseTheCommandLine ~/ser talk:UseTheCommandLine|talk ] # _  18:30, 31 March 2013 (UTC)

 W 501516 is a failed drug which is incredibly important from a research perspective as the first (and perhaps the last) pure PARδ agonist that has been tested in humans. In addition, it continues to be used as a research tool to probe the function of PPARδ.  Finally it has started to be used illicitly by athletes as a erformance enhancing drug. For these reasons, I believe that the article is notable.  Furthermore I would argue that much of the article falls more within the scope of P:PHARM than P:MED (note: pharmacology is not just the sum of all drugs, but also includes the study of drugs). I would also argue that drugs in clinical trials, particularly first in class drugs, merit a place in Wikipedia even though they may lack for the moment MEDRS compliant sourcing. As these drugs are not yet available for general use, I believe that they more properly fall within the scope of P:PHARM than P:MED. ser:Boghog|Boghog (ser talk:Boghog|talk) 19:23, 31 March 2013 (UTC)

My contention is that when one makes statements about safety or efficacy in humans, that seems straightforwardly to be about medicine rather than pharmacology per se. I am trying to be mindful of the audience here too, and my impression is that there are a great deal more people coming to WP for health information than there are to look up a research chemical, if nothing else just based on the size of the potential audiences.
Since WP is intended as an encyclopedia for a general audience, I think that mention of clinical trials should be limited to, at most, the straightforward reporting that there are x, y, and z trials going on or completed, without any kind of elaboration of additional detail (and that is often where peacock words and overreaching claims creep in). My preference would be to limit mention of clinical trials only to those which have been reported in other P:RS, i.e. those in the lay press. In the latter case, it might be useful to collapse all the clinical trial information into a simple url in an external links section to search clinicaltrials.gov for the particular drug at issue. People who actually need/want to see that information are thus directed to it, but it doesn't clutter up the article with a lot of potentially misleading-to-the-lay-reader stuff. --  [ ser:UseTheCommandLine|UseTheCommandLine ~/ser talk:UseTheCommandLine|talk ] # _  19:36, 31 March 2013 (UTC)

 I have grave concerns about the W 501516 article. It appears that the authors of the article are content to source to single primary studies and news reports statements such as:
* q|&quot;GW-501516 has a synergistic effect when combined with AICAR: the combination has been shown to significantly increase exercise endurance in animal studies more than either compound alone.&quot; (in the lead)
* q|&quot;... it increases glucose uptake in skeletal muscle tissue and increases muscle gene expression, especially genes involved in preferential lipid utilization. This shift changes the body's metabolism to favor burning fat for energy instead of carbohydrates or muscle protein, potentially allowing clinical application for obese patients to lose fat effectively without experiencing muscle catabolism or the effects and satiety issues associated with low blood sugar.&quot;
 The article is making medical claims and drawing inferences. MEDRS applies and needs to be enforced. This is not a question of notability: it is a question of what is written in Wikipedia's voice based on primary sources. More comments are needed on the talk page to make the position clear for when full protection is removed. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 20:30, 31 March 2013 (UTC)

 The article is making medical claims and drawing inferences – false. GW501516 is a failed drug not approved for human use. The animal studies are relevant from a molecular biology and pharmacology standpoint because of what it teaches about PARδ function. Hence P:SCIRS applies and not P:MEDRS. ser:Boghog|Boghog (ser talk:Boghog|talk) 21:14, 31 March 2013 (UTC)

I agree that there are some issues of scope that need to be more clearly defined, both in regards to this article and the general case (not simply drugs but also e.g. therapeutic viruses, devices, or biologics). I think that it's perfectly reasonable to apply P:SCIRS to one section, and P:MEDRS to another. I could imagine things getting a little difficult in the lead though, which is why I think there is a need for guidance.

 Where did I say that secondary sources were not needed?   Furthermore the editors on that page were already in the process of upgrading the sourcing before your comments.

 When you state q|&quot;The article is making medical claims and drawing inferences – false&quot;. There are no reliable secondary sources discussing GW 501516, so there should be no medical claims (or &quot;biomedical assertions&quot; if you prefer the phrase used in P:IRS). Once you start using primary studies on animals to make claims of using up fat, weight loss, extending endurance, etc. you are on a slippery slope to seeing the claims made unqualified and there is not the evidence to support that. Why do we need to reference animal studies in that article? If you want to tell the story of &quot;a failed drug which is incredibly important from a research perspective as the first (and perhaps the last) pure PPARδ agonist that has been tested in humans&quot;, then please assemble the sources to justify that narrative. The article at present is nothing like that and consists of multiple unsustainable claims of mechanism and effect - presumably in humans - and it needs to be gutted of that content. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 20:42, 1 April 2013 (UTC)
&quot;claims of using up fat, weight loss, extending endurance, etc.&quot; in animals should not be considered &quot;medical claims&quot; unless the article is worded so nebulously that the reader is misled into thinking they apply to people. From MEDRS: q|Where in vitro and animal-model data are cited on Wikipedia, it should be clear to the reader that the data are pre-clinical, and the article text should avoid stating or implying that the reported findings necessarily hold true in humans. The level of support for a hypothesis should be evident to the reader.
To use a specific example from W 501516, q|&quot;GW-501516 also increases muscle mass, which improved glucose tolerance and reduced fat mass accumulation even in mice fed a very high fat diet, suggesting that GW-501516 may have a protective effect against obesity.&quot; is indeed an unacceptable &quot;medical claim&quot;. Conversely, q|&quot;In mice fed a very high fat diet, GW-501516 was found to increase muscle mass, which improved glucose tolerance and reduced fat mass accumulation.&quot; isn't, or shouldn't be, as the pre-clinical, basic research, animal study nature of the evidence is abundantly clear. (It may, of course, be P:OR|synthesis, which is a whole other issue and equally unacceptable.) ser:Fvasconcellos|Fvasconcellos (ser talk:Fvasconcellos|t·pecial:Contributions/Fvasconcellos|c) 22:27, 1 April 2013 (UTC)
 But what about q|&quot;The level of support for a hypothesis should be evident to the reader.&quot; The source for either formulation of those statements is apparently a single primary study from 2004. It doesn't get much weaker than that, yet q|&quot;In mice fed a very high fat diet, GW-501516 was found to increase muscle mass, which improved glucose tolerance and reduced fat mass accumulation.&quot; would also be a sensible formulation for a fact derived from a well-established recent secondary review. How is the level of support evident to the reader when we baldly state in Wikipedia's voice an assertion that has (as far as I know) only a single, eight year-old primary study as a source? We used to have a guideline called P:ASF|assert simple facts which suggested that &quot;facts&quot; in Wikipedia are those which are sourced to undisputed, reliable secondary sources. When we give the same treatment to such weak sourcing as that statement enjoys, we are doing no favours to the readers or the encyclopedia. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 23:03, 1 April 2013 (UTC)

 Researcher Dick Swaab 

Hi. I stumbled upon several article edit where ick Swaab have been written into the articles one way or the other. While there may be good reasons for including his research results it always includes the name of the author, which is not that common on Wikipedia. The edits are done by either one of two IPs or ser:Hazelares|Hazelares, who only seems to either work on the Dick Swaab article or articles related to his work, where his name is written into the article (could be a work-, home-pc and a registered user or three different people. I can not tell). It seems a bit like self-promotion (or promotion of third party), but maybe done in good faith. When writing scientific articles it is quite common to write; &quot;in a study by person1 et al&quot;, but there seems to be a consensus not to do it here...


I have no idea how to proceed with this issue if it is even an issue. Would somebody else take a look at it. I can see that ser:Flyer22 have already reverted some of the edit, see ser talk:Hazelares.

I will write on Hazelares´s talk page that I started this discussion, so it does not go on behind his/hers back. But if somebody could have a look at some of the edits, give there input or in any other way help out... please do so, since I have no experience with this kind of situation. ser:JakobSteenberg|JakobSteenberg (ser talk:JakobSteenberg|talk) 21:57, 2 April 2013 (UTC)

The article about Swaab is very poor indeed. It was declined recently at AfC for lack of reliable sources. Currently it is a glorified CV of his life and work. I've removed some of the obvious inappropriate parts.

In light photography the issue is a spark of originality, which arrises in posing, composition, figuring out exposure, lighting, etc. All those things the tech has to do to take a good portable X-ray in an ICU. The bar to originality is low-- if light photography is the standard, then putting an extra pillow behind a patient, or turning up the kVP for the fat guy, are enough. If you think getting a really good CXR is easy to do, you've never done it-- particularly with one of those old machines. It's far more difficult to take a good chest X-ray of an ICU patient than take a photo of a him with a modern digital camera that does everything for you but turn itself on. Of course, this varies from case to case. Getting a chest x-ray in a modern digital suite is pretty mechanical-- about as much as a traffic stoplight photo. But let me give an illustrative example or originality: there are few photographic images more famous than Roentgen's X-ray of his wife's hand. Keeping the wedding ring on, so you see it on her skeletal finger, makes that image. You know? It's NOT mechanical. That one was art. And some of those films even today are art. I've taken many an X-ray with an old machine, followed by emulsion development, and I know. If it's hard, it must be art. ;) ser:Sbharris|Sser:Sbharris|Bser:Sbharris|Hser:Sbharris|arris 01:03, 4 April 2013 (UTC)

 trikethrough|Nutraceuticals Dietary Supplements 

I have just encountered this word and it is exactly what I have been searching for as a replacement for the use of &quot;alternative medicine&quot;, especially when taking about evidence proven herbal treatments.  I notice on PubMed that there are 41,632 articles when searching for this term.  I don't know how we determine that a term has reached consensus, though it appears that this is a term that is used in the accepted medical literature.  Therefore, the request is: Can we use the title &quot;Nutraceuticals&quot; for herbal and vitamin treatments?ser:Sthubbar|Sthubbar (ser talk:Sthubbar|talk) 10:08, 31 March 2013 (UTC)
Does the definition of this term differ from the definition of CAM? It might not be appropriate to usurp the other term if this word means something different. Also to balance the argument it would be good to hear how many pubmed articles use the term CAM and related... ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 10:42, 31 March 2013 (UTC)

Sorry if I don't understand the problem with the term &quot;alternative medicine&quot;. We already have aturopathy a huge category with Category:Alternative medical systems with all natural treatments and special types of medicine like chinese, unani, etc. What for a new neologism?? &quot;nutraceuticals&quot; from nutrition? treatment through nutrition? Personally I don't agree with neologisms. I already saw lots of new words in Portuguese created by Brazilians with base in translated English words. This is annoying and separate people who speak the same language. I know that we speak about a technical term but anyway I think we don't need a new term. With Internet, languages spoken everywhere, like Portuguese and English, full of neologisms will become in a near future a new edition of babel tower. No one want this. We all want a strong, unified, English language. I want the same for Portuguese :) ser:DocElisa|Doc Elisa ser talk:DocElisa|✉ 12:30, 31 March 2013 (UTC)

DocElisa, you may have missed the discussion above.  The problem with &quot;alternative medicine&quot; is that it from a purely Western/American viewpoint that many of these treatments are &quot;Alternative&quot;.  If Wikipedia is to be a global source of human knowledge, than I suggest we try and avoid skewing things from one country's/area's perspective where possible.  Above, the arguement was that &quot;alternative medicine&quot; is culturally biased and ther is no alternative term available in the Western medical literature.  Naturpathy is something completely different than Nutraceuticals.  Nutraceuticals is a culture neutral term that is widely used in the western medical literature.ser:Sthubbar|Sthubbar (ser talk:Sthubbar|talk) 13:24, 31 March 2013 (UTC)
The term &quot;nutraceutical&quot; is much narrower in scope than &quot;alternative medicine&quot;, and as a neologism coined by a U.S. physician (I won't go into the [de]merits of his work), is by no means &quot;culture-neutral&quot;. There are dozens of CAM practices out there that would not be covered by this term even in its broadest meaning (here is a [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2750935/pdf/12248_2008_Article_53027.pdf/ proposed definition] for convenience) and its use as a substitute for CAM would thus be P:NOR|original research. ser:Fvasconcellos|Fvasconcellos (ser talk:Fvasconcellos|t·pecial:Contributions/Fvasconcellos|c) 14:00, 31 March 2013 (UTC)

I would say that Nutraceutical refers to a treatment modality where normal nutrients are used in a form that makes it a drug. It certainly does not extend to all other forms of complimentary medicine. The trouble with this entire nomenclature thing is that &quot;alternative&quot; medicine can become mainsteam medicine when the evidence base is sufficiently firm.
I think we should call a treatment modality &quot;complimentary&quot; or &quot;alternative&quot; if sources say so. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 14:03, 31 March 2013 (UTC)

I didn't miss it, I have read, and I understand what you say and your idea. But I think that it's not a reason to create new words. Is not only purely Western/American viewpoint, in Europe we use the same word &quot;Medicina alternativa&quot; in Portuguese and Spanish, Alternativmedizin in Germ., French call it &quot;Médecine non conventionnelle&quot; but they didn't create a new word. Word creation in language evolution concept is something with a high responsibility and needs the agreement of a linguistic academy  IMO.

Let me clarify, I am not proposing Nutraceuticals=Alternative Medicine and that it replace that term.  It would be used for herbs, vitamins, minerals and other nutrients.  Many things like acupuncture and TCM would still be listed as CAM until another term is found in the literature.  @JFW, your suggestion is hard to follow.  What do we do when one review article calls an herb &quot;alternative&quot; and other says &quot;nutraceutical&quot;?  @DocElisa, I'm trying to reread what you wrote and understand and I must be missing something.  I was always told that Western includes Europe, Portugal, Spain, Germany and France.  Of course &quot;alternative&quot; is not offensive to those because they are exactly the groups that consider these treatments as alternative.  Furthermore, this is not a new term.  It is already used in over 41,000 articles cited in PubMed.  I accepted the argument before that there was no other term that was accepted in the literature.  It appears to me that Nutraceuticals is a term that is accepted.  Do you agree that this term is used in the literature?ser:Sthubbar|Sthubbar (ser talk:Sthubbar|talk) 14:29, 31 March 2013 (UTC)

Doc Elisa, I don't see why the importance of the origin of terms is of any relevance.  Language is fluid.  I have seen no rules on Wikipedia about being able to use terms based on their origin. The primary criteria that has been previously stressed is consensus.  I checked on PubMed for &quot;Mickey Mouse Sign&quot; and found 4 articles so that term seems to be lacking consensus.  Nutraceuticals has 41,000+ references.  This indicates to me consensus.  All of the respondents seem to be missing/avoiding the key question.  The previous argument for being forced to use the term CAM or &quot;Alternative&quot; was because of lack of consensus on any other term.  I accepted that argument until I found another term that appears to me to have consensus.  Nutraceuticals appears to have consensus in the general literature and I request permission to use that term to describe nutritional items, like vitamins, herbs and minerals used as drugs.  Is that approved or not?  If not approved, why?ser:Sthubbar|Sthubbar (ser

The eutraceutical article could do with some expansion, but not original research by making a new definition. I support following what term the majority of sources are using, and it would have been good to provide numbers of pub med papers using the words &quot;alt med&quot; etc, otherwise the number of times &quot;neutraceutical&quot; is used is meaningless. I strongly suspect that the terms &quot;iet supplement&quot;, &quot;erbal medicine&quot; etc etc are all in much more common use than neutraceutical. I also think that these terms are better understood. As per WP's MOS, we should title pages based upon the P:COMMONNAME|common name, and not based upon the views of one editor who dislikes the most commonly used term.

If you check out the link provided by Doc Elisa above, herbals, vitamins and minerals are all clearly and explicitly included in the definition of &quot;Dietary Supplements&quot;.  @Lesion, your comment seems off topic.  I am not talking about renaming any pages.

The FDA might be a better definition to follow: [http://www.fda.gov/Food/DietarySupplements/QADietarySupplements/default.htm#what_is]. If we include &quot;vitamins, minerals, herbs or other botanicals, amino acids,&quot; etc. under a heading called dietary supplements I do not have a problem with that, as long as the information is notable (i.e. commonly used), and reflects the highest quality available evidence, e.g. not presenting as equally effective a herbal remedy with little or no evidence of efficacy next to another treatment which has a robust evidence base and is commonly used. ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 14:45, 1 April 2013 (UTC)

Sthubbar, it would be good to compare the definitions of dietary supplement from different parts of the world. I suggested FDA because I thought it would be a better source than the earlier source to use.
WhatamIdoing, are you saying it would be better to follow a more medical definition rather than a regulatory definition?
DocJames, I understand the proposal to be to place all those things (see FDA definition for an example list) which fall within the definition of &quot;dietary supplement&quot; in a likewise named subsection of &quot;treatment/management&quot;. This would not exempt this section from the same MEDRS&amp; MOS standards as the rest of the article, so if there is acceptable evidence of e.g. a herbal product being of some use, and it is a notable use (i.e. widely used) and a suitable reference can be found, then I would think this is fine. It may be that some articles already have a dietary supplementation section. I think Sthubbar is talking about a scenario where a treatment traditionally classed as alternative medicine, and falls within the definition of dietary supplement, has been shown to be of some benefit and therefore should be presented in the treatment section of articles. There is also the argument that use of traditional medicine in non-western cultures is not considered so alternative, which I can't comment on because I have only worked in one part of the world. ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 20:09, 2 April 2013 (UTC)

I think it would be preferable to follow a plain English definition.  As I read the regulations (with a strobe light  miley|wink), Vitamin C is a &quot;dietary supplement&quot; when you buy it over the counter for the purpose of general health and a &quot;drug&quot; when it's given to you by prescription for the purpose of treating scurvy. 
If your goal is to include information about Vitamin C (or things like it) in a disease-oriented article (e.g., ommon cold), my suggestion for a section title is Self-care, rather than trying to separate herbs from vitamins from neti pots.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 20:44, 2 April 2013 (UTC)
But a dietary supplement can be prescribed to a sick patient, and maybe you should not equate &quot;dietary supplement&quot; with something purchased form a health food shop by the &quot;worried well&quot;. Example, calorie supplementation in cachexia. Surely this is more dietary supplementation rather than drug? Basically you are proposing that dietary supplements are voluntary purchases made by a consumer and vitamin prescribed to a sick patient is a drug...I'm not sure I agree with that unless a source can be found...I think some examples can be both a dietary supplement and a drug at the same time according to these definitions by the FDA. ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 21:06, 2 April 2013 (UTC)
As I understand it, extra food is not a &quot;dietary supplement&quot; under US law, even though it is intended to supplement the person's diet.  A special food containing a &quot;dietary ingredient&quot; is a dietary supplement, but the bar seems to be pretty high.  nsure drinks are commonly used for &quot;dietary supplementation&quot; in the sense you're using, but they're regulated as food, not dietary supplements.  That's why I want to avoid using this term and instead use terms that do not have this kind of regulatory baggage.  And, yes, Vitamin D bought over the counter is a &quot;dietary supplement&quot;, and Vitamin D bought with a prescription from Banner Pharmacaps [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/drugsatfda/index.cfm?fuseaction=Search.Overview&amp;DrugName=VITAMIN%20D is a regulated drug].  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 23:04, 2 April 2013 (UTC)
WhatamIdoing, I think there is no way to avoid conflicting definitions as there is not &quot;Earth&quot; standards.  It appears to me that &quot;Dietary Supplements&quot; is reasonably well defined and for those corner cases, they can be handled like anything else here, on the talk page and by consensus.  As to your suggestion of &quot;Self Care&quot;, I don't see how that is an options because under this would have to be every non-prescription medication, and I'm not sure there is any official definition anywhere of that term.  @Doc James, I don't understand your question.  The way I read Lesion responses is that he is accepting of the idea of using &quot;Dietary Supplements&quot; for such treatments that have quality references.  That's what I count as a vote of support.  I understand you may still resist the idea.  Please help to clarify your specific objection.

Doc James and WhatamIdoing, you both seem to ask the same question &quot;Where do we put dietary supplement treatments that don't work.&quot;  This would be answered the exact same way as &quot;Where do we put Western/pharmaceutical treatments that don't work.&quot;  There is no need to come up with a new rule.  I'm confident that Western, FDA approved, evidence based medicine is littered with treatments that either in the past were recommended or even people continue to use without evidence.  How are these Western treatments currently treated.  I would assume maybe 1) Completely left out of the article 2) Put in some section like &quot;History&quot;  3) Indicated clearly that there is conflicting evidence 3) Indicated that this is a popular treatment despite any lack of evidence.  Nothing special, same rules for &quot;Dietary Supplements&quot;.

@Doc James, I don't understand your use of the term &quot;rubric&quot;.  My initial reaction is negative, so I checked the dictionary and it seems benign so I will assume good faith.  A key point for me is that for many people &quot;Alt Medicine&quot; means non-Western, non-evidence based, faith based, old fashioned--In the same category as &quot;The Farmer's Almanac&quot;, Horoscopes, and paranormal phenomena.  Meaning well known things that the general scientific community seems to laugh at.  For many &quot;Dietary Supplements&quot; this is completely wrong and unfair.  The support for some herbs is extremely compelling and it is a disservice to the reader to put it in the same category as some holding hands therapy.

@WhatAmIDoing, you can specifically look at the heumatoid Arthritis article.  I am a new wiki editor and at first any reference I put to herbal treatmnts was quickly deleted by Doc James, even when I provided double blind study references.  Doc James, politely and gently educated me about secondary sources, so I kept working and found reliable secondary sources.  I thank Doc James for teaching me about how to contribute to Wiki, and you can see the article that there are several &quot;Dietary Supplement&quot; treatments that Doc James has agreed have compelling reliable secondary sources to support their treatment and has agreed to include them in the article, just under the &quot;Alternative Medicine&quot; heading.  For the reasons I just said, it is a disservice to put these proven treatments under the heading &quot;Alternative Medicine&quot;.ser:Sthubbar|Sthubbar (ser talk:Sthubbar|talk) 01:16, 4 April 2013 (UTC)

Doc James, thanks again for your response.  The question is not if the term &quot;Alt Med&quot; does or does not offend Doc James.  The question is what objection is there to using the term &quot;Dietary Supplements&quot;.  It seems that both Lesion and WhatamIdoing both see the downside of putting all herbal, vitamin and mineral supplements under &quot;Alt Med.&quot;
@Lesion/WhatamIdoing, I don't suggest we try introducing another title for the following reasons 1) All of the treatments that I am currently considers, except for TENS can be under the &quot;Dietary Supplements&quot; header and we can leave TENS under &quot;Alt Med&quot;.  2) There is already the argument of trying to pick a term that has been defined somewhere, so even if we chose the FDA definition, that is acceptable to me.  3)  Self-Care would include all OTC meds, and bandages or anything that could be bought without prescription so not really appropriate for the purpose of &quot;Diet.

I don't see the downside to putting alternative medicine, like most herbal preparations, under the section heading of Alternative medicine.
But I'm going to ask for the second time:  Why are you so determined to put conventional medicine (i.e., TENS) under Alternative medicine?  
Also, why shouldn't all forms of self-care, including exercise, TENS, and dietary supplements, be put together?

 Removing of evidence 

We have a user who has removed a 2009 Cochrane review among others as it found it didn't work.

That is a complete misrepresentation.  Let's start with fact that you removed all of my edit based on a mistake because I MOVED a Cochrane review.  The other Cochrane review was added by you, unknown to me, after you made the massive revert.  I only removed that second Cochrane as an error of omission, in that I was just trying to recover all of my work after your mistake.  I welcome you to go back and add back the second Cochrane review.  I support removing treatments that are proven not to work.ser:Sthubbar|Sthubbar (ser talk:Sthubbar|talk) 00:38, 8 April 2013 (UTC)

 Revert war at Osteoarthritis 

Can we get a third input on the steoarthritis page.  1) Doc James has made 5 reverts in 24hrs which I thought according to hree_revert_rule#The_three-revert_rule would cause auto 24 hr ban.  2)  I have now made my 3rd revert and since DJ seems immune to the above rule, I assume he will make his 6th revert and I doubt I'm immune.

This started by DJ making a mistake and assuming I had removed a Cochrane reference pmid:20847017, he even mentions that in his revert.  This reference was never removed, it was simply moved to a different place.  After I was able to show him, the mistake, he now wants to change his story and say I need to get approval on the talk page before making edits.  This is preposterous.

He keeps going back to a previous version that explicitly removes most of these treatments:  avocado/soybean unsaponifiables[51], boswellic acid[52], cat's claw[53], curcumin[54], chondroitin[55][56], Devil's claw[57], glucosamine sulfate[58] , S-Adenosyl methionine[59][60] and TENS.[61].  Each supported by secondary sources.

He now wants to say that some of the secondary sources are weak, OK, that's a different argument and I welcome him to individually remove any such treatment and we can judge if it is fair or not.

He also wants to add back in the previous discussion about unproven treatments.  I don't see it to be the standard in medicine articles that we put an extensive discussion about all of the &quot;Western&quot; treatments that don't work.  If treatments aren't supported by evidence or shown to be equal to placebo, then just leave them out of the article.

I welcome editing and improving of the OA article, I reject this complete deleting of the material I have added by improper and mistaken use of the revert function.  Thanks for helpingser:Sthubbar|Sthubbar (ser talk:Sthubbar|talk) 00:03, 8 April 2013 (UTC)

Doc James, you seem to change the story each time.  If you would just edit instead of revert we wouldn't have any issue.  I am not trying to push TENS.  the TENS reference I put was already accepted by you for the heumatoid Arthritis article so I'm shocked that you are just now bringing it up like I'm trying to sneak in some crappy article.  #2  The article that I deleted, I think was for NEST and I did not realize that NEST and TENS are the same thing.  If it is the case that NEST and TENS are the same and there is a newer study that says they don't work, then I support completely removing them from the treatments section.  Just stop reverting and removing every change that I made.ser:Sthubbar|Sthubbar (ser talk:Sthubbar|talk) 00:38, 8 April 2013 (UTC)
If you read the systematic reviews you were removing than it would be clear.

How is it misleading.  Here is what I have done:
1) Remove negative treatments.  This is a violation of NPOV.  If we are going to put negative Alt med treatments then we should include every negative Western treatment.  As this isn't the case then I can't understand any problem with removing the negative information.  So no problem here.
2)  I removed the NEST treatment because of rule #1.  I did not realize that NEST=TENS when I just added the TENS reference that you already accepted in the RA article.  If you say you want to remove TENS, then I'm fine with that.
3)  There is clear evidence that there is a distinct difference between Glucosamine HCL and sulfate.  Any statement saying Glucosamine is ineffective, is misleading and unbalanced.  It is more accurate to say Glucosamine HCL has a lack of support and Glucosamin sulfate shows promise or even good support.  This was my intention of updating the glucosamine section.  I admit it can be worded better.
4)  The Cochrane study that you added after the major revert of all my changes was only removed by accident and I am perfectly fine with you putting it back in.
5)  I added treatments that are supported by review articles.  If you want to question them individually, that's also fine.

None of these issues warrant a complete revert of all the changes.
1) Yes we discuss negative treatments as long as they are well supported by evidence. 2) Yes NEST = TENS so we have solved that one 3) No there is not clear evidence that the two glucosamine forms are different only tentative evidence. 4) Great 5) The treatments you have added supported by reviews are mostly still there. They are all tentative at best. By the way all your changes have not been reverted. ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 03:26, 8 April 2013 (UTC)

 Threats from Doc James 

It looks like things are going downhill with the relationship between me and Doc James.

Doc James puts a false statement on my talk page saying I have made 4 reverts.  Sorry Doc James, check your math.  2 reverts + 1 undo = 3 reverts.  It is Doc James that has made 5 reverts in 24 hours with no ban as I would expect by the rule.

Doc James now puts a threatening comment on my page saying I have been warned and better stop editing the OA page.  Let's see what am I editing.

&quot;Many alternative medicines are purported to decrease pain associated with arthritis.&quot;  Absolutely no reference for this statement and of no use.  Why don't we put in the statment &quot;Many Western medicines are purported to decrease pain associated with arthritis.&quot;?  A useless statement.  Just put in the treatments that work.

Next as has been said many times, there is no place in putting in treatments that don't work.  If he insists on saying that Vitamin C doesn't work, then I will create a list of every &quot;Western&quot; medicine that doesn't work for OA.  I guess I can start by listing Claritin as not working for OA.

I don't have to get approval from Doc James on the talk page for these updates.  I am contributing to the article with quality information.  — Preceding ikipedia:Signatures|unsigned comment added by ser:Sthubbar|Sthubbar (ser talk:Sthubbar|talk • pecial:Contributions/Sthubbar|contribs) 03:36, 8 April 2013 (UTC)

 Negative treatments 

Is it the general policy of WP:Medicine to list every and all treatments that have every been considered for all diseased and not only list the treatments that work, but also list every treatment that has been show not to work?

My understanding is that medicine articles list the treatments that work.  No need to include all of the treatments that have either been shown not to work, or have poor evidence.

Doc James is getting his pants all messed up because I'm removing a sacred Cochrane review.  I'm not removing the review, I'm removing the fact that this review is only being used to show what treatments don't work.

If we accepting putting in what treatments that don't work, then we need to go through all medicine articles and put every prescription and OTC medicine that has ever been tried for all diseases and listing them.  This would be balanced.

If we don't want to list every non-effective prescription and OTC medicine then we shouldn't be listing non-effective alt medicines.

(e/c) This is a misguided perspective.  We include what the best-quality recent secondary sources, like Cochrane reviews, report.  This sometimes includes findings for interventions that have been studied and found not to have an effect.  They are important to include because the best-quality secondary sources report on them.

 c @Sthubbar: Your understanding is flawed. We list treatments that are discussed prominently in reliable secondary sources: if the source says the treatment works, we say so; if the source says the treatment doesn't work, we say so. Go back to the principal sources for the article, read them and do your best to summarise what they say about the effectiveness of treatments.

 Cannot recommend &lt;&gt; Not recommended 

OK, it is the general negative and unfair characterization of the study.  In particular, the Cochrane study says &quot;We cannot recommend the use of...&quot; which to me is a completely different statement than the OA statement of &quot;These treatments are thus not recommended.&quot;

&quot;Cannot recommend&quot; is a neutral position saying that there is neither positive or negative evidence for the help or harm of the treatments.

&quot;Not reommmended&quot; is a negative statement implying harm to the treatments.

 We really should be having this discussion at the article talk page, not here, but I'm not really seeing a significant semantic difference.  What is your proposed wording? ser:Zad68|Zadser_Talk:Zad68|68 04:59, 8 April 2013 (UTC)

Zad there is a huge difference.  &quot;Cannot recommend&quot; = 0 (zero) &quot;Not recommended&quot; = some negative number.  So the case is
(Cannot recommend Cochrane) 0 + (some other reliable review) + 0.1 = 0.1 (possible effect)
(Not recommended Cochrane) -1 + (some other reliable review) + 0.1 = -0.9 (not recommended)
My suggestion is the same as always, leave the info out as it provides no value.  A zero is a zero.  If it must be in as Doc James seems to insist them the wording would be &quot;A 2012 review article found evidence to support the use of X. A 2010 review was unable to find enough evidence to recommend X.&quot;
I don't even know why we would include the 2010 when it just is saying nothing that they didn't find enough evidence when a more recent article does find evidence, but anyway.  This way of saying that Review A finds evidence and review B didn't find enough evidence, is fair.  This is much different than saying Review A finds evidence and review B does not recommend.ser:Sthubbar|Sthubbar (ser talk:Sthubbar|talk) 06:31, 8 April 2013 (UTC)
If you're talking about MID|20232616 &quot;We cannot recommend...&quot;, the source further states that support has not been found not just for effectiveness but also safety.  The wording for things like this needs to be taken on a case-by-case basis and the source's evidence and conclusions reviewed carefully.  If you still have concerns about the current wording in the steoarthritis article please open a discussion about it at the article Talk page, it's not possible to make a blanket P:MEDICINE-wide recommendation for all sources and article here.  ser:Zad68|Zadser_Talk:Zad68|68 14:13, 8 April 2013 (UTC)

Zad, the abstract says they &quot;cannot recommend&quot; because the evidence is &quot;unclear&quot; and more research is necessary.  That is exactly my point.

 Alternative medicine implies quackery

ser:BullRangifer|BullRangifer's page ser:BullRangifer/Alternative_medicine_critics|Alternative medicine critics says exactly the point I have been trying to get across.

&quot;Some critics...have defined alternative medicine as those unproven or disproven medical practices and ideas that lack a scientific evidence base.&quot;

&quot;[Alternative Medicine] is often described as quackery, pseudoscience, fraud, and/or unfalsifiable beliefs of a religious or metaphysical nature.&quot;

&quot;Alternative medicine has been described as pseudoscientific.&quot;

And the page goes on and on.  These are exactly why, when there are dietary supplement treatments that have strong evidence from random controlled trial, secondary review research and articles, that it is a disservice to these treatments to list then in a category associated with quackery.

Can we please put proven dietary supplement treatments under a separate heading &quot;Dietary Supplements&quot;?ser:Sthubbar|Sthubbar (ser talk:Sthubbar|talk) 10:42, 9 April 2013 (UTC)

Dietary supplements which have evidence are mainstream, not alternative. Folic acid during pregnancy is the only thing that comes to mind. As far as I am aware the rest lack evidence. Consumption of supplements which don't have evidence (i.e Antioxidants, Vitamin C and the like) are regarded as alternative precisely because there is no evidence based medical reason to take it. Calling it alternative, rather than referring to it as rampant pseudoscientific quackery is just us wikipedians trying to be polite (per P:IMPARTIAL). ser:IRWolfie-|IRWolfie- (ser talk:IRWolfie-|talk) 10:48, 9 April 2013 (UTC)

IRWolfie, this is exactly the point.  Your statement &quot;As far as I am aware the rest lack evidence.&quot; is quite common and unfortunately misinformed.  Omega-3 would be one of the most widely accepted, proven by multiple large double-blind placebo controlled randomized studies, supported by secondary review articles.

The systematic reviews disagree with you, ser:IRWolfie-|IRWolfie- (ser talk:IRWolfie-|talk) 12:40, 9 April 2013 (UTC)

I agree about the implications you've noted above. However, dietary supplements need only be &quot;safe&quot;. Unlike treatments claiming medical benefit (in the U.S.), they do not need to be &quot;effective&quot;. Indeed, you'll often see the weasel words &quot;used for...&quot; on the labels as an end run around claiming actual medical benefits. So - for &quot;alternative&quot; treatments that have been demonstrated both &quot;safe&quot; and &quot;effective&quot; - the category of &quot;Dietary supplement&quot; would not be appropriate, either. We'd also need to consider &quot;certification&quot;. That is, who (among us) is to say that a particular study is sufficiently reliable to demonstrate that some treatment is indeed not quackery? The U.S. relies on the FDA in theory. However, once a treatment passes FDA &quot;safe and effective&quot; muster, doctors are permitted to prescribe it for &quot;off label&quot; treatments. That is, they can use it to treat conditions that the drug have not been certified by the FDA as &quot;effective&quot;. This makes &quot;off label&quot; use little more than quackery, too. And, of course, there's nothing to say that Wikipedia must adopt the FDA's standards. Next... while peer-reviewed studies sound good in name, often these studies do little more than report results obtained in a petri dish rather than in clinical trials. And even clinical trials can be problematic if they lack the appropriate rigour. So, what to do? ser:Rklawton|Rklawton (ser talk:Rklawton|talk) 10:59, 9 April 2013 (UTC)

Rklawton, I'm not sure what to call your discussion, I think maybe traw man.  What you are describing is something completely different than I am proposing, and you are pointing out problems that are not unique to dietary supplements.

Only accepted treatments are allowed.  Accepted means the same thing it means for any other treatment.  No new rules or concerns.  I have yet to hear someone say that what the FDA says it the law on Wikipedia.  I thought it was what reliable secondary sources say.  The same rule for dietary supplements.  Based on reliable secondary sources the treatments are permitted or denied.

I am in no way implying that dietary supplements would be an open door policy to put any herb, vitamin, or mineral treatment there based on the flimsiest evidence, suggestion or petri dish.  No, no, no, only allow promising, reliable, or even strong, secondary sources, just like for every other treatment.  No special rules need.ser:Sthubbar|Sthubbar (ser talk:Sthubbar|talk) 11:05, 9 April 2013 (UTC)

Hmm, my ability to confuse you amazes me.  I am not saying put all proven alternative treaments under &quot;dietary supplements&quot;.  I am saying that first only treatments that fit the above FDA defined or something close definition would go under this category.  Second, we are only going to put proven treatments that fit the definition.  Dietary Supplements is not meant to imply &quot;Proven Alt Med&quot; treatments.  It just just meant to classify herbs, vitamins and minerals that are proven away from quackery.ser:Sthubbar|Sthubbar (ser talk:Sthubbar|talk) 11:32, 9 April 2013 (UTC)

I think the point that dietary supplements is a regulatory definition which implies safety rather than efficacy might be an important point. If we restrict the definition of dietary of supplements in our articles to things which are both safe and effective, could this be P:NOR|original research? ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 11:59, 9 April 2013 (UTC)

&quot;Safe and effective&quot; isn't original research if it's backed up by peer reviewed sources. I think that &quot;FDA qualified&quot; herbal treatments should not go under &quot;dietary supplements&quot; because (at least in the U.S.) &quot;dietary supplement&quot; means only &quot;safe&quot; and not &quot;safe and effective&quot;. I do think we should have some sort of category that indicates a particular treatment (herb, vitamin) is both &quot;safe and effective&quot; - aka &quot;medicine&quot;. ser:Rklawton|Rklawton (ser talk:Rklawton|talk) 12:08, 9 April 2013 (UTC)

Hmm, what am I missing here.  If the product is being sold for human consumption then by definition the consumption of that item is safe.  If it is unsafe it is removed from the market.  The secondary sources define effective.  So these will be both safe and effective.  No need for any other special categories.  Again, dietary supplements does not allow listing anything there, only things that are show to be effective by secondary sources, and if they are legally commercially sold, then they are by definition safe, at least as safe as eating at any fast food joint.ser:Sthubbar|Sthubbar (ser talk:Sthubbar|talk) 12:33, 9 April 2013 (UTC)

Let's try it this way:
* 0 = unsafe (so it gets pulled from the market)
* 1 = safe, but there's no scientific evidence that it's a medical treatment. 
* 2 = safe &amp; effective, may be FDA approved, but as a minimum, reliable sources stay it's an effective treatment
All dietary supplements fall into at least #1. However, &quot;alternative&quot; treatments with research indicating effectiveness raises it up to the level of #2 &quot;safe &amp; effective&quot;. So my point is, if it fits #2, let's not give it a label that is usually interpreted to read #1. Thus, if the AMA publishes research that says &quot;snotgrass juice&quot; is a safe and effective treatment for &quot;jazzberry rot&quot;, we shouldn't call it a &quot;dietary supplement&quot; because it's not on par with dietary supplements - it's better than that. ser:Rklawton|Rklawton (ser talk:Rklawton|talk) 13:18, 9 April 2013 (UTC)

Agree, you would have to use a section called &quot;dietary supplements with some evidence of efficacy&quot; or something otherwise the fundamental definition of dietary supplement is being altered, which might be OR... ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 13:24, 9 April 2013 (UTC)

Rklwton, OK, I get your point.  Why the confusion?  If there is an article about a disease and there is a subheading called &quot;Medicine&quot; we don't have to specify &quot;Medicine that works for this illness&quot;, it is implied.  We also don't have to clarify that the info under Medicine is not a complete list of items that fit the label medicine.  If there are 100,000 items that can be called &quot;medicine&quot; it is understood that the 10 items listed are a special subset of the category &quot;Medicine&quot;.  In our case, it is no different.  The category &quot;Dietary Supplements&quot; includes maybe 200,000 items.  If we put a section called &quot;Dietary Supplements&quot; under an illness and list 10 items, I see no need to say &quot;Dietary Supplements that are proven effective&quot; as it is already clear that per WP:Medicine rules supposedly all treatments should be proven effective.  The reader already realizes that there is something special about the 10 items listed under &quot;Dietary Supplements&quot; and they are a special subset chosen because that have a proven relation to the illness in question.

The FDA does not ensure that dietary supplements are &quot;safe&quot; - it ensures that they meet food guidelines. In response to increasing talk on Wikipedia about this, I created ietary Supplement Health And Education Act of 1994 which describes the primary US regulation. Most people in the US will have health problems and die from eating unhealthy food which is not &quot;unsafe&quot;, and in the same way that the FDA allows people to choose the food they eat regardless of health concerns, the FDA leaves people to make their own choices about supplements. No regulator in the US labels supplements as &quot;safe&quot;; they can be unsafe or have warnings, but beyond that are treated like food in the US. If anyone knows of any analogous laws in other countries then I would love to see them connected somehow to this United States statute, and also I would appreciate any comments on how to expand the article for this US law on that article's talk page. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 13:55, 9 April 2013 (UTC)

My two cents on this is, don't have a section in the article called Alternative medicine.  This is not even a section suggested by P:MEDMOS.  The section you're talking about should be called Treatment and/or Management.  Here's what P:MEDMOS says about this section:Treatment or Management: This might include any type of currently used treatment, such as iet (nutrition)|diet, xercise, edication, alliative care, hysical therapy, sychotherapy, elf care, urgery, atchful waiting, and many other possibilities.  Consider discussing treatments in a plausible order in which they might be tried, or discussing the most common treatments first.  Avoid experimental/speculative treatments and preventive measures (e.g., prophylactic vaccines or infection-avoidance techniques).If there are dietary supplements that are commonly used to treat (or used in an attempt to treat), and you've got good secondary sources covering the evidence for the use of them, put them in this section.  I wouldn't go out of my way to try to label them as 'supplements' or 'alternative' or whatever, just state what they are and what the evidence is for them. ser:Zad68|Zadser_Talk:Zad68|68 14:00, 9 April 2013 (UTC)

Zad, fine I'm OK with that.  Unfortunately a powerful WP:Medicine admin, Doc James, insists on putting all proven dietary supplements under the quackery title of alternative medicine.  Is there some way to officially start a vote or something so that I can officially move all proven herbal supplements out of this quackery header without risking another ban?ser:Sthubbar|Sthubbar (ser talk:Sthubbar|talk) 14:30, 9 April 2013 (UTC)

Are you talking about steoarthritis?  I took a quick look at the edit history there and I don't see support for what you're saying.  I'd have to let Doc speak for himself, let's wait for his response.  ser:Zad68|Zadser_Talk:Zad68|68 14:40, 9 April 2013 (UTC)

I like the idea of a &quot;treatments&quot; section, though we're going to spend a lot of time keeping out the cranks. I disagree with including a &quot;Dietary supplements&quot; section because the term has a &quot;quack&quot; perception, and I don't think the general reader is going to be familiar with WP:Medicine enough to know that we'd only include treatment demonstrated to be effective. ser:Rklawton|Rklawton (ser talk:Rklawton|talk) 14:31, 9 April 2013 (UTC)
on a side note, we don't really discuss only treatments which have been shown to be effective in our articles. Regardless of whether that treatment is generally seen as alt med or mainstream, we discuss all the treatments which are commonly used for that topic, and then discuss their individual evidence base. ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 14:49, 9 April 2013 (UTC)

Zad, it all started with the heumatoid arthritis article.  I had tried putting them under a title of &quot;Other therapies&quot; and DJ reverted.  https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rheumatoid_arthritis&amp;diff=546438158&amp;oldid=546437475.  He has also stated above that the term &quot;Alt med&quot; does not offend him, and I assume he doesn't think it is equated with quackery, or that dietary supplements should be in the category with quackery.  We have been having this discussion for pages and pages here and I'm confident DJ will serve me another ban if I don't get clear agreement here that the treatments I'm proposing can be put somewhere besides under a title that implies quackery.ser:Sthubbar|Sthubbar (ser talk:Sthubbar|talk) 14:52, 9 April 2013 (UTC)

In [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rheumatoid_arthritis&amp;diff=546438158&amp;oldid=546437475 this edit] Doc renamed Other therapies to Alternative medicine and moved content under it that said &quot;The existing evidence suggests that some of the complementary and alternative medicine modalities ... show promising efficacy in reducing pain&quot;, and that's how the article still stands right now after a lot more editing by him, so he actually created the section and filled it in with content saying positive things about it.  I do not think he believes Alternative medicine means something negative.  And in [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rheumatoid_arthritis&amp;diff=546637827&amp;oldid=546637409 this edit] he pointed to alk:Alternative medicine/Archive_24#Requested_move|this recent discussion where it was decided that &quot;Alternative medicine&quot; was the preferred title.  This is one of those things where you may not agree with it but the consensus on Wikipedia is to use Alternative medicine, and you're probably just going to cause yourself a lot of aggravation with no good result if you keep fighting it.  For what it's worth, I do not think it's necessarily a negative term either, although it almost always is associated with something that has not been as well-tested.  ser:Zad68|Zadser_Talk:Zad68|68 15:24, 9 April 2013 (UTC)

Zad, the way I read that discussion is that the proposal was to change the name of &quot;Alternative Medicine&quot; to &quot;Complimentary and Alternative Medicine&quot;.  That is something completely different that what I am requesting.  I accept to leave &quot;Alternative Medicine&quot;.  That's fine, leave it there.  I'm proposing to allow the addition of a section &quot;Dietary Supplements&quot;.  It would even be fine with me if this was a sub-section of &quot;Alt Med&quot;, not idea, and a compromise I could accept.ser:Sthubbar|Sthubbar (ser talk:Sthubbar|talk) 15:42, 9 April 2013 (UTC)

Sthubbar: I do not read the label &quot;alternative medicine&quot; as necessarily implying &quot;quackery&quot;. Do you object to the lead at lternative medicine and its expansion in the first section &quot;Terms and definitions&quot;? That may not be perfect, but it is acceptable to a non-partisan layman. Does it surprise anyone that physicians can purport to practice conventional medicine in a way which amounts to what a layman would call &quot;quackery&quot;, or that &quot;quack&quot; can be a jocular expression  applied to a physician, sometimes habitually but inoffensively? Certainly, there may be benighted persons who cannot think, speak or write about any &quot;alternative medicine&quot; without calling &quot;quackery&quot;, but surely not DocJames? Concept and language: currently conventional = conventional; currently alternative (to conventional) = alternative; &quot;quackery&quot; = campaigning name-call, possibly reflecting more unfavourably on person using it habitually, loosely or malevolently. Sometimes, sources on Med or other topics do not support what a fully informed and competent person happens to know about it: if that can be stressful each must find the remedy which suits him/her (such as adapting or abstaining). ser:Qexigator|Qexigator (ser talk:Qexigator|talk) 15:53, 9 April 2013 (UTC)

Sthubbar, well if that's really the entire scope of this discussion, then it would just come back to the sources.  If the general consensus of the best-quality sources is to classify Dietary Supplement X as &quot;alternative medicine&quot; it should not be a problem for the Wikipedia article to do so.  Maybe if I were writing the article I would just talk about Supplement X without trying to put it in a section or under a heading called Alternative medicine but then if another editor came along and did that, pointing to the fact that the secondary sources do so, I would accept that change to the article.  ser:Zad68|Zadser_Talk:Zad68|68 16:05, 9 April 2013 (UTC)

Given the huge number of products promoted as &quot;dietary supplements&quot;, &quot;nutriceuticals&quot;, &quot;health foods&quot;, etc. it is almost certain that some of them will eventually prove to have beneficial effects on health. Many more will prove to be innocuous but ineffective, and some will prove to be downright harmful. The problem we pseudonymous editors face is that we cannot be the ones to separate the wheat from the chaff. We must leave that up to competent bodies to do. Unless we have established MEDRS sources telling us that product X is safe and effective, then we should not be lending the voice of the encyclopedia to endorse X's use based on lesser-quality sources. Applying the term &quot;alternative medicine&quot; will mislead a significant number of readers into thinking that X is an alternative kind of medicine, rather than an alternative to medicine or perhaps a &quot;candidate&quot; or &quot;investigational&quot; medicine. We've danced around this ambiguity in the terms for far too long. We need to have a simple guidance section about this in p:MOSMED to which we can point editors. ser:LeadSongDog|LeadSongDog ser talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl! 16:17, 9 April 2013 (UTC)

Is that to say that X (may be a dietary supplement but not a medicine) should not be classed as &quot;alternative medicine&quot;, unless so-called by a responsible public body such as FDA? Is that not already accepted for these topics? ser:Qexigator|Qexigator (ser talk:Qexigator|talk) 16:29, 9 April 2013 (UTC)

Gezads! Zad, excellent suggestion.  In the steoarthritis article the reference ite journal|last=Rosenbaum|first=CC|coauthors=O'Mathúna, DP; Chavez, M; Shields, K|title=Antioxidants and antiinflammatory dietary supplements for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.|journal=Alternative therapies in health and medicine|date=2010 Mar-Apr|volume=16|issue=2|pages=32-40|pmid=20232616 specifically says &quot;dietary supplements&quot; [funny how great minds think alike].  I only have access to the abstract and in there I see no mention of the words alternative or complimentary.  Are you will to help me with an experiment and create a section outside of &quot;Alternative Medicine&quot; and crease &quot;Dietary Supplements&quot;, putting all of the sentences related to this reference?ser:Sthubbar|Sthubbar (ser talk:Sthubbar|talk) 16:31, 9 April 2013 (UTC)

Yes, it always comes back to what the sources say.  Or it should, anyway.  As it happens the full article is available [http://www.encognitive.com/files/ANTIOXIDANTS%20AND%20ANTIINFLAMMATORY%20DIETARY%20SUPPLEMENTS%20FOR%20OSTEOARTHRITIS%20AND%20RHEUMATOID%20ARTHRITIS.pdf here].  The article calls them &quot;dietary supplements&quot; so there's clear support for calling them that in the article.  The article was published in the journal Alternative Therapies.  This journal is listed in PubMed in the category Complementary Therapies, and see the MeSH description for that category [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/?term=Complementary+Therapies here].  So, there is also support for calling them &quot;alternative medicine&quot;.  Looking at the sources, there is support for placing them in a paragraph about dietary supplements in a subsection under Therapies called Alternative medicine.  Again, &quot;alternative medicine&quot; isn't a dirty word, I don't think.  ser:Zad68|Zadser_Talk:Zad68|68 16:53, 9 April 2013 (UTC)

 What we have here is two things defined by lack of evidence: alternative medicine is classified that way until it is proven, and then it becomes &quot;medicine.&quot; Dietary &quot;supplements&quot; are classified that way until they are proven effective, and then they too become medicine, and can legally make efficacy claims, and will often become prescription medications because effective medications also have side effects, hence the need for control and restrictions.

 Dietary supplements are classified as they are for several reasons. If they don't have proof of efficacy, they are not allowed to be sold as medications or make efficacy claims. Some other countries (Denmark for one) have similar laws. In fact, almost anything that does not yet have proof of efficacy, or has failed testing for efficacy, automatically must be classified as a supplement if the producer still wishes to market it, and they do. In such cases they are knowingly selling something proven to NOT work, but the ietary Supplement Health And Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA) protects them and was made for them. In fact, DSHEA is a protection racket for the lliance for Natural Health. This also means that some products which have not only failed to prove efficacy, but may actually be dangerous, but we don't to what extent until deaths are recorded in larger numbers (such as with phedra), are in the same &quot;supplement&quot; category. Manufacturers are required to report adverse reactions, but experience has shown that they often don't do it. Alternative medicine has no system, unlike mainstream medicine, for reporting and keeping track of adverse events. Neither evidence or danger seems to bother them. They just market and make claims.

 So....anything in the &quot;supplement&quot; category of products is carrying an invisible &quot;red flag.&quot; Discerning people know that the product is definitely not effective, and may even be dangerous, so they won't buy anything classified as a &quot;supplement.&quot; The DSHEA act ensured that this is how it works, and it protected products known to be ineffective. A sad situation, which is why there are many who would like to see DSHEA repealed.

@LeadSongDog, yes that's another reason why it's not my preference to use the label &quot;alternative medicine&quot; in articles.  The meaning of the term isn't really well-defined, the application of the term is rather subjective, what it's applied to can change over time, and there are those like Sthubbar who feel it has a negative connotation.  ser:Zad68|Zadser_Talk:Zad68|68 17:03, 9 April 2013 (UTC)

On the general point, there seems to be some confusion about &quot;mainstream&quot; and &quot;evidence-based&quot;.  Mainstream medicine is not always evidence-based.  There's a reason that vidence-based medicine and ainstream medicine are separate articles. 
Mainstream or conventional medicine is &quot;whatever's accepted&quot;.  Evidence-based medicine is &quot;whatever's proven&quot;.  To give an example, conventional medicine says that people who have major surgery should not be permitted to eat until their bowels are making noises again.  Evidence-based medicine says that this restriction is pointless and needlessly extends hospital stays, as well as making patients uncomfortable.  Neither of these are &quot;alternative&quot;, but one of them is mainstream and the other one has the evidence behind it.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 20:36, 9 April 2013 (UTC)
