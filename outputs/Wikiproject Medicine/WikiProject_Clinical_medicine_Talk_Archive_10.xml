Food and Drug Administration Criticism page
There has been a lengthy discussion about the proper fate of material related to criticism of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

FungalGuide links - useful, helpful, or poor external link spam ?
A new user  has added links to several fungal medication articles to http://www.fungalguide.ca - see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Romanbond Contributions/Romanbond]. The website has an impressive list of dermatologists on its board, has advertising/promotion editorial policies (stating adhere to international medical journal guidelines), and the pages on use of various agents seem comprehensive. Seeing these links, I had a number of thoughts - what do others think?
* Wikipedia articles should be comprehensive on their own, acting as an indexing to jumping out to external sites is not wikipedia's role (likewise we do not permit external links on each article to Encyclopaedia Brittanica). Are these links appropriate under our  guidelines ? 
* Does the information differ from just product licensing information (for which there are standard parameters in the Drugbox template to link to the FDA's own pages), i.e. is the information any different from the product information on any number of pharmacy websites that generally get removed as being spam ?
* Is it spamming to systematically link multiple anti-fungal articles to this external site ? Would a single link, in say, antifungals be more appropriate ?
* If appropriate links, should at least the formating be a little more formalised under cite web template ? David Ruben  Talk  22:27, 29 May 2007 (UTC)

Hi David, thank for your comment. I’m new to Wikipedia and might have overdone it with placing several links to the same resource. Just wanted to be more specific with my references by linking to a page that deals with the current subject rather than to a website home page. 
I’ve removed almost all links, but left a few, which, I think, are in compliance with the  guidelines.

I appreciate your advice.

No opinion on the remaining links themselves, just wanted to say, commendable action, removing your own links. Femto 14:19, 30 May 2007 (UTC)

 Similar commentary has been added to haloperidol.

His removal of suspected sockpuppetry note and again of the other warning notices to him is unacceptable. I've added  to his talk page. The use of sockpuppets to advance a POV that several editors have indicated as breaching wikipedia style or policy was disruptive ( is not a licence to revert 3 times and get away with it - even 1 revert can be sufficient disruptive to warrent action). The multiple edits in each case of Haloperidol and Akathisia were such disruptions and I have blocked the user for 24hrs. Having previously held back from further systematically undoing his POV pushing, now having blocked the user it would be inappropriate for me to edit these articles further on these points. Please other wikiproject members, help MastCell with the task of proof-checking the relevant articles. David Ruben  Talk  23:00, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

Ringworm and restructure of Clinical Mycology
Current Ringworm article covers clinical mycology in general (mycology culturing and treatment) and covers not just fungal ringworm on the skin (a specific appearance/presentation), but also lists as subtypes being fungal nail infection &amp; athletes foot (neither of which form rings), and Tinea versicolor which has entirely different microorganism (a yeast rather than a fungus) etc. Mycology article covers the general biological topic (rather than as relates to infections and human diseases) and dermophyte whilst covering the parasitic fungal, is about the organisms rather than the clinical diseases or the branch of clinical microbiology.

I propose a reorganisation, with Ringworm being about just the specific skin disorder. Tinea then perhaps should be overall descriptor or disambiguation of the various conditions prefixed with &quot;tinea&quot; rather than redirecting to ringworm. Is this sufficient, or should there be a Clinical mycology article for the overall field (we do after all have Cardiology as a specific field of medicine and then disease articles of Coronary heart disease, Ischaemic heart disease, myocardial infarction etc) 

See discussion thread started at , I'm happy to do the edits in the next couple of days, but would appreciate any points or issues being raised for me to bear in mind first (eg is &quot;Clinical mycology&quot; the best of terms etc). David Ruben  Talk  22:41, 15 June 2007 (UTC)

Rather than create a new Clinical mycology article, it may make more sense to expand Mycosis. --Arcadian 08:28, 16 June 2007 (UTC)

PubMed vs. secondary sources

 seems to be at odds with ;  MEDMOS encourages the use of PubMed references, MEDRS implicitly discourages them.

WP:MEDRS states:
In general, Wikipedia's medical articles should use published reliable secondary sources whenever possible. Reliable primary sources may be used only with great care, because it's easy to misuse them. For that reason, edits that rely on primary sources should only make descriptive claims that can be checked by anyone without specialist knowledge. Any interpretation of primary source material requires a secondary source.

In my opinion:
* The above (in WP:MEDRS) should be further qualified.  Primary sources, IMHO, are accessible to an interested layperson, with the vast amount of credible medical information (e.g. Merck Manual, eMedicine, Medlineplus.org, [http://www.canadian-health-network.ca/customtools/homee.html |Canadian Health Network]) out there and the strong base of Wikipedia articles that cover topics in medicine and experimental physiology.
* Primary sources should be the key references-- secondary sources should be considered supplemental.  Primary sources should be explained -- like any good secondary source for the lay public.
* Good secondary sources base their info from primary sources.  I think Wikipedia has enough people with expertise to deliver nuanced interpretations of primary sources that can compete handily with respected secondary sources.
* Use of secondary sources from PubMed (i.e. review articles) should be encouraged.
I look forward to the discussion.  My thoughts on this arose from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Nephron#McClintock_effect this discussion]-- and are related to changes to the McClintock effect article.  Nephron  T| 06:12, 24 June 2007 (UTC)

I wonder whether that's an old policy which is now outdated as the 'pedia continues to grow in depth. I don't worry about it myself and often use primary sources as do many others. Have a look at alot of FA nominees.cheers,  Casliber (talk · ) 06:17, 24 June 2007 (UTC)
I didn't think scientific journals were necessarily considered primary sources. Mostly, it means that care should be exerted when using recent, sweepingly new results, but I've never seen people objecting to theuse of scientific journals on the base of them being &quot;primary sources.&quot; I guess this is because no article can exist that is not based on some amount of existing work. I certainly agree that review articles/material should be encouraged, if only because that material is generally more directly accesible, and can provide of otherwise difficult to locate further material. The couple review sources I used for Verbascum thapsus provided most of the important structure for the article. Circeus 07:18, 24 June 2007 (UTC)
* It seems like a non-sensical sentiment to dismiss pubmed indexed articles as preferred sources. I agree, however, that people who are unfamiliar with some areas will use refs. out of context to prove this or that. The expertise of editors in some of these specialty areas helps to filter the wheat from chafe. Secondary sources like standard medical textbooks, positions of health ministries (eg. FDA, health Canada) etc. can be used to bring contextDroliver 15:37, 24 June 2007 (UTC)

The danger with favoring, or relying on, primary sources is that you're depending on the expertise and insight of the editor to use and interpret them appropriately. For instance, a primary source stating that a compund shrinks human tumors engrafted in NOD/SCID mice may be presented as &quot;XXX is highly effective against many human cancers.&quot; (Yes, I have been scarred by the DCA thing). In cases where 1 study has showed an effect, but dozens of others have confirmed that the effect does not exist, selective citation is a danger. I don't think we should deprecate primary sources (since they're so vital to explaining any medical topic), but I do think we should insist on something along the lines of, &quot;The use of primary sources (e.g. journal articles) is encouraged on medical topics, but interpretations of these sources should hew carefully to that presented by the authors or by reliable secondary sources such as review articles and medical textbooks.&quot; This might discourage the inevitable  usage of primary sources while still encouraging their general inclusion. Thoughts? MastCell Talk 15:54, 24 June 2007 (UTC)
&quot;The us of some types (e.g. scientific journal articles) of primary is encouraged&quot; without reference to scientific topics in particular (why not physics, maths or astronomy??) is a better wording to me. Why don't you bring your suggestion to the talk page? It should be noted that by Wikipedia's own definitions, Medical journals articles are neither &quot;original research&quot; (&quot;unpublished facts, arguments, concepts, statements, or theories&quot; or &quot;any unpublished analysis or synthesis of published material that appears to advance a position&quot;), nor are they &quot;unreliable&quot; (reliable sources: &quot;credible published materials with a reliable publication process&quot;), so for the most part, these concerns are unfounded. I don't think they fit Wikipedia's definition of Primary sources either, which refers mostly to historical documents. Examples cited are: &quot;archeological artifacts; photographs; newspaper accounts which contain first-hand material, rather than analysis or commentary of other material; historical documents such as diaries, census results, video or transcripts of surveillance, public hearings, trials, or interviews; tabulated results of surveys or questionnaires; written or recorded notes of laboratory and field experiments or observations;&quot;. Furthermore, an example of a secondary source is &quot;[a]n historian's interpretation of the decline of the Roman Empire, or analysis of the historical Jesus,&quot; which can certainly be a &quot;primary source&quot; journal articles. Further removed sources, because of their accessibility, continue to have advantages, but it is a Good Thing to be able to credit the originators of novel ideas. Circeus 17:53, 24 June 2007 (UTC)
*I'm a bit puzzled by the idea that the comments in MEDRS &quot;implicitly discourage&quot; PubMed references since PubMed isn't mentioned at all. PubMed indexes medical articles, which may be primary or secondary sources. They may be research, letters, biographies, book reviews, case notes, etc, etc. MEDRS is based on RS (a while back) and I believe the views on Primary and Secondary sources apply to medicine just as much as history or science, for example. Perhaps there is a middle ground were we encourage editors to cite primary (often seminal) papers  inline but back this up with review articles/textbooks listed as References where they have been used by the editor to confirm his interpretation (if any) of the primary material. 
I feel we should also say something to discourage citing a primary source to confirm a fact that the editor only knows through reading a secondary source. The citation may include the primary source but should also say &quot;as cited by ...&quot; to give details of the actual source used by the editor.
If you read MEDRS, you should see it (attempts to) define what are primary/secondary sources wrt medicine. There most certainly are primary sources in medicine.
I'm pleased that MEDRS is starting to be discussed. It is not ready to become a guideline without much further work and discussion from project members. Should this discussion be moved to MEDRS's talk page? Colin°Talk 18:21, 24 June 2007 (UTC)

Good idea... I thought of that after I'd already commented here. I'll move over there. MastCell Talk 19:40, 24 June 2007 (UTC)

I have been looking at , and I would be relieved to have some guidelines such as those that are listed.  This would become very relevant to topics in dentistry, such as &quot;new-and-improved&quot; products but especially on fluoride and amalgam.  It seems to me that, by far, the most important item in MEDRS is that an article must &quot;present the prevailing medical or scientific consensus.&quot;  Anything else placed in an article should be labeled as a minority view or one that is not accepted by the established consensus.  As long as this principle is followed, then I do not foresee major  nor  problems arising.  Secondary sources can be encouraged in the guideline to make certain that medical/scientific consensus is presented, but I think the most important point to emphasize is that (regardless of the source) the content presented in the article, whether held by consensus or a minority viewpoint, must be presented as such. Saying all this, I hope this proposal can eventually be elevated to a guideline with a little work. - Dozenist talk 14:26, 25 June 2007 (UTC)

Starchild Abraham Cherrix subject of AFD

An AFD is taking place over Starchild Abraham Cherrix here [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Starchild_Abraham_Cherrix].  Given that this individual has featured prominently in the debate about the rights to seek alternative medical treatments, I figure this article is notable enough to keep.

Wrongdiagnosis.com

I was aghast at the yield of an &quot;external link hunt&quot; to the nefarious site Wrongdiagnosis.com. This is a database-driven website that randomly regurgitates lists of symptoms and diagnoses. The algorithm and its methodology are not obvious; the content is certainly not the result of medical knowledge being weighed carefully by an experienced practicioner.

Benzodiazepine

No, I think you're right (but then, I think that about 99% of the pharmaceutical articles on Wikipedia, and I'm no drug-company defender). The &quot;Abuse&quot; section should be folded into the &quot;Dependence&quot; section, and the &quot;Crime&quot; section is utterly ludicrous.

The article is therefore totally unbalanced just on length of sections, let alone tone. However the cultural/controversy sections seem well sourced, albeit too gloomy, but does any source state that another source's &quot;gloom &amp; doom&quot; is wrong - is it possible to cite to regain a NPOV in these sections? Separately should these sections perhaps be pulled out from the clinical/pharmacology sections - ? a subtopic page, eg Cultural and controversy issues of benzodiazepines with Benzodiazepine just being a pharmacology page?

I propose we move medical test to diagnostic test
I am tired of using the term diagnostic test and finding it a red link because someone wrote medical test. I realize I could make a redirect page but I find the latter term less informative and less precise, and no more useful for the general lay reader. I plan to rename it Diagnostic test and will set up a redirect from Medical test, unless anyone here has a strong and persuasive objection. I got no responses when i posted this on the  page last week and perhaps no one cares. In North America both terms are used and few people don't recognize &quot;diagnostic test&quot;. Is it any different elsewhere in the Anglosphere? alteripse 19:44, 22 July 2007 (UTC)

Let's make linking to PubMed easier
As authors get better at linking content back to source articles at PubMed, the underlying wiki markup becomes much more tedious to edit. I think the markup is going to get so unmanageable at to drive away prospective authors. In addition, I am starting to see the problem where one article at PubMed is cited twice from one page, but with a different ref tag so the article shows up twice in the bibliography.

There is not reason linking to PubMed as to be so difficult. Consider if WP has a system that is sort-of a  web mashup:
# WikiPedia has a reference server that maintains a database of citations from PMIDs, ISBNs, LCCs, etc that authors have cited.
# The author inserts into a Wiki page the wiki markup  or 
# The reference server looks to see if this citation is already in its database, if not, it goes to [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query/static/eutils_help.html PubMed's eutilities] to retrieve the citation information that will be displayed in teh WP page.
# The result is a much trimmer markup that is not clutted by citation details. This also reduces duplicate citations.

Propofol infusion syndrome

Are any of our resident WikiDocs familiar with this clinical entity?

Heart disease on AID


The current  article is . Last week's collaboration was: .

Is it appropriate for for an MD's private practice websites to be linked to?
I'm interested in some feedback from peers. On biography pages, is it appropriate to contain links to a doctor's personal webpage? In particular, with fee for service areas of medicine like Plastic Surgery, a practice website is mostly an advertising vehicle. In the guideline for external links , commercial portals are discouraged. I think it's reasonable to equate such a link to a commercial enterprise, and I've seen it treated as such on other MD's bios on wikipedia. 

I've deleted the practice website of plastic surgeon, Toby Meltzer, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toby_Meltzer] only to run into resistance from some of the transgender folks who are very protective (like most of us) of any articles on doctors related to their pet issues. Dr. Meltzer is kind of a super-teriary specialist in trans-gender operations from patients who travel to him in Arizona. This practice website is how a number of patients are directed to him presumably for his practice.

If anyone has strong feelings on this, please share and chime in that discussion. Rob Droliver 14:34, 15 August 2007 (UTC)

Generally, links to a physician's private practice would seem to violate  by being commercial, adding little of encyclopedic value, etc. However, on a biography page, links to websites maintained by the subject of the article are generally accepted, even though they often have a commerical bent to them (again, per ). So long as Toby Meltzer is notable enough for an article, it's probably OK (IMHO) for that article to link to his practice website. However, the link shouldn't appear on other pages, such as gender reassignment surgery or plastic surgery. MastCell Talk 16:23, 15 August 2007 (UTC)

Emedtv, a tertiary source

A small group of editors has simultaneously started adding content with the use of EMedTV.com as a reference. Reviewing the website I am immediately struck by the familiar waffle of ad-supported health sites - no references, no name of the author let alone his/her qualifications, and no indication that it is supported by professional organisations.

Articles in question are arthritis, hypertension, atorvastatin. No doubt other articles are also being targeted. Please keep an eye out; I'm discussing one edit on . JFW | T@lk 16:51, 19 August 2007 (UTC)

Here's a list of articles from which emedtv.com is linked: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALinksearch&amp;target=*.emedtv.com]. MastCell Talk 17:09, 19 August 2007 (UTC)

Indeed uncredited by author, without references and just a tertiary source that fails to add to wikipedia's generally better (better written, better referenced and cross-linked to other articles) articles. These links need to be taken down. David Ruben  Talk  18:46, 19 August 2007 (UTC)

 I have been the one that has been using eMedTV as a reference. Why, because as a practicing physician, I have always found their information to be accurate, up to date and transparent when it comes to their editorial process, including the healthcare providers that oversee their content and their editoral process.

But I would like to respond to some of the comments make in the posts above. First of all,  come down a little off the better written, etc.  I decided to start interacting with Wikipedia after I read in the Hypertension article that pregnancy in males is a complication of HTN. I don't remember this in medical school but maybe I am wrong.  I then read the article about arthritis which had no references.  I then read an article about ibuprofen which says that priapism is a common side effect (which it is not). Furthermore, the article did not include one of the most common side effects, which is an unexplained rash.  So I decided to not only make the information more accurate but added references to support my changes.

And regarding the quote from above &quot;I am immediately struck by the familiar waffle of ad-supported health sites - no references, no name of the author let alone his/her qualifications, and no indication that it is supported by professional organisations,&quot; -- Mayo Clinic's website has ads. Does this make it a less credible site?  I would recommend before making a judgment, read their about page to see how they create content. Before using them as a reference, I did and have recommended them to a number of my patients because their information is well written and accurate.   What I gather is that this is an organization that has health care providers overseeing the quality and accuracy of their content and have an editorial process in place. 

So this then bodes the question about the definition that Wikipedia uses for credible sources and it is as follows: &quot;Reliable sources are authors or publications regarded as trustworthy or authoritative in relation to the subject at hand. Reliable publications are those with an established structure for fact-checking and editorial oversight.&quot; So when I made the updates, I took this information from eMedTV and felt that I should reference where I got it from.

I would welcome your thoughts because this is not just about my choice of reference locations, it is about using Mayo Clinic and a number of other sites that are credible sources of information.  Furthermore, what I found interesting with your edits is that you did not take down the information that I added. Why?  If my sources are inaccurate, then doesn't this make the information I added inaccurate.  If so, I will be more than happy to return the information back to the way it was before I caused all this controversy.Sailormd 22:02, 19 August 2007 (UTC)

I do not dispute the information on eMedTV. Most of it is probably accurate, much like Wikipedia. But there is no way of knowing when nobody puts his name to it. Given that the content is based on other sources, why can't we preferentially cite those sources and appear slightly more credible? See  for some background. I doubt the Mayo Clinic is much better.

 I have explained my rationale and although not answered what it appears like to me is that this group would rather no source than a secondary source. 

To make your life easier, I have also provided the links for all those that have WebMD, Mayo Clinic, RevolutionHealth as a reference:

http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALinksearch&amp;target=*.revolutionhealth.com

I am sure that there are other sites that have infiltrated Wikipedia. These are just the ones that came to the top of my head.

I have also reverted the articles back to the state they were before I edited them.  This is about being transparent. If my sources are unreliable, then the information should be removed. Sailormd 03:56, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

I also did a quick search for wrongdiagnosis.com.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=*wrongdiagnosis.com&amp;go=Go Occasionally, my  patients have brought in info from them and it is most often inaccurate.

I came here because I saw the deletion of sourced by Sailormd. If you are going to remove sources as problematic, it would be best if you replaced them with a reliable source, while it is more work, it clearly improves the encyclopedia. If you cannot add a source to replace the source you are removing, AT THE VERY LEAST, please add a citation needed tag. Look at [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Benazepril&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=152393454 this diff].

As far as I can tell, WebMD articles are attributed to an author (see very bottom where often states which group of doctors reviewed article and who is last reviewer) and therefore seem more like a secondary source (which is acceptable), very much like eMedicine, although written for a different target audience (and WedMD of course now owns eMedicine) David Ruben  Talk  17:32, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

Andrew C, there is consensus here that we should work on better sources for facts presently referenced to sites like WebMD, Wrongdiagnosis etc etc. Whether these are secondary or tertiary doesn't bother me. The fact is that Wikipedia is mature enough not to  let itself be guided by the whims of those sites' content purchasers. We have enough manpower and brainpower to get the content directly from that elusive thing called the &quot;medical literature&quot;.

If there is one thing this WikiProject should strive for, it is demonstrating in an encyclopedic fashion how medicine is practiced. Good doctors base their practice on evidence-based publications, not on hearsay or outdated factoids once crammed in medical school. Good CME is literature-based rather than expert-based. We should aim to follow these trends. One of the ills of modern medicine is the fact that people follow diagnostic and therapeutic protocols without having appraised the evidence base behind them. Again, citing directly from the literature will shorten the distance between encyclopedia content and the aggregated body of medical knowledge.

I applaud SailorMD for rigorously applying these principles. I would again like to stress that often, a little bit of PubMed sleuthing will provide a dedicated contributor with the right reference in the literature where facts were previously referenced to some website. JFW | T@lk 18:59, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

I understand what you are saying, and I agree with most of it. However, I do not applaud some of Sailormd's edits. Take for example [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bunion&amp;diff=152393192&amp;oldid=150645640 this edit]. A list of symptoms was referenced with a WebMD article. However, the reference was removed, leaving the article with an unsourced list of symptoms that came from WebMD. If the content wasn't accurate, then the whole symptoms list should have been removed along with the reference. If the content was good, the best thing to do would have been to replace the reference to a more reliable source. It is unacceptable to orphan content from their sources. At the very least, if you are going to remove WebMD references, replace them with citation needed tags (or, if the content is disputed, better yet remove the inaccurate content and the poor source).-Andrew c [[User talk:Andrew c|[talk]]] 20:22, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

The fact that content is loosely cited from WebMD does not invalidate the content. On the contrary, the content is likely to be correct. I urge you to adhere to the consensus formed on this page and not pursue your own agenda as you have done on heart failure. JFW | T@lk 00:38, 21 August 2007 (UTC)


 Well if nothing else I think this has been a productive discussion.  JFW you bring up some great points.  I absolutely agree that evidenced-based medicine is the only way to go and that these principals will lead to higher quality information. And as always I will be transparent with why I do things.  Yes I did remove several references from WebMD.  The reason -- WebMD uses licensed material created by Healthwise, a company that licenses content to several hundred other web sites. In other words, it is syndicated content similar to AP or Reuters.  In these cases, we could just as easily use one of the university sites that also use Healthwise as a reference (I am not advocating that). What I am advocating is that we limit the use of licensed or syndicated content as references.  

 Despite me bringing up Mayo Clinic (it was to illustrate a point about advertising), I do not think that their site warrants removing their references. This is because I would argue that it would be more appropriate to use a nonsyndicated site reference, such as a Mayo Clinic, if one is needed (assuming a better medical reference is not available). My rationale is that they write their own content, it is written by medical professionals, their provide references, and based on my experience it is generally accurate. I believe that sites that license their content, such as a WebMD, Wrong Diagnosis, or a host of others do not have a place here. 

 Now in order of priority, citing the literature is always going to be the first choice.  However, I would not go to the literature (in most cases) if I were looking up things like symptoms, causes, or diagnosis. As you know, we would go to Harrison's or one of the many other reference books that we have available to us.  And if we were publishing a paper we would reference this source. Pretty simple. But, Wikipedia is different, partly because of the various audiences but also because of the need for transparency (to maintain quality). Seeing the sources allows us to check for accuracy based on the resources we have available to us and our clinical knowledge. Without a citation, we have no way of verifying accuracy.  This is why I would prefer sources to be cited as long as they meet the other criteria (they write their own content, it is written by medical professionals, and their reference their sources). Do you agree with my rationale because it seems like a pretty simple criteria to measure the quality of a secondary (or tertiary) source?Sailormd 04:34, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

Mayo Clinic has gotten dramatically better recently, but they still have a bit of subtly incorrect info about Tourette syndrome. I wouldn't use them.  At least they're better than the Merck Manual.  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 05:22, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

 Point taken.  The first criteria of course it that the information cited is accurate.Sailormd 13:40, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

I fail to see why &quot;WebMD uses licensed material created by Healthwise&quot; is a valid reason for removing references. What has the licensing or syndication of content got to do with whether it is a reliable source or not? By the standards of WP, WebMD is a . Look at [http://www.webmd.com/epilepsy/Ketogenic-diet-for-epilepsy this article on the ketogenic diet]: it has an named author, an editor, reviewers, a date and cites its source. That's better than many WP references (compare with the [http://epilepsy.emedtv.com/ketogenic-diet/ketogenic-diet.html emedtv version]). Just to be clear: I'm not encouraging the use of WebMD, just saying it is not an unreliable source.

Can I just clarify that I've understood JFW, Fvasconcellos and David Ruben's comments correctly: WebMD is an adequately  for WP articles (whereas eMedTV isnt). It is a whole lot better than a newspaper, for example. By &quot;adequate&quot; I mean that it meets WP's threshold, but isn't ideal. This project strongly encourages editors to find and use better sources. We would certainly expect our best (featured) articles to be based on stronger material. I hope  indicates that there is a spectrum of quality, not a black-and-white rule. Simply removing adequately sourced text or removing the adequate references from text should be discouraged. Colin°Talk 16:49, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

No, WebMD is not suitable as a reference. It is reasonably referenced and probably reliable for a layperson, but why not go for the gold and sidestep this &quot;content for sale&quot; stuff. Also, just look at the &quot;shingles&quot; article[http://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/Shingles/Shingles-Topic-Overview] - you can see the URL is a fine example of SEO.
I remain convinced that the only way of finding better references is by removing the dodgy ones. I would hope SailorMD could be so kind as to replace his removed references with better ones. JFW | T@lk 19:10, 21 August 2007 (UTC)
I think this &quot;content for sale&quot; and SEO stuff is a distraction. As one of the authors of , I know WebMD isn't a good source, and wouldn't choose to use it myself nor recommend it. However, it doesn't fail WP's  or  as as source. Removing material or sources that meet WP policy and guidlines could be considered vandalism.

Sorry, but I'm with Colin on this one. Sure we should go for the gold, but I'd rather have... I don't know, &quot;bronze&quot; in an article than &quot;&quot;. Wholesale removal or sources which fail neither policy nor guideline, while higher-quality sources are still unavailable (i.e. haven't been searched for, let alone added to the article), is borderline y in my book. Fvasconcellos (t·) 20:33, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

Just to put the record straight, I agree that the wholesale removal of references is not right so I think we are all in agreement with this. This weekend, I will be updating the references for the ones that I recently removed.  I do however believe that in some cases references are absolutely unnecessary.  For example, look at bunions, which had previously referenced the definition of a bunion. Why does this require a citation? 

The second discussion is what is an appropriate source for medical information on WP. Source text by definition is original text. It is not text housed on another site for which a fee is paid. Therefore, I cannot see how it is ever appropriate to cite a Website for which content is not their own original work. If WebMD or a host of other sites did not write the information, they are not a source, regardless of whether the information is considered reliable.

Then it comes down to what is an acceptable source. Several people have said this to be this minimum standard should be a .  As you all know, I used eMedTV as a reference because I viewed them as a reliable source per the WP definition (health care providers overseeing the content creation, an editorial process in place, and accurate information for the sources I used based on my clinical judgment) - see [http://www.emedtv.com/about.html]. 

But, with that being said, in the future I would not use this source because this site does not meet the minimum criteria I mentioned last night for online sources. This criteria includes the article being the original work of the website referenced (not licensed or repurposed content), it is written and/or reviewed by medical professionals (who are named), they reference their sources, and of course the information is accurate. What I find when I read the  is that it does an excellent job outlining quality sources, except for online sources where it just names a couple of acceptable sources.  I am looking to promote discussion to see if we might be able to provide more clarity for online sources, eliminate some of the subjectiveness, and ultimately improve the quality of the WP product.  Does this criteria seem reasonable?Sailormd 04:57, 22 August 2007 (UTC)

Good summary. Just to clarify, it was not in itself that EmedTV data might be inaccurate, just whether it was an appropriate source (vs say an attributable text book or other website).  had quite a long and difficult time being formulated at all (in particular whether if 2 equally good sources, should an online one take precidence over a hard-copy-via-library one). So it was left somewhat imprecise whilst it &quot;bedded-down&quot; and people might see how it would help or hinder finding appropriate sources in a given situation (eg of course a newspaper article would be valid if making a point about public awareness or attitude to an item). So I think the above discussion should form a useful introduction to relooking at how firmly WP:MEDRS might be tightened-up or rephrased :-) David Ruben  Talk  12:24, 22 August 2007 (UTC)

Mother of all eyesores

To speak with Saddam Hussein, I have come to regard allergy as the mother of all eyesores. It is presently a hodgepodge of unreferenced POV, bits of random knowledge and some valid points too. I nominated this for  a while ago, but I suspect not many are looking at that page very often. I would appreciate everyone's votes, and perhaps we can tackle that article in the near future. Hmmm, eyesore, isn't that allergic conjunctivitis?

I'm planning some work on pancreatic cancer with the help of an extremely detailed review from Gut last month.

We have a very positive note on the coeliac disease article in a Gut book review, by the way. See  for details. JFW | T@lk 12:52, 20 August 2007 (UTC)

Excellent. By the way, drop me a note when you're going to start on the pancreatic cancer article. I've been a little swamped in real life, but would like to work on it, and it's always easier if others are on board at the same time so we can bounce ideas and sources around. Allergy is giving me a headache so I'm not sure how much time I'll spend there. Actually, now that I look again, the layout is not half bad. It just needs a lot of cleanup.

Journal copyright question
Can anyone who has access look at the journal study cited in the Table I built in my sandbox, and tell me if I altered it enough/left out enough to get away without this being a copyright issue?  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 05:39, 21 August 2007 (UTC)
Copyright-wise, I see no difficulties - your table is simply a summary of the Mattila et al version. One question (and pardon my ignorance on the classification of ASDs): the final line of your table is &quot;Exclusion of other disorder&quot;, while the Mattila table is &quot;Exclusion of autistic disorder&quot; - would it be more correct to say &quot;Exclusion of other autistic disorders&quot; here? -- MarcoTolo 17:29, 21 August 2007 (UTC)
Thanks for the help!  Not sure; if you look at the list of exclusions in the footnotes of the table, they aren't all autistic disorders, so in the interest of not completely duplicating their text and violating copyright, I dropped that word.  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 18:10, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

Asperger syndrome has now been (rightfully) submitted to ; a massive rewrite is underway (but the end of summer timing stinks).  We haven't yet touched the top of the article (working from the bottom up), so cover your eyes there.  Can others please look at the massive list of differentials I've added to Asperger_syndrome#Diagnosis and attempt to resolve the red links, consolidate them into some semblance of categories (I drew the lists from two different sources), and eliminate conditions that aren't worthy of mention?  I'm not a physician or a medical professional, so some of them are Greek to me.  Thanks, SandyGeorgia (Talk) 17:37, 23 August 2007 (UTC)

Asperger syndrome has now been fully rewritten, top to bottom, to reflect reliable sources.  Review and feedback on the current status at  would be welcomed.  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 17:36, 1 September 2007 (UTC)

MCOTW - resuscitating an old friend

A few months ago,  (Medical Collaboration of the Week) was a force to be reckoned with. With breakneck speed and phenomenal collaboration, some high-profile articles like asthma, multiple sclerosis and prostate cancer were improved to  level.

Sadly,  (Mr MCOTW par excellence) is too busy in meatspace, and several other high-powered contributors have had to spread themselves a bit thinner. This is a reality on Wikipedia. However, over the last few months the MCOTW has fizzled out a bit. Fewer articles are nominated, there are fewer votes, the articles turn around less frequently, receive fewer edits, and rarely make .

I propose the following:
* MCOTW now turns around twice a month: on the 1st and the 15th.
* GA status rather than FA should be the primary objective (we cannot aspire to producing an FA every 2 weeks)
* If insufficient votes are cast,  and myself will find important articles that need improving

Before embarking on this journey, I'd like to get some soundings from this WikiProject. Are the above proposals realistic? Are there any people who presently encounter barriers in contributing? Do we need to start a journal service (contributors with digital journal access locating source material on behalf of others)? All comments very much welcome! JFW | T@lk 19:42, 27 August 2007 (UTC)

I'd be interested in being more active if we can revive it. The only barrier I have to contributing is that I keep getting sidetracked (well, that and grant deadlines are approaching). It would be good to sound out how many people are active enough to participate. I would actually look forward to doing some non-controversial editing at this point. I have online access to most reasonably high-impact journals, and can help provide text to those who lack such access, within the bounds of copyright issues. MastCell Talk 22:07, 27 August 2007 (UTC)

Sounds great. So tomorrow we will start on meningitis? Some suggestions:
* Stick to &quot;pure&quot; medical topics, e.g. the current collaboration transcription factor is not an article that I expect to be improved a lot by doctors or med students.
* Announce the new collaboration on talk pages such as those from the users that voted, active contributors on previous articles, here, and on related wikiprojects.
--WS 17:49, 31 August 2007 (UTC)
 &quot;Journal service&quot; is a good idea. We should have a separate page where editors with access can enlist their names and others can post requests.--Countincr ( t@lk ) 18:56, 31 August 2007 (UTC)

So a little summary:
* Medicine collaboration of the fortnight (1st and 15th of each month)
* focusing on medical articles (we should forget about molecular biology, etc.)
* making a lot of noise on talk pages of users, projects and portals. We should promote this improved MCOTW on the Community Portal.
* we should also create an up-to-date list of the really active contributors
* Journal Service (fantastic idea!)

My questions/suggestions:
* Should we rename the MCOTW to MCOTF?
* We should make it much easier to nominate an article. The &quot;needs 2 votes to remain in consideration&quot; parameter is totally unneccessary as we get just a few nominations. In a lot of cases, I had to find a new collaboration myself. Just an aticle name + a date + the nominator's name, that's all we need.

What do you think? NCurse  work 07:12, 1 September 2007 (UTC)

I think MCOTF is now a better descriptor of that page. &quot;Needs 2 votes&quot; is unnecessary and disrupts the cycle.
Meningitis time! JFW | T@lk 10:47, 2 September 2007 (UTC)

Ok! What I've done:
* Meningitis is the new collab.
* I removed the &quot;needs X votes to remain in consideration&quot; line from the template and the past nominations.
The only thing left is the new name. Should I rename all of the related pages/templates to fortnight? 

Please help making some noise about the improvements. NCurse  work 15:28, 2 September 2007 (UTC)

Surgery article

The Surgery article seems to be woefully inadequate in describing even the fundamentals of modern surgery.  Is anybody working on expanding this article?  H Padleckas 09:58, 30 August 2007 (UTC)

I agree it could stand to be improved... . MastCell Talk 15:48, 30 August 2007 (UTC)

After practically two months, nobody had made any improvements of substance to the Surgery article to address my above-mentioned concern.  So as MastCell suggested, I became  and &quot;went for it.&quot;  I substantially expanded the Surgery article to describe fundamental aspects of modern surgery.  I would like to request a peer review to ensure the Surgery article is technically sound.  If anybody wants to review Surgery and make any [beneficial] edits, please go ahead.
