		<segment id="id44293538">Global health statistics (revisited)

I think there's consensus [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Medicine/Archive 54#Health statistics: US vs global|here]]  that we ultimately aim to provide a broad and balanced global picture. Often that's easier said than done... For esophageal cancer at least, I found the distribution statistics listed in the 2014 World Cancer Report (kindly suggested for sourcing by ) somewhat sketchy: in particular, the summaries of regional data are not stratified by the main histological types - a key variable. 

I believe a reasonable editorial case can be made for considering a publication such as  as a reliable secondary source (and, potentially an &quot;ideal&quot; MEDRS), in that it systematically collates data made available by a major international body (IARC - [http://ci5.iarc.fr/CI5-X/Default.aspx]/[http://ci5.iarc.fr/CI5-X/PDF/BYHISTO/C15.pdf]). While I appreciate 's cautious response ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AWikiProject_Medicine&amp;diff=629911344&amp;oldid=629910849]) and I too fully accept the need for caution when using such registries (as acknowledged by the authors of the paper - sorry, full text is paywalled), I feel the authors' recognition that the information documented in the paper is largely in keeping with other sources provides another argument in favor of its use, per the guiding principles of MEDRS. Imo, this sort of source could help bring together a section which is [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Esophageal_cancer&amp;oldid=631332618#Epidemiology somewhat typically fragmented]. 

I'm raising the matter here again, as I feel it goes beyond any one particular disease.  () 16:30, 27 October 2014 (UTC)
Hello. I think there must a misunderstanding because at first look, the source you are presenting is not controversial and sources of this type should be presented on Wikipedia in top-level articles in the epidemiology section. MEDRS does not cover this kind of information, and standard Wikipedia rules do. MEDRS covers information of the sort which individuals can use to gain insight into the nature of medical treatments. The source you shared is about population health. It says &quot;These first global estimates of oesophageal cancer incidence by histology...&quot; and that seems valuable and not likely to cause concern.

MalaCards

A  was made in 2013 to modify  to link to a repository called MalaCards (GeneCards but for maladies). This is a site (http://www.malacards.org) that pulls together data from sources such as Wikipedia. 

Now it suddenly appears as an identifier in the infobox after  modified the infobox.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Infobox_disease&amp;diff=631313560&amp;oldid=624167425] I have no very strong views on this, other than that I believe it was discussed in the wrong forum and that MalaCards is not particularly authoritative. Heck, it doesn't even have its own Wikipedia article. Views, anyone?  |  20:37, 27 October 2014 (UTC)

&quot;Sources such as Wikipedia&quot; is misleading, and something discussed over a period of a year is not &quot;sudden&quot;.  (Pigsonthewing); ;  20:42, 27 October 2014 (UTC)

 It attracted a small number of responses, in the wrong forum, and it stayed on that proposals page for months until it unexpectedly was incorporated in the Infobox. In that sense, it was &quot;sudden&quot; to me.
Incidentally, the methodology behind the database was published in 2013 () which is probably why it doesn't yet have widespread name recognition.  |  20:58, 27 October 2014 (UTC)
I thought I'd take a look at a mitochondrial disease [http://www.malacards.org/card/leber_hereditary_optic_neuropathy]: MalaCards: Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy... is related to leber hereditary optic neuropathy with dystonia...  (and unhelpfully, the link provided to the latter is blank). Further down the page, under the heading &quot;Related Diseases&quot; [http://www.malacards.org/card/leber_hereditary_optic_neuropathy#disorders], we seem to be informed that LHON is &quot;related to&quot; a range of conditions based on &quot;text searches within MalaCards or GeneCards/GeneDecks gene sharing&quot; [?]. Hmm... 

Per the compilers of this, as yet, young database [http://database.oxfordjournals.org/content/2013/bat018.full#sec-31], &quot;A well-known disadvantage is the extraction of irrelevant data [my emphasis]. One example is the extraction of genes that are annotated to be ‘unaffected’ by a specific disease to be associated with this same disease. Another example is extraction of genes related to ‘non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma’ for ‘Hodgkin’s lymphoma’ because the close lexical resemblance between the names of these diseases.&quot; Wouldn't linking to such content from infoboxes be likely to represent a potential source of confusion to the general usership of the encyclopedia?  () 23:20, 27 October 2014 (UTC)
The MalaCards project seems to be of interesting potential, and of course a product of hard work; congratulations to people who work for it. That said, I am not going to comment on the quality of its entries, and neither on its usefulness for the Wikipedia reader. These wouldn't change a simple fact: it was added to the disease infobox without discussion at the proper forum (i.e. here) and without consensus. I oppose adding anything on this or any such important template, below links of universal acceptance and utility like ICD-10, without the above conditions. I propose the immediate removal of the link from the template.  () 07:01, 28 October 2014 (UTC)
This is not technically &quot;the proper forum&quot; for discussing changes to some other page; WPMED does not actually own .  The editor did propose a change to that template in the actual proper forum, which is on the talk page for the template.  (However, it proved ineffective, because almost no one watches it.)  We tend to discuss things here only because it's more convenient for us, and it increases the likelihood that someone will see it, not because it's &quot;proper&quot;.  I assume that when you say, &quot;without consensus&quot;, you mean something like &quot;without getting written permission in advance&quot;, which is .  Our  is that the end result matters more than the  used to reach it.
It would be helpful to hear your opinion on whether it would be desirable to have this optional link in that template.  Whether you (and other people) think that having this option for editors is a good (or bad) idea for readers is important.   () 23:40, 28 October 2014 (UTC)
Thank you for the clarifications, they were helpful for a less experienced editor. I was mistaken to consider this talk-page &quot;the proper forum&quot; - though I believe it is more appropriate than the Molecular Biology Project talk page.
By &quot;without consensus&quot; I was referring to what I believe was not &quot;enough agreement&quot; for the addition in question. Am I misinterpreting the result of the discussion? I believe not, though your more experienced view is welcome. 
My opinion is that MalaCards wouldn't be a clearly useful addition to the template. I dislike the fact that part of its content is computer-generated, and one can sometimes see the trivial mixed with the important. Its usefulness and accuracy isn't established enough to stand by ICD-10 or MeSH.  () 14:44, 29 October 2014 (UTC) 
That's a really valuable and thoughtful explanation, .  
Do you think that these webpages might be a good  for some pages (vs an &quot;almost never anywhere&quot; position)?  Although there's no set rule, what's often happened in the past with that template is that we move websites in there when it seems like a lot of articles have a link under
External links
anyway.  So far, I only find [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALinkSearch&amp;target=www.malacards.org two links in mainspace], both as , which doesn't argue in favor of many editors already finding the links especially useful.  () 16:54, 29 October 2014 (UTC) 
At least as far as maladies in my area (cardiology) are concerned, MalaCards doesn't seem to provide , aside of genetic facts (list of related genes, their pathways and expression). Such information is already included in the links of Infobox Disease, therefore I don't think an external link to MalaCards would offer much, at least to the articles I usually visit and consider editing.  () 20:25, 29 October 2014 (UTC)
I am not in favour of adding any further additional sources or identifiers to infoboxes unless they are (a) international standards or (b) exceptional in quality. There is nothing preventing users from conducting searches on google; if this data is to be recorded then Wikidata is the place to do it in my opinion.-- () 09:34, 28 October 2014 (UTC)
I agree with Tom that Wikidata may be the appropriate place for this. (As I tried to explain above, infobox links to acknowledged irrelevancies would be a potential source of confusion for our readers.)  () 10:46, 29 October 2014 (UTC)
Agree with both.  () 19:14, 29 October 2014 (UTC)

It appears everyone copies from Wikipedia
Here is a 2011 &quot;Oxford Textbook of Zoonoses: Biology, Clinical Practice, and Public Health Control&quot; by &quot;Oxford University Press&quot; in 2011.[http://books.google.ca/books?id=S90mOwgdz9kC&amp;pg=PA364#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false] Appears to be the first edition. It says:

&quot;Plants, arthropods, and birds have also been considered as possible reservoirs; however, bats are now considered the most likely candidate. Bats were known to reside in the cotton factory in which the Ebola index cases for the 1976 and 1979 outbreaks were employed. They have been implicated in Marburg infections in 1975 and 1980. Of 24 plant species and 19 vertebrate species experimentally inoculated with Ebolavirus, only bats became infected (Swanepeol 1996). The absence of clinical signs in these bats is characteristic of a reservoir species. In a 2002–2003 survey of 1,030 animals, which included 679 bats from Gabon and the DRC, 13 fruit bats were found to contain EbolavirusRNA (Pourrut 2009). As of 2005, three fruit bat species (Hypsignathus monstrosus, Epomops franqueti, and Myonycteris torquata) have been identified as carrying the virus while remaining asymptomatic. .... Reston ebolavirus—unlike its African counterparts—is non-pathogenic in humans. The high mortality among monkeys and its recent emergence in pigs makes them unlikely natural reservoirs.&quot;

Here is the Wikipedia article in Dec of 2010.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ebola_virus_disease&amp;oldid=404199575#Natural_reservoirs]. We said

They are believed to be a natural host species, or reservoir, of the virus.[46] The existence of integrated genes of filoviruses in some genomes of small rodents, insectivorous bats, shrews, tenrecs, and marsupials indicates a history of infection with filoviruses in these groups as well.[5] Reston ebolavirus—unlike its African counterparts—is non-pathogenic in humans.

[[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] asked me to take a look at this. Good work. :/ I have no doubt that what you're seeing here is a backwards copy. And it happens. I've seen backwards copying in extremely reliable (even governmental) sources, although I don't know if I've ever found it in an Oxford UP publication before. It all comes down to the ethics of the individual contributor.

What would the WMF legal team have to do with it?  So far I don't see 300 words - it ought to count under Fair Use.  Professionally I understand of course plagiarism is often a kiss of death, but that's a different matter.  () 03:18, 25 October 2014 (UTC)
How would it be fair use, without attribution? Also, does English copyright law accept that doctrine?  [[User talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl!]] 03:41, 25 October 2014 (UTC)
I don't see anything in Fair Use (the article) about attribution.  If you put a figure from a paper on the overhead projector, do you have to include the citation to make it legal?

Fair dealing applies in the UK. Although there is an allowance for &quot;instruction&quot;, it cannot be for commercial use (e.g. text books), also an attribution is required.[http://www.copyrightservice.co.uk/copyright/p27_work_of_others#fair_dealing]  () 11:40, 25 October 2014 (UTC)

 Wnt, I am not sure which definition of &quot;scholarship&quot; you are using.  are some. I would consider a postgraduate student writing a PhD thesis to be &quot;scholarship&quot;. Even then, there should be attribution to the original author. Otherwise, it appears as an attempt to pass off the work as the scholar's own.

 The &quot;Fair use&quot; article also includes the statement &quot;Courts, when deciding fair use cases, in addition to looking at context, amount and value of the use, also look to the standards and practices of the professional communities where the case comes from.&quot; The community of book publishers does not permit verbatim copying of text without attribution.

It's rather a different problem. Attribution is a necessary part both of avoiding plagiarism and of complying with the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License. Without it, a fair use claim cannot be based on commentary or review justifications. Parody justifications fails if the reader cannot identify the object of parody.

I agree, that article needs better citations.  Unfortunately, the citations in most of our addiction/dependence articles are of similar low quality. I'm actually planning to rework some of these (mostly the drug addiction ones, few behavioral); but, it'll be a month or two before I start and will probably take me a couple months to finish.  The only one I've seen that I don't think needs to be reworked at the moment is sexual addiction (mostly because I already worked on that). Caffeine dependence for the most part is alright.  Ironically, (substituted) amphetamine addiction is shorter than Amphetamine#Addiction (it also has the common problem of referring to addiction/dependence interchangeably)... so yeah... I need to fix that.  ( | [[Special:WhatLinksHere/User:Seppi333/Maintenance|Maintained]]) 00:51, 1 November 2014 (UTC)

Fluoride toxicity Merger

Over at , we've been trying to resolve some of the merge proposals for articles in our scope. One of these is a proposed merger of Fluoride toxicity into Fluoride. There's not a strong consensus either way at the moment, but it seems agreed that Fluoride toxicity is (or was) overly reliant on non- compliant sources. As it stands now, I think the main question is whether, once non--sourced statements are removed, there will be enough left over to justify its own article. Would anyone mind taking a moment to go through and assess to what degree it will be possible to clean up the article without gutting it? [[User:0x0077BE|0x0077BE]] [/] 13:19, 3 November 2014 (UTC)

Prolotherapy for Osgood-Schlatter disease

What are peoples thoughts? [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 04:43, 3 November 2014 (UTC)
From looking at the pages linked above and without doing my own websearch, to me there appears to be several unanswered questions with regard to dextrose injection therapy in children, and so I think that it would not be reasonable to present it as a well established therapy in a Wiki article.  () 14:08, 3 November 2014 (UTC)

FROM  THE USER's perspective. es.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:K._Dean_Reeves,_M.D.

Kind regards to Doc James  for his fine editorial work and I agree completely with not presenting dextrose injection as a well-established therapy in OSD.  On 1 November, 2014, I made a simple edit adding Osgood-Schlatter disase to the list of conditions that dextrose injection to stimulate repair (prolotherapy) may POSSIBLY help with.  My edit was based not on listing the primary article, but rather was based on filtered (secondary) analysis of that primary article.   This is an important policy question for Wikipedia medical reviews in general, since at some stages of research for any particular condition, studies may be difficult to replicate in terms of funds available or other issues. However, a well-designed clinical trial may still receive significant secondary review, either via PubMed or via on-line academic review sources, which indicates that the treatment method merits consideration as a possible treatment for that condition. I ask that that the following be considered carefully as a  good illustration of this point. 

Wikipedia prefers filtered (secondary) analysis. Secondary analysis consists of three potential sources.  One is systematic reviews.  Another is critically-appraised topics and another is critically-appraised individual articles. In my view, Wikipedia review criteria should not exclude filtered assessment in the form of critically-appraised individual articles with clear recommendations, particularly from multiple academic sources simultaneously, be they on-line or in print. This is particularly true when the user is not asking for details from the individual article  to be listed and the only listing of the treatment is as a possible use.   

Given  that: 

1)  Drs Sakr and Mounsey, from the Department of Family Medicine of University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, under the editorial review vof John Hickner, M.D., MSc., Chair of the Department of Family Medicine at Cleveland Clinic, wrote a Priority Update on Research Literature three page article. This article  listed its own references and was a hybrid between a critically-appraisal of the Topol  et al article and a critical appraised topic on the treatment of  recalcitrant OSD.  The authors made the clear recommendation to &quot;Consider giving dextrose/lidocaine injections to adolescents with Osgood-Schlatter disease (OSD) that persists despite physical therapy,&quot;  Sakr M, Mounsey A. Injection may be the best bet for young athletes’ knee pain. Jnl Fam Pract 2012; 61(8):486-488 

2) The New England Journal of Medicine Journal Watch chose the Topol et al article for review, and under the pen of the Associate Editor for Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Cornelius W. Van Niel, MD, Clinical Professor in the Department of Pediatrics at the University of Washington School of Medicine, stated clearly that &quot; This study shows a promising option for adolescent athletes with stubborn OSD: either dextrose/lidocaine or lidocaine-only injections can help them play without performance-altering discomfort, and dextrose injections can help them play symptom free&quot;. http://www.jwatch.org/pa201111090000002/2011/11/09/dextrose-injections-have-osgood-schlatter

3) Essential Evidence Plus, an evidence-based point-of-care clinical decision review publication that applies specific criteria for validity and relevance to clinical practice decision recommendations, chooses less than 300 articles per year from 100  primary journals to review for a POEM (Patient Oriented Evidence that Matters) review. They selected the Topol et al research study, and, under the pen of Allen F. Shaugnessy, Professor of Family Medicine at Tufts University, made the clear statement that &quot;An injection of a solution of 12.5% dextrose and 1% lidocaine is an effective treatment of Osgood-Schlatter disease (OSD) symptoms in young athletes.(LOE = 1b-) &quot;  http://www.essentialevidenceplus.com/product/features_dailyip.cfm &quot;

4)  Medscape independently chose the article for a long synopsis, followed by continuing education questions, and concluded, under the pen of Brande Martin, Ph.D. and Désirée Lie, MD, MSEd, Director of Research and Faculty Development, Department of Family Medicine, University of California,Irvine at Orange that 
- Injections with either lidocaine alone or lidocaine with dextrose are more effective than usual care in improving function and reducing pain in young athletes with OSD engaged in sports. 
- Injections with dextrose and lidocaine are more effective than injections with lidocaine alone for improving function and reducing symptoms in adolescent athletes with OSD. (http://www.medscape.org/viewarticle/751311) 

5) Family Practice recertification testing includes a question on the treatment of Osgood-Schlatter disease that recommends dextrose injection as a treatment.   

It is only reasonable to be able to state that dextrose injection is a possible treatment for recalcitrant OSD.  

Is Wikipedia asserting that filtered reviews of individual studies are not worthwhile if they are on line from multiple academic sources, and even if every impartial review results in positive recommendations for use of that treatment for a given condition?  If so, this elevates the opinion of Wikipedia reviewers over the recommendations of multiple independent reviewers, be that via PubMed or on-line reviews.   No one is asking to list the treatment as a must or well established treatment, merely as a possible treatment.    

Hopefully it is clear that this is an important policy issue.

I guessed that this thread is about [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Osgood%E2%80%93Schlatter_disease&amp;oldid=632208092 this stage in the OSd article], where the line &quot;Medical injections to the patellar area such as Hyperosmolar Dextrose injections are effective and safe for treating tendon and cartilage degeneration.[21]&quot; is included and then deleted. I think that this new treatment could be included in the Wiki if it also described certain relevant caveats. For example, the trial was in children, they might have selected those who had earlier treatment failure, omission of the risks of infection, and so on.   () 15:13, 3 November 2014 (UTC)
I think that the spirit of avoiding primary sources is to avoid including information from a primary source that is out on a limb.  () 15:19, 3 November 2014 (UTC)
What Wikipedia prefers generally, and especially in the area of biomedical information, are secondary sources.  I've not seen the term &quot;filtered sources&quot;, so will use &quot;secondary sources&quot;.  The purpose of a secondary source is to survey the primary sources, evaluate them for weight, quality and relevance, and draw a conclusion from them, if possible.  For Wikipedia's purposes, individual primary sources are just about useless except in truly exceptional circumstances, and this doesn't appear to be one of them.  You really need to find a high-quality, independent secondary source that covers this. I think some of the sources you've identified are moving in the direction of the kind of source Wikipedia looks for, but they're not quite there yet.  I think one of the things to keep in mind here is that Wikipedia articles are encyclopedia articles, and are intended to present relatively stable information to the average reader, while the sources you've identified are really of interest to medical practitioners for their daily practice.  If prolotherapy really makes good on its promise, in due time there will be more good-quality evidence and secondary sources, and at that point Wikipedia will pick it up.  By design, Wikipedia doesn't rush to present the leading edge, but rather picks up the rear after things have settled and there's a consensus in the literature.

Speech therapy and Voice therapy

There is a disambiguation page at Voice therapy leading to 1. Voice therapy (transgender) and 2. Speech therapy which in turn redirects to Speech-language pathology. The actual fact is that even for transgenders, the same speech or voice therapy is done by speech-language pathologists. I think these should be merged into Voice therapy. Need inputs. [[User:Diptanshu.D|Diptanshu]] 13:20, 4 November 2014 (UTC)
 The only criteria for judging a merge is the amount of information from reliable sources which exists on a topic. If enough information exists to differentiate voice therapy from speech-language pathology, then two articles can exist. The problem is almost no information in voice therapy associated with a citation, and yet it all seems like it could have come from a published source. I would advise to clean up voice therapy first, deleting contested content without a citation. Then after checking the amount of content that remains, make the merge proposal. Consider also informing  about this, since this is as much of a cultural LGBT issue as it is a health issue. [[User:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ]][[User talk:Bluerasberry|(talk)]] 15:32, 4 November 2014 (UTC)

At a first glance, I think that speech therapy (or voice therapy) and speech–language pathology should be separate, as the first is &quot;treatment&quot; and the second is &quot;the study of&quot; (the field and the career).  I think that speech therapy ought to basically answer this question:  &quot;The doctor just sent my child (or my stroke-affected mother) to speech therapy.  What are they going to do there?&quot;  If we've got that information in the encyclopedia, then I don't know where it is.
I'm not entirely sure how the trans-specific subject differs from Voice training, like a vocal coach for singing, except with a goal of changing the quality of a healthy speaking voice rather than the quality of a healthy singing voice.  It doesn't seem comparable to &quot;my four year old is in speech therapy because he isn't using two-word sentences yet&quot;.   () 15:32, 4 November 2014 (UTC)

 If I were to revise the article, I would delete everything except the two sentences which are followed by citations. The many Wikilinks I might put into a navigational box so that they would not be entirely lost from the article. I think it might only be daunting because you are starting with lots of unbacked claims and few citations. I would advise you to drop the project until and unless you identify sources that you like, because there will not be progress except by starting from reliable sources.

Sequela

I agree it isn't actually much use where it is, or without references, but what it most certainly is not is OR - essentially the contents could pretty much be sourced to any serious discussion of the issue. So your prod was for a bad reason, and I removed it. Calling anything that's unreferenced &quot;OR&quot; is a bad habit too many patrollers have, and tends to get me going. I can't see the earlier version of the article, shot down in flames at  a while ago, but the cuurent Clinical trial has a short section on &quot;Conflicts of interest and unfavorable studies&quot; but doesn't afaics actually spell out why COI is the universally recognized problem that it is. It's also a pity that once again we send a group of new professional/academic editors straight off with a bloody nose.  () 18:34, 3 November 2014 (UTC)
If I may chip in, I really wish we could at least welcome users who are trying to edit in good faith (ie. say hello) before we go about reprimanding them. Although the stub is small, it is not disagreeable, and it is my personal point of view that a lot of trial-related topics have not received the same attention as clinical medicine. Unreferenced doesn't always mean OR and OR doesn't always mean delete. So I think continued interaction with the user and group may be needed. I've welcomed the user and left a note to this regard on her talk page -- () 19:37, 6 November 2014 (UTC)

Electroacupuncture

I know the acupuncture articles have had a lot of recent issues with advocacy, so I was wondering what other medical editors thought about adding this review's coverage of electroacupuncture's efficacy in an animal model of ethanol addiction to relevant articles. I would normally pass over something like this because it's research on animals, but this is the only &quot;treatment&quot; that doesn't involve viral vector gene transfer (using the adeno-associated virus and ΔJunD) which has been shown to reduce nucleus accumbens ΔFosB expression.  That said, is this content worth adding to either electroacupuncture or alcoholism under a research section?  ( | [[Special:WhatLinksHere/User:Seppi333/Maintenance|Maintained]]) 16:46, 9 November 2014 (UTC)





 Figured I should follow up with you since I've finally gotten around to downloading that review you pointed out.  It actually makes stronger statements about ΔFosB in addiction than any previous paper I've read; it's the first review I've seen that calls for using ΔFosB as a therapeutic biomarker of addiction and for using it as a metric for quantifying the addictive potential of drugs.
 ( | [[Special:WhatLinksHere/User:Seppi333/Maintenance|Maintained]]) 16:45, 9 November 2014 (UTC)



per  we shouldn't add content based on animal studies.  The potential importance here is clear, but we have cured rodents of many diseases and found many biomarkers in them too, that never played out.  If/when ΔFosB is validated as a biomarker in humans and is medicine, it would make sense to include something on that as a biomarker. (Note that the review does not say it is a biomarker - rather it says &quot;ΔFosB induction is being considered as a biomarker&quot;)   If/when electroacpuncture is shown via an RCT to be an effective treatment for alcoholism, we should include that.  Right now, the potential is just that and we don't do  here.  That's my view!  () 17:35, 9 November 2014 (UTC)
Fair enough.  I was only asking about the electroacupuncture part - not my reply to The Anome - I pinged him because he wanted me to include content from that review in FOSB ( where this review was discussed).  You have a point about the crystalball though, so I suppose it's best not to add it.This review  covers the current status of evidence for ΔFosB in humans and its consistency with animal models.  That said, the confirmation of model consistency in human cocaine addicts was (I assume) the basis for [http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?hsa05030+2354 KEGG Pathway – human cocaine addiction] and [http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?hsa05031+2354 KEGG Pathway – human amphetamine addiction].  ( | [[Special:WhatLinksHere/User:Seppi333/Maintenance|Maintained]]) 18:51, 9 November 2014 (UTC)

, , , , ,  : thank you for your prompt attention to these articles and students.  That is quite an improvement over performance from the Education Program in years past.  In particular, thank you Adam for the lengthy post [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Km14dv/Alzheimer%27s_disease&amp;oldid=632651884#How_to_add_to_a_featured_article here] at ; regular editors rarely have the time required to do that much typing to train up editors who are unlikely to remain as Wikipedians once their course ends; the time investment is not worth the effort for the one or two sentences that result from editors who then never return to help improve Wikipedia with the knowledge we painstakingly share with them.  However, there is quite a problem with the long information provided to the students by Adam, as they surely have gotten from that post the impression that if they do all that Adam outlines, the result is likely to be substantial content that will stand in the article, and that is not the case, even if they correct the extensive HOWTO and off-topic information that must be removed.   Are one of you willing and able to go over and explain to the students how we decide how much weight to give to an individual topic in an article, how that weight is determined, how they should incorporate the one or two sentences that might be useful from the (wrongly suggested) 250 to 400 word summaries recommended by their instructor, and how that information would fit into the  structure?  The idea that, even if they do all the work you have outlined, that content would stand in the article-- much less in a separate communication section-- is erroneous.  Communication issues are already covered in the article, as appropriate to each section, and given the weight they should be given according to broad overviews of the topic.  This is a mistake we frequently see in student editing:  they want to write a term paper on one aspect of an overview topic, have it take up an entire section, and do that without regard to the information on that topic already in the article, and where that information belongs in the article structure.  It is unfortunate that the students might be scurrying around to follow the instructions you've given them, but I don't see that this will result in more than one or two sentences that might stand in the article, and those sentences will have to be added in the right place by experienced editors.   There is communication information in Characteristics, Management, and other areas as appropriate for a broad overview:  a stand-alone section on Communication will not be helpful, and should not be added to a Featured Article.  If the students can add one or two sentences about communication aspects of AZ to the appropriate sections, using high-quality secondary sources, that would be helpful.

  Thank you for identifying a crucial ommission in my suggestions to the students in this course. I think that examining the state of the current article and identifying where similar claims are made is an important step in the process.

 To , much of this is good advice. I think you should closely read the current article and identify where communications research and difficulties are already covered. You should also take a look at , specifically the writing style section.

 I do feel that our current article could benefit from a nursing perspective.  is very actively involved and if the students are motivated they can certainly produce a valuable improvement to Wikipedia that students, readers and editors can be proud of. At the Wiki Education Foundation we recommend that instructors avoid Good and Featured articles, precisely to avoid the issues which have been raised above. We suggest students start new articles or improve stub/start class articles. But I think that a committed instructor with dedicated students could improve just this sort of article.

 In this specific case, I'm also inclined to beleive that the article would benefit from the nursing perspective--research on the patient response to the disease and nature of care--which result from the same sort of studies and systematic review that we expect in . It does need to be integrated well and presented with quality in the appropriate style, but I think we can be more optimistic and open to the possibility of their success.  () 21:15, 10 November 2014 (UTC)
I agree that the nursing perspective is important, and often overlooked.  We get a lot of 'this drug works slightly better than that drug', but very little 'here is the experience of that the person faces'.  Our articles about things like stroke shouldn't stop after listing the things the physicians do to resolve the acute medical situation; they should include information about what happens to the whole person, from in-hospital therapy to the likelihood of returning to independent living.  When we were running , one of the most consistent requests from readers was information about prognosis.  They aren't very interested in what the ER doc needs to know.  They're interested in things like whether Grandma be able to live at home by herself and what options exist for communicating with someone who can't talk because of a stroke (for example).

the  biggest issue with his work (outside of copyvio for synthesis information) is that he picks syntheses apparently at random and adds them to articles, sometimes with sources, but often without.  There is no indication of whether the particular synthesis he adds is important in any way (e.g. the one used in production, the first one to make the compound and that maybe overcame some difficult hurdle, etc) - just a random synthesis.  And he does this relentlessly, in zillions of articles.  I and others tried many times to talk with him to encourage him to use secondary sources and with them, provide some context as to why the synthesis he wanted to add matters, but he just barreled on.  And that is exactly what he is still doing.  Also creating stub articles on compounds (often following a series, like recently a bunch of dopamine modulators), many of which never became drugs and some of which never entered the clinic, but that are perhaps interesting to medicinal chemists.  Very fierce too - swore that he would keep on editing and switching IP addresses and mocking WP and our efforts to work with him.

GA class criteria

;Problem
GA-class article review for medical articles is arbitrary and secluded. A number of criteria (comprehensiveness, accuracy, verifiability) are unclear with regards to what is &quot;good&quot; and what is not for medical articles. This makes it harder for reviewers and for nominators. 

;Background
This has been an issue of some discussion previously. Previous proposals include proposed criteria by  and a proposal for A-class criteria by . There are, I am sure, many proposals that I haven't mentioned. The general gist of these discussions was:
# The generic GA criteria are hard to interpret for individual nominators. For example, what constitutes &quot;comprehensiveness&quot; in a medical article? Is there a &quot;bright line&quot; for sources, or just a sort of general feeling for nominators?
# The lack of guidance leads to a lot of consternation and unproductive discussion
# There is a lack of medical input into article nominations which may impact their quality and the quality of reviews is variable.
# Because reviewing is secluded, there is no guarantee that the product will have a &quot;comprehensive&quot; scope that is global in nature.
# GA articles have a &quot;GA&quot; tag that is displayed to end users, so it's important that these articles receive quality vetting.

;Proposal
We (1) agree on some standards for GA criteria in medical articles, (2) transclude active medical GA reviews onto an assessment page so that interested users can watchlist it and comment, with an aim to (3) establish a community of GA reviewers, (4) try and get 2+ reviewers to comment on each article, and (5) delimit which articles are &quot;medical&quot; articles fall in this GA scope -- probably anatomy, physiology, pharmacology and clinical medicine articles.

I commend this for discussion. I am going to ping several users:
* Users with experience as nominees of many articles: , . 
* , as he is quite a common reviewer 
* , as he has not only passed several nominations, but interacts regularly with subject experts who may issue peer reviews.  
Apologies to any users not mentioned. -- () 05:47, 13 November 2014 (UTC)

Discussion
I agree with the proposal, but I think participation has to be voluntary. In other words, if someone nominates a &quot;medical&quot; article for GA and another editor passes it, we cannot interfere (unless the pass is truly bad, in which case it goes for GAR). The alternative would involve a lot of arguing.  |  08:31, 13 November 2014 (UTC)
*The proposal seems a move in the right direction, though I agree with JFW above. I'm not sure what &quot;he has not only passed several nominations ...&quot; re me above means, as I've certainly never nominated or reviewed a medical GA (have I?). I have a couple of GA credits on my main account, but I have to say I have generally avoided the GA process for years, preferring DYK and FA. The big problem with it is the single reviewer &amp; the variable interpretation of the instructions, as well set out above, meaning you can't be sure of much about a GA article, except that the refs will be well-formatted and reasonably plentiful. Nor am I really sure what the standard is, or rather where the bottom boundary of the standard is, which makes reviewing difficult. CRUK should be able to provide reviews, probably in-house rather than external for GA, of cancer-related topics, and the intention is to continue this after I leave (which is currently set for a month's time) - the  is intended to be permanent.  It would certainly be good if other collaboration projects could get similar arrangements in place.  () 12:01, 13 November 2014 (UTC)

I used to review GANs regularly until a couple of years ago when they changed the formatting of the  pages.

&quot;1. The generic GA criteria are hard to interpret for individual nominators. For example, what constitutes &quot;comprehensiveness&quot; in a medical article?&quot; I am really not convinced that the  are hard to interpret. They seem to be fairly straightforward. (I have also reviewed a lot of non-medical articles in the past.) By the way, &quot;comprehensiveness&quot; is explicitly not a requirement for GA. It is required for . (GAs should be &quot;broad in coverage&quot;.)

&quot;2. The lack of guidance leads to a lot of consternation and unproductive discussion.&quot; Again, I am not convinced that this is true. I have been involved in a few GA reviews where this has occurred, but given the number of GA reviews going on, I would not call this &quot;a lot of consternation and unproductive discussion&quot;. Perhaps you could point out GA reviews where this has happened?

&quot;3. There is a lack of medical input into article nominations which may impact their quality and the quality of reviews is variable.&quot; While this is true, this is an ongoing issue for every subject area in Wikipedia—not just medical articles or GANs. There aren't enough specialists/experts editing. The way to solve this is by recruiting them, which is difficult to achieve.

&quot;4. Because reviewing is secluded, there is no guarantee that the product will have a &quot;comprehensive&quot; scope that is global in nature.&quot; This is not a result of &quot;secluded&quot; review, but rather because a single reviewer who may not have expertise in the subject area is assessing an article that is usually written by one editor who also may not have expertise in the subject area. (As I mentioned above, &quot;comprehensive scope&quot; is not a requirement for GA status.)

&quot;5. GA articles have a &quot;GA&quot; tag that is displayed to end users, so it's important that these articles receive quality vetting.&quot; That's the purpose of the GA reviewer. You seem to be implying that deficient articles are being passed because the reviewer lacks expertise in the area. Do you have evidence of this?

&quot;(1) agree on some standards for GA criteria in medical articles.&quot; I see no need for a specific subset of guidelines for medical articles. LT910001 has provided no evidence for this requirement.

&quot;(2) transclude active medical GA reviews onto an assessment page so that interested users can watchlist it and comment.&quot; Meh, I suppose that some people might find it useful, but I don't really have an opinion on this point.

&quot;(3) establish a community of GA reviewers, (4) try and get 2+ reviewers to comment on each article.&quot; If you're struggling to get a GAN reviewed by even one WikiProject Medicine editor, you're not going to get &quot;2+ reviewers&quot; to comment.

TL,DR: LT910001 does not provide any evidence of the existence of these perceived problems. Even if these problems existed, the proposed solution is unworkable. [[User:Axl|Axl]] ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 12:59, 13 November 2014 (UTC)
*I am not enthusiastic about doing this because I am not sure the current ratings system is sustainable. It was oddly designed anyway, with rankings going from stub, start, C, B, GA, to F, with only one WikiProject having another rating for A. This entire system hardly makes sense to Wikipedians and is a complete barrier to any outsider. In health, it can take 30 minutes to make a stub, an hour for a start article, 2 hours for a C article, 5-10 hours for a B article, 100 for a GA, and 120 for an FA. In many cases, hundreds of hours of volunteer time do not put an article past B rating, and I do not think our current rating system appreciates the vast difference between B and the undefined GA standards. I am not sure if it is worth having this discussion in the context of developing the existing system, and I am not sure of the work specifications we have to design a ratings system to meet our community's needs.

*I think that the general criteria are adequate. Although, I think that the GA process is weak, because it is possible for a nominator to write about a topic that includes complex science that is new to him or her and for the one reviewer to be blind to the problems in the article and both fail to co-opt assistance. I suspect that something else is wrong if nominators and reviews are puzzled about what the GA criteria mean to the article that they are working on. I have heard a few editors say that medical articles are harder to write than hobby articles. Why are medical article more difficult to write? We could talk about how to write a good medical article instead of how to review a medical article.   () 22:01, 13 November 2014 (UTC)
*My thoughts on the proposal:
*# It doesn't matter if &quot;we&quot; agree on some standards for GA criteria in medical articles, because &quot;we&quot; don't set the .  GA has had enough trouble with people making up criteria (like &quot;no dead links&quot;), and an effort to do this by yet another WikiProject will not be favorably received. 
*# You could transclude active medical GA reviews onto an assessment page so that interested users can watchlist it and comment, except that the only thing they would see is that article X was added or removed.  The page history on the page they're watching wouldn't show any of the changes to the actual discussion pages.
* Overall, I think that it would be more effective to go back to a previous approach, which is for nominators and/or reviewers to leave a note here when they nominate and/or start reviewing an article.   () 00:23, 14 November 2014 (UTC)
Why is that a previous approach? Surely, nominators and reviewers can currently alert WP Med that an article has been nominated for GA. They can also ask WP Med for assistance with specific medical topics that they may be struggling with.  () 11:03, 14 November 2014 (UTC)
It's a &quot;previous approach&quot; because we seem to have stopped doing it.  There was never any decision to start doing it or to stop, but almost no one has posted notices or requests for help for months.   () 17:15, 14 November 2014 (UTC)

What to do when the data is all fairly new?

Consider StomaphyX as it was , and now. Obviously it was all a bit of a promotional mess, and I think I fixed that. However, I don't know if I really did what you all would have in mind with the sources. As a relatively new (and apparently not very successful) therapy, there weren't very many large reviews. I removed claims that were unsourced, premature, or not supported by what evidence I could find. I preferred recent papers as it seemed to be emerging that the success rate over the long term was unremarkable. For example, one study stopped enrolling patients after they failed to hit their efficacy targets in half the non-sham group.

Another learning experience for me. Is the end result acceptable from a MEDRS standpoint, or should even more claims be removed? Cheers,  () 02:50, 16 November 2014 (UTC)

 I think your edits are a tremendous improvement, thank you!  This is a tough one, there's a sizeable gap between the relatively low bar WP sets for notability in general, and therefore you can write an article on it, and what  is looking for to make assertions of biomedical effects.  I think you've done what you could, but I think you should go a bit further and in the cases where there isn't a solid secondary source, attribute in the article text to the source, like &quot;A study of 27 patients found...&quot;, to make the quality of the evidence base even more clear.

Mustard plaster

Besides having some sourcing problems, this seems to be giving a lot of medical advice.  () 09:14, 9 November 2014 (UTC)
I stubbed it back to one sentence describing it as a folk home remedy. Sydney Poore/ 02:49, 10 November 2014 (UTC)

 has this to say about it:

quotation|1=Transdermal delivery of medications was foreshadowed in earlier eras by the use of certain plasters and ointments. The mustard plaster, applied as a home remedy for severe chest congestion, may be considered an example....Powdered mustard seed (Brassica nigra) was mixed with warm water, and the resulting paste was spread on a strip of flannel, which was applied to the patient’s chest with a cloth binding wrapped around the body to hold the plaster in place. The moisture and body warmth activated an enzyme (myrosin) in the mustard that hydrolyzed a glycoside (sinigrin), causing the release of the pungent active ingredient allyl isothio-cyanate (CH2=CHCH2NCS) (7). This substance possesses the qualifications listed above for transdermal absorption.

It is a low molecular weight liquid (90 Da), lipophilic, and effective at low dosage. The flannel served as an impermeable backing and the mustard paste was the reservoir. Continuous enzymatic action released the active substance over a period of hours, until the plaster was removed. Commercially manufactured mustard plasters were sold at pharmacies.

The history of plasters has been traced back to antiquity. In addition to mustard plasters, several other plasters were recognized in early 20th century editions of the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) and National Formulary (NF).

(Most of the rest of the article is about modern transdermal treatments and is not at all relevant.)  I don't have time to add anything today, but perhaps someone else would like to have a go at it.   () 03:44, 10 November 2014 (UTC)

I don't believe that we've ever held an RFC on this subject before, and I oppose adding that level of bureaucracy to the process now.  Generally, someone asks a question, reads the answers, and does his best.  We have been blessed to have remarkably few disputes on this subject (whether people are adding or removing tags), and I don't expect that to change.  If you want to change the text at WP:MED?, then the hard part is getting someone to write down a suggested replacement text.   () 17:09, 16 November 2014 (UTC)
I am inclined to take heed of 's Wiki intuition not to start a formal vote on WP Med banners. With practical support from erudite editors, I have successfully planned and completed much bigger batches of edits than the few hundred on WP Med banners, but I do not recall such a indecisive discussion as that on WP Med banners on anatomy articles before. I find this particularly odd here, as I would have thought that my proposed task and the issues that I have raised are relatively simple. I looked at &quot;&quot; and I asked for clarification about how much medical content in an anatomy article is needed for the article to be included in WP Med. I have not succeeded in clarifying this point, so I will opt not to work on WP Med banners on anatomy articles as batch-editing task at this juncture. On the other hand, some clarity has settled on the discussion on WP Med banners on named hospitals, and I anticipate that I will do a that batch sometime later this week pending any last-minute show stoppers.

Mentored editing, likely medicine-focused

Hello, I come to you for guidance on a modest project to encourage faculty and young physicians-in-training to edit WP. I have worked and taught in a medical school for a couple of decades, and witnessed the growing importance of WP as a starting place for learning about medical topics - illustrated nicely by the recent piece in the New York Times on Ebola content (and Doc James). Our faculty and students often read WP without really understanding or contributing (I see those two as linked; I have some WP editing experience).
Audience: I anticipate mostly students - dozens at most - and a few faculty will probably sit in and I hope they'll become contributors as well.
Context: I will launch this during an immunology course for first-year students, though others will probably sit in.
Structure: I intend to conduct some didactic sessions on editing WP, highlighting the 5 pillars, risks (like meatpuppetry in an academic environment) and ways to avoid them, and the importance of sourcing especially MEDRS for medical content. 
I will encourage participants to take small steps (cognizant of educational projects that have foundered due to overly-ambitious goals); this will not be for credit so there will be no pressure on the editors, and I will hold frequent &quot;office hours&quot; when I will be available to help mentor.
Appeal: I invite links to useful resources to help an audience get started with the best footing.
First and foremost, I want to encourage our students and faculty to take WP seriously and consider its value. I have asked our library to consider more actively engaging with WP and consider it as a resource under their umbrella, and have received encouragement from academic leaders here (but I do not speak with the school's voice here - I am acting alone). WP is an important resource for medical knowledge; it still has a ways to go before it will be highly accurate, but that is an achievable goal.
With appreciation for your work on WP medical content, and for any guidance you might offer, sincerely,
Stuart Ray, M.D.  () 15:23, 15 November 2014 (UTC)
*I do know that the  is a great resource, and many useful pages are linked there. Also, I would appreciate any particularly-useful welcome templates for medical editors.  () 15:41, 15 November 2014 (UTC)
*I also see the  above and have seen other educational projects go awry here; this is one reason why I am not putting any pressure on anyone to edit; my hope is that their editing will be driven by altruism and curiosity rather than more selfish motives that lead to disruptive editing. If we just get a few more editors, and improve awareness in a few others, that'll be enough.  () 15:47, 15 November 2014 (UTC)

I see that the section above was made with a user name that was created today. In order to help editors pitch replies, I think that it would be useful to know a little more about User Soupvector's WP editing experience, and if any other user names are relevant?  () 15:56, 15 November 2014 (UTC)
*That's a fair question. I am an experienced editor who would rather keep his other persona anonymous. I have notified a sysop of my alternative accounts and they approved, providing some guidance to avoid disruptive use.  () 16:01, 15 November 2014 (UTC)
**Is &quot;alternative accounts&quot; intentionally in the pleural? Out of curiosity, what guidance did a sysop give you and what did they approve?  () 16:08, 15 November 2014 (UTC)
Yes, the plural is intentional as it is in our  - 1 original + 1 new one = 2 alternative accounts. I was told, &quot;As long as they work on completely separate stuff and do not support each other in discussions you should be fine.&quot; I intend to use this new account very little - only in this mentoring role. I did this (created a personally-identified account) to make myself accountable and reassure the community that I take responsibility for these users' initial actions. I also needed an account that I could use visibly during demonstrations and training on-campus that would not compromise the anonymity of my other account.  () 16:16, 15 November 2014 (UTC)
 See , which says; &quot;It is recommended that multiple accounts be identified as such on their user pages; templates such as  or one of a selection of user boxes may be used for this purpose.&quot; Is this relevant to you?  () 16:34, 15 November 2014 (UTC)
That is just a recommendation (not a requirement), I cleared this with a sysop in advance, and linking the accounts would defeat the purpose in this case. Would you object to moving this discussion to my Talk page, since this is really off-topic on WPMED? I would also like to point out that my motivations are quite above-board, I am under the impression that the project could use more editors, and I feel as if I am being harassed unnecessarily. I would appreciate it if you'd give me the benefit of the doubt and focus on project goals. If I disrupt, there are mechanisms to deal with that.  () 16:42, 15 November 2014 (UTC)
I hope no one minds if I copied this sub-section to my Talk page to continue  if needed.  () 17:01, 15 November 2014 (UTC) (collapse box was removed by Snowman, so this is unnecessary)

 I deeply appreciate this reply but the user link you provided (Ian) seems to be a redlink - could you check? I do think what I'm planning is a little different and perhaps less risky because I'm promoting WP editing in a school of medicine rather than making classroom assignments or otherwise coercing editors; while the latter term may seem too strong, I think some of the problems we've witnessed may be attributable to educational pressure to edit rather than education regarding the value of the project and cultural valuation of WP as a resource with global benefits. I hope that having a professor endorse WP more publicly will encourage broader/deeper understanding and support.   () 18:52, 16 November 2014 (UTC)
Thanks for mention of the Education Program, which led me to  and then , which is particularly germane. These are great resources.  () 19:50, 16 November 2014 (UTC)
 His account is . Classroom outreach is not the only model, and part of the resources they make available is some group tracking interfaces. In New York some students at Mount Sinai started a Wikipedia club totally outside of their classes, for example, and over the past six months I think they have had 7 meetings for fun. At all meetings people contribute to Wikipedia. , and despite it being designed for compulsory tracking of assignments, in their case it helps them communicate with each other and watch each other's work. For a small group which intends to work together even outside the classroom I think this software has some use. Even if the software is not right for your situation, some of the training materials for classes might be.

question about controversies over interpretations of clinical trials

What do you all think of sections like Ezetimibe#Clinical_trial_controversy and Valsartan#Myocardial_infarction_controversy?  These seem somewhat tempest in a teapot in some ways (perhaps written to counter media hype or something) but there also seems to be (or have been) scientific/medical questions that were truly ambiguous and thus debatable.  Both of those sections I linked to, have to do with underlying conditions that are complex and hard to manage in any case (esp the valsartan one).   Where do sections like this fit per MEDMOS?  How should we handle topics like this?   thanks.  () 17:56, 9 November 2014 (UTC)

Perhaps not topical, but what I find as a major deficit of both sections is a lack of consistent clarity as to what treatment the drug is being compared to. Placebo or SOC? Otherwise seems OK.  () 20:42, 9 November 2014 (UTC)

 The information in &quot;Ezetimibe&quot; is far too detailed for a general encyclopedia. It needs to be drastically cut down. Even the quantity of text in &quot;Valsartan&quot; is too much. Detailed descriptions of outcomes from individual trials should be avoided. [[User:Axl|Axl]] ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 11:03, 10 November 2014 (UTC)

 &quot;what I find as a major deficit of both sections is a lack of consistent clarity as to what treatment the drug is being compared to. Placebo or SOC?&quot; I don't think that Wikipedia should be including that information in its text. Wikipedia should just be summarizing the conclusions of the relevant secondary sources. If a reader wants to check such detailed information, they can go to the source. [[User:Axl|Axl]] ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 11:06, 10 November 2014 (UTC)
Hey Axl.  I think that if you are going to say that treatment X increases or decreases an AE, you have to say with respect to what.  In the diabetes area, for example, you start getting confusion with statements such as &quot;metformin is the only diabetes treatment shown to reduced CV events&quot;. The problem is that it reduced them compared to treatment with sulfonylureas as a comparator, and sulfonylureas increase CV events compared to placebo.  So it may well be that metformin has only a neutral effect on CV events compared to non-treatment, or it could even increase them.  () 11:22, 10 November 2014 (UTC)
I agree that details of trials, and arguments over trial design, don't belong in articles on the conditions, but I don't see that they are unencyclopedic in articles on the drugs (or the trials themselves), where the issues have been widely discussed and are well presented here. Of course this is a tricky area to edit, where subject understanding is key.   () 12:06, 10 November 2014 (UTC)

 &quot;In the diabetes area, for example, you start getting confusion with statements such as &quot;metformin is the only diabetes treatment shown to reduced CV events&quot;.&quot; If that is what reliable secondary sources say about metformin, then that is what Wikipedia's article should say. (If some sources say that, while others say that the interpretation is too simplistic, then the evidence needs to be judged on a case-by-case basis.) [[User:Axl|Axl]] ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 13:33, 10 November 2014 (UTC)
That is the problem exactly: Reliable sources state &quot;reduced with respect to sulfonamides&quot; which becomes a Wikipedia statement that CV events are &quot;reduced&quot;.  I really can't imagine a high quality MEDRS compliant source making a statement that an outcome or AE was reduced or increased without stating the reference treatment regimen.  Its like saying &quot;The moon is bigger.&quot;, a completely meaningless statement unless a reference object is provided.

*I am not sure how these should be handled but I have never had fun trying to manage this kind of information. The subject matter is difficult even for experts in the field. Sources are confusing and it is often difficult to find the appropriate ones.
If I were going to commit to improve the Ezetimibe article and I thought the content in that controversy section were good enough, I would fork that section into its own article so that I would not be deleting the content but so that I could prevent the main article from having  attention on the information which is less important to an overview of the drug. For the Valsartan there is not much information in the controversy section, so it cannot be forked, yet this is not the kind of information which ought to be in a controversy section. I think that I would opt to leave it there and ignore it until the rest of the article were more developed.
I regret that I do not have better ideas for the short term. [[User:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ]][[User talk:Bluerasberry|(talk)]] 15:10, 10 November 2014 (UTC)
As so often, half the problem is the use of &quot;controversy&quot; itself in the headers - I doubt either of these really deserve it. &quot;Interpretation of clinical trial results&quot; or something would be better. Both sections seem to me (without being at all familiar with this area) not to be obviously undue, but are certainly remarkably badly written, in places terminally unclear.  () 17:20, 10 November 2014 (UTC)

thanks everybody for your thoughts... i haven't seen anybody respond to the question of where that content should go in MEDMOS.  some kind of subsection under Medical use, or down in society&amp;culture controversies....?  or its own funky little section like we have now?   () 17:55, 10 November 2014 (UTC)
It should go in the research section, which is close to the bottom. [[User:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ]][[User talk:Bluerasberry|(talk)]] 18:02, 10 November 2014 (UTC)
I think &quot;research&quot; should be forward-looking, where this is mostly raking over past trials and their interpretation. Where it is a big issue it should be its own section, perhaps after &quot;history&quot;.  Short bits could go in history in some cases. The initial comment didn't mention that at Ezetimibe trial &quot;controversy&quot; matters are the bulk of the lead also.  () 01:01, 11 November 2014 (UTC)
Agree with Formerly 98, that's probably the biggest problem. And agree with Johnbod, research is the wrong section. The sections on controversies can go anywhere as a heading on the same level as the ones suggested in Medmos, because a section of that kind does not fit under any of the topics suggested. The all caps used in the names of the clinical trials shouldn't be copied in Wikipedia. ENHANCE, IMPROVE-IT, CHARM - what's to stop the pharmaceutical industry from calling their studies THEBEST or SOEFFECTIVE and get it added in Wikipedia. --   15:01, 11 November 2014 (UTC)

Paid editing
What do people think of this edit [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Transcranial_magnetic_stimulation&amp;curid=98093&amp;diff=633669770&amp;oldid=633482028] by this user  [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 00:51, 14 November 2014 (UTC)

It seems like the edit was made in good faith and was somewhat constructive, and my main concern would be that they are using the FDA guidelines in place of more MEDRS compliant sources. Also interesting is the website's claim that they work &quot;with Wikipedia’s top administrators&quot;. Who exactly does this mean, I wonder?   01:13, 14 November 2014 (UTC)
NO.  They were warned eight months ago that their user name is in violation of our user name policy. They are violating our Terms of Use (it is very likely run by employees of IMS, editing for pay, on behalf of clients).  I do not mind COI editing the presence of editors with a COI when it is done according to they follow our policy and guidelines. This account is not a happy occurrence..  Am debating - ANI and get that account blocked already, or perhaps bring to SPI (to have IP addresses checked).  Am very very unhappy about this.  Aggressive and incompetent and not talking back on their Talk page is a nasty mix.   () 01:34, 14 November 2014 (UTC) (edit my comment to clarify  () 11:09, 14 November 2014 (UTC))
Yes we need greater transparency here. Who exactly is paying them? Who are these &quot;top admins&quot;? Who do they work for? One however of course cannot request any of this information but lots of concerns. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 02:34, 14 November 2014 (UTC)
actually under the Terms of Use, they must disclose their employer, their client, and their affiliation.  See the first section in  which is  to save you scrolling.   () 11:40, 14 November 2014 (UTC)
I'm personally of the opinion that the WMF can enforce their TOS if they want - wikipedia policy encourages disclosure of COI but does not require it -  the community doesn't need to be involved in what is essentially a legal agreement between a user and the WMF, given that over and over again the EnWikipedia community has explicitly said that we are not interested in mandated COI disclosures. Frankly, this kind of discussion is exactly why disclosure rules are a problem - it's a huge distraction. If the edit is low quality (it seems well-referenced, though I'd need to verify that the references support the conclusions, and it's not overly effusive about the technique), revert it. If only parts of it are inaccurate, manually revert those parts. Honestly, just looking at it, it's not obvious what's wrong with their edits, but apparently they are &quot;terrible&quot;? Is this a fringe view? Did they completely misrepresent the sources? Instead we're all caught up in whether or not they have a COI. [[User:0x0077BE|0x0077BE]] ( · ) 12:55, 14 November 2014 (UTC)
What you write  about COI disclosure is dead wrong.  There is a legal context here; WMF owns Wikipedia and sets the Terms of Use that you and every editor agree to every time you use Wikipedia.   By using Wikipedia all of us agree to abide by WP's Terms, policies, and guidelines, which include the obligation to disclose &quot;paid editing&quot; - a specific kind of COI.  It is true that every editor and admin can choose or not to abide by and enforce them, but when they do, they put their editing privileges at risk.  With regard to other aspects of the COI guideline (such as not directly editing articles), it is true that they are only guidelines but they have a very strong  and broad core of support. In my view, the COI guideline has never been promoted to policy because there are some specific aspects (like whether or not to completely ban paid editing) that are so emotional/divisive that discussions about them implode and go nowhere.  But what is actually in the guideline has strong consensus.  As to the question about the specific edit, they blew off  in structure and content and some of the sourcing was not  compliant.  () 14:34, 14 November 2014 (UTC)
The Wikipedia community sets its own policies independent of the WMF, and there is no Wikipedia policy that bans paid editing. Our choice of what policies to enforce and how is our own decision, and there has never been a consensus to ban COI or paid editing here. I don't disagree that the WMF can choose how to enforce the TOS, but there's nothing in the TOS that says that we, the community, are under any obligation to do that work for them. Note also that the TOS includes a provision to allow the community to supercede the paid disclosure policy on an individual project. Obviously we have a guideline and not a policy, so as far as I can tell the TOS still require COI disclosure, but again, they certainly don't require us to act to enforce their rules. Disclosure of paid editing may be a legal requirement of using Wikipedia (unless an alternative COI policy is adopted), but banning or otherwise stopping undisclosed COI editing is definitely not required of Wikipedia editors or admins. Either way, the COI is completely beside the point. If it's not MEDRS compliant and they are making low-quality and disruptive edits, it doesn't matter if they are being paid. SPAs in general are a complete nuisance, whether they are doing it for ideological reasons, for fun or for profit. [[User:0x0077BE|0x0077BE]] ( · ) 14:48, 14 November 2014 (UTC)
neither I nor anyone here is talking banning paid editing, so i don't know what you are talking about. you don't get it.  oh well.  () 14:56, 14 November 2014 (UTC)

(ec) It's a rather subtle sort of 'terrible', to be fair—though arguably, this is the worst kind of problematic editing because it can be harder to pick up.  Certain material is re-arranged to change the emphasis and tone of the article, certain negative statements are quietly reduced in prominence or silently deleted.
Paid editing through an intermediary (as we're seeing here) is potentially particularly problematic, because it can allow for 'identity-washing'—a drug or device manufacturer enjoys the benefits of having a Wikipedia article oh-so-slightly slanted in a preferred direction, without the accountability for their own conflict of interest.  (This editor is already being coy about the corporate interests who are guiding or encouraging the editing on this article: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Transcranial_magnetic_stimulation&amp;diff=631597613&amp;oldid=631569967].)  There's no disincentive for a company to 'test the boundaries' of Wikipedia's sourcing and NPOV requirements; any reputational damage sticks to IMS Health, rather than the product manufacturer.
This editor's failure to read and follow basic policies – like the ban on 'role' accounts – when they have been repeatedly pointed out is also not a good sign.  They insist that their edits have received the approval of their (in-house, not-well-described, anonymous) medical and legal(!) teams [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Transcranial_magnetic_stimulation&amp;diff=631507457&amp;oldid=611064077], but they can't be bothered to understand Wikipedia's rules.  Wikipedia is a tool for them to distribute their message.
Overall, it's a bad pattern of behavior and attitude that we should be coming down on very hard before it gets established as an accepted norm. () 15:58, 14 November 2014 (UTC)
 amen, brother/sister, to your last two paragraphs.  () 16:10, 14 November 2014 (UTC)
* I agree with the sentiment, but I just think it applies generally whether the person is being paid or not, which is why I think the discussion of COIs is irrelevant. The fact that they are violating the terms of service is more or less irrelevant to Wikipedia policy or the content they added. The fact that it's low-quality (I agree that it's a subtle kind of terrible, so without looking into it further, I can't say for sure, but there's certainly circumstantial evidence that it's unlikely to be high-quality and in compliance with policies and guidelines) is, however, not irrelevant. If they're consistently flouting the rules, we should bring it to AN/I. [[User:0x0077BE|0x0077BE]] ( · ) 16:31, 14 November 2014 (UTC)
The edit adds, I assume correctly, numerous FDA rulings allowing use, and adds favourable studies, removing earlier unfavourable ones. I know nothing about the subject &amp; haven't probed in detail but this potentially looks like taking a rather out of date article, and updating for FDA etc - which is fine- plus either giving a full marketing whitewash, or reflecting fairly more recent studies, or something in between.  Do other sources trust the more recent favourable paper, or is it one of the many dubious company-sponsored studies that are muttered about? I don't know. There is a case, in the absence of someone able and willing to produce an up to date and balanced article, for leaving all the new edits, but adding back all the negative stuff removed too.  () 16:51, 14 November 2014 (UTC)

With regard to the specifics of this particular edit.
* Under the lede, the Paid Editing version states that the methodolgy has been approved by the FDA for certain indications. This is not our usual way of expressing efficacy, but it it is properly cited. The prior version (which is the current version post jytdog's reversion) states only that it is an experimental procedure. My conclusion is that while the Paid Editing version was not ideal, it does give our readers more complete information than the version is replaced.
* The next change comes under the section &quot;Treatment&quot;
* The cited source (a 2014 meta analysis) states in a rather technical way that there is Level A evidence that HF-TMS is efficacious for pain and depression; and that there is Level B evidence that LF-TMS is efficacious for  depression, and chronic motor stroke; and that HF-TMS is efficacious for negative symptoms of schizophrenia.  
* This is accurately reflected in the Paid Edit, but the prior/current version incorrectly characterizes this same source as saying TMS has &quot;generally shown only modest effects with little confirmation of results&quot;
* The next change is also in &quot;Treatment&quot; and deals with psychiatric treatment using TMS
* The old/current version states very narrowly that &quot;However, reviews have stated that rTMS appeared to be effective in the treatment of certain types of major depression under certain specific conditions&quot;  It then goes on to unfavorably compare the efficacy of TMS to ECT.  While I don't have access to all the cited papers, the abstracts of the 10 or more cited papers are all much more positive than this with the exception of an older review (2008)that states that evidence for efficacy is not complete yet.  None of them seem to say anything about &quot;certain types of depression under certain conditions&quot;.  And the emphasis on the inferiority to ECT seems overdone to me, as ECT is a much more invasive procedure.
* The Paid Editing version adds a citation of a 2010 APA Practice guideline as stating that &quot;for patients whose symptoms have not responded adequately to medication…transcranial magnetic stimulation could also be considered&quot; without mentioning that the summary in that document largely seems to call the evidence for efficacy equivocal (Though in Paid Editor's defense, that analysis is probably based only on the data avaialable 5 years ago). It also quotes the Australian guidelines, stating that this organization has &quot;endorsed&quot; the procedure, without mentioning that the actually wording in the document is even more favorable: &quot;compelling&quot;. I did not have access to the other cited refs.
*The next change is under &quot;Risks&quot; and does not change the overall conclusions - that there is a low risk of seizure
* 2 or 3 side effects were deleted by the Paid Editor, but these were speculative and / or discounted in the source document and in my opinion did not really belong in the article anyway.  The proof of these fell well below case reports, which we do not accept as medical evidence.
* Under &quot;Depression&quot; the Paid Editor deleted reference to a 2007 FDA Advisory Committee meeting in which the Committee concluded there was not adequate evidence for efficacy. The FDA approved the device 7 years later based on new data, so I'm not really sure what having the 2007 rejection in the article added.  I would have taken it out also..
* Under &quot;Commercial Health Insurance&quot; the Paid Editor added a favorable AHRQ review.  I don't know how relevant this is to the topic of health insurance coverage.  On first glance it looks like they removed some negative info, but it was kept and merged into another pargraph.
 Overall, while many are very unhappy with the process by which this edit was made, I think it is more accurate and more complete than the version it replaced.  I'm inclined to revert the article back to the Paid Editor version, especially based on what I feel is a degree of mischaracterization of the contents of some of the cited references in the previous version. I think we owe it to our readers to put the accuracy of our health articles ahead of our dissatisfaction with the process by which the edit occurred.  Nonetheless, I will await detailed feedback from others about the actual content of the edits.  () 05:29, 16 November 2014 (UTC)
I have been traveling and have not had an opportunity to look at the changes in detail. The issue I had with their requested change on the talk page was that it was not very clear what they were requesting. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 06:25, 16 November 2014 (UTC)

 your points are well taken (as are those of other editors who have said we should deal with the proposal on its merits, as well as where it came from.  i've been meaning to go through their edits in detail and just did so.  heck that article has been on my to-do list for a long time.  I just worked on the diagnosis and treatment parts.  Everything else including the lead needs more attention, and we need to write a mechanism section in plain english.  i won't think about the lead til we have re-written it...  () 07:27, 16 November 2014 (UTC)
I agree with the emphasis of content and sourcing, but we also remove edits made by users who flout WP policy, and it's been noted above that this role-based account appears to flout relevant policy and community norms. If it's found that this user's editing is in violation of policy, then their edits should be subject to summary removal; we should try to retain aspects that are content improvements as  has helpfully highlighted.  --  () 16:04, 16 November 2014 (UTC)
I think this is all going in a very useful direction, so a tip of my hat to everyone involved, but I will say that it is not my experience that we remove otherwise constructive edits from non-compliant users. Generally the relevant parties are just given a temporary ban if they refuse to comply with policy, and an indefinite ban if they continue to flout policy. I think the right thing to do here is to do exactly what  and  are doing, which is going through their edits and seeing what use can be made of them. I also think that it's almost certainly time to bring them to  for violations of the username policy. [[User:0x0077BE|0x0077BE]] ( · ) 16:43, 16 November 2014 (UTC)
I really don't want to put myself in a position where I am perceived as an advocate for this editor. But in all fairness:
* The edits were posted to the Talk page of the article in question a full 2 weeks before they were added to the article.  Except for Doc James, who was traveling and unable to answer in depth, no one challenged the edits or even commented on them. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Transcranial_magnetic_stimulation#Corrections_based_on_FDA_Wikipedia_guidelines 
* They have stated that they have requested a name change and so are now actively seeking to be in compliance.  Overall, it seems to me that the  presence of this editor raises important policy questions, but I'm not seeing the evidence that said Paid Editor is a scofflaw.  What I see is a lack of understanding of our rules and culture.
On a separate note, like it or not, people use our articles to make healthcare decisions.  I feel very strongly that disciplining rogue editors (if that is the situation we have here) is completely and totally secondary to providing the most accurate information we can provide.  JMHO.   () 16:56, 16 November 2014 (UTC)
I agree with Ox0077BE:  Last I checked, &quot;summary removal&quot; applied only to formally ned editors, and even then, if the edits were improvements, then removal is often strongly contested.  , and this editor even appears to have tried to follow one of the recommended processes.  It's not the new editor's fault that the talk page messages were nearly ignored for two weeks.  (Isn't waiting two weeks, and then proceeding if there are no substantive objections, exactly what some of the COI pages recommend?)  IMO, it's readers first, and having wrong information on the page for reasons like &quot;the editor didn't have the correct style of username&quot; is not putting readers first.   () 17:05, 16 November 2014 (UTC)
 and  from my perspective this is getting silly.  We always want best process we can reasonably attain, and we want the best content we can reasonably attain.  And we deal in specifics.   In this specific case, there are high level issues - namely IMS has launched a program to &quot;fix&quot; Wikipedia articles for pay (that is two layers of paid editing)  yet has no idea at all about how Wikipedia actually works;  the issues there are long term, multiple, and serious -- and there were issues specific to their proposed edits that were problematic, which you can see unfolding on the Talk page of the article. (and no there is nothing in the COI guideline that says a paid editor can go ahead and make edits like this;  they can make small noncontroversial factual corrections)  And the edit was revertable on the merits.  Yes the article was and still is pretty bad.  But I am struggling with what i see is abstract, hand-wavy, high-horsing from the two of you.   I am getting my hands dirty and engaging with them to see if this nascent program can be redirected into something that can help us and am working to improve the article.  () 17:38, 16 November 2014 (UTC)
I don't think anybody is &quot;high horsing&quot; and my comments were not primarily directed at you so much as emphasizing that we put accuracy first, which I was not sure eveyone agreed with based on some of the comments above. On a minor note, the summary revert did restore some inaccurate information as I in the line by line assessment above, and I disagree with your decision to revert the edit before reading it in enough detail to make a line by line decision on what to keep based on merits.  But this is only a minor disagreement among friends, and is not intended to detract from my great respect for your efforts here.  () 18:05, 16 November 2014 (UTC)
The guideline at  is not the only &quot;page&quot; about conflicts of interest, and I was referring to the simplified essays that are often promoted to conflicted editors.  I spent a lot of time at COIN a couple of years ago.  While things have probably changed since then (the WMF had not required disclosure under the Terms of Use at that time), it was common to tell conflicted editors to post a note on the talk page, to wait two weeks, and then proceed (optionally notifying COIN in the meantime, depending on the preference of the person giving the advice).   () 20:00, 17 November 2014 (UTC)

 quick note. I've been emailing with the head of the group at IMS, and he said they are going to take down the &quot;WikiCorrect&quot; program website until they learn how Wikipedia actually works.  It seems they want to be good citizens but really had no idea what they were doing.  They did, by the way, finally make a request to change their username but it was unfortunately to something as bad.  I  am trying to educate them (harsh as i may be sometimes).   if (and it is a big if) they get on board with WP's mission and come to understand our policies and guidelines, they could be a useful presence.  i would suggest not dropping any hammers just yet.

 asked me to comment here because I regularly have to decide whether user names breach our policies before I [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=block&amp;user=Jimfbleak&amp;page=&amp;year=&amp;month=-1&amp;tagfilter=&amp;hide_patrol_log=1&amp;hide_review_log=1&amp;hide_thanks_log=1 indefinitely block] the account. Basically, user names that are the same as a company or product are not permitted, the one exception being names like &quot;Jane from BP&quot; if she is not actually promoting BP (although this is uncommon). Here, the name represents a product and is indicated as such on the company website. The user account must be blocked, irrespective of the edits made. The only real decision is whether to allow the creation of a new account or have a full block. There seems to be enough of an assumption of good faith to allow a new account.
I've deleted the user page which is a clear breach of our policies in that it's promoting a product. I've also soft-blocked the account since the name is also a clear breach of our username policies. If you think I've got it wrong and it should be a hard block, with no new name permitted, let me know
I can't see how the user name or the content of the user page can possibly be justified under our guideline, but I make no comment on the edits from the account because that seems to be a matter under active discussion above [[User:Jimfbleak|Jimfbleak]] - [[User talk:Jimfbleak|talk to me?]] 07:03, 17 November 2014 (UTC)
To . Thank you for advancing the discussion on the general topic of user names, and I also appreciate your clarity of thought here and at .  May I say that I think that you have made a good choices in blocking the user account, deleting the user page, and leaving a route for the user to choose a different user name. Nevertheless, in case there is any confusion about what a soft block and a hard block are, could you explain a bit about these options with a reply pitched at new users and non-admins please. Like your comment, my comment is only about user names and not about User WikiCorrect-Health's content-creating edits.  () 11:26, 17 November 2014 (UTC)
As I understand it, Paid Editor had already applied to change the name of the account, had taken down the webpage describing the service in response to criticism from Wikipedia editors, and had not used the account since complaints were made. Given that they had already applied to change the name of the account, this seems like a negative response to a good faith effort to get into compliance, and its hard for me to understand what it accomplishes.    () 11:56, 17 November 2014 (UTC)
, if the user has already applied to create a new account, that's good. The soft block doesn't affect that. The old user name has to be blocked under our policies. If you think that companies and products should be acceptable as user names, then you will need to get that policy changed. The page I deleted was the user page on Wikipedia, which was clearly promoting the product. What is happening on an external website is nothing to do with my actions, but we don't allow advertising on Wikipedia user pages or elsewhere. If you disagree with that, again you will need to get the policy changed. If you think that the content I deleted from the user page was not promotional, then you can request its restoration. Since the text includes company first person spam like We work with hospitals, universities and healthcare companies to obtain referenceable, non-promotional information to fix health related pages to ensure fair balance is maintained on healthcare related Wikipedia pages. We also educate and consult healthcare companies, government agencies, hospitals and medical schools to frequently monitor the pages of their interest to ensure quality, and fix incorrect information according to FDA guidelines without violating Wikipedia rules and principles, I suspect you will have an uphill struggle. I'm sorry if you see the enforcement of our policies as negative, especially when the user concerned is free to create a new account, but vague accusations of negativity do no persuade me that I have acted incorrectly.
, good point. A soft block affects only that account name and allows the creation of a new account. A hard block targets the user's computer ISP number, and prevents the creation of a new account from that computer. A hard blocked editor can still edit their own talk page and request an unblock.

 Understood and thank you for the additional info.  I don't know all the ins and outs around here yet.  My comments have mostly been motivated by a degree of surprise at how strongly the overall reaction to this editor has been. Certainly we need to have rules and enforce them.  But I deal every day with SPAs and users who break the rules in a dozen different ways.  (Try editing an article on a recreational drug sometime to add  compliant references on long term adverse effects or to remove claims that cannabis is the cure for every disease known and you'll see what I mean.) 
I apologize if my comments were perceived as disrespectful or directed at you in particular.

, would you mind pointing me to the sentence in  that says the account &quot;must&quot; (your word) be blocked?  I find (for example at ) that the account &quot;can be&quot; blocked if the account is both (1) an inappropriate name and (2) editing inappropriately, but &quot;can be&quot; is not the same as &quot;must&quot;.  I also find, at the end of the same paragraph, a clear statement that accounts not meeting both of those criteria &quot;should not be blocked&quot; (emphasis in the original).  Although that statement is not unambiguously relevant in the instant case, the policy clearly states that a promotional username alone is not sufficient to require a block.  However, you (appear to) say here that the username alone results in a mandatory block.   () 20:00, 17 November 2014 (UTC)
I have lifted the block.  The problem with a softblock is that it prevents the editor from participating at , where they had actually started a change-of-name request three days ago.  Yes, a softblock allows an individual to create a new account under a new name, but the new account wouldn't have their old edits associated with it.  Their proposed new account name also has issues, but a block seems premature as long as their subsequent edits continue to engage with our processes.  (I would rather not make the 'path of least resistance' for this individual to be to create a new account under which they don't disclose their COI.

 You are technically right, although it's rare for a spamuser not to be associated with spam edits. In this case, the user page text was obviously promotional, so the criteria were met, but I should have been more precise with the language [[User:Jimfbleak|Jimfbleak]] - [[User talk:Jimfbleak|talk to me?]] 06:57, 18 November 2014 (UTC)
 Well, I'm not going to wheel on this, and I can see your point. However, surely the old name should be blocked at some stage [[User:Jimfbleak|Jimfbleak]] - [[User talk:Jimfbleak|talk to me?]] 06:57, 18 November 2014 (UTC)
 My understanding of the technical side of the name change process is that with a properly-performed name change carried out by a 'crat, the account name is literally changed—past, present, and future use included.  Page histories reflect the new name, not the old.  Log entries (blocks and so forth) appear under the new name, not the old.  The old username ceases to exist.  Significantly, any blocks on the original account carry over to the new username; they do not 'stick' to the original name.
After a name change, a user may – and is often strongly encouraged to – create redirects from his or her old user and user talk pages to avoid confusing redlinks from old signatures (which will still point to the original username).  The user may also re-register his or her old account solely to avoid the account being recreated by another person accidentally (or maliciously) in the future.  This account doesn't need to be blocked (though it can be); the user just has to refrain from making edits with it.  () 13:55, 18 November 2014 (UTC)

 just FYI I spoke with IMS today.  As  noted, they are big fans of WP.  They did a big study last year (you can see some of it [http://www.imshealth.com/portal/site/imshealth/menuitem.762a961826aad98f53c753c71ad8c22a/?vgnextoid=ff71ad0087c73410VgnVCM10000076192ca2RCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=736de5fda6370410VgnVCM10000076192ca2RCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=default here] and found that something like 60% of doctors refer to WP and they found that drug/device/diagnostic company clients talk about articles relevant to them in WP.  IMS appears to be committed to establishing a WP presence, but realize that they started out on a really bad foot.  I gave them a 10,000 overview on our mission and our key content policies/guidelines especially for health content, and our bad history with paid editors.  Call me a sucker but my sense is that they want to do it &quot;right&quot; (and I made it clear to them that for many in WP there is no &quot;right&quot; way for them to be here... but that there were ways they could behave that were more likely to be more productive all around)    I reckon they will be in touch with Doc James and others about establishing a relationship with Project Medicine.  () 02:07, 18 November 2014 (UTC)
I am hesitant about relationships with pharma. The companies themselves are full of many excellent people; however, there goals do not always match our.
What I am okay with them doing is pointing out errors in the format &quot;X may be better than Y&quot; with Z as a high quality source that supports the change. They should stick to editing the talk page. If there suggestions are well formatted and reasonable they will be carried out.
The issue with the previous suggestions is that they were not well formatted (no inline refs were used) and they were too long winded. As all suggestions they are making will be somewhat controversial at least one reference will be needed for each sentence. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 02:25, 18 November 2014 (UTC)

Anatomy pages with clinical content

The Med project has discussed this before and the consensus opinion was that pages with significant clinical content can be part of the WP Medicine and that they should have a WP Medicine template banner on the talk page. There are over 540 Anatomy pages with a heading in the article relevant to medicine. The section heading is often called Clinical significance, but other are also seen (ie Clinical examination). I am planning to sort through these articles and tag the appropriate ones with the WP Medicine banner, so I would like to be clearer about where to draw the line between articles that have a small clinical section that would not be part of WP Med and those with a significant clinical section that should be part of WP Med. Alternatively, I could tag them all? Any comments?  () 21:32, 13 November 2014 (UTC)
Hi, consensus speaks that we tag none of them, and  states all applicable anatomy articles should have a clinical significance section (would be nearly all of them once sufficiently expanded). -- [[User:CFCF|CFCF]]  () 04:29, 14 November 2014 (UTC)
Yes I oppose tagging them with WP:MED. They are well served by WP:AN. Of course all medical content regardless of tagging needs to be supported by  sources. 
We should keep this project more clinically oriented. Yes we also include people and hospitals as there is no other project for them. But for anatomy there is a project. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 06:41, 14 November 2014 (UTC)
See , which says; &quot;Hospitals and other medical facilities where healthcare is undertaken: Use  instead of WPMED.&quot;.  There are WP projects for biographies and also for buildings.  () 10:21, 14 November 2014 (UTC)
*See : which says &quot;Human anatomy: Tag with . Additionally, tag with  only for anatomy articles with prominent clinical content. Other tags may also be appropriate.&quot;. As I was saying, there is a consensus to tag anatomy articles with a large section on clinical medicine and the last discussion about this is here: . My question was not to re-establish this principal, but to clarify what is prominent clinical content in Anatomy articles.  () 10:01, 14 November 2014 (UTC)
*As a rule of thumb, I would like to suggest, as least for discussion, that if the clinical section seen in an anatomy article when considered in isolation looks bigger in size to a Stub and would appear to have qualities exceeding a Stub, then it can be included in WP Medicine. Or, in other words, if the clinical content, has the sort of features that can be seen in a minimal Start class article, then it can be included in WP Med. Of course, the clinical section may not stand alone well as a Start article; however, considering Stub and Start class articles in this way may be useful yardsticks.  () 10:54, 14 November 2014 (UTC)
** This is a good rule of thumb; I would definitely tag all such articles with WPMED.  I might tag articles that have a couple of paragraphs.  Also, we've tended to tag articles about major anatomy (e.g., body parts and organs that children have heard about) with both.   () 17:23, 14 November 2014 (UTC)
*I have found over 100 Anatomy articles that are tagged with WP Med. I assume that these are tagged with the WP Med banner, because each contains a sizable clinical content section consistent with . I might check through these too, but I would also need to be fairly certain about what criteria to apply to asses if clinical content section is suitable for the article to be kept in WP Med or not.  () 11:15, 14 November 2014 (UTC)
** The assumption (that these all have sizeable clinical sections) is unfortunately not warranted.  It's just as likely that the page hasn't been re-evaluated since WP:MED? last changed.  You will also find some anatomy articles tagged with WPMED only, because some taggers (from outside these projects) aren't aware that WPANAT exists.  I recommend re-evaluating them all from scratch.  Speaking as the person who has, over the years, done more WPMED assessment work than anyone else, I am unlikely to object if you remove WPMED tags from articles that are primarily anatomy-focused whenever that seems reasonable to you.  I trust your judgment.   () 17:23, 14 November 2014 (UTC)
I have not been looking for Anatomy articles that are only tagged with WP Med. If well known body parts are in WP Med, then is this documented anywhere? Note that Arm, Finger, Eyelash, Gland, Hamstring, Abdomen, Humerus, Iris (anatomy), Jugular vein, Frontal lobe, Lens (anatomy), Left atrium, Epiglottis, Cerebellum are not part of WP Med. Any comments?  () 18:00, 14 November 2014 (UTC)
No, it's not documented anywhere.  It's been done, and it gets undone periodically, and we don't worry too much about it.   () 20:55, 14 November 2014 (UTC) 

I propose we remove &quot;Additionally, tag with  only for anatomy articles with prominent clinical content.&quot; WPAN is enough. 
Snowman it would be great if you remove the WPMED tags from the anatomy articles you find with it and make sure WPAN is there. We here should concentrate on disease related articles.
The problem we encounter if we tag all anatomy articles is that sex related topics will become our most viewed articles. The media pays attention to this and we already have received some poor press regarding this. It makes recruitment of physicians more difficult.

I think that I can run through all these pages and do the necessary tagging or un-tagging, but I need a clear criteria to work by.  Currently the consensus is looking somewhat unclear, and so I can not do anything. I am not promising anything. I would like to know; 
1. Are the current statements at  about tagging the rules for me to work by. If so:
1a. What is significant clinical content in an anatomy article?  () 20:24, 14 November 2014 (UTC)
1b. Is that the clinical content alone looks like better than a Stub workable for a WP Med article?  () 20:24, 14 November 2014 (UTC)
1c. Are basic anatomy parts that a child would know automatially classified within WP Med?
2. Is there so much disagreement in this discussion that a new consensus is needed? If so; 
1a. Any suggestions?  () 20:24, 14 November 2014 (UTC)
3.  stats that hospitals and people are not part of WP Med.  () 20:24, 14 November 2014 (UTC)
3a. What does people mean - famous doctors, famous people with diseases, authors or what?
3b. Is everyone happy that hospitals are not in WP Med or not?  () 20:24, 14 November 2014 (UTC)
Here are my clear criteria:  Do what seems sensible according to your own very good judgment, based on your already good understanding of the situation, and don't worry about it beyond that.  If someone really, really needs one of these to be double-tagged, then they'll re-add it.  If the response is silence, then assume that you did it correctly. 
(Firm answers:  1c, definitely not.  It happens, it's not consistent, we don't worry about it.  3a means mostly famous people with diseases.  We tolerate articles about healthcare workers, businesses, etc.  3b, definitely happy.)    () 20:55, 14 November 2014 (UTC)

**The scope at  explicitly descopes from education establishments, directing editors to WPMED. The page at  is rather confusingly self-referential.

There's probably room for guidance somewhere at  and  too. [[:Category talk:Hospitals]] is interesting in what it doesn't say. Similarly, [[:Category:Teaching_hospitals]] is interestingly in  [[:Category:Medical education]], [[:Category:Hospitals]], and [[:Category:Medical research organizations]]. It seems like the category tree may not precisely align with the projects.

In the UK many ordinary hospitals formally teach medical students. They used to have (T) or (Teaching) after the name of hospital or the heath authority to indicate this. What about the definitions of institute, clinic, or college?. A Wiki article about a medical school will probably say what teaching hospitals and other hospitals, clinics, and institutes are attached. I would think that WP Med would be interested in medical schools. Logically, WP Med would also be interested in hospitals where medical students are taught, but there would be rather a lot. I looked in dictionaries; &quot;teaching hospital&quot; or &quot;university hospital&quot; tend to be regional hospitals and also provide teaching, but &quot;medical school&quot; was not in two medical dictionaries I looked at.  I am not sure if the terminology means different things in different parts of the world or if the medical set-up is different in different part of the world. I think that WP Hospital are interested in hospital administration, so they might know.   () 00:13, 20 November 2014 (UTC)

You're not kidding! To make matters worse, the latest change to that article was from an IP... when I did a geolocate, it was from Yale-New Haven Hospital! So that editor got  about COI. The safest thing may be not to make any claims at all, but to acknowledge that Stahlman may have been the first to ventilate a neonate, and Gluck was a pioneer in NICU design.
