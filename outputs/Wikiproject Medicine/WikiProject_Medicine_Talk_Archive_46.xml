Textbooks copy and pasting appear to be growing
We may need to change our referencing requirements to only allow sources published before the existence of Wikipedia.

Trying to verify that these are all names for eptospirosis: Weil's syndrome, canicola fever, canefield fever, nanukayami fever, 7-day fever, Rat Catcher's Yellows, Fort Bragg fever, black jaundice, and Pretibial fever. We list them all back in 2010.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leptospirosis&amp;oldid=404489759]

This textbook lists them in the same order as us [http://books.google.ca/books?id=mX1XAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA189#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false] its from 2013.

While attribution is good, it doesn't solve the circular referencing problem. These books have a number of characteristics that can be auto detected at least in principle.  All are published in recent years, have very few if any copies held in major libraries, and most are attributed to one of a handful of publishers that are themselves fairly new.

 More eyes on aniel Amen 

I added the tag for this project on the talk page. I hope that it was accurate to do so. Amen's article is going under a full overhaul, and that might be an improvement. However, a number of statements seem to cast doubt on many, possible most, aspects of his work. I'm concerned Wikipedia is characterizing him as some sort of quack, when I'm not sure that is quite accurate. [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=%22daniel+amen%22&amp;btnG=&amp;as_sdt=1%2C5&amp;as_sdtp= a Google Scholar search] suggests he has some credibility, or at least sway. I don't feel my experience in medical issues will be terribly useful here, and would very much appreciate anyone familiar with him/his fields of study, to have a look.
If he is using SPECT scans to &quot;diagnose&quot; ADHD and pushing vitamin supplements, yup there are issues. And the titles of his books, wow. ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 08:53, 14 March 2014 (UTC)
I don't know if he is doing that, or if that is another mischaracterization of what he does do. Or even if he is pioneering in the field, and trying to share what he feels are areas of further investigation. That he dumbs down complex issues, in order to get people to make better life choices, seems admirable. I don't know that any of it is that cut and dry. A thoughtful look at his life is undoubtably a good read, a tar and feathering, maybe not so much. My hunch is that items are being cherry-picked, and used against him. In fairness, others may feel that is a good solution to counteract promotional editing which has been accused on the talk page.

I originally posted this on the oticeboard#Daniel Amen|Biographies of Living Persons Noticeboard, section on Daniel Amen but thought I would add this here as well, as it might actually be even more relevant here in this discussion--

edical-RINGE is about cience, but sychology is not, and never can be, purely a science--   

I have a concern that the aniel Amen article is being treated like a &quot;cience article&quot; when, in fact, much of the topic is about sychology, which can never be a &quot;ure science&quot;. 

I think treating a psychology article (such as this one) like it is about &quot;pure science&quot;, is misguided. Treating Psychology as a science has inherent limits-- that is, in reality, psychology is much more of what is called a &quot;oft science&quot; than it ever could be a &quot;ard science&quot;. Science can help in the understanding of psychology, and should be used as much as possible to the extent that it can help, but there is something about psychology that is more elusive and much more difficult to pin down. There is an aspect of psychology that is very hard to apply ard science in any conclusive way.    

In a nutshell, psychology is inherently ubjective, when science is a practice in bjectivity. (sychology being an essential part of what sychiatry is, in addition to the neurological and pharmaceutical aspects). All of this makes it much harder to &quot;scientifically evaluate&quot; things that involve psychological states of mind. 

 *So psychiatrists are all less scientific than they appear to be (including Dr. Amen's critics). And so are neuroscientists, when they start talking about sychology.  

Psychiatry is far from being a &quot;cut and dried&quot; field, and that applies as much to Dr. Amen's critics as it does to Dr. Amen. I therefore fear that treating critics of a psychological theory as if they are the &quot;voice of science&quot; is giving these critics authority that they do not deserve. Of course Dr. Amen should not get authority that he does not deserve either. But this does not take us to the same place as a &quot;RINGE conclusion. Instead it takes us to a place of not being able to know much of anything for sure. And so a responsible article would rely more heavily on the &quot;this can not be known for sure either way one (literature)|tone&quot;, than a RINGE tone. There can be no RINGE where there is no science, or in this case, some science, but not enough science. This cuts both ways, applying just as much to Dr. Amen's critics as it does to Dr. Amen.  

Thanks.

Giving the article a medical-fringe angle then implies that psychology is medical when it is not, or not sufficiently so for the purposed of medical fringe or science fringe designations.
ser:Cliffswallow-vaulting|Cliffswallow-vaulting (ser talk:Cliffswallow-vaulting|talk) 20:25, 15 March 2014 (UTC)

My biggest concern is that medicalizing this subject, also encourages medicalizing other psychology articles. Which opens the door to subjecting them all to medical-fringe or science-fringe designations. The ramifications go far beyond this article. 

It's the wrong tandard and could be abused elsewhere (in other psychology articles). 

sychology, despite it's inherent resistance to scientific method, deserves to exist and has value, without being hammered by RINGE accusations. Better that everyone knows to take psychology with a grain of salt, rather than to label all of it as a falsehood.

I'm saying that PECT scans are combined with psychological evaluations-- so once you combine a ard science method with a oft science method, there is really no clear hard science anymore. You can't anymore rove it than isprove it.

Therefore saying that it is proven is not right, but saying that it has been dis-proven is also not right. What you can say is that there is disagreement and criticism.ser:Cliffswallow-vaulting|Cliffswallow-vaulting (ser talk:Cliffswallow-vaulting|talk) 05:24, 16 March 2014 (UTC)

I'm going through a GA review at present and the reviewer finds the use of the term &quot;Indications&quot; as a section heading confusing (in this case referring to a surgical procedure).  Although indications is listed in MEDMOS, is there another (more layperson-friendly) term that is commonly used? ser:Ian Furst|Ian Furst (ser talk:Ian Furst|talk) 17:58, 14 March 2014 (UTC)

You might consider &quot;uses&quot; or &quot;applications&quot;, but I agree that &quot;indications&quot; is the most precise term. ser:DoctorJoeE|DoctorJoeE pecial:Contributions/DoctorJoeE|review transgressions/ser talk:DoctorJoeE|talk to me! 18:08, 14 March 2014 (UTC)
I think they have a point as, though the most precise word, &quot;indications&quot; is not generally understood the way that say &quot;diagnosis&quot; is. If we are talking about ental implant#Indications (as it now is), something like &quot;Types and uses&quot; best summarizes the content there. ser:Johnbod|Johnbod (ser talk:Johnbod|talk) 18:14, 14 March 2014 (UTC)
Indications is not esoteric medical word, it is used in everyday parlance. Don't think more clumsy terms like &quot;uses&quot;, &quot;applications&quot;, &quot;type&quot; or even &quot;reasons&quot; (e.g. as seen on ental_extraction#Reasons) are particularly needed. Only reasons adequately reproduces the meaning of the original word... but it doesn't sound particularly encyclopedic imo. Should use the term which the sources are using. Link to ndication (medicine) in the first sentence of the section if needed. ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 18:24, 14 March 2014 (UTC)
Indications is not used in &quot;everyday parlance&quot; with the medical meaning where I live (mind you, neither is &quot;parlance&quot;). The link can't be used in a heading, though it should be used in the text.  In what seems to be the example concerned here the section covers more than a narrow interpretation of &quot;indications&quot; in any case. ser:Johnbod|Johnbod (ser talk:Johnbod|talk) 18:32, 14 March 2014 (UTC)
utdent The term confused ser:TonyTheTiger who, from what I can see, has a lot of experience with reviewing articles.  If it confused this user, I'm going to assume that it will confuse the average person.  However, it's part of medmos so I didn't want to make a change that was non-uniform.  I can't link it in the title as ser:Johnbod said. Personally, I'm not sure the average reader would understand that an indication is &quot;a valid reason&quot; for an operation/procedure/test. ser:Ian Furst|Ian Furst (ser talk:Ian Furst|talk) 18:39, 14 March 2014 (UTC)
and Tony's American.  There may well be a P:ENGVAR issue here too. In the US drug packaging leaflets are apparently required by legislation to use the term; in the UK they are not and patient information will typically (normally, always?) avoid it, having a section called something like &quot;What FOO tablets are and what they are used for&quot;.  Another reason to be cautious in using the term, and maybe note an ENGVAR issue at MEDMOS. ser:Johnbod|Johnbod (ser talk:Johnbod|talk) 18:41, 14 March 2014 (UTC)

=D wouldn't that be P:original research|original research? But, I have to insist that indication(s) is not an esoteric word.

I think, overall, that the recommended headings in the MEDMOS would have to be changed before your reviewer would be able to appropriately ask for this section to change... ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 18:58, 14 March 2014 (UTC)
I agree with Lesion -- &quot;indications&quot; is the proper term, and can be linked to ndication (medicine) in the first sentence of the section if you are seriously concerned that readers will not understand; although its meaning becomes intuitively obvious once readers begin reading the section.  Reducing descriptors to the lowest common denominator, at the expense of precision, is a mistake in an encyclopedia, IMHO. ser:DoctorJoeE|DoctorJoeE pecial:Contributions/DoctorJoeE|review transgressions/ser talk:DoctorJoeE|talk to me! 19:00, 14 March 2014 (UTC)
I was going to say &quot;Of course it's &quot;not originally a medical term&quot;! But the medical meaning is different from the normal ones...&quot; until I looked at the ED, who in fact say it &quot;apparently&quot; is the earliest sense, dating to 1541, though in fact the early citations seem closer to &quot;symptom&quot; in modern usage, as &quot;indications&quot; of what a patient's condition is, not what to do about it. I think Ian (and Tony) are right to think it is not very generally understood in its precise modern medical sense of &quot;a valid reason to use a certain test, medication, procedure, or surgery&quot; (our article, from Mirriam-Webster).  You get on to the 2nd page of the 935 hits in a search for &quot;indications&quot; on the UK NHS website [http://www.nhs.uk/Search/Pages/Results.aspx?q=indication] before you hit a use in this technical sense.  ser:Johnbod|Johnbod (ser talk:Johnbod|talk) 19:04, 14 March 2014 (UTC)
utdent
But that sense is still in use. &quot;Night sweats might indicate malaria&quot;. This is the same sense as the nonmedical use: &quot;Rumbling might indicate that the volcano is about to erupt&quot;. The other sense of the word, as something (e.g. sign/symptom or specific condition) which triggers something else to happen (e.g. a specific treatment choice over another), is also not confined to medicine. &quot;A rumbling volcano indicates that you should quickly move to safety.&quot; I have difficulty understanding how there is any difference between the medical use and the nonmedical use of the term. ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 19:25, 14 March 2014 (UTC)
With respect, that's probably why you are a dentist, not a lexicographer. OED distinguishes 4 senses of the noun, of which the medical is 1b (also 4 for the verb). Try seeing how many of the 935 uses in the link above mean &quot;a valid reason to use a certain test, medication, procedure, or surgery&quot;, or to take any form of action. ser:Johnbod|Johnbod (ser talk:Johnbod|talk) 19:34, 14 March 2014 (UTC)
Even if we agreed that indications is a common enough term to let it stand, the next logical question would be, &quot;Is contra-indications intuitive to the layperson?&quot;.  We need to consider the terms together. Is &quot;Reasons for use&quot; and &quot;Reasons not to use&quot; any less percise? Maybe &quot;Indications for use&quot; Btw - what is the average reading comprehension level of an english speaking user? ser:Ian Furst|Ian Furst (ser talk:Ian Furst|talk) 19:49, 14 March 2014 (UTC)

&quot;ontraindication&quot; can be wikilinked just as easily as can &quot;indication&quot;.  &quot;Reasons for use/not use&quot; is clumsy and unencyclopedic; &quot;indications for use&quot; is redundant. ser:DoctorJoeE|DoctorJoeE pecial:Contributions/DoctorJoeE|review transgressions/ser talk:DoctorJoeE|talk to me! 19:59, 14 March 2014 (UTC)
Personally, and rather perversely, I think &quot;contra-indications&quot;, as effectively only a medical term (or at least a scientific/technical one), is rather less confusing to the average reader. The question is not just whether to use or not use, but whether to use and explain, as well as linking. If used, I think they should be explained, and if used in a header, explained right afterwards. ser:Johnbod|Johnbod (ser talk:Johnbod|talk) 20:05, 14 March 2014 (UTC)

In a surgical context, medical may mean nonsurgical, and this occurs in modern sources. &quot;Medical uses&quot; makes less sense than &quot;Reasons&quot;, which is the most accurate substitute so far suggested, not that I think substitution is required. ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 23:11, 14 March 2014 (UTC)

There's a lot of that.

I know we've talked about it before, but I don't think we ever actually raised a p:Bot request for it. The approach is not without minor drawbacks, but we can't afford to allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good here.
The l|cite journal template can take the parameter ara|type|Systematic review (e.g.) which is suitable for the purpose of capturing the information.

I have added one of the 3 PubMed results to the article.

Any aspect of myth has to do with how common it is. As far as I know its extremely rare, and the article states that most people, but not all have valves in their facial veins.

 ex therapy article  

ser|Rmcoe significantly expanded the Sex therapy article today as part of a P:Student assignment.

That is obviously a major improvement.  It's gone from two general references (one weak) to more than a dozen inline citations.  The sources include textbooks and academic journals.  It covers aging, which is an area that our articles (especially sex-related articles) are often biased against.  It's not perfect (what article is?), but it is a major improvement.
Also, I think it meets the P:DYK rules for fivefold expansion.  Perhaps someone would like to write a hook and nominate it?  The main page benefits from having general interest articles like this.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:35, 18 March 2014 (UTC)

The aging thing, though, that seems to be a wide academic bias; the vast majority of sexuality/sexual activity sources I come across focus on youth or those who are iddle aged, but with the middle age portion usually only covering those in their 30s, 40s or early 50s (ages that are still young by many people's standards, especially those in their 30s)...if ages are mentioned or discussed. And this aspect, that sexuality/sexual activity research often does not focus on older adults, is also another piece that the Sex therapy article addresses. ser:Flyer22|Flyer22 (ser talk:Flyer22|talk) 18:14, 18 March 2014 (UTC)

 Personally, I'd prefer the current opening paragraph. In the lead we ought to avoid medical jargon: for example, nalgesia - even wikilinked - is not as good as &quot;reduction of pain&quot; for a lay reader. Also, from a diving medicine standpoint, air is an anaesthetic at sufficient depth (see itrogen narcosis) and enon is a [http://www.general-anaesthesia.com/xenon-anaesthesia.html usable anaesthetic at normal pressure]. The anaesthetic effect of air under pressure doesn't fit well with our normal concept of a drug and narcosis is not a purposeful effect.

 Access to wikilibrary 

A bit of a strange request here, but have been working on P:ANATOMY articles recently and have hit a bit of a loggerhead: can't find any good sources for the history of organs. May seem like a strange issue, but per our recent changes to P:MEDMOS#Anatomy|the guidelines (and common sense) I need some historical data to get organ articles up to GA... eg who discovered or first documented organs etc., but this is quite difficult now, requiring a lot of digging for each organ. Without the prospect of GA it is a little demotivating to make random edits that only somewhat improve articles. Finding comprehensive and reliable sources is really quite difficult.

I have heard that Wikilibrary can sometimes help with this, by providing online access to some sources? I'm not sure what sources are available, but I've used Google books to access some pages of these books and they are very high-quality and was wondering if someone could point me in the right direction? (such as how to add them to the library, or access them if they are already there?)

Thanks all for your help. The two books I am looking for are textbooks. Have put in a request at the state library to lend them to me, will see where that leads.

Am also uncomfortable about ignoring the history entirely - I feel it would be quite strange to nominate any article, from allbladder through ervix through almaris longus muscle without at least some mention about who first documented it and the etymology of the term, and any changes in understanding over time.

As |WhatamIdoing says I think that P:UNDUE applies in the cases that history is difficult to find.

 unner's knee? 

This article is currently a redirect to hondromalacia patellae, but at least as far as I was aware liotibial band syndrome is a more common cause of runner's knee. 
Some sources state runner's knee being the common name of at least 4 distinct injuries. Anyone out there who can point me to a good source so I can create a proper disambiguation page?
The best I found is this review from 1999 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1313339/], which states it is equivalent to atellofemoral pain syndrome

Added lica syndrome.  Hope you don't mind unpublished anecdotes as references on medical DABs.miley|wink &quot;Runners-knee&quot;-related pain started after a distance runner had completed 2 marathons.  On three separate occasions with different doctors, the knee pain was misdiagnosed as either patellar chondromalacia or PFPS based upon an MRI, a simple X-ray, and/or a CT-scan.  Still unsatisfied with each dx after using wikipedia and linked sources to ifferential diagnosis|self-ddx and rule these out, he saw a 4th doctor that finally suspected plica syndrome based upon an X-ray and an MRI.  He confirmed it during arthroscopic knee surgery and excised 2 plica. Following that surgery ~5 years ago, that runner (who happens to be me) completed another 2 marathons without even a single recurrence of &quot;Runner's knee&quot; type pain... I obviously don't have much faith in some doctors as a result of that.  I'm sure there's an actual medical review which includes this since its already in the &quot;see also&quot; of every one of the articles above, but I'm too lazy to check pubmed atm.  I'd suggest just leaving it there based upon P:IGNOREALLRULES and the likelihood that I didn't spend time writing this paragraph because I wanted to create a pointless fabrication. ser:Seppi333|Seppi333 (ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert 2¢ | pecial:WhatLinksHere/User:Seppi333/Maintenance|Maintained) 18:50, 19 March 2014 (UTC)

 WhatamIdoing is correct to point out that disambiguation pages should not have references. However P:DABREF indicates that the target articles should have appropriate references. Therefore articles such as hondromalacia patellae and lica syndrome should state that &quot;Runner's knee&quot; is an alternative name, and a reference should be provided.

liotibial band syndrome, Patellofemoral pain syndrome/chondromalacia patellae are the only ones I can find which are called Runner's knee in the literature.
Reading up a bit, there are sources out there calling lica syndrome the great imitator of knee injuries, maybe it would be better to add it to the differential diagnosis section of the articles?

MID|19887299 I probably should've just checked for reviews instead.  That took just as long to do. &quot;Runner's knee&quot; isn't really a technical/medical term for disorders – it's just a catch-all and informal term referring to overuse injuries typically seen in runners, particularly those associated with chronic pain along the medial or lateral aspect of the patella.

 [1] added alk:Dextroamphetamine#Dextro_:_Levo_ratio_in_Adderall above.
 I contributed a change to the articles dderall and mphetamine, based on what was already written in extroamphetamine. The statement(s) at that time were, that Adderall would have a D:L amphetamine ratio of 3:1, which was obviously wrong. The current statment 3:1 ratio of D:L amphetamine salts is true, but rather useless, as it mixes up active and inactive ingredients. The 72.7% dextroamphetamine in Adderall where at least mentioned in the book The Amphetamine Debate, although I'm rather sceptic about the quality of the statement there, cause it mistakes dexamphetamine and lisdexamphetamine (might be a typo /autocorrect of a typo as well as simply bad quality) (Moore, Elaine.[http://books.google.com/books?id=6vfMjBwzpIgC&amp;pg=PA90 The Amphetamine Debate: The Use of Adderall, Ritalin and Related Drugs for Behavior Modification, Neuroenhancement and Anti-Aging Purposes]. McFarland, 2010, p. 90.). I myself calculated ratios therefore (but got different values), see alk:Dextroamphetamine#Dextro_:_Levo_ratio_in_Adderall, and e.g. ser:Seppi333 didn't reply till today on that. See also ser_talk:Edward_Bower#D:L-amphetamine_ratio_of_Adderall, because ser:Edward Bower has pecial:diff/122637472/122638124|introduced the statement originally. He seems to be inactive, so he likely won't tell what his source was.
 Seppi333 confuses having a lot of wikipedia contributions with having or even beeing a reliable, published source. see alk:Amphetamine#5-HT toxidrome. He simply mistakes mphetamines with mphetamine, he hasn't shown up with a single source simply telling mphetamine overdose might cause erotonin syndrome.

&quot;11 DESCRIPTION
ADDERALL XR is a once daily extended-release, single-entity amphetamine product. ADDERALL XR combines the neutral sulfate salts of
dextroamphetamine and amphetamine, with the dextro isomer of amphetamine saccharate and d,l-amphetamine aspartate monohydrate. The
ADDERALL XR capsule contains two types of drug-containing beads designed to give a double-pulsed delivery of amphetamines, which
prolongs the release of amphetamine from ADDERALL XR compared to the conventional ADDERALL (immediate-release) tablet formulation.
Each capsule contains: 5 mg 10 mg 15 mg 20 mg 25 mg 30 mg
Dextroamphetamine Saccharate 1.25 mg 2.5 mg 3.75 mg 5.0 mg 6.25 mg 7.5 mg
Amphetamine Aspartate Monohydrate 1.25 mg 2.5 mg 3.75 mg 5.0 mg 6.25 mg 7.5 mg
Dextroamphetamine Sulfate USP 1.25 mg 2.5 mg 3.75 mg 5.0 mg 6.25 mg 7.5 mg
Amphetamine Sulfate USP 1.25 mg 2.5 mg 3.75 mg 5.0 mg 6.25 mg 7.5 mg
Total amphetamine base equivalence 3.1 mg 6.3 mg 9.4 mg 12.5 mg 15.6 mg 18.8 mg

I don't dispute the validity of your statement.  My problems with it are: 
*2.3% is insignificantly small to make this needlessly more complicated for the average reader.
*The formulation is obviously intentionally based upon the ratio of salts.
*You don't cite it.


As for 5-HT toxidrome, all I can say to that is you apparently can't read.  That quote says amph OD induces a &quot;syndrome&quot; with some of its symptoms secondary to &quot;serotonin excess.&quot;  Serotonin toxicity symptoms manifest on a spectrum, not as a binary state (i.e., an ndicator function).  This is why your statement &quot;No, it's not a pefect match, a serotonin syndrom is not just an excess of serotonin&quot; is wrong. Serotonin syndrome is just a toxic overdose of serotonin (technically, neuronal activity).  
You're intentionally misrepresenting my statement that &quot;I wrote the section and read the sources&quot; as an rgument from authority. I'll just be explicit and say what it was meant to suggest:
* To the best of my knowledge, everything in this section is sound and has perfect text-source integrity
* I'm accountable for the verifiability of the content. 
* It's laughable that you're giving me a lecture on the difference between amphetamine and substituted amphetamines.

 Adderall: Anyway, your complaint is a self-attack, as you only pecial:redirect/revision/600140086|filled the introduction with more details. Never have you simply added a citation needed tag at the 72.7%, instead you have attacked me with the words &quot;His edits may need to be checked/watched on other articles.&quot;. What a nice guy you are!
 You could have easily shortened your Adderal answer to zero words, as it says nothing new. Have a look on alk:Dextroamphetamine#Dextro_:_Levo_ratio_in_Adderall, that's not a small gap. Just ignore the probem? And if you want to say 72.7% are roughly 75% than write &quot;roughly&quot;. But you still need a source that tells you the D:L ratio (without salts, roughly or accurate). Will you show up with one, different from The Amphetamine Debate that I mentioned?

 5-HT toxidrome: A syndrome whose most prominent feature is an adrenergic storm with some of its symptoms secondary to serotonin excess (so just amended by an obviously smaller serotonin excess compared to the adrenergic and dopaminergic). To call that serotonin syndrome is just false. Found words &quot;excess of serotonin&quot; in erotonin syndrome and in paper about amphetamine overdose -&gt; amphetamine overdose may cause serotonin syndrome = SYNTH.
 amphetamine is [http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/318/2/604.full  considerably less effective in elevating plasma 5-HT compared with fenfluramine, MDMA, and methamphetamine], mphetamine is a less potent drug out of mphetamines regarding 5-HTP excess. Btw, fenfluramine and MDMA are agonists at 5-HT receptors, too. That might contribute to their serotonin toxicity, so it's not clear if it's just an elevated serotonin level that causes serotonin syndrome of mphetamines (I guess agonism is the central mechanism of action for a serotonin syndrome caused by agonists as SD).
Time does matter: It is healthy to have a pulse rate of 200bpm for a short while on a run, but dangerously if it takes longer.
 Your continuum theory is just as good as fever = hyperpyrexia, intensity above some cut-off does matter. If you don't show up with a citable source saying &quot;amphetamine causes serotonin syndrom&quot; (mild or whatever), then take it out of the article or do cite literally. Is a serotonin syndrom technically just an excess of serotonin? You know a case of a human with diagnosis of an acute serotonin syndrome, and anybody measured the theorized excess of serotonin? Technically it's just differential diagnosis.
 It would be easy to circumnavigate the problems caused by your interpretation of the &quot;cited&quot; source, just by citing it: &quot;an excess of serotonin&quot; (add &quot;and related symptoms&quot; if you want) instead of serotonin syndrom/toxidrome in mphetamine#Overdose. But that does require that you think critically about your own contributions. Btw, I have no doubts in your ability to read.
 &quot;It's laughable&quot;... But it was pecial:diff/598451967/598462108|necessary (&quot;it lists MDMA right next to it&quot;, where it is superclass substituted amphetamines. After that SYNTH &quot;but this could easily happen given a high enough (&quot;extremely large&quot;) overdose for ~100% SERT phosphorylation&quot; and again [http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/318/2/604.full that's a highly unlikely speculation and OR]).

*Serotonin syndrome:
The scope of all the policies you've stated so far, P:PRIMARY, P:OR, and P:SYNTH, is limited to article content. Non-article content is completely outside the scope of these.  If I said amphetamine is a panacea that cures all diseases known to man without any reference at all, I can do it right here on WT:MED, and it's perfectly OK as long as my statement adheres to the talk page guidelines. I don't care if you think I'm wrong about any statement I've made, or even if you misrepresent some of my statements like you've done in your reply above.

I do care that the amphetamine article strictly adheres to these policies (and to a lesser extent adderall/dextroamphetamine as well, since they're not currently FA-nominated).  I cited a review and provided a quote containing a statement which I've asserted is equivalent to the definition of serotonin syndrome. Specifically, I've said that it's defined as a toxidrome model involving excessive serotonin activity in neurons. If you know this isn't the definition of that concept, you should be correcting me with a reference; in which case, I would have to find a suitable replacement reference or remove the phrase/citation from the article.  On the other hand, if you aren't familiar with serotonin syndrome, you should simply ask me to provide you with a reference which defines it as this model. 

I'll let you decide who provides the reference for this.

*Enantiomer ratios:
instead you have attacked me with the words &quot;His edits may need to be checked/watched on other articles.. What a nice guy you are!I'm delightful, aren't I? |1
You could have easily shortened your Adderal answer to zero words, as it says nothing new.No, I actually explained to you, in the bulleted list, why I have an issue with it and suggested how you could correct the policy breach of WP:SYNTH. 

As for the ratio you want to add, I don't really care if it's added or not; I think it's useless, but I won't delete it if you add it with an appropriate citation.  However, I will revert it if you change the current salt ratio text/reference instead of adding it with the reference separately.

I know about the scope of WP:SYNTH,... I'm not a newby, although I have less contributions to en.wikipedia.org as I have on de.wikipedia.org. So if you're stating here just small talk, you are totally right, but I would add that this talk page is not inteded for small talk. I criticise your edits on the pages themselves, WP:SYNTH,... are applying, cause its in their scope. Your edit misses a justification without talk here (no word of serotonin toxydrome/syndrome in given cite in mphetamine) and that on article talk pages. You would have had either to add a sufficient cite that doesn't need your vulnerable interpretation, or I may have refered to your interpretation's justification here in my critic.

I agree, your 1st reply (to me) could only be shortened to the bullet list. It doesn't matter in lead how a manufacturer is describing its formulation, it's obviously useless for any reader to state any ratio between a mixture of active and inactive ingedients (e.g. salt-ratio) in lead. I never removed the note in the article about salt-ratio, and I won't do. I will shorten lead again and add the cite.

Changing &quot;erotonin syndrome|serotonin toxidrome&quot; to &quot;erotonin syndrome#Spectrum concept|excess of serotonin&quot; is the maximum what you can take out of all mentioned cites from the given reference.

 How many types of cohort studies are there? 

I was surprised to discover that while rospective cohort study and etrospective cohort study are not redlinks, ongitudinal cohort study is. Does anyone know if maybe two of these terms are synonymous with each other or something? It seems like the [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/longitudinal two] [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prospective?show=0&amp;t=1395335879 words] have distinct meanings in epidemiology, so there should probably be 2 separate pages on longitudinal and prospective studies. ser:Jinkinson|Jinkinson ser talk:Jinkinson|talk to me 17:20, 20 March 2014 (UTC)
At the risk of sounding like a dumb-ass, this is my understanding of it. I'm no epidemiologist.  A cohort study defines a group (the group is the cohort) and observes them.  It can be cross-sectional (meaning the group at any given point in time), prospective or retrospective.  I believe longitudinal in this instance is synonymous with prospective.  There are also matched cohort studies, when long-term observations is impractical, unethical or impossible.  For instance, does eating fast-food lead to greater heart disease.  It's tough to control all the variables, other than fast food consumption that contribute to heart disease so they match the patients based on other risk factors with one match being high fast-food consumption and the other low (edit: then following them going forward for the occurrence of heart disease).  In this sense, the cohort is cross-sectional (looking at previous behavior) the longitudinal.  A prospective randomized trial would create an inception cohort of people, then randomize them to 2 treatment groups. Question from the peanut butter test?  Does that help? ser:Ian Furst|Ian Furst (ser talk:Ian Furst|talk) 17:33, 20 March 2014 (UTC)

 A longitudinal study is a study that observes subjects over a period of time. Because longitudinal studies typically require planning, most of these are prospective studies. But there is no reason that a longitudinal study cannot be retrospective. For instance, with the advent of electronic medical records, plenty of folk are doing retrospective longitudinal studies using patient medical histories. --ser:Mark viking|Mark viking (ser talk:Mark viking|talk) 18:36, 20 March 2014 (UTC)

From a medical point of view, this would set the precedent to add the thousands of potential allergens with the potential to cause contact dermatitis to the hundreds of pages that describe the anatomy or specific topics of dermatitis.  From an editorial point of view, it seems contrary to the concept  of original writing on Wikipedia to cut and paste the same sentence in many articles.

Imo, articles like tomatitis and heilitis should mention as many of the most common allergens as possible. But ofc we need MEDRS sources to support it. Note also that cheilitis already mentioned balsam of peru before these edits (in heilitis#Eczematous_cheilitis) but only in one short sentence.

It sounds like a common allergen: &quot;Balsam of Peru (BOP) is a well-known contact allergen that is one of the most prevalent in the United States.&quot; from http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23857009 . ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 14:17, 20 March 2014 (UTC)

I'm interested that even our editors most knowledgeable in this area are not familiar with alsam of Peru, given its top-five allergen status.  But all the more reason for appropriate mention.  Clearly, only mentioning it in the article itself is less than ideal.  But I agree that mentions should be appropriately trimmed.  I think Doc James and I have trimmed it well in a couple of articles, and Lesion raised an article where it was less well placed than another related article (it is a problem in some dental cements and related dental products).  BTW, in  its crude form, has even been banned from some products.--ser:Epeefleche|Epeefleche (ser talk:Epeefleche|talk) 15:35, 20 March 2014 (UTC)
=) not totally hopeless, wiki already mentioned this on some articles like atch test (medicine)#Common allergens and heilitis. Per Axl's comment (see below), on article like tomatitis etc, probably better to mention this substance in the context of a list of common allergens. In each case, need a P:MEDRS|MEDRS source to support specifically that this allergen causes that condition. ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 17:10, 20 March 2014 (UTC)
 Lesion, the reference for the list in urning_mouth_syndrome#Other_causes_of_an_oral_burning_sensation is Oral and maxillofacial medicine: the basis of diagnosis and treatment. This is a generic textbook and is a suitable source for this information in this article.

 The first reference is specifically about balsam of Peru. It is not suitable for generic articles about &quot;Stomatitis&quot; or &quot;Dermatitis&quot;. The other three references are generic texts. In these, balsam of Peru is mentioned as one of a list of substances. To describe only balsam of Peru gives it undue weight. If it is to be included, it should only be as part of a list. There is certainly no need to state &quot;Balsam of Peru is used in food and drink for flavoring, in perfumes and toiletries for fragrance, and in medicine and pharmaceutical items for healing properties.&quot; ser:Axl|Axl ¤ ser talk:Axl|[Talk] 15:41, 20 March 2014 (UTC)

OK yes agree. On stomatitis, I have started a short list of allergens so there is not undue weight. Whole article needs much work...

*If you look at the indicated [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stomatitis&amp;diff=600418721&amp;oldid=599977213 diff], it simply jumps out that the real problem from an editorial standpoint is the fact that nearly everything that was pre-existing in that section lacked any refs whatsoever.  People reading that article should see RS-supported information, which should include known causes (referenced to RSs), in language they can understand that is accurate -- that should be our focus.  The non-RS supported material should either be properly supported, or deleted. I've tagged it in the meantime.  Much of the article suffers from the same malady ... and not from the inclusion of reference to a top-5 allergen, supported by RSs.--ser:Epeefleche|Epeefleche (ser talk:Epeefleche|talk) 18:51, 20 March 2014 (UTC)

As to the refs -- please note that &quot;Major academic publishers (e.g., Elsevier, Springer Verlag, Wolters Kluwer, and Informa) publish specialized medical book series with good editorial oversight; volumes in these series summarize the latest research in narrow areas, usually in a more extensive format than journal reviews.&quot;  The text are perfectly excellent RSs, and should not be deleted (keeping the refs in allows the reader to jump to the ref for further info). 

Adding any other &quot;top 5&quot; allegens would of course be appropriate.  Feel free.  But that's not cause for deletion of this top-5 allergen, RS supported.

That whole article is in a poor state. Not convinced the current layout is the best approach for this broad scoped article... A layout like heilitis might be better, which doesn't have any causes section, instead mentioning the causes as the different types are discussed. ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 20:19, 20 March 2014 (UTC)

 Request for some extra opinions 



McGrigor then concluded that women’s brains were more analogous to infants, thus deeming them inferior at the time.[8] To further these claims of female inferiority and silence the feminists of the time, other anthropologists joined in on the studies of the female skull. These cranial measurements are the basis of what is known as craniology. These cranial measurements were also used to draw a connection between women and black people. French craniologist, F. Pruner, went on to describe this relationship as: “The Negro resemble[ing] the female in his love for children, his family, and his cabin

As the point on phrenology, yes that section is actually fairly representative of the debate at the time.  However, that section has some pretty obvious P:Weight|weight issues when it comes to craniology/phrenology.   While that debate is absolutely noteworthy, being of serious historical, cultural, and empirical value (especially as regards the evolution of the evolved sciences) its proper place is at hrenology (and to a lesser extent nthropometry), not the article focused on the current scientific understanding of the human cranium and its relevance to the brain. There should be little more than a brief reference to those pseudo-scientific analogs to modern science and whatever reference is left there should be represented as thoroughly debunked by modern developments.   That's not the only statement in that section which is troubling -- there's also this: &quot;Some authors consider this size difference to partly explain the alleged difference in average intelligence between men and women, and between various human races.&quot;  That particular claim is so far outside the scientific mainstream (and has been for most of the modern era) that I don't even know where to start.  More particular to our purposes here, said claim is not supported to any significant weight by the scientific consensus presented by the vast majority of sources available on the subject.   On the subject of sources, if you are looking for a good text to contextualize this debate and the evolution of scientific understanding of the subject, you can do a lot worse than tephen Jay Gould's he Mismeasure of Man, which, though a little dated, is still a definitive work on deconstructing this and several other types of antiquated psuedoscience on intellect that developed from the same tradition.  Anyway, my time is limited so I'll not edit that section immediately, but if no one does soon, I certainly will.  It should present little problem; justifying that change on the basis of policy and the sources will be the easiest task any Wikipedian ever took on.  ser:Snow Rise|Snow (ser talk:Snow Rise|talk) 17:37, 23 March 2014 (UTC)

Editor review requested for Wikipedia Education Program

user:Salubrious Toxin
The P:Wikipedia Education Program has an oversight system in which the only people who can make course pages for classes are those who have done a tutorial and have had their Wikipedia editing experience checked by two other Wikipedians. There is a user who has done the tutorial but has so little editing experience that it is difficult for others to judge. Because what he has done is related to medicine, I thought that it would be better for me to ask here at the medicine board than on the education board for someone to give a second review of him. I met him in person as a first review, and in my opinion he knows enough about Wikipedia to be responsive to any concerns which arise. He wants to start a Wikipedia club at his medical school and I would like to support him in this. If he had the userright then he would start a course page and begin advertising for an in-person meetup for an editathon at his school, and have his classmates register for the editathon through this course page.

Hello everyone. I have spent more than an hour talking with an instructor at a nearby medical school about her wish to have her OBGYN class contribute to Wikipedia. I plan to organize an in-person workshop with them and support them otherwise in their engagement with Wikipedia.

This instructor has no prior Wikipedia experience nor do the students, and for that reason, it would be difficult for the people coordinating the Education program to evaluate their stated plans and say whether they should have the userright to set up a course page. Could I ask for someone here to review what she has proposed to do as written ikipedia:Education_noticeboard#OBGYN_bootcamp_project|in OBGYN bootcamp project on the noticeboard and give a comment there about the circumstances under which the instructor for this class can have a userright to have a course page?

Two questions to experience reviewers - I think it's a great article but all original research.  Do I make a note to add non-primary and move on or do I need to dig up secondary sources before approving.  Also, the headings are non-standard (e.g. not MEDMOS) but it's a physiology article.  I haven't found any headings guidelines for physiology (although anatomy applies as well).  What do you normally recommend to the authors? ser:Ian Furst|Ian Furst (ser talk:Ian Furst|talk) 12:53, 26 March 2014 (UTC)
Original research = not published in any source.  If it's supported by primary sources, then it's not OR.  That happens a lot when research scientists and grad students write articles, because they think the rules for peer-reviewed journals apply (and journals usually prohibit citations of secondary sources).

 Assessing articles 

Hi everyone,

I've got ser:Kephir/gadgets/rater set up to handle task forces for us now.  If you want to rate articles, and especially if you would like to tag already-rated (but possibly out of date?) articles for task forces, then please consider installing it.  

When you install it and go to any article, you'll get a new tab called &quot;Rater&quot; (near the history tab).  Click that and you'll see the existing tags.  You can add WPMED (type &quot;Medicine&quot; into the box on the bottom left) if it's not there.  Click the [+] by WPMED's entry to see the task forces.  Click and task force's name to list it (e.g., click &quot;Society&quot; for people, schools, and orgs).  Optionally, use the pop-up to set a priority for the task force (if it doesn't match the main rating—e.g., all people are &quot;Low&quot; for the main rating but may be anything for ara|society-imp).  Click 'Save' and you're done.  It's that quick and easy.

Also, Category:Unassessed medicine articles is up over 100 articles again, if anyone has a case of editcountitis going.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 21:33, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

 Project page for conducting good article reviews on medical articles

Specialized criteria for medical GA's?

|WhatamIdoing thanks for having a look. I was thinking that a biomedical type article should be assessed more closely against MEDMOS and MEDRS rather than the existing GA criteria. Also, some aspects of the general guidelines are not relevent (at least that I can see, e.g. &quot;writing about fiction&quot;). 

If this is the kind of thing people would find useful, then OK keep it, otherwise I don't see a great deal of use in another page which duplicates info available elsewhere. Thoughts?  ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 17:31, 23 March 2014 (UTC)

GA is community-wide, so we can't make a medicine-only version.  
We could try to get the community-wide criteria changed; however, I don't think that's necessary, because a good deal of what's in MEDMOS actually falls under the first GA criteria (&quot;A good article is well-written&quot;) and third (&quot;It addresses the main aspects of the topic&quot;).  I think a page to describe special issues or the best way to understand the existing criteria would be just fine.  The important point is not to look like we are setting up &quot;new&quot; or &quot;different&quot; criteria.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 20:08, 23 March 2014 (UTC)
 Oddly enough, GA#2b specifically mentions ikipedia:Scientific citation guidelines for science-based articles, so there's a precedent for encouraging GA nominators to follow MEDMOS and MEDRS for medical articles. I wouldn't encourage reviewers to take a tough line, but GA#2b requires the article to use reliable sources, which is linked to ikipedia:Identifying reliable sources. That has a section P:RS#Medical claims|Medical claims stating q|&quot;It is vital that the biomedical information in all types of articles be based on reliable, third-party, published sources and accurately reflect current medical knowledge&quot; so I guess we could justify a desire to meet MEDRS if pushed on the point.
 This is an interesting idea. How exactly, at least according to Lesion, are the MEDRS and MEDMOS criteria different from the GA criteria as they currently exist? Also, is it more of a problem that medical articles listed as GAs actually shouldn't be, or the other way around? ser:Jinkinson|Jinkinson ser talk:Jinkinson|talk to me 23:57, 23 March 2014 (UTC)
 We hold all medical articles to a very high standard of sourcing, principally because medicine tends to have a lot of very high quality sources and there's no reason not to insist on the best sources, and partially because there's a moral imperative to get it right for the reader who may decide to take what's written here as authoritative medical advice (no matter how many disclaimers we make). From that point-of-view it seems silly not to ask medical GANs to meet the same standards we ask of medical articles that are not GAs. Conventionally, GAs are not required to be perfect, so there's a reluctance to set the bar too high; personally I don't think we do any favours to GANs that fall short of MEDRS, although I'm not so worried about MEDMOS. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 00:24, 24 March 2014 (UTC)
utdentThey would not be hugely different, as pointed out by WAID and RexxS above. Most changes would be little, e.g.:
1b mention MEDMOS. Remove the link to writing about fiction,
2b making this about MEDRS specifically instead of RS
...And that's about all the changes I would suggest. Mostly it is making a general guideline more useful for people working on a particular type of article, not changing the spirit of the main criteria. There was a discussion here a few months ago about potentially making WPMED-specific criteria. Let me search the archives to link to that discussion. ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 00:35, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

A good idea, but it does seem to duplicate most of what is on the GA page. I certainly think that two user groups could deal with some more detailed information about biomedical articles: (1) reviewers, detailing what is/is not a reliable source and how to deal with issues of readability, technical prose and comprehensiveness; (2) users who are not associated with this project and nominate medical articles without proper preparation, a short page outlining MEDMOS and MEDRS; or a template that can be used when quick-failing a review could be very useful. --ser:LT910001|LT910001 (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 02:34, 24 March 2014 (UTC)
You can't remove fiction.  GA is community-wide.  You cannot make a medicine-specific/all-other-subjects-excluding version and still pretend that it's the same thing as the community-wide GA.  If you make a version that excludes fiction or other non-medical content, then it stops being Good articles.  You would need a new name and a separate process, and you would need to remember that the existence of this new &quot;Medical Special Good articles&quot; would not prevent someone from applying for and receiving normal old Good article status.
You could, if you thought it was important (I don't), try to convince the community that the community-wide GA criteria need to explicitly mention MEDMOS.  Unless and until that is actually mentioned, though, reviewers are actually forbidden (read footnote #2) from requiring compliance with it (or any of dozens of other Manual of Style pages).
You don't need to mention MEDRS directly, or to go through SCG (which IMO is a mess).  GA requires all material to be verifiable (even if not sourced) and for five specific types of material to have inline citations supported by a reliable source.  MEDRS is the community-wide definition of what constitutes a reliable source for biomedical (NB:  note social, cultural, historical, biographical, financial, commercial, etc.) material.  You can therefore consider it to be already included, even though not named. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:05, 24 March 2014 (UTC)
Proposed removing the link to &quot;writing about fiction&quot; since it would not be relevant to medical articles (that I can foresee anyway). I understand what you are saying, that GA cannot be changed to make &quot;special medical GA status&quot;, but I believe that medical articles are already assessed against specialized GA criteria, i.e. against MEDRS and MEDMOS ... especially if a WPMED regular editor carries out the review. This would be just making it slightly more &quot;official&quot;. 
Will wait for more discussion on this, I was expecting some controversy ... happy to see what the community wants and I will follow it. 
P.S. I don't know what SCG is? ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 16:32, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

Fair enough. There is also the concern that if one Wikiproject fragments their concerns, what is to stop other Wikiprojects from doing the same thing? One alternative may be to have a &quot;GA preparation checklist&quot; page (on this wikiproject) specific for medical articles. This would address your concerns whilst maintaining the centralised GA process. --ser:LT910001|LT910001 (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 05:38, 26 March 2014 (UTC)
utdentI don't think a GA reviewer will follow it as they are unlikely to have the time/inclincation to look thru project specific guidelines.  In my limited experience (n=3 attempts) I've found the GA good for structure but it does little to encourage discussions on content.

 I can understand and agree with the sentiment that any medical article claiming to be a good article should adhere to MEDRS for biomedical content. But I'll ask, it this currently a problem?

|LT910001, user Blue Rasberry found that WikiProject Military history already have their own class A criteria. It would not be a precedent therefore if simple WPMED criteria for class A were concocted, as has been suggested before. Articles would pass both class A and GA, probably at the same time.

|Ian Furst, there is a short statement in which the nominator states why they have nominated this article for GA. In this section, a link to that page could be placed, then a non-WPMED reviewer would be more likely to see it. ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 11:44, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

|Mark viking, I have only made 3 GA nominations, and even in that small number the thoroughness of the review was very variable. There are some reviewers who (rightly imo) will want to check every single source, run the text through a program which checks for plagiarism, and carefully considers the wording of every single sentence. These are definitely good articles. Other reviewers are not familiar with MEDRS and the MEDMOS and do not appear to check references against them. Here is one recent example that me and Ian nominated: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Toothache/GA1], and I am certain that many others who have nominated GA may corroborate this variation in the standard of the review. ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 11:45, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

So yes agree that the quality / thoroughness of reviews at GA are variable. I have nominated articles that have just passed GA review for re-review when they miss the mark by a long way.

Oppose standardised format. I do not see a convincing reason why editors should have to confirm to one or other date style if they so choose. This is a solution looking for a problem.

 Wikimania 2014 London health presentations 

Hello. At m2014:Main_Page|London Wikimania the following presentations are proposed to discuss health topics.

Wikimania 2014 London presentation proposals
*m2014:Submissions/Wikipedia and Medicine
*m2014:Submissions/Perspectives in Medicine on Wikipedia
*m2014:Submissions/Wikipedia and Underpriviledged Community
*m2014:Submissions/Informed Health
*m2014:Submissions/Reform of citation structure for all Wikimedia projects

Comments are welcome at any of these proposals. I myself am sort-of volunteering for two panels that I proposed myself, the &quot;perspectives in medicine&quot; panel and the &quot;reform of citation&quot; panel. While I would present, more than wanting to present I wish other people would present. Especially for the medicine panel, if anyone where is attending Wikimania in London this summer, please feel encouraged to sign on as a presenter.

James is giving the &quot;Wikipedia and Medicine&quot; talk which would be great but while we have an audience, there really is room for several medical presentations at this conference. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 16:38, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

 Jimbo Wales on adequate sources for articles on medical treatments 

There is a lot of blog coverage of a change.org petition calling on Wikipedia to adjust its editorial policies to allow in more article text about &quot;holistic approaches to healing.&quot; Jimbo Wales [http://www.change.org/petitions/jimmy-wales-founder-of-wikipedia-create-and-enforce-new-policies-that-allow-for-true-scientific-discourse-about-holistic-approaches-to-healing/responses/11054 responded], &quot;Wikipedia's policies around this kind of thing are exactly spot-on and correct. If you can get your work published in respectable scientific journals - that is to say, if you can produce evidence through replicable scientific experiments, then Wikipedia will cover it appropriately.&quot; See the [http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2014/03/25/an-excellent-response-to-complaints-about-medical-topics-on-wikipedia/ Respectful Insolence] blog by a medical doctor, the [http://skeptools.wordpress.com/2014/03/25/wikipedia-jimmy-wales-responds-change-org-alt-med-alternative-medicine-cam/ Skeptical Software Tools] blog, and other blogs for more details.

 Nursing and nursing journals 

Hi, is nursing considered a subfield of medicine or is it a field that runs parallel to it? I am asking because of this ikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2014 March 16#Category:Gastrointestinal nursing journals|CFD discussion, where it was decided to merge a couple of nursing journals into a medical journal category. Up till now, nursing journals are categorized in a categorization tree that basically runs parallel to the medical journals category and both |Medical journals and |Nursing journals are categorized as subcategories of |Healthcare journals. Should we maintain this scheme (and ask for a -partial- reversal of the before-mentioned CFD) or should we merge both category trees (implying that, e.g., |Oncology nursing journals will be merged into |Oncology journals? The current situation (where all specialty nursing journals are kept separately from specialty medical journals, except for the gastrointestinal ones) is rather undesirable, I feel. I'd appreciate any input from knowledgeable editors here and am cross-posting to the Nursing and Academic Journals wikiprojects. Thanks. --ser:Randykitty|Randykitty (ser talk:Randykitty|talk) 11:20, 27 March 2014 (UTC)
It's a separate, parallel field. It has different educational requirements, separate licensure and a different process for entry to practice. I can understand the need to keep things simple, but I think it's more accurate to keep medical and nursing journals separate. ser:EricEnfermero|EricEnfermero ser talk:EricEnfermero|HOWDY! 12:08, 27 March 2014 (UTC)
I can't say that I find &quot;different educational requirements, separate licensure and a different process for entry to practice&quot; convincing arguments. The same goes for eneral physicians, odiatrists, and ardiac surgeons... --ser:Randykitty|Randykitty (ser talk:Randykitty|talk) 12:15, 27 March 2014 (UTC)
Here's where I would disagree: The groups that you mention generally undertake an undergrad four-year education followed by doctoral study and additional postgraduate residency training; two of the three are licensed by the same boards; and almost all members of those three groups undergo hospital credentialing processes. Nurses go through almost none of that and have a completely different role in health delivery most of the time. I appreciate you seeking comments though; nurses seem to be pretty underrepresented on Wikipedia and I think it means something just to be heard. I think we can agree that - whatever is decided - it's not ideal to have one specialty (gastrointestinal journals) handled differently than the rest. ser:EricEnfermero|EricEnfermero ser talk:EricEnfermero|HOWDY! 12:41, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

Nursing is a healthcare field, but is separate from medicine, at least academically. For instance at UCSF, a medical school, the School of Nursing is separate and parallel with the School of Medicine. While we are at it, pharmacy should be considered separate from the others, as well as the llied health professions. See, for instance, ealth care provider#Practitioners and professionals. Putting dentistry journals under the medical journals is probably wrong, too. --ser:Mark viking|Mark viking (ser talk:Mark viking|talk) 13:40, 27 March 2014 (UTC)
*comment The category system is not intended to delineate crisp differentiation between fields; its purpose is navigation. As an example this [http://tools.wmflabs.org/catscan2/quick_intersection.php?lang=en&amp;project=wikipedia&amp;cats=Nursing%0D%0AMedicine&amp;ns=0&amp;depth=5&amp;max=30000&amp;start=0&amp;format=html&amp;redirects=&amp;callback=&amp;norun query] which only goes 5 levels deep shows 5600 articles which are categorized in both the l|Nursing tree and the l|Medicine tree, so we aren't violating some rigid separation wall by doing so again. Ultimately, I think we can have both - a separate tree of nursing journals, but also categorize the nursing journals underneath the medicine tree, since the medicine tree has more generic names - e.g. |Oncology journals as parent of |Oncology nursing journals - why would we want to prevent readers from discovering that there is a whole tree of nursing journals devoted to the subject of Oncology? If you want to try to be *really* fair, you could have l|Oncology journals as the parent, and then siblings of l|Oncology medical journals and l|Oncology nursing journals and l|Oncology public health journals but frankly I think it's a bit exaggerated. As for that CFD, the reason it was deleted is smallcat - if you don't have enough to justify a category - and usually 2 isn't enough - the cat is deleted. So, I don't see any need to reverse that CFD either.--ser:Obiwankenobi|Obi-Wan Kenobi (ser talk:Obiwankenobi|talk) 16:07, 27 March 2014 (UTC)
*I wouldn't propose to reverse the CfD completely, just the decision to merge to the medical journals cat. But I like your proposal of categorizing the nursing specialty journal cats under the medical specialty journal cats, and for smaller cats just include them in the medical journal cat as now happened with the gastrointestinal nursing journals. --ser:Randykitty|Randykitty (ser talk:Randykitty|talk) 16:48, 27 March 2014 (UTC)
*Based on this discussion I agree that Nursing journals should be kept in a separate category - although I have no problem if it is a separate category within the category of medicine. Otherwise, I think it is burdening one category too much when combining medicine and nursing journals. --- ser:Steve Quinn|Steve Quinn (ser talk:Steve Quinn|talk) 06:38, 29 March 2014 (UTC)

I have been reading a lot of articles about professors, and I was surprised to find that many very well known professors don't even have a Google Scholar profile.  Apparently this is common among some professors who were tenured before its use became common, and those who decide to list their work in other places.  I also found that the citation level varies a lot from one subject area to another, depending on if it's customary to write journal papers, publish whole books, go on lecture/conference tours, etc.  His title of &quot;Professor Emeritas&quot; tells me that he is likely mostly retired. Anyway, thanks for taking the time to look at this.

 Google scholar is not the only possible test.

This is history of medicine not medicine, and MEDRES standards do not apply.  Google Scholar is particularly useless for people in the humanities, and using the number of books in a library needs to be considered by subject--essentially no scholarly books reach 1000.)  But the only way of judging notability we have is to hold a discussion at AfD The general practice at AfC is to accept any article likely to pass afd -- some people define likely at 50%; I use 60%, and if I've done any work on it, aim much higher. Considering the very extensive German article, and the very high notability standards of the German WP, and their much greater competence than the enWP in dealing with the academic humanities, including those studying East Asia. I've accepted the article. We can deal with further improvements (or challenges) later, as with all articles. ser:DGG| DGG (ser talk:DGG| talk ) 20:01, 30 March 2014 (UTC)

 I've seen it discussed in both [http://www.jcm.co.uk/product/catalog/product/view/6737/reflections-on-the-german-acupuncture-studies/ Journal of Chinese Medicine] and [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3155101/ Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine], but it's obvious what the problem is - only the journals specifically related to acupuncture would be concerned about whether German health insurance companies paid out for acupuncture or not. It would not have even dented the consciousness of mainstream journals - why would it? So my advice to QG is to leave it be: there won't be anything that we'd want to use as sources, and without best-quality sources, it's not worth expending energy on.

 ffects of pornography‎ article 

The rticle|Effects of pornography article could use significant help from this WikiProject, and so can the Effects section of the ornography article, which I mentioned in the edit summary before [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pornography&amp;diff=601975793&amp;oldid=601974827 this latest edit there.] I might have mentioned the Effects of pornography‎ article at this WikiProject before (will need to check the archives to be certain), but I've had it on my P:Watchlist since 2012 (temporarily took it off my WP:Watchlist) and I've mainly seen POV editing there about pornography's effect on health and crime, with few improvements going on there. I'm not sure how active the research is on the effects of pornography‎ with regard to health or crime, but, judging by the sources used in that article, one could conclude that the research is not very active on the topic or at least that there are not many reviews coming out on it. So, per ikipedia:MEDRS#Use up-to-date evidence, this may be an area where P:Primary sources are the rule instead of the exception or are at least not as discouraged as they usually are with regard to health topics. ser:Tgeorgescu|Tgeorgescu and ser:Drbogdan|Drbogdan are the latest editors of that article and Drbogdan added some more references to the lead (though, per P:CITELEAD, references don't necessarily need to be in the lead).

 ipedema 

Dear medicine experts, could you please take a look at this article? Since it was created in 2005, it has had only two references (one of which is dead), but it makes a number of questionable statements, such as an 11% incidence, a claim that &quot;in recent years growing awareness of lipedema has come from internet sources&quot;, and various other completely unsupported statements about specific details. There is a recent comment in the alk:Lipedema|talk page asserting that the article is a subtle promotion of cosmetic surgery, which may make sense, as it states that &quot;lipedemic fat generally cannot be lost through diet and exercise&quot;. It doesn't help that the article is extremely vague as to the causes of the condition; it first states that lipedema can be inherited while stating that the cause is unknown in a different section, but it seems to me that accumulating fatty tissue is different from the swelling of fatty tissue, which is what dema implies ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3309375/ this article] calls lipedema a &quot;rare disease&quot; characterised by hyperplasia of individual fat cells).

There are no great plans to scale up the Wikimedia publication of academic sources, and for that reason, I see no reason for a special response to this even though comments on the proposal are welcome as for any Wikimedia proposal.

 eta:Grants:IEG/Medicine Translation Project Community Organizing|Medical translation Individual Engagement Grant 

I'd like to ask you all to take a look at a Wikimedia IEG grant a few of us here at Wikiproject MED are behind.
You may already have heard of the translation of medical articles that is being done (if not please take a look at ikipedia:WikiProject Medicine/Translation Task Force). The goal of the grant I've applied for is to get some traction so as to have the translation and integration process going smoothly.
We've come far at ikipedia:WikiProject Medicine/Translation task force/RTT, but to get further there is need of some form of organization, preferably by someone who can devote significant time to the task.

I'm very hopefull that I can provide real benefit with this grant, as there are so many articles on Wikipedia that could help people all over the world.
It's even more important when you take into account drives such as ikipedia Zero, which gives readers who might not have access to anything else access to Wikipedia.

Please take a look at the grant page: eta:Grants:IEG/Medicine Translation Project Community Organizing|Medicine Translation Project Community Organizing, and add a comment or give your ideas on how we can best benefit other Wikipedia communities.

 P:Student assignment: aginismus,  ervical cancer and a few other vaginal-related articles 

I saw [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Vaginismus&amp;diff=602527156&amp;oldid=564389888 this], and decided to let this WikiProject know that a class will be working on the Vaginismus, Cervical cancer and a few other vaginal-related articles; more information is here: ducation Program:Harvard University/Obgyn bootcamp (April 2014). ser:Flyer22|Flyer22 (ser talk:Flyer22|talk) 05:15, 3 April 2014 (UTC)
Looks promising. Considering the name of the course I'd think those taking it were medical students, or maybe even interns, probably with a rather good understanding of the materials. If we're proactive and get into contact with the instructor to make sure P:MEDMOS and P:MEDRS are followed this could be really good. ser:CFCF|CFCF (ser talk:CFCF|talk · pecial:Contributions/CFCF|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/CFCF|email) 08:18, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

|CFCF and |Flyer22 I will be presenting to this class in person next week. Some of the students have already registered for the class and I think we all would appreciate any comments anyone has once they have developed their articles. They seem enthusiastic. Thanks for noticing. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 14:49, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

 New user edits at epression (mood) 

A new user ser:Naimanadeem|Naimanadeem has made several edits to this article today, using a few primary sources to reference his/her edits. I am at a loss whether these are considered acceptable under P:MEDRS, but lean towards suggesting they be replaced by better secondary sources.
The reason why I am hesitant is because we make the distinction between ajor depressive disorder and epression (mood), something which not all sources do in the same way, and some of the primary sources target depression in general and not specifically major depressive disorder.
Thoughts?

Yes, it is a bit of a headache that some medical articles use &quot;depression&quot; as an abbreviation for &quot;major depression&quot; and thus &quot;major depressive disorder&quot;. Many of the edits look reasonable and the statements look like they should be able to be supported by secondary sources, although there's one or two that mightn't be. Best would be to look for review articles and see what can be replaced. ser:Casliber|Cas Liber (ser talk:Casliber|talk · pecial:Contributions/Casliber|contribs) 18:53, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

 ikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Meningioangiomatosis 

Dear medical experts:  Is this a notable topic, and should the old Afc submission be kept and improved instead of being deleted as a stale draft?  —ser:Anne Delong|Anne Delong (ser talk:Anne Delong|talk) 14:05, 3 April 2014 (UTC)
I did some citation cleanup, wikilinks, etc but it still needs inlining of citations. For a short stub with only a few refs, that should not really be a showstopper. ser:LeadSongDog|LeadSongDog ser talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl! 16:58, 3 April 2014 (UTC)
While doing the above, I noted that there's no target article for poradic disease as distinct from amilial diseaseand  ereditary disease, both of which redirect to enetic disorder. Any thoughts on whether they need distinct articles, or is another redirect to the one catch-all sufficient? ser:LeadSongDog|LeadSongDog ser talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl! 19:43, 3 April 2014 (UTC)</segment>
