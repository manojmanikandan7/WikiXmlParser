We may need to change our referencing requirements to only allow sources published before the existence of Wikipedia.

Trying to verify that these are all names for leptospirosis: Weil's syndrome, canicola fever, canefield fever, nanukayami fever, 7-day fever, Rat Catcher's Yellows, Fort Bragg fever, black jaundice, and Pretibial fever. We list them all back in 2010.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leptospirosis&amp;oldid=404489759]

This textbook lists them in the same order as us [http://books.google.ca/books?id=mX1XAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA189#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false] its from 2013. This textbooks list the same order [http://books.google.ca/books?id=mvO2wKDjtGMC&amp;pg=PA402] and it is from 2012. So does this textbook [http://books.google.ca/books?id=m7vT6i3xmC4C&amp;pg=PA54]. Exact same order from 2012. Gah. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 07:15, 14 March 2014 (UTC)

Any of the print on demand publishers should be considered as suspect, especially when there are no earlier editions.

In such cases,  may be useful in warning editors to avoid the wikibook, but we really need a systemic scanning tool looking at each newly added reference to test for such.LeadSongDog come howl! 13:03, 14 March 2014 (UTC)
I wonder... Amazon seems to be hip-deep in this trade. Can Jeff Bezos et al. be persuaded to dedicate some of their vast computing resources to QA of the products they're selling?  No doubt there's a truth in advertising argument to be made, but they might simply want to protect their brand. LeadSongDog come howl! 13:39, 14 March 2014 (UTC)

Just a note on that last one, Boundless publish direct copies of Wikipedia, so they are always off-limits. CFCF (talk ·  · ) 15:08, 14 March 2014 (UTC)

Book LLC is not owned by amazon though is it? Do we know how much they make from books that openly copy and paste from Wikipedia? Would be happy to approach them. We just need a well thought out argument for why they should care. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 23:09, 14 March 2014 (UTC)
While attribution is good, it doesn't solve the circular referencing problem. These books have a number of characteristics that can be auto detected at least in principle.  All are published in recent years, have very few if any copies held in major libraries, and most are attributed to one of a handful of publishers that are themselves fairly new. They sell only online. I'm pretty sure a bot could be crafted that would be able to flag these if we agree it is needed.LeadSongDog come howl! 03:12, 15 March 2014 (UTC)

Duplicates

Hyperkinetic disorder. ADHD.  See the infobox in hyperkinetic disorder.  Note the definition/nomenclature provided for IDC10 .  Also note that the former is basically just an article on ADHD.

I realize the former, per the ICD10 page, is a &quot;group&quot; of disorders as well as &quot;ADHD&quot;, but the group is so insignificant/arbitrary that I don't think it should be an article.  Should the former just redirect to the latter? Seppi333 (Insert 2¢ | ) 21:22, 15 March 2014 (UTC)
Yes one is the ICD10 term the other is the DSM term. The DSM term has predominance in usage. I would support a merge as they are two different classification for the the same thing. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 23:28, 15 March 2014 (UTC)

I censored 3 sections w/ comments - left a note with each censor.  Most of [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dabigatran&amp;diff=599784286&amp;oldid=599776655 these edits] are just layout edits to collapse the TOC/organize the article and fix section headers.  I only checked one section for primary sources - it was mostly cited with recent reviews.  Hopefully the rest of the article is cited similarly. Still a lot left to organize/check in this article. Seppi333 (Insert 2¢ | ) 22:45, 15 March 2014 (UTC)
I have placed those sections on the talk page. And re-organized the article per . Trimmed a lot of the primary research which provided content that was overly details.

More eyes on Daniel Amen

I added the tag for this project on the talk page. I hope that it was accurate to do so. Amen's article is going under a full overhaul, and that might be an improvement. However, a number of statements seem to cast doubt on many, possible most, aspects of his work. I'm concerned Wikipedia is characterizing him as some sort of quack, when I'm not sure that is quite accurate. [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=%22daniel+amen%22&amp;btnG=&amp;as_sdt=1%2C5&amp;as_sdtp= a Google Scholar search] suggests he has some credibility, or at least sway. I don't feel my experience in medical issues will be terribly useful here, and would very much appreciate anyone familiar with him/his fields of study, to have a look.
If he is using SPECT scans to &quot;diagnose&quot; ADHD and pushing vitamin supplements, yup there are issues. And the titles of his books, wow. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 08:53, 14 March 2014 (UTC)
I don't know if he is doing that, or if that is another mischaracterization of what he does do. Or even if he is pioneering in the field, and trying to share what he feels are areas of further investigation. That he dumbs down complex issues, in order to get people to make better life choices, seems admirable. I don't know that any of it is that cut and dry. A thoughtful look at his life is undoubtably a good read, a tar and feathering, maybe not so much. My hunch is that items are being cherry-picked, and used against him. In fairness, others may feel that is a good solution to counteract promotional editing which has been accused on the talk page. I encourage people to have a look and address anything the feel needs it. Sportfan5000 (talk) 09:25, 14 March 2014 (UTC)
Wikipedia is in fact rather soft on him compared to many comments in RS. Have you read the article's Talk page? Alexbrn talk||COI 09:30, 14 March 2014 (UTC)
Looked back in the history and there appears to be some COI editing. It seems like there was an attempt to promote him and his business on Wikipedia. And we have had a few editors deal with it. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 09:51, 14 March 2014 (UTC)
 you are framing things in terms of how you feel and your hunches. Please note that there are policies and guidelines at play that govern health related content:   (policy),   (guideline) and  (guideline).  Folks working on the article are making judgements based on their solid knowledge of these policies and guidelines.  Discussion needs to remain grounded on policies and guidelines, not on feelings and hunches.  Thanks. Jytdog (talk) 12:45, 14 March 2014 (UTC)


I originally posted this on the Biographies of Living Persons Noticeboard, section on Daniel Amen but thought I would add this here as well, as it might actually be even more relevant here in this discussion--

Medical-FRINGE is about science, but psychology is not, and never can be, purely a science--   

I have a concern that the Daniel Amen article is being treated like a &quot;science article&quot; when, in fact, much of the topic is about psychology, which can never be a &quot;pure science&quot;. 

I think treating a psychology article (such as this one) like it is about &quot;pure science&quot;, is misguided. Treating Psychology as a science has inherent limits-- that is, in reality, psychology is much more of what is called a &quot;soft science&quot; than it ever could be a &quot;hard science&quot;. Science can help in the understanding of psychology, and should be used as much as possible to the extent that it can help, but there is something about psychology that is more elusive and much more difficult to pin down. There is an aspect of psychology that is very hard to apply hard science in any conclusive way.    

In a nutshell, psychology is inherently subjective, when science is a practice in objectivity. (Psychology being an essential part of what psychiatry is, in addition to the neurological and pharmaceutical aspects). All of this makes it much harder to &quot;scientifically evaluate&quot; things that involve psychological states of mind. 

 *So psychiatrists are all less scientific than they appear to be (including Dr. Amen's critics). And so are neuroscientists, when they start talking about psychology.  

Psychiatry is far from being a &quot;cut and dried&quot; field, and that applies as much to Dr. Amen's critics as it does to Dr. Amen. I therefore fear that treating critics of a psychological theory as if they are the &quot;voice of science&quot; is giving these critics authority that they do not deserve. Of course Dr. Amen should not get authority that he does not deserve either. But this does not take us to the same place as a &quot;FRINGE conclusion. Instead it takes us to a place of not being able to know much of anything for sure. And so a responsible article would rely more heavily on the &quot;this can not be known for sure either way tone&quot;, than a FRINGE tone. There can be no FRINGE where there is no science, or in this case, some science, but not enough science. This cuts both ways, applying just as much to Dr. Amen's critics as it does to Dr. Amen.  

Thanks.

Cliffswallow-vaulting (talk) 20:22, 15 March 2014 (UTC)

Giving the article a medical-fringe angle then implies that psychology is medical when it is not, or not sufficiently so for the purposed of medical fringe or science fringe designations.
Cliffswallow-vaulting (talk) 20:25, 15 March 2014 (UTC)

My biggest concern is that medicalizing this subject, also encourages medicalizing other psychology articles. Which opens the door to subjecting them all to medical-fringe or science-fringe designations. The ramifications go far beyond this article. 

It's the wrong standard and could be abused elsewhere (in other psychology articles). 

Psychology, despite it's inherent resistance to scientific method, deserves to exist and has value, without being hammered by FRINGE accusations. Better that everyone knows to take psychology with a grain of salt, rather than to label all of it as a falsehood.

Cliffswallow-vaulting (talk) 20:25, 15 March 2014 (UTC)

Are you suggesting that the use of SPECT scans doesn't fall within the remit of the scientific method? AndyTheGrump (talk) 20:30, 15 March 2014 (UTC)

I'm saying that SPECT scans are combined with psychological evaluations-- so once you combine a Hard science method with a Soft science method, there is really no clear hard science anymore. You can't anymore prove it than disprove it.

Therefore saying that it is proven is not right, but saying that it has been dis-proven is also not right. What you can say is that there is disagreement and criticism.Cliffswallow-vaulting (talk) 05:24, 16 March 2014 (UTC)

I'm going through a GA review at present and the reviewer finds the use of the term &quot;Indications&quot; as a section heading confusing (in this case referring to a surgical procedure).  Although indications is listed in MEDMOS, is there another (more layperson-friendly) term that is commonly used? Ian Furst (talk) 17:58, 14 March 2014 (UTC)

You might consider &quot;uses&quot; or &quot;applications&quot;, but I agree that &quot;indications&quot; is the most precise term. DoctorJoeE /talk to me! 18:08, 14 March 2014 (UTC)
I think they have a point as, though the most precise word, &quot;indications&quot; is not generally understood the way that say &quot;diagnosis&quot; is. If we are talking about Dental implant#Indications (as it now is), something like &quot;Types and uses&quot; best summarizes the content there. Johnbod (talk) 18:14, 14 March 2014 (UTC)
Indications is not esoteric medical word, it is used in everyday parlance. Don't think more clumsy terms like &quot;uses&quot;, &quot;applications&quot;, &quot;type&quot; or even &quot;reasons&quot; (e.g. as seen on Dental_extraction#Reasons) are particularly needed. Only reasons adequately reproduces the meaning of the original word... but it doesn't sound particularly encyclopedic imo. Should use the term which the sources are using. Link to Indication (medicine) in the first sentence of the section if needed. Lesion (talk) 18:24, 14 March 2014 (UTC)
Indications is not used in &quot;everyday parlance&quot; with the medical meaning where I live (mind you, neither is &quot;parlance&quot;). The link can't be used in a heading, though it should be used in the text.  In what seems to be the example concerned here the section covers more than a narrow interpretation of &quot;indications&quot; in any case. Johnbod (talk) 18:32, 14 March 2014 (UTC)
 The term confused  who, from what I can see, has a lot of experience with reviewing articles.  If it confused this user, I'm going to assume that it will confuse the average person.  However, it's part of medmos so I didn't want to make a change that was non-uniform.  I can't link it in the title as  said. Personally, I'm not sure the average reader would understand that an indication is &quot;a valid reason&quot; for an operation/procedure/test. Ian Furst (talk) 18:39, 14 March 2014 (UTC)
and Tony's American.  There may well be a  issue here too. In the US drug packaging leaflets are apparently required by legislation to use the term; in the UK they are not and patient information will typically (normally, always?) avoid it, having a section called something like &quot;What FOO tablets are and what they are used for&quot;.  Another reason to be cautious in using the term, and maybe note an ENGVAR issue at MEDMOS. Johnbod (talk) 18:41, 14 March 2014 (UTC)
Just took a poll in my house (n=2) and neither thought the meaning was intuitive. Ian Furst (talk) 18:46, 14 March 2014 (UTC)
=D wouldn't that be ? But, I have to insist that indication(s) is not an esoteric word. I suspect that it is not originally a medical term... medicine has borrowed it from ordinary English. &quot;Did the volcano give any indications that it was about to erupt?&quot; Lesion (talk) 18:51, 14 March 2014 (UTC)
I think, overall, that the recommended headings in the MEDMOS would have to be changed before your reviewer would be able to appropriately ask for this section to change... Lesion (talk) 18:58, 14 March 2014 (UTC)
I agree with Lesion -- &quot;indications&quot; is the proper term, and can be linked to Indication (medicine) in the first sentence of the section if you are seriously concerned that readers will not understand; although its meaning becomes intuitively obvious once readers begin reading the section.  Reducing descriptors to the lowest common denominator, at the expense of precision, is a mistake in an encyclopedia, IMHO. DoctorJoeE /talk to me! 19:00, 14 March 2014 (UTC)
I was going to say &quot;Of course it's &quot;not originally a medical term&quot;! But the medical meaning is different from the normal ones...&quot; until I looked at the OED, who in fact say it &quot;apparently&quot; is the earliest sense, dating to 1541, though in fact the early citations seem closer to &quot;symptom&quot; in modern usage, as &quot;indications&quot; of what a patient's condition is, not what to do about it. I think Ian (and Tony) are right to think it is not very generally understood in its precise modern medical sense of &quot;a valid reason to use a certain test, medication, procedure, or surgery&quot; (our article, from Mirriam-Webster).  You get on to the 2nd page of the 935 hits in a search for &quot;indications&quot; on the UK NHS website [http://www.nhs.uk/Search/Pages/Results.aspx?q=indication] before you hit a use in this technical sense.  Johnbod (talk) 19:04, 14 March 2014 (UTC)

But that sense is still in use. &quot;Night sweats might indicate malaria&quot;. This is the same sense as the nonmedical use: &quot;Rumbling might indicate that the volcano is about to erupt&quot;. The other sense of the word, as something (e.g. sign/symptom or specific condition) which triggers something else to happen (e.g. a specific treatment choice over another), is also not confined to medicine. &quot;A rumbling volcano indicates that you should quickly move to safety.&quot; I have difficulty understanding how there is any difference between the medical use and the nonmedical use of the term. Lesion (talk) 19:25, 14 March 2014 (UTC)
With respect, that's probably why you are a dentist, not a lexicographer. OED distinguishes 4 senses of the noun, of which the medical is 1b (also 4 for the verb). Try seeing how many of the 935 uses in the link above mean &quot;a valid reason to use a certain test, medication, procedure, or surgery&quot;, or to take any form of action. Johnbod (talk) 19:34, 14 March 2014 (UTC)
Even if we agreed that indications is a common enough term to let it stand, the next logical question would be, &quot;Is contra-indications intuitive to the layperson?&quot;.  We need to consider the terms together. Is &quot;Reasons for use&quot; and &quot;Reasons not to use&quot; any less percise? Maybe &quot;Indications for use&quot; Btw - what is the average reading comprehension level of an english speaking user? Ian Furst (talk) 19:49, 14 March 2014 (UTC)

&quot;Contraindication&quot; can be wikilinked just as easily as can &quot;indication&quot;.  &quot;Reasons for use/not use&quot; is clumsy and unencyclopedic; &quot;indications for use&quot; is redundant. DoctorJoeE /talk to me! 19:59, 14 March 2014 (UTC)
Personally, and rather perversely, I think &quot;contra-indications&quot;, as effectively only a medical term (or at least a scientific/technical one), is rather less confusing to the average reader. The question is not just whether to use or not use, but whether to use and explain, as well as linking. If used, I think they should be explained, and if used in a header, explained right afterwards. Johnbod (talk) 20:05, 14 March 2014 (UTC)
 K - I'll leave it as is for now and provide a link to this discussion for the reviewer.  I don't think there will be a clear concensus on the terms anytime soon. If there is any desire for more discussion, I'm happy to be involved.  As it stands now; 2 think it should change and 2 think it should stay the same.  No agreement on an alternative. Ian Furst (talk) 20:25, 14 March 2014 (UTC)
I much prefer &quot;medical uses&quot; and &quot;recreational uses&quot;. Indications more refers to the position of oversight bodies such as the FDA and Health Canada.

Agree with James.  For style and an understandable categorization, its straightforward to name the main section &quot;Uses&quot; and subheadings (if relevant) &quot;Medical&quot;, &quot;Recreational&quot;, &quot;Performance enhancing&quot;/&quot;Enhancing performance&quot;, etc. E.g., Methamphetamine#Uses &amp; Amphetamine#Uses. Seppi333 (Insert 2¢ | ) 22:22, 14 March 2014 (UTC)
I'll change to medical uses in the article.  Thanks for reviewing everyone.  Ian Furst (talk) 22:27, 14 March 2014 (UTC)
&quot;Medical uses&quot; is not always a suitable substitute for &quot;indications&quot;. In this article particularly, it doesn't make a great deal of sense to use this language about a surgical procedure. Surgical sources use the term medical to mean non-surgical. Lesion (talk) 22:46, 14 March 2014 (UTC)
Yes but that comes from a time when surgeons cut hair. Now they are doctors like the rest of us :-) Common usage is that medical means both &quot;surgery and non-surgery&quot; Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 22:53, 14 March 2014 (UTC)
In a surgical context, medical may mean nonsurgical, and this occurs in modern sources. &quot;Medical uses&quot; makes less sense than &quot;Reasons&quot;, which is the most accurate substitute so far suggested, not that I think substitution is required. Lesion (talk) 23:11, 14 March 2014 (UTC)

User adding many primary sources

Every single one of their edits I have looked at begins with &quot;A recent study showed that ... &quot; cited with a primary source. Not checked to see if any of the authors' names are recurring. Lesion (talk) 14:35, 14 March 2014 (UTC)
There's a lot of that. It's way past time we had a bot marking citations of papers that PubMed identifies as having a particular publication type, as with:  Journal Article (as opposed to Review, Systematic review, or Meta-analysis). I know we've talked about it before, but I don't think we ever actually raised a  for it. The approach is not without minor drawbacks, but we can't afford to allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good here.
The  template can take the parameter  (e.g.) which is suitable for the purpose of capturing the information.

Have never heard of this, and there's no citations in the article. Is it a hoax, a myth or an exaggeration? What's the deal? --Harizotoh9 (talk) 22:57, 17 March 2014 (UTC)
No it's real. A bit old but I have heard of it in a few textbooks. Lesion (talk) 23:19, 17 March 2014 (UTC)
I have added one of the 3 PubMed results to the article. Apparently there's an urban legend going around that says if you pop a pimple in the triangle (aka the &quot;triangle of death&quot;) you can cause an infection because the bacteria travel to the back of the brain, and from there they travel to your sinuses. &quot;If not treated right away, an infection in your sinus cavity can be very serious, leading to paralysis, loss of vision, or even death.&quot; [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/25/popping-pimples-kill-you-infection_n_3961886.html] Jinkinson talk to me 00:03, 18 March 2014 (UTC)
Probably over-dramatic.  From what I remember in anatomy, the risk is of valveless facial veins allowing retrograde flow to the cavernous sinus or brain causing either brain abscess or cavernous sinus thrombosis.  I've seen one of each in 20 years with little evidence it came from something like this.  Neurosx may have something more to say about it, but it's relatively uncommon.

Thanks guys. I was afraid it might be some kind of a hoax or myth. It should be re-written. Also what is the actual proper terminology? Maybe it should also be merged into another article? --Harizotoh9 (talk) 07:26, 18 March 2014 (UTC)

Any aspect of myth has to do with how common it is. As far as I know its extremely rare, and the article states that most people, but not all have valves in their facial veins. I think it would be good to get some numbers or incidence in there. It is a real phenomena, but Wikipedia should be careful so as not to exaggerate the danger.

Added 5 references - may need some rewording.  One of the original studies is from 1937 (as a link to the full original article) called it the danger area because 61% of cases of cavernous sinus thrombosis were the result of furuncles in the area. But the term comes from 1850's! Ian Furst (talk) 14:29, 18 March 2014 (UTC)

Sex therapy article 

 significantly expanded the Sex therapy article today as part of a . I've cleaned up the content a bit, but the expansions could use the assessment of others from WP:MED (such as how the article should be organized and if any content and/or sources should be removed). Flyer22 (talk) 17:01, 18 March 2014 (UTC)

That is obviously a major improvement.  It's gone from two general references (one weak) to more than a dozen inline citations.  The sources include textbooks and academic journals.  It covers aging, which is an area that our articles (especially sex-related articles) are often biased against.  It's not perfect (what article is?), but it is a major improvement.
Also, I think it meets the  rules for fivefold expansion.  Perhaps someone would like to write a hook and nominate it?  The main page benefits from having general interest articles like this.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 17:35, 18 March 2014 (UTC)

Agreed. Flyer22 (talk) 17:54, 18 March 2014 (UTC)

The aging thing, though, that seems to be a wide academic bias; the vast majority of sexuality/sexual activity sources I come across focus on youth or those who are middle aged, but with the middle age portion usually only covering those in their 30s, 40s or early 50s (ages that are still young by many people's standards, especially those in their 30s)...if ages are mentioned or discussed. And this aspect, that sexuality/sexual activity research often does not focus on older adults, is also another piece that the Sex therapy article addresses. Flyer22 (talk) 18:14, 18 March 2014 (UTC)

Writer's block

Any suggestions for a better opening sentence?
&quot;Anesthesia, or anaesthesia (from Greek , an-, &quot;without&quot;; and , aisthēsis, &quot;sensation&quot;), is a temporary, drug induced state the purpose of which is to reach one or all of the three endpoints of hypnosis, analgesia and muscle relaxation.&quot;
Ian Furst (talk) 19:30, 18 March 2014 (UTC)
 Personally, I'd prefer the current opening paragraph. In the lead we ought to avoid medical jargon: for example, analgesia - even wikilinked - is not as good as &quot;reduction of pain&quot; for a lay reader. Also, from a diving medicine standpoint, air is an anaesthetic at sufficient depth (see Nitrogen narcosis) and Xenon is a [http://www.general-anaesthesia.com/xenon-anaesthesia.html usable anaesthetic at normal pressure]. The anaesthetic effect of air under pressure doesn't fit well with our normal concept of a drug and narcosis is not a purposeful effect. I know it's not much help to your writer's block, but it might help to see as broad a picture as possible when trying to write definitions. --RexxS (talk) 20:06, 18 March 2014 (UTC)

Access to wikilibrary

A bit of a strange request here, but have been working on  articles recently and have hit a bit of a loggerhead: can't find any good sources for the history of organs. May seem like a strange issue, but per our recent changes to  (and common sense) I need some historical data to get organ articles up to GA... eg who discovered or first documented organs etc., but this is quite difficult now, requiring a lot of digging for each organ. Without the prospect of GA it is a little demotivating to make random edits that only somewhat improve articles. Finding comprehensive and reliable sources is really quite difficult.

I have heard that Wikilibrary can sometimes help with this, by providing online access to some sources? I'm not sure what sources are available, but I've used Google books to access some pages of these books and they are very high-quality and was wondering if someone could point me in the right direction? (such as how to add them to the library, or access them if they are already there?)

Thanks all for your help. The two books I am looking for are textbooks. Have put in a request at the state library to lend them to me, will see where that leads. Am uncomfortable using old books, as it is not uncommon for there to be some variance in the histories that they report (eg during the intervening investigators may point out it is A, not B, who discovered something). Am also uncomfortable about ignoring the history entirely - I feel it would be quite strange to nominate any article, from Gallbladder through Cervix through Palmaris longus muscle without at least some mention about who first documented it and the etymology of the term, and any changes in understanding over time. And that's not even mentioning the fact that almost all sources neglect the history in Chinese and Indian traditional medicines entirely, which have their own parallel anatomical histories. --LT910001 (talk) 00:40, 15 March 2014 (UTC)

As  says I think that  applies in the cases that history is difficult to find. As you point out historical sources may differ wildly, but I think that is something that occurs extensively in all historical fields. For some newer sources the following books might be relevant. Not all of them are strictly text-books, but they have extensive bibliographies (which can be viewed in Amazons quick-look feature).

I think this is a case where this is a term which has been co-opted to mean the alt med entity &quot;adrenal fatigue&quot; now. I think historically it had a different meaning in medicine (see [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1044180/ this] for example), but I don't think it is a term widely used in now standard medicine, but used mainly by alt med types.

Merge all Diuresis stubs

When I reviewed and accepted a new article at AfC, Cold-induced diuresis, I discovered that all the &quot;XXXXXXXX diuresis&quot; articles listed on the Diuresis disambiguation page are brief stubs. I believe merging them all to Diuresis is a better option than having half a dozen closely related perma-stubs. The interrelationships between the different &quot;varieties&quot; of diuresis can then also be explained better. Roger (Dodger67) (talk) 06:51, 18 March 2014 (UTC)

Runner's knee?

This article is currently a redirect to Chondromalacia patellae, but at least as far as I was aware Iliotibial band syndrome is a more common cause of runner's knee. 
Some sources state runner's knee being the common name of at least 4 distinct injuries. Anyone out there who can point me to a good source so I can create a proper disambiguation page?
The best I found is this review from 1999 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1313339/], which states it is equivalent to Patellofemoral pain syndrome

Done, thanks. If anyone has more in-depth knowledge, please add to the dab CFCF (talk ·  · ) 15:42, 19 March 2014 (UTC)
Added plica syndrome.  Hope you don't mind unpublished anecdotes as references on medical DABs. &quot;Runners-knee&quot;-related pain started after a distance runner had completed 2 marathons.  On three separate occasions with different doctors, the knee pain was misdiagnosed as either patellar chondromalacia or PFPS based upon an MRI, a simple X-ray, and/or a CT-scan.  Still unsatisfied with each dx after using wikipedia and linked sources to self-ddx and rule these out, he saw a 4th doctor that finally suspected plica syndrome based upon an X-ray and an MRI.  He confirmed it during arthroscopic knee surgery and excised 2 plica. Following that surgery ~5 years ago, that runner (who happens to be me) completed another 2 marathons without even a single recurrence of &quot;Runner's knee&quot; type pain... I obviously don't have much faith in some doctors as a result of that.  I'm sure there's an actual medical review which includes this since its already in the &quot;see also&quot; of every one of the articles above, but I'm too lazy to check pubmed atm.  I'd suggest just leaving it there based upon  and the likelihood that I didn't spend time writing this paragraph because I wanted to create a pointless fabrication.

 WhatamIdoing is correct to point out that disambiguation pages should not have references. However  indicates that the target articles should have appropriate references. Therefore articles such as Chondromalacia patellae and Plica syndrome should state that &quot;Runner's knee&quot; is an alternative name, and a reference should be provided.

 Seppi333, I don't agree with your application of WP:IAR. Axl ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 13:28, 20 March 2014 (UTC)
Iliotibial band syndrome, Patellofemoral pain syndrome/chondromalacia patellae are the only ones I can find which are called Runner's knee in the literature.
Reading up a bit, there are sources out there calling plica syndrome the great imitator of knee injuries, maybe it would be better to add it to the differential diagnosis section of the articles?
Finally, I have a source stating that Chondromalacia patellae is an older name for Patellofemoral pain syndrome, for which there are two separate articles. Anyone know better? CFCF (talk ·  · ) 15:11, 20 March 2014 (UTC)
 I probably should've just checked for reviews instead.  That took just as long to do. &quot;Runner's knee&quot; isn't really a technical/medical term for disorders – it's just a catch-all and informal term referring to overuse injuries typically seen in runners, particularly those associated with chronic pain along the medial or lateral aspect of the patella. Also,  could I ask you to continue your review on the amph FAC if you have time over the next two weeks?  It'll probably close after that. Seppi333 (Insert 2¢ | ) 17:57, 20 March 2014 (UTC)

Side note Jumper's knee
I also came across this article, which redirects to Patellar tendinitis, which is correct and all, but there is nothing on that page about differential diagnosis in younger individuals with Sinding-Larsen and Johansson syndrome, which in turn shares an article with Osgood–Schlatter disease.

 I contributed a change to the articles Adderall and amphetamine, based on what was already written in dextroamphetamine. The statement(s) at that time were, that Adderall would have a D:L amphetamine ratio of 3:1, which was obviously wrong. The current statment 3:1 ratio of D:L amphetamine salts is true, but rather useless, as it mixes up active and inactive ingredients. The 72.7% dextroamphetamine in Adderall where at least mentioned in the book The Amphetamine Debate, although I'm rather sceptic about the quality of the statement there, cause it mistakes dexamphetamine and lisdexamphetamine (might be a typo /autocorrect of a typo as well as simply bad quality) (Moore, Elaine.[http://books.google.com/books?id=6vfMjBwzpIgC&amp;pg=PA90 The Amphetamine Debate: The Use of Adderall, Ritalin and Related Drugs for Behavior Modification, Neuroenhancement and Anti-Aging Purposes].

He seems to be inactive, so he likely won't tell what his source was.
 Seppi333 confuses having a lot of wikipedia contributions with having or even beeing a reliable, published source. see .

&quot;11 DESCRIPTION
ADDERALL XR is a once daily extended-release, single-entity amphetamine product. ADDERALL XR combines the neutral sulfate salts of
dextroamphetamine and amphetamine, with the dextro isomer of amphetamine saccharate and d,l-amphetamine aspartate monohydrate. The
ADDERALL XR capsule contains two types of drug-containing beads designed to give a double-pulsed delivery of amphetamines, which
prolongs the release of amphetamine from ADDERALL XR compared to the conventional ADDERALL (immediate-release) tablet formulation.
Each capsule contains: 5 mg 10 mg 15 mg 20 mg 25 mg 30 mg
Dextroamphetamine Saccharate 1.25 mg 2.5 mg 3.75 mg 5.0 mg 6.25 mg 7.5 mg
Amphetamine Aspartate Monohydrate 1.25 mg 2.5 mg 3.75 mg 5.0 mg 6.25 mg 7.5 mg
Dextroamphetamine Sulfate USP 1.25 mg 2.5 mg 3.75 mg 5.0 mg 6.25 mg 7.5 mg
Amphetamine Sulfate USP 1.25 mg 2.5 mg 3.75 mg 5.0 mg 6.25 mg 7.5 mg
Total amphetamine base equivalence 3.1 mg 6.3 mg 9.4 mg 12.5 mg 15.6 mg 18.8 mg
is from [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2013/021303s026lbl.pdf Shire's December 2013 FDA medication guide for Adderall XR]
(reformatting that as a readable table)


and 

Amphetamine, in the enantiomer ratio present in ADDERALL® (immediate-release)(d- to l- ratio of 3:1), ...

is REPEATEDLY stated in [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2007/011522s040lbl.pdf Barr's generic Adderall December 2007 FDA medication guide] (the most recent label for any Adderall IR pharmaceutical).
I don't dispute the validity of your statement.  My problems with it are: 
*2.3% is insignificantly small to make this needlessly more complicated for the average reader.
*The formulation is obviously intentionally based upon the ratio of salts.
*You don't cite it.


As for 5-HT toxidrome, all I can say to that is you apparently can't read.  That quote says amph OD induces a &quot;syndrome&quot; with some of its symptoms secondary to &quot;serotonin excess.&quot;  Serotonin toxicity symptoms manifest on a spectrum, not as a binary state (i.e., an indicator function).  This is why your statement &quot;No, it's not a pefect match, a serotonin syndrom is not just an excess of serotonin&quot; is wrong. Serotonin syndrome is just a toxic overdose of serotonin (technically, neuronal activity).  
You're intentionally misrepresenting my statement that &quot;I wrote the section and read the sources&quot; as an argument from authority. I'll just be explicit and say what it was meant to suggest:
* To the best of my knowledge, everything in this section is sound and has perfect text-source integrity
* I'm accountable for the verifiability of the content. 
* It's laughable that you're giving me a lecture on the difference between amphetamine and substituted amphetamines.

 Adderall: Anyway, your complaint is a self-attack, as you only . Never have you simply added a citation needed tag at the 72.7%, instead you have attacked me with the words &quot;His edits may need to be checked/watched on other articles.&quot;. What a nice guy you are!
 You could have easily shortened your Adderal answer to zero words, as it says nothing new. Have a look on , that's not a small gap. Just ignore the probem? And if you want to say 72.7% are roughly 75% than write &quot;roughly&quot;. But you still need a source that tells you the D:L ratio (without salts, roughly or accurate). Will you show up with one, different from The Amphetamine Debate that I mentioned?

 5-HT toxidrome: A syndrome whose most prominent feature is an adrenergic storm with some of its symptoms secondary to serotonin excess (so just amended by an obviously smaller serotonin excess compared to the adrenergic and dopaminergic). To call that serotonin syndrome is just false. Found words &quot;excess of serotonin&quot; in Serotonin syndrome and in paper about amphetamine overdose -&gt; amphetamine overdose may cause serotonin syndrome = SYNTH.
 amphetamine is [http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/318/2/604.full  considerably less effective in elevating plasma 5-HT compared with fenfluramine, MDMA, and methamphetamine], amphetamine is a less potent drug out of amphetamines regarding 5-HTP excess. Btw, fenfluramine and MDMA are agonists at 5-HT receptors, too. That might contribute to their serotonin toxicity, so it's not clear if it's just an elevated serotonin level that causes serotonin syndrome of amphetamines (I guess agonism is the central mechanism of action for a serotonin syndrome caused by agonists as LSD).
Time does matter: It is healthy to have a pulse rate of 200bpm for a short while on a run, but dangerously if it takes longer.
 Your continuum theory is just as good as fever = hyperpyrexia, intensity above some cut-off does matter. If you don't show up with a citable source saying &quot;amphetamine causes serotonin syndrom&quot; (mild or whatever), then take it out of the article or do cite literally. Is a serotonin syndrom technically just an excess of serotonin? You know a case of a human with diagnosis of an acute serotonin syndrome, and anybody measured the theorized excess of serotonin? Technically it's just differential diagnosis.
 It would be easy to circumnavigate the problems caused by your interpretation of the &quot;cited&quot; source, just by citing it: &quot;an excess of serotonin&quot; (add &quot;and related symptoms&quot; if you want) instead of serotonin syndrom/toxidrome in Amphetamine#Overdose. But that does require that you think critically about your own contributions. Btw, I have no doubts in your ability to read.
 &quot;It's laughable&quot;... But it was  (&quot;it lists MDMA right next to it&quot;, where it is superclass substituted amphetamines. After that SYNTH &quot;but this could easily happen given a high enough (&quot;extremely large&quot;) overdose for ~100% SERT phosphorylation&quot; and again [http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/318/2/604.full that's a highly unlikely speculation and OR]).

*Serotonin syndrome:
The scope of all the policies you've stated so far, , , and , is limited to article content. Non-article content is completely outside the scope of these.  If I said amphetamine is a panacea that cures all diseases known to man without any reference at all, I can do it right here on WT:MED, and it's perfectly OK as long as my statement adheres to the talk page guidelines. I don't care if you think I'm wrong about any statement I've made, or even if you misrepresent some of my statements like you've done in your reply above.

I do care that the amphetamine article strictly adheres to these policies (and to a lesser extent adderall/dextroamphetamine as well, since they're not currently FA-nominated).  I cited a review and provided a quote containing a statement which I've asserted is equivalent to the definition of serotonin syndrome. Specifically, I've said that it's defined as a toxidrome model involving excessive serotonin activity in neurons. If you know this isn't the definition of that concept, you should be correcting me with a reference; in which case, I would have to find a suitable replacement reference or remove the phrase/citation from the article.  On the other hand, if you aren't familiar with serotonin syndrome, you should simply ask me to provide you with a reference which defines it as this model. 

I'll let you decide who provides the reference for this.

*Enantiomer ratios:
instead you have attacked me with the words &quot;His edits may need to be checked/watched on other articles.. What a nice guy you are!I'm delightful, aren't I? 
You could have easily shortened your Adderal answer to zero words, as it says nothing new.No, I actually explained to you, in the bulleted list, why I have an issue with it and suggested how you could correct the policy breach of WP:SYNTH. 

As for the ratio you want to add, I don't really care if it's added or not; I think it's useless, but I won't delete it if you add it with an appropriate citation.  However, I will revert it if you change the current salt ratio text/reference instead of adding it with the reference separately.

Seppi333 (Insert 2¢ | ) 17:25, 19 March 2014 (UTC)


I know about the scope of WP:SYNTH,... I'm not a newby, although I have less contributions to en.wikipedia.org as I have on de.wikipedia.org. So if you're stating here just small talk, you are totally right, but I would add that this talk page is not inteded for small talk. I criticise your edits on the pages themselves, WP:SYNTH,... are applying, cause its in their scope. Your edit misses a justification without talk here (no word of serotonin toxydrome/syndrome in given cite in amphetamine) and that on article talk pages. You would have had either to add a sufficient cite that doesn't need your vulnerable interpretation, or I may have refered to your interpretation's justification here in my critic.

I agree, your 1st reply (to me) could only be shortened to the bullet list. It doesn't matter in lead how a manufacturer is describing its formulation, it's obviously useless for any reader to state any ratio between a mixture of active and inactive ingedients (e.g. salt-ratio) in lead. I never removed the note in the article about salt-ratio, and I won't do. I will shorten lead again and add the cite.

Changing &quot;serotonin toxidrome&quot; to &quot;excess of serotonin&quot; is the maximum what you can take out of all mentioned cites from the given reference.

How many types of cohort studies are there?

I was surprised to discover that while prospective cohort study and retrospective cohort study are not redlinks, longitudinal cohort study is. Does anyone know if maybe two of these terms are synonymous with each other or something? It seems like the [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/longitudinal two] [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prospective?show=0&amp;t=1395335879 words] have distinct meanings in epidemiology, so there should probably be 2 separate pages on longitudinal and prospective studies. Jinkinson talk to me 17:20, 20 March 2014 (UTC)
At the risk of sounding like a dumb-ass, this is my understanding of it. I'm no epidemiologist.  A cohort study defines a group (the group is the cohort) and observes them.  It can be cross-sectional (meaning the group at any given point in time), prospective or retrospective.  I believe longitudinal in this instance is synonymous with prospective.  There are also matched cohort studies, when long-term observations is impractical, unethical or impossible.  For instance, does eating fast-food lead to greater heart disease.  It's tough to control all the variables, other than fast food consumption that contribute to heart disease so they match the patients based on other risk factors with one match being high fast-food consumption and the other low (edit: then following them going forward for the occurrence of heart disease).  In this sense, the cohort is cross-sectional (looking at previous behavior) the longitudinal.  A prospective randomized trial would create an inception cohort of people, then randomize them to 2 treatment groups. Question from the peanut butter test?  Does that help? Ian Furst (talk) 17:33, 20 March 2014 (UTC)
In that case, should longitudinal cohort study be redirected to prospective cohort study? Jinkinson talk to me 17:43, 20 March 2014 (UTC)
I think so. Ian Furst (talk) 18:08, 20 March 2014 (UTC)
edited example above Ian Furst (talk) 18:22, 20 March 2014 (UTC)

 A longitudinal study is a study that observes subjects over a period of time. Because longitudinal studies typically require planning, most of these are prospective studies. But there is no reason that a longitudinal study cannot be retrospective. For instance, with the advent of electronic medical records, plenty of folk are doing retrospective longitudinal studies using patient medical histories. --Mark viking (talk) 18:36, 20 March 2014 (UTC)

Block of text being added to a bunch of articles
This same block of text [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stomatitis&amp;diff=600418721&amp;oldid=599977213] is being added to a dozen or more articles [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Epeefleche]. Thoughts? Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 08:35, 20 March 2014 (UTC)
From a medical point of view, this would set the precedent to add the thousands of potential allergens with the potential to cause contact dermatitis to the hundreds of pages that describe the anatomy or specific topics of dermatitis.  From an editorial point of view, it seems contrary to the concept  of original writing on Wikipedia to cut and paste the same sentence in many articles.  If there are sufficient sources to create it, would it be better to create a page on balsam of peru including it's allergenic potential.  I've never heard of this stuff.  Common elsewhere in the world?  same as friar's balsam? Ian Furst (talk) 12:40, 20 March 2014 (UTC)
 Insertion of that text into generic articles such as &quot;Stomatitis&quot; and &quot;Cheilitis&quot; gives . The information should only be in &quot;Balsam of Peru&quot;. Axl ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 13:13, 20 March 2014 (UTC)
Thanks yes that is my position. Just at the one article. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 13:15, 20 March 2014 (UTC)
Imo, articles like stomatitis and cheilitis should mention as many of the most common allergens as possible. But ofc we need MEDRS sources to support it. Note also that cheilitis already mentioned balsam of peru before these edits (in Cheilitis#Eczematous_cheilitis) but only in one short sentence. That should probably be enough, so no need to duplicate info there with these edits. Support inclusion of a similar one sentence mention on other articles if relevant and if MEDRS sources used. Probably relevant on stomatitis, not sure about oral ulceration.  courtesy notification. Many thanks, Lesion (talk) 13:47, 20 March 2014 (UTC)
To Ian and Axl, have a look at Burning_mouth_syndrome#Other_causes_of_an_oral_burning_sensation, if the number of allergens (or in that case substance which cause a burning sensation) gets out of hand, it does not take up much room to stick them all in a table... we should try to give encyclopedic coverage after all. Lesion (talk) 13:52, 20 March 2014 (UTC)
Yes it is more about the amount of text. How is this relevant on the Anusol &quot;Balsam of Peru is used in food and drink for flavoring, in perfumes and toiletries for fragrance, and in medicine and pharmaceutical items for healing properties&quot; [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anusol&amp;diff=600448495&amp;oldid=600422846] Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 13:54, 20 March 2014 (UTC)

It sounds like a common allergen: &quot;Balsam of Peru (BOP) is a well-known contact allergen that is one of the most prevalent in the United States.&quot; from http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23857009 . Lesion (talk) 14:17, 20 March 2014 (UTC)
Yes some content is fine. It is the degree. I hope we have figured it out. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 14:22, 20 March 2014 (UTC)
I'm interested that even our editors most knowledgeable in this area are not familiar with Balsam of Peru, given its top-five allergen status.  But all the more reason for appropriate mention.  Clearly, only mentioning it in the article itself is less than ideal.  But I agree that mentions should be appropriately trimmed.  I think Doc James and I have trimmed it well in a couple of articles, and Lesion raised an article where it was less well placed than another related article (it is a problem in some dental cements and related dental products).  BTW, in  its crude form, has even been banned from some products.--Epeefleche (talk) 15:35, 20 March 2014 (UTC)
=) not totally hopeless, wiki already mentioned this on some articles like Patch test (medicine)#Common allergens and cheilitis. Per Axl's comment (see below), on article like stomatitis etc, probably better to mention this substance in the context of a list of common allergens. In each case, need a  source to support specifically that this allergen causes that condition. Lesion (talk) 17:10, 20 March 2014 (UTC)
 Lesion, the reference for the list in Burning_mouth_syndrome#Other_causes_of_an_oral_burning_sensation is Oral and maxillofacial medicine: the basis of diagnosis and treatment. This is a generic textbook and is a suitable source for this information in this article.

 [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stomatitis&amp;diff=600418721&amp;oldid=599977213 This edit] includes four references:-

 



 The first reference is specifically about balsam of Peru. It is not suitable for generic articles about &quot;Stomatitis&quot; or &quot;Dermatitis&quot;. The other three references are generic texts. In these, balsam of Peru is mentioned as one of a list of substances. To describe only balsam of Peru gives it undue weight. If it is to be included, it should only be as part of a list. There is certainly no need to state &quot;Balsam of Peru is used in food and drink for flavoring, in perfumes and toiletries for fragrance, and in medicine and pharmaceutical items for healing properties.&quot; Axl ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 15:41, 20 March 2014 (UTC)

OK yes agree. On stomatitis, I have started a short list of allergens so there is not undue weight. Whole article needs much work... I have used &quot;DermNet NZ&quot; in the past, it is referenced, although not an ideal source there is lot of good info there. Lesion (talk) 16:26, 20 March 2014 (UTC)

*If you look at the indicated [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stomatitis&amp;diff=600418721&amp;oldid=599977213 diff], it simply jumps out that the real problem from an editorial standpoint is the fact that nearly everything that was pre-existing in that section lacked any refs whatsoever.  People reading that article should see RS-supported information, which should include known causes (referenced to RSs), in language they can understand that is accurate -- that should be our focus.  The non-RS supported material should either be properly supported, or deleted. I've tagged it in the meantime.  Much of the article suffers from the same malady ... and not from the inclusion of reference to a top-5 allergen, supported by RSs.--Epeefleche (talk) 18:51, 20 March 2014 (UTC)

As to the refs -- please note that &quot;Major academic publishers (e.g., Elsevier, Springer Verlag, Wolters Kluwer, and Informa) publish specialized medical book series with good editorial oversight; volumes in these series summarize the latest research in narrow areas, usually in a more extensive format than journal reviews.&quot;  The text are perfectly excellent RSs, and should not be deleted (keeping the refs in allows the reader to jump to the ref for further info). 

Adding any other &quot;top 5&quot; allegens would of course be appropriate.  Feel free.  But that's not cause for deletion of this top-5 allergen, RS supported.

That whole article is in a poor state. Not convinced the current layout is the best approach for this broad scoped article... A layout like cheilitis might be better, which doesn't have any causes section, instead mentioning the causes as the different types are discussed. Lesion (talk) 20:19, 20 March 2014 (UTC)

McGrigor then concluded that women’s brains were more analogous to infants, thus deeming them inferior at the time.[8] To further these claims of female inferiority and silence the feminists of the time, other anthropologists joined in on the studies of the female skull.

As the point on phrenology, yes that section is actually fairly representative of the debate at the time.  However, that section has some pretty obvious  issues when it comes to craniology/phrenology.   While that debate is absolutely noteworthy, being of serious historical, cultural, and empirical value (especially as regards the evolution of the evolved sciences) its proper place is at Phrenology (and to a lesser extent Anthropometry), not the article focused on the current scientific understanding of the human cranium and its relevance to the brain. There should be little more than a brief reference to those pseudo-scientific analogs to modern science and whatever reference is left there should be represented as thoroughly debunked by modern developments.   That's not the only statement in that section which is troubling -- there's also this: &quot;Some authors consider this size difference to partly explain the alleged difference in average intelligence between men and women, and between various human races.&quot;  That particular claim is so far outside the scientific mainstream (and has been for most of the modern era) that I don't even know where to start.  More particular to our purposes here, said claim is not supported to any significant weight by the scientific consensus presented by the vast majority of sources available on the subject.   On the subject of sources, if you are looking for a good text to contextualize this debate and the evolution of scientific understanding of the subject, you can do a lot worse than Stephen Jay Gould's The Mismeasure of Man, which, though a little dated, is still a definitive work on deconstructing this and several other types of antiquated psuedoscience on intellect that developed from the same tradition.  Anyway, my time is limited so I'll not edit that section immediately, but if no one does soon, I certainly will.  It should present little problem; justifying that change on the basis of policy and the sources will be the easiest task any Wikipedian ever took on.  Snow (talk) 17:37, 23 March 2014 (UTC)

Are (deadly) poisonous mushrooms within the scope of WP:MED? The tag was recently added to the talk of Amanita phalloides with the rationale &quot;WikiProj med has a toxicology taskforce&quot;.

Editor review requested for Wikipedia Education Program

user:Salubrious Toxin
The  has an oversight system in which the only people who can make course pages for classes are those who have done a tutorial and have had their Wikipedia editing experience checked by two other Wikipedians. There is a user who has done the tutorial but has so little editing experience that it is difficult for others to judge. Because what he has done is related to medicine, I thought that it would be better for me to ask here at the medicine board than on the education board for someone to give a second review of him. I met him in person as a first review, and in my opinion he knows enough about Wikipedia to be responsive to any concerns which arise. He wants to start a Wikipedia club at his medical school and I would like to support him in this. If he had the userright then he would start a course page and begin advertising for an in-person meetup for an editathon at his school, and have his classmates register for the editathon through this course page.

Hello everyone. I have spent more than an hour talking with an instructor at a nearby medical school about her wish to have her OBGYN class contribute to Wikipedia. I plan to organize an in-person workshop with them and support them otherwise in their engagement with Wikipedia.

This instructor has no prior Wikipedia experience nor do the students, and for that reason, it would be difficult for the people coordinating the Education program to evaluate their stated plans and say whether they should have the userright to set up a course page. Could I ask for someone here to review what she has proposed to do as written  on the noticeboard and give a comment there about the circumstances under which the instructor for this class can have a userright to have a course page? Thanks to anyone who can review this.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 15:32, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

Two questions to experience reviewers - I think it's a great article but all original research.  Do I make a note to add non-primary and move on or do I need to dig up secondary sources before approving.  Also, the headings are non-standard (e.g. not MEDMOS) but it's a physiology article.  I haven't found any headings guidelines for physiology (although anatomy applies as well).  What do you normally recommend to the authors? Ian Furst (talk) 12:53, 26 March 2014 (UTC)
Original research = not published in any source.  If it's supported by primary sources, then it's not OR.  That happens a lot when research scientists and grad students write articles, because they think the rules for peer-reviewed journals apply (and journals usually prohibit citations of secondary sources).  
Don't worry about the section headings.  AFC is about first drafts, not about getting everything right.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 15:47, 26 March 2014 (UTC)

Assessing articles

Hi everyone,

I've got  set up to handle task forces for us now.  If you want to rate articles, and especially if you would like to tag already-rated (but possibly out of date?) articles for task forces, then please consider installing it.  

When you install it and go to any article, you'll get a new tab called &quot;Rater&quot; (near the history tab).  Click that and you'll see the existing tags.  You can add WPMED (type &quot;Medicine&quot; into the box on the bottom left) if it's not there.  Click the [+] by WPMED's entry to see the task forces.  Click and task force's name to list it (e.g., click &quot;Society&quot; for people, schools, and orgs).  Optionally, use the pop-up to set a priority for the task force (if it doesn't match the main rating—e.g., all people are &quot;Low&quot; for the main rating but may be anything for ).  Click 'Save' and you're done.  It's that quick and easy.

Also,  is up over 100 articles again, if anyone has a case of editcountitis going.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 21:33, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

Project page for conducting good article reviews on medical articles

* 

Started the above page to try and standardize the GA review process more for medical articles, and perhaps encourage participation. Feel free to comment on, or change the page. Kind regards, Lesion (talk) 14:24, 23 March 2014 (UTC)

Specialized criteria for medical GA's?

 thanks for having a look. I was thinking that a biomedical type article should be assessed more closely against MEDMOS and MEDRS rather than the existing GA criteria. Also, some aspects of the general guidelines are not relevent (at least that I can see, e.g. &quot;writing about fiction&quot;). 

If this is the kind of thing people would find useful, then OK keep it, otherwise I don't see a great deal of use in another page which duplicates info available elsewhere. Thoughts?  Lesion (talk) 17:31, 23 March 2014 (UTC)

GA is community-wide, so we can't make a medicine-only version.  
We could try to get the community-wide criteria changed; however, I don't think that's necessary, because a good deal of what's in MEDMOS actually falls under the first GA criteria (&quot;A good article is well-written&quot;) and third (&quot;It addresses the main aspects of the topic&quot;).  I think a page to describe special issues or the best way to understand the existing criteria would be just fine.  The important point is not to look like we are setting up &quot;new&quot; or &quot;different&quot; criteria.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 20:08, 23 March 2014 (UTC)
 Oddly enough, GA#2b specifically mentions  for science-based articles, so there's a precedent for encouraging GA nominators to follow MEDMOS and MEDRS for medical articles. I wouldn't encourage reviewers to take a tough line, but GA#2b requires the article to use reliable sources, which is linked to . That has a section  stating  so I guess we could justify a desire to meet MEDRS if pushed on the point.
 This is an interesting idea. How exactly, at least according to Lesion, are the MEDRS and MEDMOS criteria different from the GA criteria as they currently exist? Also, is it more of a problem that medical articles listed as GAs actually shouldn't be, or the other way around? Jinkinson talk to me 23:57, 23 March 2014 (UTC)
 We hold all medical articles to a very high standard of sourcing, principally because medicine tends to have a lot of very high quality sources and there's no reason not to insist on the best sources, and partially because there's a moral imperative to get it right for the reader who may decide to take what's written here as authoritative medical advice (no matter how many disclaimers we make). From that point-of-view it seems silly not to ask medical GANs to meet the same standards we ask of medical articles that are not GAs. Conventionally, GAs are not required to be perfect, so there's a reluctance to set the bar too high; personally I don't think we do any favours to GANs that fall short of MEDRS, although I'm not so worried about MEDMOS. --RexxS (talk) 00:24, 24 March 2014 (UTC)
They would not be hugely different, as pointed out by WAID and RexxS above. Most changes would be little, e.g.:
1b mention MEDMOS. Remove the link to writing about fiction,
2b making this about MEDRS specifically instead of RS
...And that's about all the changes I would suggest. Mostly it is making a general guideline more useful for people working on a particular type of article, not changing the spirit of the main criteria. There was a discussion here a few months ago about potentially making WPMED-specific criteria. Let me search the archives to link to that discussion. Lesion (talk) 00:35, 24 March 2014 (UTC)
Here is that conversation: . The stuff I said about turning on the article feedback is now impossible because feedback is no more. , . Lesion (talk) 00:42, 24 March 2014 (UTC)
A good idea, but it does seem to duplicate most of what is on the GA page. I certainly think that two user groups could deal with some more detailed information about biomedical articles: (1) reviewers, detailing what is/is not a reliable source and how to deal with issues of readability, technical prose and comprehensiveness; (2) users who are not associated with this project and nominate medical articles without proper preparation, a short page outlining MEDMOS and MEDRS; or a template that can be used when quick-failing a review could be very useful. --LT910001 (talk) 02:34, 24 March 2014 (UTC)
You can't remove fiction.  GA is community-wide.  You cannot make a medicine-specific/all-other-subjects-excluding version and still pretend that it's the same thing as the community-wide GA.  If you make a version that excludes fiction or other non-medical content, then it stops being Good articles.  You would need a new name and a separate process, and you would need to remember that the existence of this new &quot;Medical Special Good articles&quot; would not prevent someone from applying for and receiving normal old Good article status.
You could, if you thought it was important (I don't), try to convince the community that the community-wide GA criteria need to explicitly mention MEDMOS.  Unless and until that is actually mentioned, though, reviewers are actually forbidden (read footnote #2) from requiring compliance with it (or any of dozens of other Manual of Style pages).
You don't need to mention MEDRS directly, or to go through SCG (which IMO is a mess).  GA requires all material to be verifiable (even if not sourced) and for five specific types of material to have inline citations supported by a reliable source.  MEDRS is the community-wide definition of what constitutes a reliable source for biomedical (NB:  note social, cultural, historical, biographical, financial, commercial, etc.) material.  You can therefore consider it to be already included, even though not named. WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:05, 24 March 2014 (UTC)
Proposed removing the link to &quot;writing about fiction&quot; since it would not be relevant to medical articles (that I can foresee anyway). I understand what you are saying, that GA cannot be changed to make &quot;special medical GA status&quot;, but I believe that medical articles are already assessed against specialized GA criteria, i.e. against MEDRS and MEDMOS ... especially if a WPMED regular editor carries out the review. This would be just making it slightly more &quot;official&quot;. 
Will wait for more discussion on this, I was expecting some controversy ... happy to see what the community wants and I will follow it. 
P.S. I don't know what SCG is? Lesion (talk) 16:32, 24 March 2014 (UTC)
 SCG =  mentioned in the Good Article Criteria. HTH, --RexxS (talk) 17:59, 24 March 2014 (UTC)
Fair enough. There is also the concern that if one Wikiproject fragments their concerns, what is to stop other Wikiprojects from doing the same thing? One alternative may be to have a &quot;GA preparation checklist&quot; page (on this wikiproject) specific for medical articles. This would address your concerns whilst maintaining the centralised GA process. --LT910001 (talk) 05:38, 26 March 2014 (UTC)
I don't think a GA reviewer will follow it as they are unlikely to have the time/inclincation to look thru project specific guidelines.  In my limited experience (n=3 attempts) I've found the GA good for structure but it does little to encourage discussions on content.  Both are needed to make the articles readable imo but, personally, I enjoy the challenges &amp; discussions from other medproject people about content. Ian Furst (talk) 10:59, 26 March 2014 (UTC)
This seems related to the discussion: .  I don't know if anyone else has seen this, but it appears that we really can't tell GA reviewers to check for compliance with this Wikiproject's standards.  At least that is how I interpret that page. Zell Faze (talk) 16:03, 26 March 2014 (UTC)
 I can understand and agree with the sentiment that any medical article claiming to be a good article should adhere to MEDRS for biomedical content. But I'll ask, it this currently a problem? Have there been medical articles that have progressed to good article nomination, that have passed good article criteria, but that have failed badly in meeting MEDRS sourcing and citation requirements? I'd hate for a lot of effort to go into solving a problem that doesn't exist in practice. --Mark viking (talk) 16:50, 26 March 2014 (UTC)
, user Blue Rasberry found that WikiProject Military history already have their own class A criteria. It would not be a precedent therefore if simple WPMED criteria for class A were concocted, as has been suggested before. Articles would pass both class A and GA, probably at the same time. This would not necessitate messing with the wording of the encyclopedia-wide GA criteria. Lesion (talk) 11:44, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

, there is a short statement in which the nominator states why they have nominated this article for GA. In this section, a link to that page could be placed, then a non-WPMED reviewer would be more likely to see it. Lesion (talk) 11:44, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

, yes, that is what several people have been saying. Probably can't change the GA criteria since they are standardized across the encyclopedia. Lesion (talk) 11:44, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

, I have only made 3 GA nominations, and even in that small number the thoroughness of the review was very variable. There are some reviewers who (rightly imo) will want to check every single source, run the text through a program which checks for plagiarism, and carefully considers the wording of every single sentence. These are definitely good articles. Other reviewers are not familiar with MEDRS and the MEDMOS and do not appear to check references against them. Here is one recent example that me and Ian nominated: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Toothache/GA1], and I am certain that many others who have nominated GA may corroborate this variation in the standard of the review. Lesion (talk) 11:45, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

Ping to  who has much experience with GA. Lesion (talk) 11:44, 27 March 2014 (UTC)
So yes agree that the quality / thoroughness of reviews at GA are variable. I have nominated articles that have just passed GA review for re-review when they miss the mark by a long way. We simply need to make sure that those from this community pick up medical GANs when they appear. While I think most of us here agree that following WP:MEDRS and WP:MEDMOS are requirements. Other reviewers may not be aware of these guidelines. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 13:34, 27 March 2014 (UTC)
Would support an A-class listing for WP-MED. We seem to have quite a large active mass, so articles should not have to wait more than a couple of months to be reviewed. --LT910001 (talk) 03:05, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

Medical FA dates

Except for a select few that had an unusual, but consistent standard, I just fixed/established a consistent dating standard in every medical FA above low importance (either MDY or DMY, depending on which was more prevalent).  There were maybe about 5 out of 50 that actually had a consistent format. Seppi333 (Insert 2¢ | ) 05:45, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

The tool I used consistently applies DMY or MDY date formats using any date type, even malformed ones (e.g., it removed non-breaking spaces between a day and month, then corrected the date format). So basically, if there's consensus for establishing a consistent medical FA date format, it can be done very easily.  The tool seems to be coded very well.

Question for WP:MED editors

You weren't around for the  war a few years ago, right?  This may be a perfectly good idea, but my impulse would be to avoid it, and, if I couldn't avoid it, to make sure that all the ArbCom restrictions had lapsed before doing anything.  Cas was on ArbCom then and might remember where the pages are.  Also, I'd maintain a strict  stance.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:14, 24 March 2014 (UTC)
Beyond a desire to cause a pointless conflict or article ownership, I have no clue why anyone would oppose this change.

Sounds good. , I think you raised a good point, so I went and checked around 500-600 citations on the pages which had a lot of date changes (I only applied a change if there were a nontrivial number of inconsistencies).  Specifically, out of the refs on Alzheimer's disease, Major depressive disorder, Management of multiple sclerosis, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Major_depressive_disorder&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=601078402 this invalid date] was the only thing that didn't convert.  It performs fairly well because it's not a citation script (i.e., it doesn't pull data); it just finds/replaces strings.  I've been checking to see that it doesn't convert dates outside of references before committing the edit because of that. In any event, it seems to work with very high accuracy based upon the sample I checked. Seppi333 (Insert 2¢ | ) 20:05, 24 March 2014 (UTC)

Does &quot;your plan would (very probably) violate &quot; count as &quot;any legitimate concern&quot;?  Seriously, there have been wars over making all articles use The Right Style™ (so that FA #1 matches FA #2, etc.) in the past, so I think it's a good idea to tread lightly and with discussions at each affected article, exactly the way the guidelines tell you to do.

 Project-wide consensus seems to exist for :
* Articles on topics with strong ties to a particular English-speaking country should generally use the more common date format for that nation. For the United States, this is month before day; for most others, it is day before month.
 That means, for example that if you wanted to make the dates in Abortion in the United States consistent, I'm pretty certain you'd have to use MDY. However, if it became a Featured Article, your proposal would suggest we change all of them to DMY. I think that counts as a legitimate concern. I don't care, personally, but I know that a lot of editors will care and I think you ought to be aware of some of the obvious pitfalls. --RexxS (talk) 01:35, 26 March 2014 (UTC)

Oppose standardised format. I do not see a convincing reason why editors should have to confirm to one or other date style if they so choose. This is a solution looking for a problem.

Comments are welcome at any of these proposals. I myself am sort-of volunteering for two panels that I proposed myself, the &quot;perspectives in medicine&quot; panel and the &quot;reform of citation&quot; panel. While I would present, more than wanting to present I wish other people would present. Especially for the medicine panel, if anyone where is attending Wikimania in London this summer, please feel encouraged to sign on as a presenter.

James is giving the &quot;Wikipedia and Medicine&quot; talk which would be great but while we have an audience, there really is room for several medical presentations at this conference.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 16:38, 28 March 2014 (UTC)

Jimbo Wales on adequate sources for articles on medical treatments

If you can get your work published in respectable scientific journals - that is to say, if you can produce evidence through replicable scientific experiments, then Wikipedia will cover it appropriately.&quot; See the [http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2014/03/25/an-excellent-response-to-complaints-about-medical-topics-on-wikipedia/ Respectful Insolence] blog by a medical doctor, the [http://skeptools.wordpress.com/2014/03/25/wikipedia-jimmy-wales-responds-change-org-alt-med-alternative-medicine-cam/ Skeptical Software Tools] blog, and other blogs for more details.

Nursing and nursing journals

Hi, is nursing considered a subfield of medicine or is it a field that runs parallel to it? I am asking because of this , where it was decided to merge a couple of nursing journals into a medical journal category. Up till now, nursing journals are categorized in a categorization tree that basically runs parallel to the medical journals category and both  and  are categorized as subcategories of . Should we maintain this scheme (and ask for a -partial- reversal of the before-mentioned CFD) or should we merge both category trees (implying that, e.g.,  will be merged into ? The current situation (where all specialty nursing journals are kept separately from specialty medical journals, except for the gastrointestinal ones) is rather undesirable, I feel. I'd appreciate any input from knowledgeable editors here and am cross-posting to the Nursing and Academic Journals wikiprojects. Thanks. --Randykitty (talk) 11:20, 27 March 2014 (UTC)
It's a separate, parallel field. It has different educational requirements, separate licensure and a different process for entry to practice. I can understand the need to keep things simple, but I think it's more accurate to keep medical and nursing journals separate. EricEnfermero HOWDY! 12:08, 27 March 2014 (UTC)
I can't say that I find &quot;different educational requirements, separate licensure and a different process for entry to practice&quot; convincing arguments. The same goes for general physicians, podiatrists, and cardiac surgeons... --Randykitty (talk) 12:15, 27 March 2014 (UTC)
Here's where I would disagree: The groups that you mention generally undertake an undergrad four-year education followed by doctoral study and additional postgraduate residency training; two of the three are licensed by the same boards; and almost all members of those three groups undergo hospital credentialing processes. Nurses go through almost none of that and have a completely different role in health delivery most of the time. I appreciate you seeking comments though; nurses seem to be pretty underrepresented on Wikipedia and I think it means something just to be heard. I think we can agree that - whatever is decided - it's not ideal to have one specialty (gastrointestinal journals) handled differently than the rest. EricEnfermero HOWDY! 12:41, 27 March 2014 (UTC)
Nursing is considered a healthcare field. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 13:26, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

Nursing is a healthcare field, but is separate from medicine, at least academically. For instance at UCSF, a medical school, the School of Nursing is separate and parallel with the School of Medicine. While we are at it, pharmacy should be considered separate from the others, as well as the allied health professions. See, for instance, Health care provider#Practitioners and professionals. Putting dentistry journals under the medical journals is probably wrong, too. --Mark viking (talk) 13:40, 27 March 2014 (UTC)
*comment The category system is not intended to delineate crisp differentiation between fields; its purpose is navigation. As an example this [http://tools.wmflabs.org/catscan2/quick_intersection.php?lang=en&amp;project=wikipedia&amp;cats=Nursing%0D%0AMedicine&amp;ns=0&amp;depth=5&amp;max=30000&amp;start=0&amp;format=html&amp;redirects=&amp;callback=&amp;norun query] which only goes 5 levels deep shows 5600 articles which are categorized in both the  tree and the  tree, so we aren't violating some rigid separation wall by doing so again. Ultimately, I think we can have both - a separate tree of nursing journals, but also categorize the nursing journals underneath the medicine tree, since the medicine tree has more generic names - e.g.  as parent of  - why would we want to prevent readers from discovering that there is a whole tree of nursing journals devoted to the subject of Oncology? If you want to try to be *really* fair, you could have  as the parent, and then siblings of  and  and  but frankly I think it's a bit exaggerated. As for that CFD, the reason it was deleted is smallcat - if you don't have enough to justify a category - and usually 2 isn't enough - the cat is deleted. So, I don't see any need to reverse that CFD either.--Obi-Wan Kenobi (talk) 16:07, 27 March 2014 (UTC)
*I wouldn't propose to reverse the CfD completely, just the decision to merge to the medical journals cat. But I like your proposal of categorizing the nursing specialty journal cats under the medical specialty journal cats, and for smaller cats just include them in the medical journal cat as now happened with the gastrointestinal nursing journals. --Randykitty (talk) 16:48, 27 March 2014 (UTC)
*Based on this discussion I agree that Nursing journals should be kept in a separate category - although I have no problem if it is a separate category within the category of medicine. Otherwise, I think it is burdening one category too much when combining medicine and nursing journals. --- Steve Quinn (talk) 06:38, 29 March 2014 (UTC)

Dear medical experts:  I can't tell if this is a notable professor or not.  Should the old Afc submission be saved and improved?  —Anne Delong (talk) 11:21, 29 March 2014 (UTC)
Google scholar does not show any highly-cited papers, so probably not. Unless of course, there's coverage of him in another language (i.e. German or Japanese), which I'm not seeing, not reading those languages. Stuartyeates (talk) 00:24, 30 March 2014 (UTC)
I have been reading a lot of articles about professors, and I was surprised to find that many very well known professors don't even have a Google Scholar profile.  Apparently this is common among some professors who were tenured before its use became common, and those who decide to list their work in other places.  I also found that the citation level varies a lot from one subject area to another, depending on if it's customary to write journal papers, publish whole books, go on lecture/conference tours, etc.  His title of &quot;Professor Emeritas&quot; tells me that he is likely mostly retired. Anyway, thanks for taking the time to look at this.  Maybe I'll ask at Wikiproject Germany, and if I don't get a positive answer there, I'll let the draft go to G13 oblivion.  —Anne Delong (talk) 02:50, 30 March 2014 (UTC)
 Google scholar is not the only possible test. A widely held book (I use 1000 libraries on worldcat, but that's worse that google scholar for English-centricism) will also work, as will any of the normal biography tests. Stuartyeates (talk) 02:53, 30 March 2014 (UTC)
This is history of medicine not medicine, and MEDRES standards do not apply.  Google Scholar is particularly useless for people in the humanities, and using the number of books in a library needs to be considered by subject--essentially no scholarly books reach 1000.)  But the only way of judging notability we have is to hold a discussion at AfD The general practice at AfC is to accept any article likely to pass afd -- some people define likely at 50%; I use 60%, and if I've done any work on it, aim much higher. Considering the very extensive German article, and the very high notability standards of the German WP, and their much greater competence than the enWP in dealing with the academic humanities, including those studying East Asia. I've accepted the article. We can deal with further improvements (or challenges) later, as with all articles.  DGG ( talk ) 20:01, 30 March 2014 (UTC)

no we don't have other sources, especially for the claim that because of GERAC, some insurers stopped covering acupuncture.  QG really wants that statement in the article.

gang there is serious forum-shopping going on here.  This source and a similar one were carefully discussed at Talk:Gerac and one of them on Talk:MEDRS, an length and calmly, as part of a review of sources by jps. Alexbrn, Second Quantization participated too.    Careful, measured discussion during which five editors participated from across the board on this issue.  QG did not participate.   We decided to exclude these two sources for everything.  After the dust settled, GQ re-introduced them both to the article.

Jytdog (talk) 05:10, 30 March 2014 (UTC)
So this is a medical or insurance claim were the source is disputed right? To put this simply  if other reliable published sources do not include the information that you have found at only one place, then that information is—by definition—not important enough to include or is a  fringe claim. -- Moxy (talk) 05:16, 30 March 2014 (UTC)
 I've seen it discussed in both [http://www.jcm.co.uk/product/catalog/product/view/6737/reflections-on-the-german-acupuncture-studies/ Journal of Chinese Medicine] and [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3155101/ Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine], but it's obvious what the problem is - only the journals specifically related to acupuncture would be concerned about whether German health insurance companies paid out for acupuncture or not. It would not have even dented the consciousness of mainstream journals - why would it? So my advice to QG is to leave it be: there won't be anything that we'd want to use as sources, and without best-quality sources, it's not worth expending energy on. There is still lots for you to do without having to get into arguments. There is so much that could be improved in the Acupuncture article (like &quot;A 2012 review said this...

Effects of pornography‎ article

The  article could use significant help from this WikiProject, and so can the Effects section of the Pornography article, which I mentioned in the edit summary before [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pornography&amp;diff=601975793&amp;oldid=601974827 this latest edit there.] I might have mentioned the Effects of pornography‎ article at this WikiProject before (will need to check the archives to be certain), but I've had it on my  since 2012 (temporarily took it off my WP:Watchlist) and I've mainly seen POV editing there about pornography's effect on health and crime, with few improvements going on there. I'm not sure how active the research is on the effects of pornography‎ with regard to health or crime, but, judging by the sources used in that article, one could conclude that the research is not very active on the topic or at least that there are not many reviews coming out on it. So, per , this may be an area where  are the rule instead of the exception or are at least not as discouraged as they usually are with regard to health topics. Tgeorgescu and Drbogdan are the latest editors of that article and Drbogdan added some more references to the lead (though, per , references don't necessarily need to be in the lead). I'm not sure why the &quot;Some studies support the contention that the viewing of pornographic material may increase rates of sexual crimes&quot; part of a sentence was left uncited, since that is supported lower in the article.

Lipedema

Dear medicine experts, could you please take a look at this article? Since it was created in 2005, it has had only two references (one of which is dead), but it makes a number of questionable statements, such as an 11% incidence, a claim that &quot;in recent years growing awareness of lipedema has come from internet sources&quot;, and various other completely unsupported statements about specific details. There is a recent comment in the  asserting that the article is a subtle promotion of cosmetic surgery, which may make sense, as it states that &quot;lipedemic fat generally cannot be lost through diet and exercise&quot;. It doesn't help that the article is extremely vague as to the causes of the condition; it first states that lipedema can be inherited while stating that the cause is unknown in a different section, but it seems to me that accumulating fatty tissue is different from the swelling of fatty tissue, which is what edema implies ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3309375/ this article] calls lipedema a &quot;rare disease&quot; characterised by hyperplasia of individual fat cells). Of course, I'm in no way an expert, and I may just be mistaken, so any comment would be appreciated. Thanks! -Anagogist (talk) 16:43, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

O-Acetylpsilocin 

O-Acetylpsilocin (4-AcO-DMT) is a research chemical purported to be a prodrug of psilocin, which the article makes clear.  My concern is that, as an RC, secondary sources are notably lacking on the subject, and I'm wondering if we're overstepping MEDRS by reporting the theoretical mechanism of action when no actual studies has taken place.  It's within the realm of possibility that 4-AcO-DMT is active itself but this too has not been confirmed.  Ugh, I also just noticed that bluelight.ru forums (an illicit drug form) is being used as a source, so it's probably worse than I thought.

Citation of Wikiversity articles as sources in medical articles.

See here: [https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Category:Articles_used_as_reference_in_Wikipedia]. It appears that having instituted some sort of 'peer review' process, it is now being claimed that Wikiversity meets  and/or . AndyTheGrump (talk) 19:29, 30 March 2014 (UTC)

Incidentally, it should probably be noted that all articles so far cited from Wikiversity have been written by the same author: . AndyTheGrump (talk) 19:53, 30 March 2014 (UTC)

Looking at the archives for this talk page, I found this thread [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine/Archive_45#Peer_review_of_medical_research_now_offered_for_free_in_Wikiversity] which discussed the proposed Wikiversity 'peer review' process - though I can see nothing whatsoever in it to indicate that there was any consensus to accept such material as WP:MEDRS-compliant. AndyTheGrump (talk) 19:59, 30 March 2014 (UTC)

As given in , it has been established that &quot;Wikiversity content is generally not . Therefore, usage of Wikiversity as a reference in Wikipedia is generally not advisable.&quot;. Yet, I still think such usage is possible, as can be judged on a case-by-case basis. Mikael Häggström (talk) 20:09, 30 March 2014 (UTC)

Perhaps you could then explain why the 'Wikiversity:Peer review' page [https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Peer_review] which was written almost entirely by you expressly claims that &quot;A major reason of having a work peer reviewed in Wikiversity is the possibility to summarize it in Wikipedia, or having additional quality assurance of existing Wikipedia entries, citing the Wikiversity page as the source&quot;. It is up to Wikipedia, not Wikiversity, to decide whether sources meet our standards - and it seems entirely irresponsible to suggest otherwise. AndyTheGrump (talk) 20:27, 30 March 2014 (UTC)
Andy, the page you cited (a category page on Wikiversity) does not appear to make any claim that Wikiversity meets RS/MEDRS. Lesion 21:10, 30 March 2014 (UTC)
Not directly, no. But the implication is there on [https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Peer_review] - and the person responsible for writing it has chosen to cite his own Wikiversity articles on Wikipedia. WP:COI seems relevant here... AndyTheGrump (talk) 21:18, 30 March 2014 (UTC)
Where are they cited on Wikipedia? Also I personally would not say that the second cited page (Peer review) expressly states that Wikiversity meets RS/MEDRS. It says a possibility, which to my reading implies that this could be the case in the future, or indeed a case by case basis (as pretty much any other source on Wikipedia)... as stated above. Might be an idea to tweak this wording for more clarity. Lesion 21:24, 30 March 2014 (UTC)
If you look at the articles in the Wikiversity category, they each contain a template saying &quot;This article is used as a reference in Wikipedia in the following articles:&quot; AndyTheGrump (talk) 21:48, 30 March 2014 (UTC)
OK I see now. E.g. [https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Allogeneic_component_to_overcome_rejection_in_interspecific_pregnancy Allogeneic component to overcome rejection in interspecific pregnancy] is used on Interspecific pregnancy and Immunosurgery. Perhaps we should try to reach a consensus about this, ping to posters on original thread , , . To continue the discussion, I would suggest on the positive side of these sources, that they appear to be secondary sources, with in-line citation to reputable sounding sources. On the negative side, assume this journal is not MEDLINE indexed. Lesion 22:16, 30 March 2014 (UTC)
It is not MEDLINE indexed, but I'm working on having such issues fixed. The  just got ISSN registered last week, and I'm currently working on assigning doi codes for each article, so there is still a lot of work to do.Mikael Häggström (talk) 04:27, 31 March 2014 (UTC)
*I support this project as a pilot. I would not suggest dismissing all papers in a given journal even if that journal is from a Wikimedia project, because most journals publish dubious papers which ought not be cited even if on their face they seem to have gone through process. If someone questions a source then I think the best response would be to just treat it like any other source which someone claims is dubious. There are no great plans to scale up the Wikimedia publication of academic sources, and for that reason, I see no reason for a special response to this even though comments on the proposal are welcome as for any Wikimedia proposal. I like having an original publishing proposal in place as a concept of how this can be done. For a more developed similar proposal, check out Scholarpedia.

I'd like to ask you all to take a look at a Wikimedia IEG grant a few of us here at Wikiproject MED are behind.
You may already have heard of the translation of medical articles that is being done (if not please take a look at ). The goal of the grant I've applied for is to get some traction so as to have the translation and integration process going smoothly.
We've come far at , but to get further there is need of some form of organization, preferably by someone who can devote significant time to the task.

I'm very hopefull that I can provide real benefit with this grant, as there are so many articles on Wikipedia that could help people all over the world.
It's even more important when you take into account drives such as Wikipedia Zero, which gives readers who might not have access to anything else access to Wikipedia.

Please take a look at the grant page: , and add a comment or give your ideas on how we can best benefit other Wikipedia communities.

New user edits at Depression (mood)

A new user Naimanadeem has made several edits to this article today, using a few primary sources to reference his/her edits. I am at a loss whether these are considered acceptable under , but lean towards suggesting they be replaced by better secondary sources.
The reason why I am hesitant is because we make the distinction between Major depressive disorder and Depression (mood), something which not all sources do in the same way, and some of the primary sources target depression in general and not specifically major depressive disorder.
Thoughts?
 --  CFCF (talk ·  · ) 08:11, 3 April 2014 (UTC)
Yes, it is a bit of a headache that some medical articles use &quot;depression&quot; as an abbreviation for &quot;major depression&quot; and thus &quot;major depressive disorder&quot;. Many of the edits look reasonable and the statements look like they should be able to be supported by secondary sources, although there's one or two that mightn't be. Best would be to look for review articles and see what can be replaced. Cas Liber (talk · ) 18:53, 3 April 2014 (UTC)
