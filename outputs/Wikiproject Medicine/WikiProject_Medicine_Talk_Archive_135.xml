Gita Ramjee expansion
Hi Wikipedians. Was hoping there might be an editor/contributor who’d be able to help me expand the article on Ugandan-South African HIV researcher ita Ramjee who recently died due to ovid-19. The article has been nominated to be included on the home page as a recent death, but needs some TLC. Is there anyone here who’d be able to include a bit more detail on her research? Might be possible to include some JSTOR sources at the moment too. Thank you! --ser:Elinor.Dashwood|Elinor.Dashwood (ser talk:Elinor.Dashwood|talk) 09:19, 2 April 2020 (UTC)

 Reader engagement with medical content on Wikipedia  
This is from a month ago but I just saw it from an update to the meta page.

*meta:Research:Investigating Wikipedia's role as a gateway to medical content

|Willinsky, |Lauren maggio, and |Daniel Mietchen are among the organizers named on the meta page, but only the first two are named as authors of the paper.

The paper analyzed what it calls &quot;WikiProject Medicine Pages&quot;, or &quot;WPM pages&quot;.

*&quot;WPM pages were viewed more than four times as frequently as the rest of Wikipedia&quot;
*&quot;readers spent more time on a page before first clicking an external link after loading a WPM page.&quot;
*&quot;WPM readers were more likely to hover over a footnote or other link, especially on their desktop devices, and more likely to click on footnote links, compared to W readers (Table 4). On the other hand, W readers were more likely to click on external links than WPM readers, favoring their mobile devices in that regard. The WPM readers are interested, it appears, in seeing what evidence is being drawn upon in making the statements set out on a WPM page rather than trying to view the source compared to readers of the rest of Wikipedia.&quot;
*&quot;...WPM readers are more engaged in assessing the citation of the external link, which assists in validating and building trust in the content that makes up the WPM pages, than by the opportunity to visit the sources as a gateway for further learning. &quot;

ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 22:38, 5 April 2020 (UTC)

Also particularly interesting is the main conclusion that they draw: &quot;Our findings suggest that WPM readers appear to use links to external sources to verify and authorize Wikipedia content, rather than to examine the sources themselves&quot;. A separation of the the multiple roles that citations fulfil. ser:Evolution and evolvability|T.Shafee(Evo&amp;Evo)ser talk:Evolution and evolvability|talk 01:41, 6 April 2020 (UTC)
About t|&quot;more likely to hover over a footnote or other link&quot;:  How do they know that they're hovering over a ref tag to look at the citation, and not hovering over a link to an unfamiliar word to find out what it means?  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 14:21, 6 April 2020 (UTC)

 Popular pages 

Our most popular pages have changed in recent weeks, mostly in predictable ways.  You can see articles listed by page views at ikipedia:WikiProject Medicine/Popular pages (which is due for its automatic monthly update in the next couple of days).  Almost all of the top 20 pages are related to the current pandemic.

There are also pages, such as ytokine release syndrome, that aren't as popular but whose popularity has significantly increased (#181 for February, and wasn't on the list last February; current page views are up about 500% compared to this February).  If you see articles that are getting more traffic than before, please feel free to share them here.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 20:20, 5 April 2020 (UTC)

 Monoclonal protein 

Hi all, I've just asked question in the talkpage for yeloma protein, and I am posting here to get more eyes on the matter.

 Viral load 

In the context of the coronavirus, I've seen someone talking about the iral load in the environment – think &quot;I wouldn't go for a walk outside in that city, because the viral load is so high there&quot;.  I'm not sure that's a technically correct use of the term, but (a) that article needs some attention anyway, and (b) if there is a better term, maybe it should be mentioned there.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 01:55, 8 April 2020 (UTC)
&quot;Viral load&quot; has a precise meaning. As you know, the expression first came into to use  in the context of HIV treatment. To talk of a viral load outside this context wrong.  In the environment we have &quot;levels&quot; such as bacteriophages and enteroviruses in water. ser:Graham Beards|Graham Beards (ser talk:Graham Beards|talk) 10:37, 8 April 2020 (UTC)
 I agree, viral load is a liquid measure used for blood viruses. For viral aerosols, researchers often call it viral concentration and might use copies per cubic meter as units. But measuring such concentrations is difficult and as far as I know there is no single standard assay. Here is an old review paper on the subject.[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2546863/] --{{u|ser:Mark viking|Mark viking}} {ser talk:Mark viking|Talk} 11:06, 8 April 2020 (UTC)

eply|WhatamIdoing I think they mean environmental contamination? The similar distribution and survival profiles on surfaces for both viruses, supports the view that COVID-19 behaves like SARS-CoV and environmental contamination by respiratory droplets is an important factor in transmission. ...A study from Singpore (Ong et al 2020) sampled air and surfaces in the rooms of 3 patients with COVID-19.

* Good point. I think the very first sentence is already problematic, because it defines it as the quantity in a given volume, but it doesn't say a volume of what.

 ICD-11 

Hello everyone! I've made a start on writing the article CD-11. I'm also planning to create CD-11 MMS chapter pages, similar to those of the CD-10 (emplate:ICD-10|here) and the CD-9 (emplate:ICD-9|here). I've already created CD-11 MMS Chapter 1: Certain infectious or parasitic diseases|Chapter 1: Certain infectious or parasitic diseases and l|ICD-11 MMS.

Full disclosure: I'm a total noob. I have no degrees in medicine, no background in health care, nothing. I could only write stuff about the general structure of the ICD-11, and about mental disorders. As a psychiatric patient myself, I know a bit about that. But I know nothing about the other stuff.

I have not send it yet, because I can imagine that the WHO and many other people 019–20 coronavirus pandemic|have different things on their minds right now.

 WikiJournal article on Epidemiology of ep D 

Hi all. A new WikiJMed article has just been published on the Epidemiology of Hep D (oi:10.15347/wjm/2020.001). Since the Wikipedia page on Hep D lacked an epidemiology section, I've added the abstract from the wikijournal article However it might be logical to move over some more of the info.

 ephron 

Hi guys. This article, which I think is of extreme importance, had 15 instances of the &quot;citation needed&quot; template. I've sat down with 3 basic books and provided citations for all of them, correcting the claims when they disagreed with the sources. How else do you reckon we can improve this key article? ser:DrVogel|Dr. Vogel (ser talk:DrVogel|talk) 15:54, 12 April 2020 (UTC)
I would recommend keeping ephron relatively simple to avoid repetition with other pages. I think that the lede should be shorter, summarizing its contents without having unique new material. There is no need to expand sections which are already in P:SUMMARY form, nor to expand existing functional sections, which overlap with idney#Function and enal physiology. ser:Klbrain|Klbrain (ser talk:Klbrain|talk) 18:30, 12 April 2020 (UTC)
ser:DrVogel|Dr. Vogel, I like the abundance of images in that article.  I noticed that several sub-sections had no citations, and it sounds like you could improve that easily.  Also, ideally, the beginning of each section should be in very simple language.

 Saltatory pattern of fetal heart rate 

Hello WikiProject Medicine. Do you folks think that raft:Saltatory pattern of fetal heart rate warrants a standalone article, or would it be better to incorporate it within another article (eg eart_development#Heart_rates)? Any other comments on the notability or accuracy of this article would also be greatly appreciated. Cheers, ser:1292simon|1292simon (ser talk:1292simon|talk)
I think that it would work well as a section on ardiotocography#Interpretation; an alternative would be etal distress. The content is certainly worth including somewhere. The phenomenon described isn't primarily one of heart development, but a sign of autonomic (via CNS) stimulation in response to acute hypoxia leading to fetal distress. The article links to etal hypoxia, but that redirects to ntrauterine hypoxia which focusses more on chronic (rather than peripartum) effects of hypoxia. Note that etal distress#Signs and symptoms already mentions &quot;Non-reassuring patterns seen on cardiotocography: -increased or decreased fetal heart rate (tachycardia and bradycardia)&quot;. However, the topic of the draft is quite technical and hence would be better on ardiotocography#Interpretation, a section which is in need of updating. ser:Klbrain|Klbrain (ser talk:Klbrain|talk) 07:54, 13 April 2020 (UTC)
* Hi Klbrain. Many thanks for your help with this. I won't pretend to understand all those fancy latin-based words, but I think I got the gist that the best spot is ardiotocography#Interpretation! Cheers, ser:1292simon|1292simon (ser talk:1292simon|talk)

GoodRx link
ing|SandyGeorgia To clarify: my question is about whether linking to a price comparison website in the infobox is supported (or at least just not contested) by the community; I never intended to list GoodRx's prices for reasons I stated on the drugbox talk page. ser:Seppi333|Seppi333 (ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert 2¢) 00:20, 29 March 2020 (UTC)
The previous discussions have mostly been about putting a link in the External links section.  The main problem with a site like GoodRx is that it's limited to a single country, which P:ELNO dislikes.  Editors have discussed adding the nternational Medical Products Price Guide website as an external link (if it weren't basically a big &quot;Under Construction&quot; sign right now).  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 06:12, 29 March 2020 (UTC)
The idea was to implement it with the functionality to add links to external sites for other countries if any are available, analogous to how the pregnancy and legal status categories are implemented (i.e., by listing the RHS with a prepended country code). That field is not intended to be exclusive to the United States; there merely happens to be a use case for linking GoodRx in the US (namely, rug coupons for high cost drugs) beyond the provision of pricing information, hence why I proposed that first. If other countries for which the drugbox provides pregnancy-cat/legal-status parameter support have accurate and up-to-date price trackers, a parameter can/may just as well be created for them IMO. The drugbox already contains parametrized ELs to websites that provide country-specific information (i.e., all of the licensing info parameters), so I don't really see how the creation of this field can be construed as being problematic on the basis of the US being the first country to be parameterized or that the parameter would link to country-specific information. That's just my 2 cents anyway. I'm going back on my wikibreak. ser:Seppi333|Seppi333 (ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert 2¢) 07:42, 29 March 2020 (UTC)
I don't think GoodRX is comparable to details such as pregnancy and legal status which are stable and encyclopaedic. A site offering the current price, after coupon discount, in your local area of the US only, from partner retailers, is not encyclopaedic, and fails P:EL. If folk think linking to price comparison websites (of which drugs is one but many - mortgages, insurance, consumer goods, savings accounts, pension plans, etc, etc) then you should really go for a site-wide RFC on it, and not raise your hopes. -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 08:42, 29 March 2020 (UTC)
Fair enough.  That was my plan anyway; I just don't have time to do it right now.  Don't really have any expectations at this point. ser:Seppi333|Seppi333 (ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert 2¢) 09:28, 29 March 2020 (UTC)
 Seppi, I think WhatamIdoing has well summarized the issues and concerns but I wanted to recognize your work that went before at any rate. I mentioned at one point that I would not be opposed to including GoodRx in an external link template, but I think we would have to have similar apps from many countries before considering implementing such a proposal.

ing|Colin|SandyGeorgia So, the field in question - at present - is meant to provide links to country-specific consumer/retail drug price information.  I'm open to adding other websites/DBs to my proposal if either of you know of suitable retail drug price databases for other countries. I can't imagine the United States is the only country for which data on that exists given that consumer drug cost minimization is a rather important avenue of harmacoeconomics research, and you can't really study that without consumer drug price information. So, I will probably end up looking for other databases later if no one knows of any off-hand. 

I was thinking of posing an RFC question along the lines of &quot;Is it acceptable to include external links to various country-specific databases that provide consumer/retail drug pricing information in an external links template in drug articles?&quot;  Does that cover the main issue at hand in your opinion, or would you phrase this differently?

@Colin: this is really minor and doesn't really have any bearing on this discussion, but I figured I'd clarify one point.  Regarding the underlined part - q|A site offering the current price, after coupon discount, in your local area of the US only, from partner retailers - GoodRx's drug coupon prices with retailers don't vary by region; they're the same all across the US because GoodRx negotiates with the harmacy benefit manager of the corresponding pharmacy chain (e.g., Caremark for CVS pharmacy) to establish the coupon price for the corresponding retailer. It doesn't work with individual pharmacies to set those. Not all US pharmacy chains are present in every US state, which is primarily why they localize the drug coupon listings. Addendum: regarding the out-of-pocket (non-coupon) retail price which is displayed along with the coupon price, from my understanding PBMs set those as well, so those shouldn't vary geographically within pharmacy chains either. ser:Seppi333|Seppi333 (ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert 2¢) 05:25, 13 April 2020 (UTC)

 I don't know of any others, Seppi, but I suggest it might be better to hold off on any new RFCs until we get our RFC mechanism act together via the arb case.  On the different pharmacies in different states, I agree with you (that that is the issue), but I think in effect, that makes for the same conclusion Colin was drawing.  Perhaps I'm misunderstanding; I've been known to do that :)  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  05:29, 13 April 2020 (UTC)
 I'm not in any rush to do this, so I suppose I can wait. How long do you think that'll take? ser:Seppi333|Seppi333 (ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert 2¢) 05:40, 13 April 2020 (UTC)
ser:Seppi333|Seppi333 I don't really know the US at all well. The &quot;local area&quot; comment wasn't so much that perhaps GoodRX would locate the nearest/cheapest price but that a particular chain of pharmacy is available locally. For example, for me, it is all well and good if some site says that ASDA have the cheapest ibuprofen gel if there isn't an ASDA near me. I agree with Sandy that there is no rush for this. I also think you should consider what WP would be like if links to local price comparison databases were added for other article types too, and how the community would decide which sites to include, and the fact that these sites are themselves commercial and may compete. From Googling, I can see GoodRX is not the only one in the US. There are in the UK many insurance comparison sites, each with their own set of partners, each with their own special offers, and they only link to partners who either pay up front for the privilege or who give the site commission on sales. So I think it is going to be really hard to explain why Wikipedia should form a promotional link with one company, such as GoodRX, and for that matter, why Wikipedia would get nothing in return. You should consider that this is a question for the whole WP community, starting perhaps with a policy talk-page question about external links, rather than one where WP:MED have any special wisdom or authority. -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 10:24, 13 April 2020 (UTC)
Hmm, I imagine that if WP allows external links to price databases, the best approach would be to require a community-wide RFC to determine appropriateness. I don't think a blanket ban with no exceptions on them is the best approach because in some cases, they can serve a purpose other than simply listing prices (e.g., public service, historical record, etc.). That said, I agree that the vast majority of websites like this are not encyclopedic; however, beyond the additional functions that such websites might provide (e.g., GoodRx providing drug coupons), I think there is a distinction in terms of whether or not pricing information for unregulated products vs regulated products as well as pricing information for products where the price deviates from a competitive or related form of economic equilibrium due to oligopolistic (e.g., economic cartels like OPEC influencing the rice of oil) and monopolistic market players (e.g., shitbags like artin Shkreli who increased the price of araprim in the US by more than 50-fold) is encyclopedic.  Milk is a good example of the former and ilk#Price is covered in that article for that reason. Oil is a good example of the latter and it doesn't really surprise me that we have an article about its price for that reason.  Drugs, which are a class of heterogeneous products, are examples of the former or both, depending upon the country and number of suppliers for a particular drug within that country.
For those reasons, I think the price of drugs is encyclopedic; however, the current price of drugs is not something that can feasibly be maintained in article prose. By linking to external drug price databases, we avoid problems with providing outdated pricing information in articles and bloating articles with details for different countries and the varied systems for setting consumer/retail drug prices that they use.
As a general rule, I completely agree with you about linking to commercial price comparison websites being a cause of concern, primarily due to the likelihood of rincipal-agent problems (e.g., the company running a website might change its business model and promote certain suppliers and/or omit others - that's probably the most concerning situation) and, to a lesser extent, the fact that we'd be providing an economic benefit to the company that runs the website which we link to.  In the case of GoodRx, favoring some retailers and omitting others would actually negatively impact their revenue based upon their current business model.  Even in the single instance where they have a conflict of interest (i.e., they operate a [https://www.goodrx.com/treatment telemedicine service price comparison platform] and operate a [https://heydoctor.goodrx.com/ telemedical service provider]), they still list other providers in instances where that provider's price for a service is lower than GoodRx's price (i.e., they are providing unbiased service pricing information at their own expense). There aren't any COIs like that with their drug price comparison service because they don't operate pharmacies.  If, in the future, GoodRx were to change its business model in a manner that undermines our intended purpose for linking to it (i.e., providing unbiased drug pricing information), literally all we'd need to do to address that is remove the parameters from the template; I don't think that's really in the realm of possibility though since doing so would run counter to their mission/corporate culture. If there is consensus to do this, I would have to contact GoodRx directly to request access to their database in order to create the bot script to add the relevant links to their drug price comparison webpages; so, I could also just stipulate that as a requirement for us to link to their database when I make the request.
As for us providing an economic benefit to GoodRx by linking to them (NB: simultaneously, GoodRx would be providing an economic benefit to the people who follow our links to them in the form of drug coupons), that's a valid concern; however, there's no alternative sources of consumer drug price data that provide the same level of completeness as the GoodRx database. It also happens to be the most widely used drug price comparison website and drug coupon provider in the United States at the moment.  To requote the source I cited in emplate talk:Drugbox#GoodRx: q|Finally, we used a single website to represent discounts available online. Nonetheless, GoodRx is the largest price aggregator and coupon tool used by thousands of doctors and millions of patients every month. Further, 100% of GoodRx coupons were honored when physically presented at the pharmacy during this study.  That's not particularly surprising given that they were the first company to provide those services in the US. That being said, if a better alternative presents itself in the future, the external links could always be changed. 
I've spent a lot of time thinking about the cost/benefit of doing this in relation to our readers; based upon the stupidly high cost of drugs in the US, the prevalence of people who lack health insurance or have high deductible plans, and utility of GoodRx's drug coupons (which I illustrated in emplate talk:Drugbox#GoodRx), I think the benefit that they can provide to people in the US who navigate to their website from Wikipedia outweighs the &quot;cost&quot; we incur in the form of a risk (which I believe to be low) of principal-agent problems in the future.

I think I get what you're thinking, but maybe not really?  It doesn't give any real biomedical information.  It provides mostly historical information – it's been used for centuries, it's still being used, it's been studied – and a couple of physical facts (i.e., contains some chemicals).  There are editors who would want to remove it entirely, and others who would want to wrap every sentence in disclaimers like &quot;even though it hasn't been proven scientifically to actually work,&quot; but these individual sentences are probably correct.
That said, lose reading is apparently a dying art, and I've seen people read &quot;Don't do that!&quot; and think it means &quot;You can do that, if you really want to&quot;.  So if you can find a source that says there's no evidence that it actually works better than doing nothing for any purpose, then you might want to add one of those 'disclaimer' sentences.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:50, 18 April 2020 (UTC)

**Thanks, I'd like an image to illustrate the hagas_disease#Management|management section of the Chagas disease article. The mainstay of management for half a century has been treatment with one of the two drugs I mentioned above. They're somewhat infamous for their poor side effect profile, and are often used as poster children for the need for new drugs for neglected tropical diseases. Given their unfortunate fame, I thought it would be nice to have a picture of the drugs themselves (or at least one of them). In this particular case, packaging variation should be limited (I think?) since Bayer is the sole producer of nifurtimox (under the name &quot;Lampit&quot;) and just two companies produce benznidazole (under &quot;Abarax&quot; and &quot;Radanil&quot;/&quot;Rochagan&quot;). I'm not sure how much they vary the packaging in their different markets, but the disease is mostly prevalent in Latin America, so packaging from anywhere that the disease is endemic would be best (but I'll settle for whatever I can get!). Shamefully, I don't know much about the copyright complications around packaging. A picture of just the pills would be fine.

 Naming guidelines for articles on vaccines and drugs that do not yet exist 
ile:SARS-CoV-2 without background.png|thumb|40px|SARS-CoV-2
I started a requested move at OVID-19 vaccine proposing that it be renamed to OVID-19 vaccine development to reflect that such a vaccine does not yet exist and to be consistent with OVID-19 drug development. Some in the discussion opposed to the move pointed to IV vaccine, which appears to have never had a requested move discussion. Given the discrepancy, I think a broader conversation is warranted. Should articles about vaccines or drugs that do not yet exist include &quot;development&quot; in the title? {{u|ser:Sdkb|Sdkb}} ser talk:Sdkb|talk 19:52, 21 April 2020 (UTC)
 HIV is only one example. There are numerous articles for vaccines that are either in development or in clinical trials, including new versions of existing vaccines (for example, work is being done to develop a new mumps vaccine, and a new flu vaccine must be developed every year, which will probably also be the case with COVID-19). This is a critical distinction for vaccines, and perhaps some antibiotics or antivirals. Other drugs like headache medicines or statins may be improved from time to time, but with vaccines, many require constant improvement or they cease to work at all. ser:BD2412|BD2412 ser talk:BD2412|T 20:06, 21 April 2020 (UTC)

* Another factor:  Drugs are usually a single small molecule, which can be reliably reproduced by others.  Vaccines are iologics, which means they're not easy to copy and not necessarily interchangeable.  Your flu vaccine and my flu vaccine could be very different, even if we started with the same strains of the virus.  We will hopefully get multiple vaccines against COVID-19.

 ntibody testing/ntibody titer 

Serious work needs to be done here by editors who know the terrain. We have more content on antibody testing in the OVID-19 testing article (by far) than we do in the miserable stub at ntibody titer (and ntibody testing is a disambiguation page split between two concepts of the term). There is a great deal of news reporting right now about antibody testing for COVID-19, and we have no article giving a decent explanation of what antibody testing generally entails. I think ntibody titer should be moved to ntibody testing (LISA can go in a hatnote there), and the content on what an antibody titer is should be a section of the article in the broader context of what the testing reveals and what good it is. ser:BD2412|BD2412 ser talk:BD2412|T 18:57, 22 April 2020 (UTC)

Wow, that's quite meta. Honestly, it seems a little navel-gazey to me, but since it's been written about in the media, I guess why not? But I don't think the article should get longer than it is right now, and should probably be significantly shortened in some areas per P:INDISCRIMINATE.
At a brief glance, it looks like we don't have articles on Facebook's or Google's response to the pandemic (although we do have oronavirus app). Rather than having a Wikipedia-focused article, would it be better to have an article on technology companies' response, and have Wikipedia as one part of that? I've also proposed (unsuccessfully, so far) that isinformation related to the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic be broadened to have a scope not just about misinformation but about all aspects of information dissemination related to the virus.

That recipe calls for all-purpose flour and whole wheat flour, although I happen to have made it with some bread flour and white whole wheat this time.  I buy a pound of yeast every few years.  It keeps indefinitely in the freezer.  I'm running low (by my standards ;-)), but the worst-case scenario is that I'll use the last pinch to jump-start a not-so-sour starter.

 New page on supercomputer-assisted research? 
I contributed the section &quot;Supercomputer-assisted research&quot; to the page OVID-19 vaccine a while back, with COVID-19 work on the ummit (supercomputer)|Summit supercomputer and lue Waters having piqued my interest. I relied extensively on press releases and news articles for sourcing, however; in addition, the sources themselves contained no indication of vaccine research, but rather were focused on using supercomputers towards the discovery of drug candidates, forecasting, and medical protocols. Therefore, the section was removed. (I highly recommend going over the version history for the page.)

If I may ask, where might any information on the effects of COVID-19 on computing research be located?

 POV editing 

I have concerns about ser5|Magnovvig's recent edits to the eil Ferguson (epidemiologist) article, specifically misrepresentation of sources to cast Ferguson's research in a poor light, unsupported by the sources.
# In [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neil_Ferguson_(epidemiologist)&amp;diff=953526927&amp;oldid=953523180 this edit] Magnovvig misquoted the [https://www.businessinsider.com/neil-ferguson-transformed-uk-covid-response-oxford-challenge-imperial-model-2020-4 source] by substituting &quot;One of Ferguson's models predicted that 65,000 people would die from swine flu&quot; for the source's &quot;one of Ferguson's models predicted 65,000 people could die from the Swine Flu&quot;. There's a very clear difference in meaning in that edit.
# In the same edit, Magnovvig asserted &quot;This latterly caused some embarrassment to Health Secretary att Hancock during BC Today on 16 April 2020 while the oronavirus pandemic raged in the UK.&quot; The source says nothing about &quot;embarrassment&quot;, nor does it describe its context as &quot;while the coronavirus pandemic raged in the UK.&quot; The embellishment is clear editorialising.
# In [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neil_Ferguson_(epidemiologist)&amp;diff=953527533&amp;oldid=953526927 this edit], Magnovvig selectively quoted Streek as saying &quot;the authors assume that 50 percent of households where there is a case do not adhere to voluntary quarantine ...&quot; The source actually quotes Streek as saying &quot;In the - really good - model studies by Imperial College about the progress of the epidemic, the authors assume, for example, that 50 percent of households in which there is a case do not comply with the voluntary quarantine ...&quot; Magnovvig's deliberate omission of Streek's preface puts a spin on the quote you employed and places the paper in a much worse light that Streek's actual words did.
# Having mentioned criticism of Ferguson's work, Magnovvig failed to make use of the Business Insider source's quotes from Tim Colbourn and Stephen Griffin, which were favourable to Ferguson's study.

But otherwise, let's not go any further than the objective, unchanging facts, such as positions held and papers published.

 I'm concerned about your use of this forum for browbeating me.
 In this instance, there are no quotes on wiki, and wikipedians are somewhat free to interpolate. The model influenced policy, did it not? That is why the House of Lords had their post-factum inquiry. Or do I mistake their thrust. The model itself was taken from &quot;can die&quot; to &quot;will die&quot; somewhere between abstract theory and dictated policy and concrete practice. That is the reality of what transpired, and the [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/raison_d%27%C3%AAtre raison d'être] for the Lords inquiry. Please, let us not split hairs. Ferguson for a time was in the [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/jump_seat jump seat] of the bus. Lesser men would not have survived a call that was wrong by *two orders of magnitude*.
 No it is not. It is an accurate picture of what transpired in the interview. Wiki forces us to summarise fifteen minutes of radio into one sentence. Are you naive or just a hack? What other reason is there to think that a radio host drags up some event from more than a decade earlier?
 It is standard practice in academic circles to couch language in a [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/shit_sandwich shit sandwich]; I'm just cutting to the chase. Wiki forces us to brevity, remember? And it's Streeck, if I'm not mistaken.
 This is an article about Ferguson, and that is a ed herring. If I want to write about Tim Colbourn and Stephen Griffin or any other character who appears in the Business Insider article, I'll do so on their pages. What you seem to be saying here, if I'm not mistaken, is that you buy into rgumentum ad verecundiam.
 Ferguson is a big boy and more than able to fend for himself. Remember that lesser men would not have survived a call that was wrong by *two orders of magnitude*.

 Wikipedians are not free to put spin on sources. There is a big difference between a model that predicts that deaths could rise to 65,000, and a model that predicts that deaths would rise to 65,000. That is not splitting hairs, and your edit deliberately misrepresents the source.
 q|&quot;This latterly caused some embarrassment to Health Secretary Matt Hancock during BBC Today on 16 April 2020 while the coronavirus pandemic raged in the UK.&quot; is not an accurate picture of what [https://www.businessinsider.com/neil-ferguson-transformed-uk-covid-response-oxford-challenge-imperial-model-2020-4 the Business Insider source] states. Anyone can read the source you used to see that is the case. You embellished what you read there to reflect your own POV and that's not acceptable. Strike your personal attack on me there.
 Steek's comment was not made &quot;in academic circles&quot;, but in a newspaper interview. He was asked for an example of a model containing an untested assumption. Your selective quotation gives a very different interpretation of Streek's criticism of the report that he otherwise found &quot;wirklich gut&quot;nd as is apparent from a full reading of the source.
 You are utterly mistaken. There's no red herring. Our article is indeed about Ferguson, but q|&quot;All encyclopedic content on Wikipedia must be written from a neutral point of view (NPOV), which means representing fairly, proportionately, and, as far as possible, without editorial bias, all the significant views that have been published by reliable sources on a topic.&quot; You cherry-picked the critical comment about one of his models from the Business Insider source, but didn't report that the source also contained quotes favourable to Ferguson's work.
 If you don't demonstrate that you're prepared to abide by our policies on NPOV and NPA, I'll take steps to see that your editing privileges here are curtailed until you do. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 17:23, 28 April 2020 (UTC)

 Help with creating a new wikipedia article outlining a newly discovered disease

Hi, I am a research coordinator. My team has newly discovered a disease and would like to publish a Wikipedia article on it without being controversial. I am looking for assistance as to how I can facilitate this? Furthermore, what data will you need from me and my team so that we can facilitate this? 

From what I understand, in order to publish an article about a newly discovered disease, we would need an article written about this disease by an individual who was not involved in the original study and discovery of the disease, however this person can not be someone who is uninvolved with the study. Can someone further explain this point to me? I don't quite understand what I will need to do moving forward...

Hello, ser:Leahpoly|Leahpoly.  You don't need to bother with l|Help Me tags on this page.  We're always here to help.  You can probably understand our dilemma:  we want to have comprehensive coverage, but it sometimes seems like any quack can buy an allegedly peer-reviewed journal article, so we have to restrict things and say that the original paper isn't ever enough.  In this situation, we usually want is at least one peer-reviewed eview article that talks about your new disease.  It doesn't matter whether that article agrees or disagrees with you, but it does matter that the authors aren't you.  It also matters that the review article (not yours) comes from a medium-to-good journal, and not one of those places that's notorious for publishing whatever they can make money on. 
So that's where we start.  From there, it depends a little on the subject.  The standard for a newly isolated virus or bacteria (which is pretty objective) is usually lower than the standard for a syndrome that is currently diagnosed as one thing, but which your group thinks ought to be considered its own thing (which is probably the toughest category).  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 23:01, 28 April 2020 (UTC)

 Blood irradiation therapy 
ile:Blood irradiation misleading screenshot.png|thumb|200px|right
Circulating on Facebook are what look like (but aren't) screenshots of a Wikipedia article entitled &quot;ultraviolet blood irradiation&quot;, and they are being used to suggest that Trump's statement yesterday that UV might be a cure for Covid-19 is more sensible than he is being given credit for. We don't have an article by that name but the term is a redirect to lood irradiation therapy, which may now see an increase in traffic. It is not the most polished article on the 'pedia, and I can see from the talk page there has been discussion before about how credible a technique this is.

Proposing moving eedle exchange programme to yringe service program
It is currently under eedle exchange programme but I am proposing moving it to yringe service program (a target that already exists). The reason is that there are operations that hands syringes out to drug addicts. While those are still a syringe service, not every syringe service is a needle exchange. ser:Graywalls|Graywalls (ser talk:Graywalls|talk) 03:57, 1 May 2020 (UTC)
ser:Graywalls|Graywalls, there are two changes in this suggested move.  The first is moving needle (the pointy metal bit) to syringe (the basically harmless plastic tube).  The second is moving exchange (which implies a trade) to service (which does not).  Which of these two swaps is the important bit?  Or, to put it another way, is there actually an organization that hands out only plastic syringes to people who will have to stick dirty needles on the end of those clean syringes, and then congratulates themselves on doing a fine public service?  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 04:39, 1 May 2020 (UTC)
 The two terms used are needle exchange or syringe service program. There are programs under the disguise of euphemism &quot;need-based&quot; that HANDS OUT insulin syringes to drug addicts. By convention, I have not seen anything named &quot;needle service program&quot; though. &quot;SSP&quot; seems to be commonly used in the medical context. https://fsph.iupui.edu/doc/research-centers/SSP_Report_20180516.pdf  
 The term &quot;needle exchange&quot; refers to a program where the service user must bring in old gear in order to obtain new stuff usually 1 to 1. It is a model that few (if any) in harm reduction favor and is usually implemented for political reasons. example: [https://harmreductionjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1477-7517-7-1 The Washington Needle Depot: fitting healthcare to injection drug users rather than injection drug users to healthcare: moving from a syringe exchange to syringe distribution model].    bI haven't read this whole article in depth but it does not appear to be limited to describing an exchange program. For example it mentions vending machines which obviously can't function that way. Harm Reduction Coalition (respected in HR community) also [https://harmreduction.org/training-calendar/syringe-service-programs-best-practices/ uses] the term Syringe Service Programs.    b Unfortunately the term &quot;exchange&quot; is used throughout this article and I can also see there are various permutations of the terms including hyphenation and abbreviations. I think it would be appropriate to include some kind of clarification about the difference between &quot;exchange&quot; and &quot;service&quot; because obviously it is a point of confusion though I am not sure exactly how to write such a thing or where it would go. There should be a brief section about actual exchange programs.  b For the curious, the kind of injection equipment available is generally something like the [https://www.bd.com/en-uk/products/diabetes/diabetes-products/insulin-syringes/microfine-insulin-syringes BD Micro-Fine].    bAlso sorry if this is not the right place to put this but the term &quot;drug addict&quot; is considered stigmatizing (see for example [https://www.hri.global/what-is-harm-reduction What is harm reduction?] footnote #1).   b (I just signed up to be a editor and am intending to lurk a bit before jumping in editing.

Do they also hand out the pointy metal bit?  Or just the plastic part?  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 19:40, 1 May 2020 (UTC)
they're often syringes with the needle permanently built into them. ser:Graywalls|Graywalls (ser talk:Graywalls|talk) 20:20, 1 May 2020 (UTC)

I can see the advantage for the service vs exchange part of the name change (all are services; some are exchanges).  The euphemistic aspect of &quot;really, just the plastic bit!&quot; rather than the &quot;don't step on the improperly discarded sharps&quot; concerns me.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 22:21, 2 May 2020 (UTC)

 Misinformation MEDRS 

isinformation related to the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic, which keeps growing, needs a bit of ongoing attention. Some things like Buzzfeed are being used as MEDRS (for &quot;Potentially serious side effects from chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine include irregular heartbeats, tinnitus, blurred vision, muscle weakness or &quot;mental changes&quot;&quot;, for instance). There are also some medical implications in the mere fact that some statements in the article; things like an implication that COVID-19 cannot affect young people with no comorbidities should require MEDRS. Obviously the regular media cover notable bits of misinformation, but I think we should be explicitly contrasting those notable rumours with reliably-sourced information. 

There are some biomedical ideas common to many conspiracy theories, such as beliefs that specific ethnic groups are more or less vulnerable (on genetic grounds, not due to demographic factors like socieoeconomic status, profession, age, prevalence of pre-existing conditions, etc.), or that the virus was genetically engineered to attack humans. Adding a section after &quot;Combative efforts&quot; refuting these might be an option. ser:HLHJ|HLHJ (ser talk:HLHJ|talk) 01:50, 18 April 2020 (UTC)
 HLHJ, one thing you can do in the interim (as you wait for others to get in there), is to put a edcn tag on non-MEDRS-sourced text. That generates a &quot;medical citation needed&quot; tag, and will help others get to things quicker. ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  01:54, 18 April 2020 (UTC)
 Thanks, ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia; I'd been using &quot;medical citation needed&quot; tags, but was not aware of that convenient shortcut. The whole page frankly needs a rewrite, some of it ideally by someone who's really kept up with the COVID-19 literature, which I have not. 17:38, 18 April 2020 (UTC)
 Relatedly, I've had a solid go at ist of unproven methods against COVID-19, which basically consists of dozens of iterations of:

uote box |There are widespread rumours on Facebook that p:BEANS|stuffing beans up your nose prevents/cures COVID-19. A [hapless spokesperson for a public health authority] said that there was no evidence that stuffing beans up your nose is effective against COVID-19, and it is not on the WHO list of recommended measures. They also warned that stuffing beans up your nose can have side effects, like damage to the nasal passages and difficulty breathing normally. They strongly advised the public not to stuff beans up their noses, recommending that they instead wash their hands and follow social distancing measures. They also said that anyone experiencing problems as a result of stuffing beans up their nose should call their medical provider.

The MEDRS are not always stellar. Frankly there are too many of these rumours to keep up with refuting even just the notable ones that reach tens or hundreds of thousands of people. The WHO has put out statements against some of them. ser:HLHJ|HLHJ (ser talk:HLHJ|talk) 01:32, 19 April 2020 (UTC)
HLHJ are you thinking we need higher bars for notability of items of misinformation?

That's an impressive list, I'd never heard of a lot of those misconceptions. Sorry, ser:Doc James|Doc James, didn't see your post at first. Here, if we just enforce MEDRS and only include things a public health authority saw fit to refute, which are generally also those with entire news articles about them, then that seems to act as a decent bar; it gets the most common and most dangerous misinformation. These rumours tend to be language-bound, and there are a lot of them that are notable; eventually we may need to prune for sheer length. 
I was posting here mostly because I was worried about uncited and incorrect MEDRS implications from the inclusion of some topics in isinformation related to the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic. Some IPs have been not unreasonably complaining about this on the talk page. The &quot;Age&quot; section has been removed, but, for instance, isinformation related to the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic#Public use of face masks|content on public mask wearing, which I don't think I'd put in the same category as violet-oil suppositories, remains. I'm hoping someone expert will go through and remove any misinformation about what is misinformation. ser:HLHJ|HLHJ (ser talk:HLHJ|talk) 06:46, 28 April 2020 (UTC)

For better results “Plasma Therapy” we have to follow following points 

1.	Corona virus frequently changes through mutation. So Donor and Receiver from same tree of Covid-19 infection , that means plasma transfer between persons belongs to same area or between family members.

2.	In Plasma therapy dosage 200 ml , no option for change dosage ,so its better option to collect Immunoglobulin concentrate from plasma with technique “Plasmapheresis” . Injecte Immunoglobulin’s instead of plasma .The above drug “ Human Covid-19 Immunoglobulins”injection (Monoclonal antibodies/IgG antibodies)  from in India based on this principal,”Passive Immunity” . Patient needs only IgG antibodies (Immunoglobulins). No need to transfer total plasma with unnecessary material.“ Human Covid-19 Immunoglobulins” injection is preferable than plasm for covid-19 patients. In this injection the manufacturer mixed all various types of strains of Corona virus. We can adjust dosage based on severity of clinical symptoms.

 The only point I'd make, |Doctor Andrew Baldwin MD is that we must be careful not to editorialise based on our own knowledge and experience. For example, the Atlanta study says nothing that I could find about donor and receiver being from the same tree of COVID-19. Although I'd personally agree with your conclusion that the rate of mutation indicates a higher chance of success when donor and recipient are from the same region, I would disagree with the suggestion that mutation rate is a factor in preferring family (there are other reasons for that). In my case, my son is in Canada and I'm in the UK, so I doubt we'd be encountering COVID-19 with just the same pattern of mutations.

https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/coronavirus-when-will-a-covid-19-vaccine-be-ready/article31490925.ece

&quot;Coronavirus is difficult to isolate. But the efforts of scientists of National Institute of Virology (NIV) Pune have been successful and about 11 isolates of coronavirus are available which is a prime requisite for doing any kind of research related to viruses. Even with expedited clinical trials and approvals, it will take not less than around one-and-a-half to two years to develop a vaccine,&quot; Gangakhedkar asserted.

Dr Sreehari Y, chairman of MRPA Corporation, said, “We started work on the research three months ago when the first Covid-19 case was reported in China. We have a team of 25 doctors, including general physicians, pathologists and microbiologists, among others”. 

He further said, “The basic process of this injection is that Injectable Immunoglobulins are collected from asymptomatic Covid-19 persons (IgG antibodies positive) or recovered patients to protect and strengthen the immune system of new patients.

Different procedures may be used to filter immunoglobulins from the blood”

 KCMO stats 

Hi all,

I've made a bunch of prevalence maps at a county level based on the JHU &amp; census data. The only state missing is Missouri, because I'm kind of thrown off by how they treat Kansas City. Does anyone with a better insight have a suggestion as to how to interpret that data at the county level? Some other states had combined reporting (e.g. Utah's health districts, New York City) where I could just combine the counties and add their numbers (basically taking a weighted average).

The complicated part is that cases show up both in counties and as 'Kansas City'. I'm hoping that the double counts are excluded, but not sure how to exactly calculate things, because I see different definitions for 'Kansas City' and how many counties it spans.

The eastern edge of the biggest hospital is right on State Line Road.  People from all over the region use that hospital.

 Habit cough 
abit cough is a mess of marginal sources.  I can clean it up to MID|25856777 and MID|26926981, but there are editorial comments all over the literature about the naming. See MID|28449492  Should it stay at habit cough or be moved to omatic cough syndrome? ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  08:27, 30 April 2020 (UTC)

It looks like the name is old, e.g., [https://www.google.com/books/edition/Illustrations_of_Unconscious_Memory_in_D/Bx5WAAAAMAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=%22Habit+cough%22&amp;pg=PR9 chapter 6] of this 1891 book, which also calls it a memory-cough and objects to it being called a stomach-cough because that name implies the wrong pathophysiology.  (The term habitual aborter was used in veterinary medicine at the same time, and I suspect that it arises from a more neutral view of the word habit than we have these days – more like &quot;It was his habit to take a walk everyday after dinner&quot; than the modern use, which almost always implies a bad habit:  tobacco habit, habit of chewing fingernails, etc.)  
A section on the name would not be amiss, I think.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 19:06, 30 April 2020 (UTC)
Just because a name is old, that doesn't mean that it is should be changed. While those 2015 and 2016 articles suggest a recent name change, the use of habit cough continues in the medical literature; for example, the 2017 MID|28289448 starts q|Habit cough is most commonly characterised ..., so I'd argue that it's too soon for a name change, and as the name change hasn't taken effect in common (medical) use. ser:Klbrain|Klbrain (ser talk:Klbrain|talk) 08:41, 1 May 2020 (UTC)
 That was the direction I was headed as well.  I think I will rewrite the article first, with a Name section, and then we can better see if a name change is warranted.  I am also concerned that Weinberger as author appears so often on that page, and want to spend some time seeing if there are differing views. ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  13:07, 1 May 2020 (UTC)

So, people, this simple little article (abit cough) is a bit fraught, and it may be expedient to sort this before I continue writing.  New guidelines were issued in 2015.  Those guidelines appear to suggest this should be two separate articles, placed at Tic cough and Somatic cough syndrome.  But the lead author on the Guidelines (Vertigan) has written a 2017 editorial (which is basically a review), and another author of the Guidelines (Weinberger) seems to prefer the old terminology.  So I have used the primary source (Vertigan editorial) in a limited way, with attribution, to explain the dilemma. And then Koreans wrote new guidelines in 2016, that stuck with the old naming.b I have only written up so far a small portion of the Name dilemma, and still have the entire article to write, based on numerous new sources.  Before I continue, it would be helpful to decide if this should be two articles, and if so, under what names ... as we have apparently a situation of somewhat contentious guidelines involving four different ill-defined and not well distinguished terms and conditions (tic cough, habit cough, psychogenic cough and somatic cough disorder).  The new names were to bring terminology in line with DSM-5, but that appears to have some resistance. The [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5394006/ 2017 Vertigan editorial] gives the best overview of the whole situation; she was the lead author on the [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4493876/ 2015 Guidelines]. Weinberger, another author on the Guidelines, in [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5344044/ 2017 prefers Habit cough] in a published secondary review (and one reason this concerns me is that Weinberger is the main proponent of uggestion therapy, which I had never heard of until this article). ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  17:13, 2 May 2020 (UTC)
If there isn't a consensus as to whether there is one, two or more syndromes, then I think that its best to keep the topic on one page where the different potential meanings can be discussed. Different syndromes can be discussed in different sections, and they can also be compared. If the page were to split, then the same awkward disambiguation of related terms needs to be carried out in two places rather than one. I wonder whether there are also national differences here, with the US changing nomenclature and the rest of the world not. ser:Klbrain|Klbrain (ser talk:Klbrain|talk) 17:19, 2 May 2020 (UTC)
 OK, it's going to be tricky to sort it all out on that one page, but I will keep trying.  (Should also mention that Irwin, author of 2006 guidelines, was co-author of 2015 guidelines, and Pringsheim, co-author on 2015 guidelines, is a well-recognized ic disorder person, so it looks like a good panel). Also, on the national differences, the Vertigan editorial mentions four other countries, that I will look into ... ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  17:32, 2 May 2020 (UTC)
It sounds like a Classification section might do some good.  &quot;Weinberger classifies it this way, and the Korean guidelines split it that way, and...&quot;  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 22:06, 2 May 2020 (UTC)
 Headed that direction as well, but I can't even say &quot;it&quot;, since there may be two &quot;it&quot;s.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  22:14, 2 May 2020 (UTC)
 Maybe if I just roll the whole mess into one Section called, &quot;Classification and name&quot;?  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  22:16, 2 May 2020 (UTC)
I had a look, and I think that's working. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:49, 7 May 2020 (UTC)</segment>
