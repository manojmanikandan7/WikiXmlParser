Old pages
A number of the oldest of the old pages listed on pecial:Ancientpages are obscure diseases.  It would be great if some of these could be dealt with by being categorized.  Listed below are some of the oldest. - ser:SimonP|SimonP 17:13, Nov 24, 2004 (UTC)
*emierre's syndrome
*orvan's syndrome
*entral pontine myelinolysis this is a neurological disorder most often associated with rapid repair of hyponatremia
*rthrogryposis multiplex congenita this is a congenital multiple contracture syndrome. I think it has more than one cause (i.e., not a single distinct genetic disease).
*ay Meyer syndrome.  Shouldn't this be hyphenated if it's named after two people, kind of like i-Fraumeni syndrome?  ser:Andrew73|Andrew73 23:58, 13 October 2005 (UTC)
We should in any case have redirects from all such articles without hyphens to the articles with the hyphen. - ser:Nunh-huh|Nunh-huh 00:15, 14 October 2005 (UTC)
*ligoclonal bands
*enani Lenz syndactylism is a very obscure and minor congenital limb malformation syndrome.
*ucopolysaccharidosis type VII Sly syndrome This is an inborn error of metabolism affecting the CNS and various other organs.
I moved this to ly syndrome so it matches the other mucopolysaccharidoses. 
*lpers disease This is a congenital birth defect syndrome involving a skull malformation.
*lternating hemiplegia is an acquired neurological dysfunction.
Seems to me that all these articles now have been categorized. ser:Alex.tan|Alex.tan 21:01, 6 Apr 2005 (UTC)

 Category:Medicine 

I've been moving articles from Category:Medicine to the appropriate subcategories, but there are a lot of articles and some help would be appreciated. In general, medical articles are categorised in two types categories: by the medical specialism they belong in (e.g. Category:Pulmonology) and by their etiology (e.g. Category:Autoimmune diseases and/or Category:Eponymous diseases). ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 22:35, 8 Dec 2004 (UTC)

One of my colleagues just pointed me at the ustralian Medical Council website - where they have a [http://www.amc.org.au/exam mock exam]. After 50 questions (takes about 20min) you get a break down of your performance. 

I gotta confess I was a bit anxious doing the test but was relieved to obtain the giddying ranking of 'satisfactory' (for the record I scored: 39/50 Mastery: 12/15) apparently I guess better than I thought!

&quot;Neurologic disorders&quot; vs &quot;Neurology&quot;
Hi. While going through the old pages above listed by ser:SimonP|SimonP, I wondered whether articles on ... arghh... diseases affecting the nervous system should go under what I thought sounded right (and what I started doing) Category:Neurologic disorders or whether, as some have already done, put them in Category:Neurology. I was figuring that &quot;Neurologic disorders&quot; would fit as a subcategory of Category:Diseases but that &quot;Neurology&quot; would not because it's also the study of normal neural tissue function. What's the consensus view here? ser:Alex.tan|Alex.tan 05:02, 28 Feb 2005 (UTC)

Diseases should be in both categories. Neurology is the field that deals with them, and neurologic disorders is the pathophysiological category. All autoimmune diseases are in Category:Autoimmune diseases, even though they are also under Category:Rheumatology, Category:Pulmonology etc. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 22:56, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)

Nephrotoxicity
epatotoxicity and eurotoxicity were extant, but today I finally started ephrotoxicity. Could all of you kindly add the drugs you know, and the mechanism? It is still very short. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 22:56, 8 Mar 2005 (UTC)

 On the topic of &quot;Category:Disorders&quot; 

this is in regard to the listing of Category:Disorders on the ikipedia:Categories_for_deletion#Category:Disorders|Categories for Deletion page

In the discussion, we have gotten to the point of considering whether a &quot;disorder&quot; is a &quot;disease&quot; or vice versa.  One proposal on the table is to delete Category:Disorders (the actual action would be a renaming to a specific disorder type, but that is tantamount to a delete).  Another proposal is to keep Category:Disorders and actually place Category:Diseases as a sub-category of it (the reasoning is found in the discussion linked from above).  One question is whether something like &quot;growth disorder&quot; as a category can be considered a viable child of &quot;diseases&quot; as a category; if it cannot, then maintaining a &quot;disorders&quot; category is pretty much a requirement.

It would be helpful if one or another of you could step into the discussion and provide some input that might help a decision be made.

Thanks in advance.  ser:Ceyockey|Courtland 03:51, 2005 Mar 9 (UTC)

 Automatic tool for creating PubMed citations 

In trying to ikipedia:Cite your sources|cite my sources, I've found [http://www.qwikly.com/WikiBib/Journal.html WikiBib] very useful. However, that tool requires that you provide all the info (e.g. article title, journal, author, etc.), and I'm a bit too lazy for that. So I created a tool that can [http://diberri.dyndns.org/pubmed.html generate citations given just a PubMed ID], and I figured someone here might find it useful too.

 Infobox  
I propose using an infobox on pages for diseases and disorders. Here is a mockup I've come up with: emplate:DiseaseDisorder_infobox. An example of how this would look is available [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leukemia&amp;oldid=14766106 here]. --ser:Arcadian|Arcadian 00:37, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

The way you have designed the template invites a whole host of problems. It presumes that signs, symptoms, diagnosis and therapy are clear-cut. They are not. For example, you stated that astroenteritis is treated with operamide. That is generally, but there are too many &quot;yes, but...&quot; situations to blankly put this in the template.
The template contains entries for incidence and prevalence. These numbers are very dependant on population and location (e.g. hepatitis in Southeast Asia), again defying the purpose of a template.
I can only imagine one use for this template, which is linking numerical data, such as the ICD code and DSM IVR classification, as you rightly did. Otherwise, I am firmly opposed to its use on disease-related pages. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 03:55, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

* I have revised the template to meet your specs. You can click [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leukemia&amp;oldid=14766106 here] to see how it looks. In the long term, I'd hope we could consider putting some of those other categories back in, and I think I'm more optimistic than you are that we can find mutually agreeable sources (for example, we could use the ICD codes for symptoms and signs, and I know there are WHO sources for incidence and prevalence), and that the use of this template could be a useful nudge to the editors on some of the disease pages that are currently disasters. The field I'd argue for most is a Cause field, because I think that will help focus people's attention when they edit pages. But for now, if the only two fields we agree on are ICD and DSM, could we go forward with that, try it for a few months, and then if it goes smoothly, perhaps we could consider gradually expanding it? --ser:Arcadian|Arcadian 04:32, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

What if we redesigned it for unequivocal codes &amp; terms such as ICD9, DSM IV, OMIM number, defective gene, defective enzyme, causal organism? Many diseases would have an association with more than 1 item in some of the fields (e.g., more than 1 OMIM number or infectious agent). We could list up to 5 of each, and if more are applicable, the box would say &quot;multiple, see article&quot;. I am relatively lukewarm about this because I am realizing that most of the disease articles I have written have multiple genes or enzymes involved. OK forget it. I do agree entirely with you that there is no value to the boxes as offered with a few arbitrary signs and symptoms. Nice try by Arcadian; give him credit for effort anyway. ser:Alteripse|alteripse 04:28, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

* A thought in response to Alteripse's comments: perhaps we could address your concerns by putting fields in for &quot;Parent&quot; and &quot;Children&quot;. For many of the diseases where there is ambiguity about the cause (for example, astroenteritis) we could use that as a consistent interface to drill down or drill up and resolve ambiguity. --ser:Arcadian|Arcadian 04:41, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Are parent and children some type of technical database terms describing a hierarchy? Explain a little what you mean? ser:Alteripse|alteripse 05:00, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

*For example, if there was a template on the nemia page, because the causative agent is dependent upon the type, we wouldn't list the cause on that page, but instead say 'see children'. In the children section of the template, we would have links to the kinds of anemia, like ron deficiency anemia or egaloblastic anemia. Then, on those pages, the 'parent' field would have nemia. Because the different kids of anemia present in similar ways, we could include the signs and symptoms on that parent page. --ser:Arcadian|Arcadian 05:13, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Uh, in the present form it seems Leukemia has a DSM code (quod non, unless they have started coding the third axis now). I support Alteripse's idea to link other &quot;discrete&quot; values such as OMIM numbers. In theory eSH headers could also be linked.
Without wanting to sound patronising, I think Arcadian is being too optimistic about medicine being systematic. What is considered a &quot;cause&quot; for a disease is often dependant on numerous risk factors. I would have serious misgivings about a definite &quot;cause&quot; being stamped on every medical article; again it smacks of oversimplification.
As for &quot;parent&quot; and &quot;child&quot;, this is indeed confusing. Even iron deficiency has multiple unrelated causes. Let's just not do this. The category system is presently in use to classify diseases by the type (autoimmune, malignant, infectious) and by the specialism that deals with them. That should be sufficient. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 05:17, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Per the above, I've added MeSH and OMIM. --ser:Arcadian|Arcadian 11:23, 6 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Haven't heard any feedback for a while -- any other changes that people want to the template before I start putting it on some of the pages? --ser:Arcadian|Arcadian 19:35, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)

We are more dubious than ungrateful and don't want you to waste your efforts if we end up not being able to use the boxes without introducing errors. Why don't you put a couple of your proposed boxes on a couple of hematology or endocrinology articles (look at the ones JFW and I have been working on) and let us see if they might be applicable before you do a whole lot? ser:Alteripse|alteripse 19:42, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Well, I don't want to put more time into building the disease infoboxes if JFW is just going to revert them again as he did earlier this week, so I'd rather find out beforehand if they're okay before I invest the time. When he performed his reversions, he asked that I come to this page and get a consensus before proceeding, so that's what I'm doing here. To help facilitate consensus, I have removed everything but ICD from the initial emplate:DiseaseDisorder_infobox. --ser:Arcadian|Arcadian 20:42, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Arcadian, I apologise for appearing heavy-handed, but there were big problems with the box, and on every page I found a reason why the box would not be appropriate. You've spent a lot of time on this, and I don't want to create the impression that us grumpy doctors are monopolising on medical articles (which I do occasionally tend to do).
ICD codes should apply to all diseases, while DSM-IVR or OMIM will not. I do warmly support your move to link ICD codes, which is probably the best classification of diseases we have at the moment. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 22:17, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)

Evening chaps, just happened across this page and thought I'd say what a good idea I think the infobox is, and wondering if any of you would care to revisit it after a break of a few months? FWIW, I think the inclusion of OMIM &amp; MeSH links but be quite sensible, as it would allow users to cross-over into those two databases for further research. Also, I've just added the UK's ist of Read Codes|Read codes in a similar format to the ICD-10 page, as I thought if the info box were to go ahead it might be sensible to include all widely used classification standards (though that page might need a bit of work...). I look forward to further discussion! ser:James Bedford|James Bedford 00:09, 10 November 2005 (UTC)

 Another one we might want to consider adding is CD-O. Right now I've been adding those as subcodes to ICD-10, but it might be more precise to split them out. Perhaps we could have an 'other codes' section to handle codes that would not apply to all cases. By the way, thank you for creating ist of Read Codes. What is the relationship between Read Codes and OPCS-4? Eventually I'd like to get infoboxes to support rocedure codes as well as iagnosis codes, but I'm still trying to get a better understanding of international standards.

 Preclinical medicine/medical science project 

Hi all, I am ser:PhatRita|PhatRita, a medical student. I have been following this project recently with interest. I think the same format and organistion could be applied with great effect to subjects on preclinical medicine such as human anatomy and physiology. The pages there are a mess. They face several problems which include:

*lack of agreement on whether to use lay or professional terms such as &quot;superior&quot; vs &quot;above&quot;
*lack of organisation on materials - redirections problems such as upper limb to arm (which is anatomically incorrect) and so on.
*lack of material full stop. There is so much to expand on. Many entries, especially anatomy, are one sentence and are stubs.
*lack of clinical relevance. Pages have no links to clinically important subjects, eg rist and carpal tunnel syndrome
*some information is misleading, perhaps peer reviewing could help?
*many pages are both animal and human together. It makes pages sometimes unreadable and sometimes complex and misleading.

Just take a look at the uman physiology page to see what I mean.

The project could provide:

*a central organisation
*highlight and attract more involvement
*improve the quality and linking to clinically relevant subjects
*peer reviewing could further help this
*separation of human medical science as a stand alone subject, which is important clinically.

What do you think? Please mail me with suggestions and interest
thanks

ser:PhatRita|PhatRita 12:02, 22 July 2005 (UTC)

Although lacking time myself, I warmly support PhatRita in this quest. Basic science is still immensely poorly covered, and organisation is sorely lacking. The problem lies partially at the rather unglamorous character of basic anatomy, however important to any surgeon (or even for the sake of science). I was utterly shocked that I had to start ediastinum almost four years after Wikipedia was started. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 00:23, 25 July 2005 (UTC)



I have started the ikipedia: WikiProject Preclinical Medicine|Preclinical medicine page. If you are interested in helping in any way, please have a look! ser:PhatRita|PhatRita 00:08, 27 July 2005 (UTC)



Sure, welcome, and have at it!  When it's really bad, you can really make it better. I've been splitting my toil between clinical and a few biochemistry/physiology topics, as well as lounging about the ref desk. ser:Alteripse|alteripse 00:34, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

First of all, welcome, PhatRita! I agree with the issues you have raised. Unfortunately, medical students and doctors tend to be extremely busy which is part of the reason why these articles are not in top shape, I suspect. Now that I'm an intern, I've become busier than I ever was, and I've had to severely cut back my time on Wikipedia (I haven't even listed myself as a member of this WikiProject, which I probably should do). Recently I've been focusing on new articles, picking medical ones from ikipedia:WikiProject Missing encyclopedic articles, varying somewhat between basic science and clinical articles (my recent ones have been hromoblastomycosis, astoiditis, ransaminase, oleus muscle, and crocyanosis). I agree with JDW about the difficulty in writing anatomy articles—I put everything I could think of in oleus muscle and it was a stretch at that. I've been collecting links to articles that need work but my list grows faster than I can attack it. I don't know how many people are active here, but perhaps we could consider some type of collaboration of the fortnight or something if there are enough. Or at least an internal peer review—I know I wouldn't mind others in the medical profession (or about to enter!) taking a look at the articles I write. — ser:Knowledge Seeker|Knowledge Seeker ser talk:Knowledge Seeker|দ 01:34, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

In fact, the more I think about it, I like the idea of having a weekly or fortnightly collaboration. Would anyone else be interested? Of course there would be no obligation to contribute, but if we had several people poke their heads in it could really help. There are many medical articles that really should be a lot better than they are—like IRS for instance. I wouldn't mind setting up and maintaing the collaboration page. Maybe we could alternate between clinical and pre-clinical topics. Laypeople would also be welcome, especially to ensure that the articles are understandable. Thoughts? — ser:Knowledge Seeker|Knowledge Seeker ser talk:Knowledge Seeker|দ 03:28, July 25, 2005 (UTC)

Hi all again, thanks for your comments and suggestions. I think Knowledge Seeker's idea of a COTW is a good idea, just to get the process of improving the pages off the ground. Maybe sometime down the road we can think about expanding it into a more ambitious project if needs be. If possible we could program a new tag like COTW Medicine or something, to stick on nominees. In fact, why not stamp a seal like &quot;improved with the COTW medicine&quot; and maybe that will attract more support.
Whenever I write about a topic on anatomy or other basic sciences, I always forget an important point or maybe a certain object has a different name, eg sternal angle/Louis etc. Peer reviewing as part of the collaboration is very useful.
If you could make a page for this purpose, I'll be happy to help you maintain and improve. Are there any interested people for the first collaboration?
ser:PhatRita|PhatRita 12:39, 25 July 2005 (UTC)

As there was talk about anatomy, I would specifically like to point out that it would be very appreciated if Latin redirects were created to the relevant topics.

Redirect askun to chromatopsia?
chromatopsia currently redirects to askun, however, I was wondering if anyone would mind if I switched the redirect in the other direction. In Google, &quot;Achromatopsia&quot; gets about 20,700 hits and &quot;Maskun&quot; gets about 20,500 (but the vast majority appear to be Icelandic webpages or things unrelated to abnormal cone function). In PubMed, &quot;Achromatopsia&quot; gets 2,854 hits whereas &quot;Maskun&quot; gets only 1 (one). Please let me know if there are objections to switching the redirect. ser:Edwardian|Edwardian 05:09, 5 August 2005 (UTC)

Switching the redirect seems like a good idea; however, there's probably more to be done, as the two terms aren't synonymous.  Achromatopsia isn't only an inborn error of the cone; it's a general term for absence of color vision, and there's more than one kind of that, including permanent acquired achromatopsia from small right parieto-occipital strokes (some people argue that this is always color agnosia or color anomia, which verges on the philosophical.); and paroxysmal achromatopsia, described in some (extremely rare) cases of occipital lobe epilepsy (Brazis, Localization in Clinical Neurology mentions this; I've seen a case of it myself.)  -ser:Ikkyu2|Ikkyu2 10:35, 29 August 2005 (UTC)

I would also be interested in contributing to Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology. I am a consultant orthopaedic surgeon and editor of [http://www.orthopaedicweblinks.com Orthopaedic Web Links] If David Ruben is acting as overall editor for orthopaedic surgery perhaps he can give me some direction. I have added a couple of comments to the talk sections of Traumatology and Orthopaedic Surgery but haven't quite got all the wiki conventions and customs straightened out. I am giving a lecture at UBC (Vancouver) next week about Internet activity for orthopaedic surgeons. Do you want me to direct them your way?--ser:Mylesclough|Mylesclough 06:55, 21 September 2005 (UTC)

Wow, an orthopod! It would only be reasonable to make you overall editor for orthopaedic surgery. PLEASE tell the UBC about the dire need of orthopaedic articles on Wikipedia. The present info is written by lay people and of low-to-very-low quality. Most docs here are either medics or GPs, and surgeons and orthopods are urgently required for the relevant pages! ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 17:13, 21 September 2005 (UTC)

Academic egos are fragile, poor souls, and there is very little credit for contributing to the Internet. On Wikipedia it seems as if anonymity is preferred. The mulitple editing model means that no one person (or team) can be credited with the article. I like it, but it will be tough to sell to people who are a)busy b)involved in publish-or-perish. So I will put out the message but have some doubts of its reception.
What is the status of the Medical Wiki? The links to it don't work at the moment --ser:Mylesclough|Mylesclough 22:11, 21 September 2005 (UTC)

I am not aware of any large-scale comprehensive medical wiki. I agree that it takes a particular mind-set to contribute fruitfully to Wikipedia; there is scepticism about its accuracy. It would be great of you'd be able to enthuse any orthopods in our work.

 Finding those medically inclined 
Just discovered Wikipedia and the medical part of it. Have been adding categories to userpages of those suspected of being doctors or students. Should I have forgotten any please leave a category on your/their page. Here are the ones already guilty of being a Category:Physician_Wikipedians|doctor or Category:Medical_Students_Wikipedians|student.

Furthermore I found some pages  (ypermagnesemia, ypomagnesemia, aracentesis, leural effusion, ulmonary edema, horacentesis) that need extra work. Presently I will redo these and hope they will be more up to standard. 

On these pages (cute respiratory distress syndrome,hest tube, leural effusion, neumothorax, ulmonary edema, horacentesis) I would like to insert pictures but I am not sure if the ones I have are allowed. I have some nice ones from the net or out of medical journals. Maybe some of you might help. --ser:Nescio|Nomen Nescio 18:16, August 29, 2005 (UTC)

Nescio, you're working unbelievably hard! Don't get overworked! You are likely to find many other medical pages that are substandard. We have the Medical Collaboration of the Week to iron out the most sorry examples, but the ones you've identified could all do with work.

Images are a sore point. I always carry a small digital camera, but the most interesting images are of patients or their imaging, both of which have ethical concerns. Images from US Government sources are widely available, though, and could fix this problem. Alternatively, you may ask your patients if they would object against inclusion of an image in Wikipedia. I did this with ickman line, but in an ideal world a written permission should be obtained.

Images of medical technology should be easy to obtain (just snap a picture of a CVVH machine, a mechanical ventilator or a chest drain) but are less illustrative. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 20:35, 29 August 2005 (UTC)

erebellum
ser:Nrets | Nrets and I have spent a lot of time on the erebellum article. It went to peer-review without much action. It's now up as a ikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Cerebellum| FAC.

I found it quite difficult to read, even though I've just finished neuroanatomy a months ago. I think a bit more wikifying is needed. There are several terms which I think you should clarify, such as phylogenetic and lesions (instead of relying on redirecting) - eg lesion (damage to the nerve) etc. 

The main concern I have is the &quot;lesions of the cerebellum&quot; section, which is a mass of writing. The only clearly visible disease, Parkinson's, is actually a disorder in the sunstantia nigra in the deep grey mass of the midbrain. 

I also think that some terms should be bullet pointed - such as atresia, diadochokinesia, ataxia and so on. Clinical detection of cerebellar disorders should be included. I will try and fill most of these in. But it does look promising. ser:PhatRita|PhatRita 15:42, 31 August 2005 (UTC)

* Re phatRita's remarks, Thanks for your input. I think that several topics in this article are simply touched upon since they could be greatly expanded into their own articles, such as: erebellar disorders or omputational theories of cerebellar function.  The way the article stands now there is a bit of a general overview, anatomy, cellular physiology, and medical conditions.  While neither section is as comprehensive as it may be, they do serve to give a general overview of the cerebellum, what it does and how it's studied.  Therefore, much of the elaboration on the medically-related terms might be better in a separate page.  ser:Nrets|Nrets 16:23, 31 August 2005 (UTC)

 Reorganize? 

I have some lofty ideas for new medicine subprojects, but I am unsure where to set them up. One is to revamp the &quot;ikipedia:WikiProject Clinical medicine/Collaboration|medical article workshop&quot; page as discussed on ikipedia talk:WikiProject Clinical medicine/Collaboration. Another is to implement something like what is being discussed at ikipedia talk:Medicine Collaboration of the Week#Systematic covarage of topics. The question is, should I do it here or at a new ikipedia:WikiProject Medicine? My first inclination is to do it here, but I would want to significantly redo the project page and perhaps some of the other pages, and other users might prefer this project the way it is and won't appreciate me messing it all up. Also, neither of these idease are limited to clinical medicine; they would include preclinical medicine too. The problem, though, with making a parent WikiProject is that it would just add more complexity that might be unnecessary. In any case I have no desire to modify things like the template or infoboxes and such; I am interested in coordinating work and highlighting areas for improvement and such. Any thoughts? — ser:Knowledge Seeker|Knowledge Seeker ser talk:Knowledge Seeker|দ 07:34, September 5, 2005 (UTC)

 Myocardial infarction 

The need to patrol medical articles is again emphasised. Have a look on alk:Myocardial infarction. A well-meaning chap who thinks uabain will cure myocardial infarction tries to push a link to his website. The danger of this is the pseudoscience dressed up as scientific opinion. Please be vigilant, all. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 12:14, 5 September 2005 (UTC)
I've left a message on the alk:Myocardial infarction|Myocardial infarction talk page too. I've provided links to Wikipedia's policy of no original research, verifiability and NPOV. I've also offered a mild middle ground, for the author to mention that ouabain is used in some alternative treatment, bu that it hasn't been tested thoroughly.

 Infoboxes 

This is not the first time I've had trouble with ser:Arcadian|Arcadian's infoboxes. He has been inserting these into medical articles without little discussion with the members of this Wikiproject, and although the effort is laudable in itself I've found many inconsistencies and problems.

A recent discussion concerns taxia. Arcadian inserted a box here, as ICD10 has a &quot;category R&quot; for symptoms not otherwise classified (NOS). I think the presence of a box on a &quot;symptom&quot; page creates massive confusion, and am against its use. What do the others think of this? ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 20:39, 5 September 2005 (UTC)

Jfdwolff -- despite what you wrote on my talk page, I did address your issue, on the talk page for the template. Feel free to check the timestamps. But since the topic has been moved here now: Here's your original statement: 

Could you please respond to my message before putting the box back? taxia is not a diagnosis, and even the ICD itself recognises this. I think that by putting ICD boxes on symptom pages we cause confusion. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 20:26, 5 September 2005 (UTC)

Several forms of Ataxia are listed in ICD-10 as &quot;Diseases of the nervous system&quot;. [http://www3.who.int/icd/vol1htm2003/fr-icd.htm?gg10.htm+]. Also, ataxia on its own is listed in ICD-10 under &quot;Symptoms and signs involving the nervous and musculoskeletal systems&quot;. [http://www.dimdi.de/static/en/klassi/diagnosen/icd10/htmlengl2005/fr-icd.htm?gr25.htm+]. You said that I recreated the DiseaseDisorder infobox, but if you read the talk page you would have seen that I created another template called &quot;SignSymptom infobox&quot; to address your concern. Please tell me what you feel was so inaccurate about [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ataxia&amp;diff=22643512&amp;oldid=22626341 what I added] that you had to revert it without going to the talk page first.  --ser:Arcadian|Arcadian 21:06, 5 September 2005 (UTC)

Well, your SignSymptom box looks deceptively like the DiseaseDisorder box, to the point that I failed to notice the difference. The talk page of the template is not on my Watchlist, and I don't understand what made you think that it is.
We have had run-ins in the past on this. Your effort is laudable and I agree it is useful to continue the most common medical classification system on Wikipedia (as we do already with enzymes, pharmacological agents etc). My gripe is your working without much consensus. For example, container pages (e.g. eukemia, ymphoma) should not have boxes because these are not actual disease entities, and discussing this subject here would have elicited a response from most medically involved people on Wikipedia. I've also had to tidy up after you on various occasions ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leiomyoma&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=22642873 diff], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hodgkin%27s_disease&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=22357708 diff], [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Infectious_mononucleosis&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=22357742 diff]).
Please do not interpret my actions as hostile, but I honesty wish you'd discuss things better. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 22:33, 5 September 2005 (UTC)
(biting my tongue...) I would be delighted to address JFW's concerns about the emplate talk:DiseaseDisorder infobox. I've added his concerns to the talk page, and I invite everybody on this page to offer feedback and help drive to a consensus. --ser:Arcadian|Arcadian 00:43, 6 September 2005 (UTC)

I'm not sure why anyone thinks ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes are useful information to include. They're a means of coding billing records rather than a classification designed to enhance understanding of pathophysiology. Putting them in a box unduly emphasizes the trivial. - ser:Nunh-huh|Nunh-huh 02:06, 6 September 2005 (UTC)

However, ser:Ksheka|Ksheka, our now-departed Wiki cardiologist, was concerned that there are so many breakthrough articles that it is hard to decide which ones have affected the field enough to warrant inclusion.

There was a flurry of &quot;disclaimer&quot; making when templates first came out. We had disclaimers for legal and medical advice and nearly anything else you can imagine. Articles got cluttered up with them, and a decision was made that one link to the general disclaimer on every page would suffice (it's at the bottom of each served page as &quot;Disclaimers&quot;). The template you have found is linked to at the top of the general disclaimer page. It shouldn't be used in any actual articles. I think this is probably just fine as it is. - ser:Nunh-huh|Nunh-huh 01:15, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

 Interface with veterinary medicine? 
It's been brought up at FAC for pneumonia that we currently don't interface with those among us who treat animals. Is there a precedent that we've established that I just don't know? I would be in favor of splitting any medical article into a (human) and (non-human) article with a possible disambiguation at the top if there is an existing article. Any thoughts? ser:InvictaHOG|InvictaHOG 11:50, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

You want to split 5N1 into one for humans and one for nonhumans? Or just the symptoms and treatments? How about taking it one article at a time, each on its own merits? I've found it best to let articles organically grow and split off other articles as needed. Things like wiki-articles that evolve over time seem to work best that way. ser:WAS 4.250|WAS 4.250 22:55, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

Ideally, I think it would be nice to split H5N1 into an article about the causative organism and a separate article for the human disease which results. Then, if someone were to write extensively about the manifestations of H5N1 in birds, going into detail about the unique pathophysiology, etc., then I think it would be nice to have a dedicated article linked to H5N1 (non-human) at the top of the H5N1 organism/human disease page. It would be nice to have a plan for what to do about renal disease in cats, diabetes in dogs, etc. They are important articles, but I don't think that making every disease (ie diabetes, cancer) into a clearinghouse for every species makes sense. Better to let the disease name represent human disease and have a disambiguation link for any animal pages. 

However, I also like organic growth of wikis. I was just hoping not to reinvent the wheel if this situation had come up before (ie questions about pneumonia in other species on the FAC) ser:InvictaHOG|InvictaHOG 23:24, 15 November 2005 (UTC)

 Psychiatry under attack 

The Wiki is sorely lacking psychiatrists. This is a sorry time for sychiatry. Some delightful nti-psychiatry-affiliated editors have marched onto the Wiki with a big box of POV and are now unpacking their ware at various mental health-related articles.

Being the busybody that I am I have asked ser|Francesca Allan of MindFreedomBC to be more NPOV in her work on sychiatry, linical depression, . Fuller Torrey, hemical imbalance theory, ipolar disorder and lectroconvulsive therapy. I may need some help to lick these articles into a semblance of shape, as presently some of them are in a deplorable state.

Does any of you know a knowledgeable psychiatrist who would be interested in working on the Wiki?

What is the technique of checking for brain trauma through eye movement properly called? Thanks in advance.

As far as I know, it's usually just described. Something along the lines of &quot;checking extraocular movements.&quot; Typically, &quot;extraocular movements intact&quot; or EOMI if normal. Checking the pupils is separate, of course. ser:InvictaHOG|InvictaHOG 21:17, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

 Name of eponymous diseases 
I was wondering how eponymous diseases should be named. Is it with or without 's after the name of the doctor/describer. E.g. for an article I created recently, would the correct name be arber disease or arber's disease? At Category:Eponymous diseases and ist of eponymous diseases both seem to be used. What is most correct here? --ser:Wouterstomp|WS 23:28, 28 November 2005 (UTC)
I've been picking my way through some of the eponymous signs while I've been busy and have run into the same issue. I think that both should be linked to the same page (ie Farber's disease should not be red!). I think that the most appropriate way (from what I've read) to do it is without the apostrophe. After all, no one owns the disease, etc. Some diseases just sound better with the s, though! ser:InvictaHOG|InvictaHOG 23:43, 28 November 2005 (UTC)
Good question. I think the current styles are shifting toward not using the apostrophe. My personal preference, though, is to use it (I can't bring myself to say Alzheimer disease instead of lzheimer's disease).

 Infobox Help 
I want to create a hospital infobox, but I don't have the wiki-expertise to do it properly. Is there anyone here willing to go in on the project? I already have a basic format:
*name
*location
*number of beds
*affliation (school, private, religious, public, etc.)
*certification (trauma level, etc)
*website

Ideas? ser:Kerowyn|Kerowyn 23:03, 25 December 2005 (UTC)

*I suggest careful consideration as to your intensions here - do you seek to add local district general hospitals ? If so then it will go the way of schools with most articles being nominated for deletion (See ikipedia:WikiProject Deletion sorting/Education for a general list of discussions involving deletion of education-related articles).  In essence a body must have special significance, apart from being the sole provider of a service to a small community, to be in Wikipedia.  Hence local grocery stores are not mentioned but the socio-economic significance of almart (US) and esco (UK) warrent.  Thus t Thomas' Hospital is valid as both for its historical 12th Centuary origins, a major medical school, and site of the UK's first nursing school set up by lorence Nightingale with wards named both after her and in recognition of her work (eg cutari ward).
*So I ask again, what is the point an 'infobox' ?  Number of beds is pointless statistics (services in the UK are constantly being shifted between sites and forthcoming changes are likely to see patients forced to attend a greater range of hospitals) and it is of no interest to even the local community.  Waiting times for outpatient &amp; inpatient care are important to patients, which medical school the studients they might encounter come from is not. :-)   ser:Davidruben|davidruben 00:44, 26 December 2005 (UTC)

Kerowyn: I've created a stub at emplate:Hospital, and shown an example of it at edars-Sinai Medical Center.  To add or remove fields, first edit the template, and then make a parallel edit on the hospital page. It's very simple and bare-bones, but it should be enough for you to get started. And if you've got any questions on how to edit templates to make them fancier, feel free to ask on my talk page.

The only thing I [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3AHospital&amp;diff=32771885&amp;oldid=32771815 changed from your version] was shortening the header, and adding the pipe, so that if the field was omitted, the field shows up as a blank space instead of having the field name in brackets. --ser:Arcadian|Arcadian 15:56, 26 December 2005 (UTC)

***Thanks Arcadian. I've been doing stub sorting in the medical section, and it seems to me that infoboxes are a good way of standardizing articles about hospitals. Some are only a sentence long. And David, in the United States at least, the number of beds in a hospital is a good indication of size and services, while waiting time varies wildly depending on the time of day. If a patient is choosing a hospital, then Wikipedia probably isn't they primary source of information. But as I said, I only have a basic idea of what might need to be included in an infobox. ser:Kerowyn|Kerowyn 04:04, 26 December 2005 (UTC)

****Another thought, while I'm here. How are hospitals accredited in the UK? I know the US system of ranking trauma centers (evel I trauma center , etc., but I assume the rest of the world uses different systems. ser:Kerowyn|Kerowyn 04:07, 26 December 2005 (UTC)

****In UK individual hopsitals, being part of the HS, do not need to be complete providers of all services in an attempt to compete against their neighboughs.  Hospitals are arranged in Hospital Trusts which consist of one or more hospitals, each of which may be spread over a couple of sites.  The Hospital Trusts tender their services to the purchasing community-based CTs.  Hence most routine services are provided within each Hospital Trust, but not necessarily at each Hospital site.  Specialist services may be located at just one hospital (eg maternity services) but not another.  Tertiary level specialities (eg neurosurgery, kidney dialysis, transplatation) might not be provided by a particular Hospital Trust at all, and is instead commission by the PCT from a different Hospital Trust who provides that service for a whole region of the country.  Emergency (Trauma) centers are provided by all Hospital Trusts, but not necessarily at each hospital site.  So the question of bed numbers indicating levels of service are meaningless.  e.g Barnet Hospital is a District hospital with a full casualty, with Edgware Community hospital having outpatients, day-surgery and a midwife-only Birthing Unit (any complications ambulanced across to Barnet). In addition there is  Finchley Memorial community hospital which only provides outpatients services.  A few years ago, Chase Farm Hospital which had a complete range of services was forced into merger with its larger Barnet/Edgware/Finchley group.  Bed numbers are irrelevant - if one lives in Edgware, one must travel to Barnet for casualty, if living in Barnet and desire not to have any Obstetrician, then must travel to Edgware for their Birthing Unit.  Overall NHS bed numbers have been reduced in the last 10years (more day-case surgery, recognition of need to get mobile after operations to reduce risk of DVTs, and primarily for cost-cutting) and the current &gt;100% bed-occupancy rate (new patient placed in a bed whilst its previous occupant awaits to be discharged home) is in part causing greater complications after discharge, more work for General Practitioners, and may be contributing to the spread of MRSA in UK hospitals.
****Ok I accept it is important to try and have a style standardisation of those hospital articles WP already has. 
****As for that list of UK hospitals, I see most do not yet have WP articles.  Of these, most probably should never be given a WP article.  Might I propose the title of the lists be changed to 'Notable UK Hospitals listed by Wikipedia' etc ('notable' can be debated endlessly of course, but at least this would indicate an intension to be selective). I'm generally a WP inclusionist, but.... ser:Davidruben|davidruben 16:39, 26 December 2005 (UTC)
*****I think we should include bed number as a indication of hospital size. What I mean to ask is: how are trauma centers ranked? In the US a Level I trauma center has more services and staff to deal with emergencies, while Level II and Level III centers have fewer services. Is there a similar indicator for UK trauma centers? And I'd like to edit the infobox to include hospital specialities, for children's hospitals, etc. 
*****As for the list of UK hospitals changing the title to notable hospitals is probably a good idea. It'd be nice if we could give every hospital on the planet a short article, but it's not necessary or practical. It wouldn't be a bad idea to change all the hospital lists to notable hospital. ser:Kerowyn|Kerowyn 05:48, 28 December 2005 (UTC)
******Is there any readily available source of this information? Cedars-Sinai, for example, is affiliated with UCLA Medical School. Isn't that the kind of affiliation you meant? And it seems to me that maintaining accurate and specific numbers of beds would be a bit of a nightmare. - ser:Nunh-huh|Nunh-huh 06:07, 28 December 2005 (UTC)
******* Yes, that is the sort of affiliation I meant. Any medical schools and organizations that play a major role in administrating the hospital should be listed as affiliated organization. I realize that could add up to a lot of organizations for some hospitals, but one or two of the most important organizations should be enough. 
 I'm not sure if the certification section is clear though. What I mean by that is evel I trauma center etc, which is a important indicator of trauma staff and services in the US. Maybe that should be changed to &quot;trauma certification&quot; for clarity?
 The main source of information is the hospital website, which ought to be fairly accurate. Bed numbers don't fluctuate that much unless the hospital undergoes a major renovation. It shouldn't be too hard to keep up to date. ser:Kerowyn|Kerowyn 07:10, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

 Famous patients 

I'm starting to get intractable urticaria from the long lists of &quot;famous patients&quot; in many health-related articles. On varian cancer the editors were even using horrible terminology like &quot;stage IV disease, presently battling cancer&quot; etc etc. We've had a succesful deletion of a list of famous pneumonia patients split off from neumonia. I think we need to discuss a guideline for inclusion, possibly in the form of ikipedia:Notable patients.

If a page on a person mentions his disease history or cause of death, there is no immediate need to cross-reference this to the relevant disease page. Only under very strict conditions should someone be included in a &quot;list of notable cases&quot;:
* The disease episode made newspaper headlines
* The disease episode made an important contribution to the public perception of an illness (e.g. eorge Best and irrhosis, ichael J. Fox and arkinson's disease)
* The impact is lasting, not just through a memorial research funds trust
* There is reliable outside support (e.g. doctors commenting in newspaper articles, such as prof oger Williams did in George Best's case).

Please tell me what you all think, and we can start up the guideline. It can then be used to clobber crufty editors who insist on including their icon's ingrown toenail in the relevant article. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 13:43, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

External links
Inspired by JFW's proposal above, I'd like to propose that we define standards for what constitutes ikipedia:No original research|Original research when adding external links to medical articles. Here's a draft -- For a link to be added to a medical article, it must meet at least one of the following three criteria:

* The article has a ubMed ID.
* The domain of the URL is from a hospital or accredited university.
* The domain has a lexa Internet ranking of ten thousand or less. (This wouldn't apply for blogs or other personal accounts that would piggyback on the Alexa ranking of the parent.) --ser:Arcadian|Arcadian 18:04, 29 December 2005 (UTC)

Links with PubMed IDs should be deleted. If they are references, they should be cited as references, and if they're not then the don't belong in the external links section. Peer-reviewed research is of a higher information quality than people's websites etc.
Blogs are unacceptable unless the blog itself is inherently notable, usually because the blogger is inherently notable. I feel strongly blogs are extremely inadequate as sources of any form of medical knowledge, unless - again - written by experts.
&quot;Information&quot; pages are commonly added by anons. Anyone can write &quot;information&quot;, even doctors, but if this information is not peer-reviewed or underwritten by a professional organisation it is completely random. I now remove links as &quot;non-authoratitive&quot; if they are full of Google ads or promote non-standard treatments. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 15:13, 30 December 2005 (UTC)

This single user is the most tenacious anti-vaccine editor on Wikipedia, and has filled many articles with his choice anti-science on the subject of vaccination. Everything sounds nice and NPOV, but when the matter is investigated one encounters dangerous lunacy, notoriety and dishonesty. iera Scheibner, for example, was touted (by another editor) as a scientist with scientific arguments against vaccination until it turned out she had not published more than one paper on a medical topic, was the recipient of the Australian Skeptics' &quot;Bent Spoon Award&quot; and was the subject of an article in Vaccine detailing her views and modus operandi.

An example of this in use is at aldenström macroglobulinemia. I figured that was uncontroversial so I made the change without asking, but I have another change I'd like to propose that I wanted to ask about first. There are a few sources about medical conditions that I think are reliable and comprehensive enough to warrant inclusion in the template at the top of the article, to faciliate more consistent navigation. The four I've got in mind are MIM,  edlinePlus, Medicine, and iseases Database. Two of them are commercial sites (eMedicine and DD) but for both of them, the ignal-to-noise ratio is really good.

The quote &quot;The entries listed below vary between theoretical therapies and treatments that will most likely become standard procedures within the next few years.&quot;

Pubmed reference bookmarklet
Hi, I created a handy ookmarklet that will make a wikipedia reference when used on a ubmed abstract page, using ser:Diberri|Diberri's pmid converter. Add a bookmark to your bookmark toolbar with the following url:
 javascript:(function(){ var e,s; IB=1; function isDigit(c) { return (%220%22 &lt;= c &amp;&amp; c &lt;= %229%22) } L = location.href; LL =L.length; for (e=LL-1; e&gt;=0; --e) if (isDigit(L.charAt(e))) { for(s=e-1; s&gt;=0; --s) if (!isDigit(L.charAt(s))) break; break; } ++s; if (e&lt;0) return; if ((L.substring(s-10,s))'list_uids=')pmid = L.substring(s,e+1); w=open('http://diberri.dyndns.org/pubmed.html?pmid=' + pmid,'add','width=800,height=300,scrollbars,resizable'); })();

When clicked while on a pubmed abstract page, it will open a new window with the properly formatted wikipedia citation for the article. Let me know if it works and if you think it is useful. I only tested it on irefox, I don't know if it works on nternet explorer. --ser:Wouterstomp|WS 10:08, 12 January 2006 (UTC)

 ypoxia (medical)ypoxemia?

The terms are synonymous in most concepts. The extreme nitpickers among us would distinguish the two as follows: Hypoxia is a general deficiency of oxygen in the body. Hypoxemia is a deficiency of oxygen in the blood. You dont get one without the other and in clinical care people use the term hypoxia to mean both. So the articles should be merged with a one sentence explanation of the difference. ser:Alteripse|alteripse 13:39, 15 January 2006 (UTC)
 I've put a request for merge tag.  ser:Andrew73|Andrew73 14:56, 15 January 2006 (UTC)
Can I be a bit of a nit-picker? I agree that the terms are synonymous to some extent. I do not have a medical dictionary at hand, and I would be grateful if someone could check this, but in think there is an important distinction which is clinically relevant. ypoxaemia is a generalised lack of oxygen in the blood, which can be caused by number of pathologies, as listed on the relevant page. Hypoxia, in my book, is more about a regional lack of oxygen. As such, hypoxia can happily exist without hypoxaemia. Some examples, and why they are relevant:
*Tumour hypoxia. This is a major cause of tumour resistance to radiotherapy, and also to chemotherapy. It is caused by tumour growth oustripping blood supply. The result is necrotic tumour, and hypoxic, but viable tumour cells. There is a specialised branch of cancer research looking at this, using such esoteric devices as eppendorf electrodes. The hypoxic sensitising drug irapazamine is one of a family of pharmaceuticals that have been developed to exploit this.
*Infectious abscesses, empyema. Generally termed hypoxic rather than hypoxaemic. Low oxygen tension allows growth of anaerobic bacteria. Antibiotic penetration is poor due to poor local perfusion.
*Ischaemic limbs, digits etc. Are these hypoxic or hypoxaemic? Need to ask a vascular surgeon.
*Cerebral hypoxia. As in Ischaemic stroke, hanging, strangulation.
*Myocardial infarction. Locally hypoxic myocardium dies with the well known sequelae.
Sorry to be a pedant. Very happy to be contradicted. ser:Jellytussle|Jellytussle 04:44, 16 January 2006 (UTC)

Oh I can identify with pedantry or I wouldn't be here, but we more commonly say a person is hypoxic than hypoxemic, don't we, and mean the same thing? But I admit, you have identified a couple more contexts in which the terms are not equivalent. Do you think they should be kept as two separate articles? I will also admit I havent even looked at the contents. ser:Alteripse|alteripse 05:11, 16 January 2006 (UTC)

Yeah, I say someone is hypoxic when technically they are hypoxaemic. Can we have a page entitled &quot;Hypoxia and Hypoxaemia&quot; which clearly explains the differences and common points (and explains the slack jargon) and then points to the relevant detailed syndromes? Or perhaps Hypoxia, with sections on generalised hypoxia (AKA hypoxaemia) and regionalhypoxia. Hmm. I seem to have argued myself into agreeing with the merge idea. ser:Jellytussle|Jellytussle 05:21, 16 January 2006 (UTC)

Hypoxemia is when blood oxygen is low.  Hypoxia is when tissue oxygen is low.  Hypoxic is a term meaning less oxygen than should be there.  I'd vote to put stuff under hypoxia, with hypoxemia being when blood is hypoxic. ser:Kd4ttc|Kd4ttc 02:08, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

*Merge Never heard the term Hypoxaemia used in the UK during my time in hospital or as a GP since, always Hypoxia.  However, on it own this is always taken to mean 'the patient as a whole is hypoxic'. Whilst I agree that the term hypoxia can be qualified with regional locations (as per good examples above), a patient who has hypoxaemia will have tissues that are hypoxic and so the same discussion then ensues as to the resulting effects.  I would suggest merging into Hypoxia, with a small inclusion as to the terms hypoxia vs hypoxaemia, then the causes of both generalised lack oxygen (hypoxaemia) as opposed to localised restriction. The current ypoxia (medical) article already has in its introduction the body as a whole (generalized hypoxia) or region of the body (tissue hypoxia), but this is developed no further - so merge the two with separate sections/sub-sections as required. ser:Davidruben|David Ruben  ser talk:Davidruben|Talk  03:26, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

MERGE.  There is merit to both, though.  The work hour article is long enough, but perhaps would be shortened if put in the context of residency.  I think you could do a nice article on residency and merge them.  I would merge if you are committed to doing a nice edit job as a dedicated project.

Disagree with Merge - Both are reasonably long articles although I agree (JFW) that both could do with editing-down and rewording of their current content.  However both need further expanding/boadening:
*The residency article in particular could do with expansion to cover the situation in other countries (currently terribly US-centric).
*The working hours can have a useful discussion on:
**rotas
**doctor fatigue. Is it better to get no sleep during a night shift covering for several teams, or being on-call more often covering fewer patients and so getting some sleep?
**Does doctor fatigue cause greater clinical errors.  Unfortunately, for the juniors medical staff, much of the the evidence in the UK suggested not: it did take longer to make decisions and more care (ie greater effort) made to ensure not making errors (ie more looking up of information or dosages calculated twice to make sure)
**Access to training
**EU vs UK in implementing changes, relationship between those in training and consultants (who after all tend to control the Medical regulatory authorities).
I think good articles of each will be/should be (if they are comprehensive and thoughtfully written) too long to be merged. ser:Davidruben|David Ruben  ser talk:Davidruben|Talk  19:47, 17 January 2006 (UTC)
