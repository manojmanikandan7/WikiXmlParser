Does anyone happen to have this source:

* Mitchell RS, Kumar V, Abbas AK, Fausto N (2007). &quot;Chapter 4&quot;. Robbins Basic Pathology (Eighth ed.). Philadelphia: Saunders. .

It's one of the last things left on the checklist for the GA review at Thrombophilia.   () 23:51, 26 March 2011 (UTC)
I have the 6th ed of Robbins in my collection somewhere... Nope, sorry, I have Robbins' Pathologic Basis of Disease. Sorry. () 23:53, 26 March 2011 (UTC)
Actually it looks like my library has a copy. Is there something I can look up for you?  () 00:04, 27 March 2011 (UTC)

I have full access to that chapter in that edition.  Shall I just check the seven cited spots in our article?  I don't see a specific query on  other than the need to check the source.  Happy to help.  --  () 01:20, 27 March 2011 (UTC)
It is interesting that the term &quot;thrombophilia&quot; does not even appear in Robbins.  It's certainly not a term I've ever used.  --  () 01:29, 27 March 2011 (UTC)
Thank you for your comments at the GA review!  Yes, I'd love to have one fewer source to crawl through, and very much appreciate your response.  This is really just a routine check, made more difficult because the source is something that no one at the article seems to have access to (which naturally means that the likelihood of finding problems as a result of 'editing drift' is higher than usual).   () 03:12, 27 March 2011 (UTC)

The content in question was added by another editor (it might have been Mikael Haggstrom). This is why I prefer journal articles of textbooks!  |  09:08, 27 March 2011 (UTC)
Regarding your preference for journal articles over textbooks, I could not agree more.  Textbooks are essentially a series of monographs with very little peer review.  When an error is identified the mechanisms for reporting to the publisher, vetting by authors/editors, and then making confirmed corrections visible to the audience are weakly implemented (if at all).  I've been somewhat baffled by WP's stance, other than the ease with people accept books as authoritative.  --  () 17:14, 27 March 2011 (UTC)

Update:  Thrombophilia is now WPMED's newest .  Also, I'd like to say what a great bunch of people we have here, with folks jumping in to solve problems and make suggestions and work together.  Thanks.   () 02:05, 30 March 2011 (UTC)

Eyes needed

 is an SPA with a particular interest in finasteride. I've now had a couple of difficult exchanges with him, and would appreciate if others could have a look and offer their views with regards to recent edits.  |  10:14, 29 March 2011 (UTC)

Conflict at MR Neurography

I wonder if someone could take a look at .  There's this doctor who's apparently involved in the technique, and has a financial stake in it, who's been editing this article for years.  A newbie left me a note saying they thought the article looks like an ad for the technique, so I encouraged them to edit it and correct whatever bias they saw.  The doctor's response was angry and hostile, they started reverting each other, and now I'm afraid the bitten newbie may already be gone.  I'm not sure who's right about whether the article's biased,  so it would be great to have someone neutral who knows something about MRI take a look.  The doctor's pointing out numerous good sources to support his point of view that the technique is widely accepted,  but is not in favor of allowing info about whether insurance companies will cover the technique, so it looks like there are no good sources for that on either side.  I would love it if someone with a level head could take a look and potentially referee.  [[user:delldot|delldot]] [[user talk:delldot|∇.]] 18:19, 30 March 2011 (UTC)

It looks like delldot still needs some help here.   () 16:07, 31 March 2011 (UTC)

Depression (mood) citing emedicinehealth.com

Is this an appropriate source? [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Depression_(mood)&amp;diff=421577152&amp;oldid=420470467#cite_note-EMedicineHealth-4 Recent edits] at Depression (mood) cite its [http://www.emedicinehealth.com/depression/page2_em.htm depression page] 3 times. The new content seems useful and appropriate to the article, but an informed opinion on that, too, would be appreciated. -- () 09:15, 31 March 2011 (UTC)

Most of it looks okay.  eMedicineHealth is consumer-grade but generally reliable.  You could call it a &quot;good enough&quot; source.  You wouldn't want to build a whole article around it, but I sometimes think it helpful to have a couple such sources in high-profile articles, because it increases the odds that an interested reader will be able to find a source that s/he can actually understand.  It's perfectly adequate for supporting non-technical statements like the fact that treatments exist, etc.   () 16:11, 31 March 2011 (UTC)



Should the pharma wikiproject be merged as a taskforce here? Am trying to improve the layout /  and would appreciate further input. Discussion is taking place [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Pharmacology/Style_guide here] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style_(medicine-related_articles)#Indications_vs_Therapeutic_uses here]. Also discussing the drug box here . Everything is in early discussion. I wish to attempt to apply a consistent format that emphasis generally relevant material more prominently but will not make large scale changes until consensus is reached. [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 09:11, 27 March 2011 (UTC)

Pharmacology is a medical specialty, but pharmacognosia, pharmaceutics and other non-clinical fields are not. I don't think a merge is needed just yet.  |  09:23, 27 March 2011 (UTC)

Concerns where brought up that the project is nearly inactive. Thus why I propose it. But do agree.--[[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 09:26, 27 March 2011 (UTC)

I think we should be pragmatic about the projects rather worrying about the percentage of overlap of specialities. If WP:PHARM want to develop a styleguide that has any chance of making it into the MOS, it needs to be a project with many active members and a guideline that can show it represents the opinions of many Wikipedians and also reflects best-current-practice. Looking at the talk pages of that project, I don't see many edits that aren't by folk already in the medicine project, and I see only two editors actively working on the style guide. ° 10:01, 27 March 2011 (UTC)
I do not think  wishes to develop a guideline on their own. As Colin mentioned MED and PHARM are not two separate groups but the same group of people. I started posting there as I wished to makes some changes and it is currently unclear where this discussion should take place. If WP:MED need to be involved IMO it would be best for PHARM to than be a taskforce. BTW EMS is a taskforce but is an independent profession. --[[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 10:37, 27 March 2011 (UTC)
 As I see it,  and  are partially overlapping, yet distinct projects.  In addition, I see two types of drug articles.  The first are substances that have not yet been approved for human use.  These may be drugs in the pipeline or simply research tools.  These would primarily be of interest to WP:PHARM.  The second are drugs that are already on the market.  These articles would be of interest to both projects.  I am all in favor of highlighting the indications before the chemistry in articles about marketed drugs.  At the same time, we need to make sure that the chemistry and pharmacology sections are not diluted.  Finally I think the chemistry and pharmacology emphasis on drugs in the pipeline is appropriate.  Disclaimer: I am a chemist.  () 11:03, 27 March 2011 (UTC)
Physicians are still interested in medications coming down the pipeline. And yes we here should cover them...[[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 12:00, 27 March 2011 (UTC)
PHARM also covers veterinary-only medications, which is outside of our scope.   () 16:33, 27 March 2011 (UTC)
Which PHARM editors are actively writing and discussing veterinary-only medications? Projects exist so that editors can collaborate, and for that you need a decent number of editors and frequent postings. Looking through this and last year's PHARM postings, I think most of those would have been equally or better responded to by posting here. IMO there should be a contraction of wikiprojects as WP matures and some of the early enthusiasm has worn off. If we merge these projects then we'd get more eyes looking at problems and less duplication of effort such as tagging and style guides. A reason to split would be if WP:MED members complained that their talk pages were filled up with discussions on pharmaceutical, chemistry or veterinary issues that they weren't interested in and found distracting. I don't think that's likely to be a problem. ° 20:01, 27 March 2011 (UTC)
I agree with  that WP:PHARM is as much chemistry as it is medicine. I'd like to know whether our chemists, eg. Boghog,  and , would put WP:MED on their watchlists, or whether we'd run the risk of losing them. -- () 10:13, 28 March 2011 (UTC)

I always saw the pharmacology wikiproject broader than only medication (as indeed mentioned, it also covers drugs which are not for humans), and covers a part of chemistry as well (i.e. the biochemistry of how the drug does its job, and the multi-million industry of the development (the actual synthesis of the molecules) of drugs, many of which do not get onto the market in the end).  Pushing it completely into WP:MED .. I think it has its merits on its own.  I am following WP:PHARM and WP:CHEM because of the chemicals, for me, having WP:MED in stead of WP:PHARM .. I think that WP:MED for me, as a chemist, might be 'too much noise'.  I am sharing the concerns of Boghog (pharmaceuticals are more than the drugs that are used on humans).  However, having WP:MED people becoming more active on the medicinal part of the drugs would be very welcome, and I am sure that that would give new insights in what to do with the drug-pages.  -- [[User_Talk:Beetstra|T]] [[Special:Contributions/Beetstra|C]] 11:43, 28 March 2011 (UTC)

Also, I'd like to challenge Doc James' description of PHARM as &quot;nearly inactive&quot;:  according to , it has been twice as active as WPMED during the last year.   () 19:06, 28 March 2011 (UTC)
Sorry I was just repeating what Colin had hinted at. If we are mistaken than I send my apologies.--[[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 19:14, 28 March 2011 (UTC)
I don't watchlist here, and I came here from the mention at PHARM. Actually, I've got enough on my plate without watchlisting here, so I would prefer not to. No harm that I can see in leaving things as they are now. (By the way, I'm a neuroscientist, not a chemist.) -- () 20:49, 28 March 2011 (UTC)
Sorry, my mistake. I took you for a biochemist because of your userbox. -- () 10:00, 29 March 2011 (UTC)
Oh, no problem! Biochemist, yes (albeit a bit out of date...); chemist, not really. Such are the subtleties of interdisciplinary research! :-) -- () 17:29, 29 March 2011 (UTC)

* Strong Oppose It's a separate wikiproject, and deals with articles specifically related to drugs. I see some overlap, sure, but it should remain separate.  () 13:38, 31 March 2011 (UTC)
**As a discussion, I don't really see a need for &quot;Opposes&quot; here, but for the record I am also strongly opposed to this proposal. Pharmacology is a distinct science that overlaps with and includes many subject areas, not a medical specialty or subset of medicine. Furthermore, the scope of WP:PHARM (originally developed when it was still known as WP:DRUGS) includes many other topics, such as drug discovery, pharmacovigilance, regulatory aspects etc. Our coverage of these topics may still be incipient, but that is no reason to fold the project into a seemingly more active one. I don't think that would be productive at all.  (·) 16:16, 6 April 2011 (UTC)

Looking for opinions, interesting facts

I am giving a 25 minute talk to a group of dermatologists, and I want to entitle it &quot;Wikipedia, Dermatology, and You&quot;.  I want to talk about (1) what Wikipedia is and why it should be important to dermatologists, (2) the current state of dermatologic content on Wikipedia, and (3) finish with a basic tutorial on how to edit.  With that being said, I wanted to know if the community could give me some suggestions on interesting facts/stats I can include in this presentation?  I am looking for tidbits to really make the talk interesting.  I am open to anything.  For example, how many hits does medicine-related content get per month, and of that, how many does derm content get?  Derm content makes up how many bytes of data? etc. etc.  I want this presentation to make an impression.  Thank you all in advance, and I will make sure to give credit where do for any brilliant suggestions given! --- () 20:53, 1 April 2011 (UTC)

Thank you.  Also, has anyone else given a lecture like this to physicians?  What type of content do you like to include?  Any good quotes, etc?  I was definitely planning on including Jimbos quote regarding the &quot;sum of all human knowledge.&quot;  Any other thoughts? --- () 17:33, 2 April 2011 (UTC)
High ideas are great, but I would not assume that these physicians are ready to be WP &quot;true believers&quot; (I'm not suggesting that you imply such an assumption - I'm just thinking it's a hazard in a talk like this).  Docs are really good at seeing (or perceiving) an agenda behind a sales job, so I would avoid making it sound like a sales job.  I like your comments above - they suggest you'll simply point out that WP is a de facto source of health-related information (for everyone), and inaccuracies have the potential to interfere with evidence-based health care.  --  () 17:48, 2 April 2011 (UTC)

It might be effective to remind them of the fact that their own patients are reading Wikipedia, and so improving Wikipedia is a way to care for their patients.  One of our UK physicians here reported (a couple of years ago now) that a patient appeared with a printed copy of a Wikipedia article that he had written himself, demanding that the patient receive the &quot;right&quot; treatment, according to the Wikipedia article.  Fortunately, since he's written the article (and since it wasn't an unusual case), what Wikipedia said and what he thought best were the same thing.   () 20:24, 2 April 2011 (UTC)

Impact of medical articles

As long as it's an unstated &quot;talk to your doctor about this&quot; advice rather than &quot;persuade your doctor that you have this&quot; advice (like the DTC drug adverts do), it's not a bad thing.  If someone panics and thinks they have Whosiwhatsit's Ohmygoditis, goes to see their doctor, and it turns out they get a diagnosis of diabetes instead, that's a good thing.  If they reject the diagnosis and keep doctor shopping until they get one that agrees with them or starts taking medications that are dangerous and ineffective, that's more of a problem...   () 18:11, 4 April 2011 (UTC)

It would appear that some thanks for the good press should be going to our very own .  Seems Wikipedia might be good for something after all.  () 18:46, 4 April 2011 (UTC)

Problems with the vitamin D article

My impression as a lay person from reading the article on Vitamin D was that it gives a rather one sided view on the controversy that seems to exist on using doses between, say, 2000 IU per day up to 10,000 IU per day. What is more serious, however, is the misrepresentation of sources and selective use of sources.

Today, I took some time to read [http://www.ajcn.org/content/85/1/6.short this article], which gives the rationale for having a tolerable upper limit of 10,000 IU per day. But this was misrepresented in the article by saying that a researcher advocates that 10,000 IU could be the upper limit based on the assumption that intake of supplements and sun xposure are similar, but that is not the core reasoning made in the article at all (and it is not just one researcher saying this).  The next part of the article then attacks the equivalence between obtaining vit. D from sun exposure and from supplements/diet. While that may be valid criticism, it does make misrepresenting the study arguing for 10,000 IU as the tolerable upper limit a sort of a straw man attack.

ALso, as discussed on the talk page, while the article mentions a study linking high calcidiol levels to ischemic heart disease, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12889694 a study that critcizes this], is not mentioned.

I just made some corrections to the article (on issue of 10,000 IU/day as the UL), but I think the artcle has to be edited by experts who strictly stick to what the sources actually say. Also all points of view from the big experts should be represented correctly.  () 00:07, 5 April 2011 (UTC)
Ugh! Its full of non-MEDRS based assertions, some from primary studies, even some from news stories. I thought we didn't discuss dosages, but they are a major feature of the article. Needs some serious trimming of superceded work. [[User talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl!]] 02:45, 7 April 2011 (UTC)

Patient information boxes

Hi WikiProject Medicine. Following the Wikimedia UK/Cancer Research UK collaboration recently, I've put up a proposal on Village Pump (proposals) regarding : basically adding links to governmental, non-profit and charitable websites which have patient information about particular conditions, diseases, treatments and so on. Your input is welcome. — () 12:30, 6 April 2011 (UTC)

Is this more helpful than expanding the current  or using the external links section?  |  22:50, 6 April 2011 (UTC)

I think it would be more helpful.  External links can be problematic if the article is long and we really don't want the Infoboxs to get expanded too much.  However, I do have misgivings about the non-profit and charitable websites part of the idea.  Take the focal infection theory article for example; just what would be put into a patient information box for that article?  Or what about the Bright's disease article which refers to a historical term?  This is not going to be easy-- () 09:13, 8 April 2011 (UTC)

 The main thing I found difficult when starting editing was that I couldn't just write stuff that I knew. You might want to have a key point on its own dealing with the importance of sourcing, because that's so fundamental to how we work here. I think you'll find that telling an audience that they shouldn't expect to write anything on Wikipedia that they can't support by a quality source may come as a big surprise to them. -- () 01:01, 8 April 2011 (UTC)

Sigh, not really a move war. I moved it once and have no intention to move it again.

Let me see if I can find it again...[[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 13:21, 4 April 2011 (UTC)

Okay here is the previous discussion  and . There does not appear to be consensus for these moves. There where complaints  which was why I moved a couple back. I say we go with the ICD which does not use hyphens [http://www.progenetix.net/cgi-bin/pgSubsetindexLoader.cgi?subIDsearch=I80413]. But really I cannot be bothered much further. [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 14:57, 4 April 2011 (UTC)

We discussed this, and we agreed to follow the practice of high-quality reliable sources (e.g., the ICD) rather than the grammar rule book.  In this specific instance, the reliable sources are divided—in favor of non-hyphenation, but still significantly divided—and other reasons will need to be considered.
I recommend that the decision be left to the regular content editors at that article (that is, to Axl and FeatherPluma, not Doc James or Kwami—or me, for that matter).  And as a means of reducing complaints, I suggest that Kwami adopt a personal policy of never reverting any page moves on medicine-related articles without first discussing it on that article's talk page.    () 16:25, 4 April 2011 (UTC)
While I support &quot;small cell carcinoma&quot;, per ICD-9, I definitely don't support &quot;non small cell carcinoma&quot;, which I don't see listed one way or the other. &quot;Non-small&quot; would seem to make much more sense to me, as &quot;non&quot; isn't a word. -- () 17:13, 4 April 2011 (UTC)
We need some consistency here. Should we hyphenate 'small', but not 'large'? We have broad agreement that these things should be hyphenated. As an encyclopedia, we should care enough for precision to hyphenate everything, but certainly here hyphens are critical for a general audience, even if those in the field are so familiar with the terms they don't need them. —  () 19:19, 4 April 2011 (UTC)
The reason I got involved was the person who wrote this article Large-cell lung carcinoma with rhabdoid phenotype complained about all the hyphens . He tried to revert once [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Large-cell_lung_carcinoma_with_rhabdoid_phenotype&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=417367830&amp;oldid=417299123] but was reverted by Kwam. Discussion ensued. It appear to me that consensus was again the hyphen I therefore removed it here [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Large-cell_lung_carcinoma_with_rhabdoid_phenotype&amp;action=history] as I assumed Kwan understood the consensus just wasn't willing to fix them. I agree WAID that the decision should be left to the main editor of the article. But what about the articles that do not have main editors? And if the main editors try is the project going to support them in their efforts?[[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 19:40, 4 April 2011 (UTC)
There is no ownership of articles on WP. And it would be odd to have Large-cell lung carcinoma but Large cell lung carcinoma with rhabdoid phenotype. The same reasoning for one applies to the other. Even if we agree not to follow the MOS (or medical journals that hyphenate) on medical articles in general, many of us agree these should be an exception, due to the ease of misreading them otherwise. —  () 20:30, 4 April 2011 (UTC)
 Nevertheless, an active WikiProject is entitled to form a consensus on issues concerning articles within its scope. The Manual of Style contains excellent guidance on general style, and I would expect editors to have very good reasons if they wanted to make local exceptions to MOS. This happens already for some aspects of medical articles and  is accepted as part of the MOS. The regular editors here are intelligent and rational, and if several of them are indicating that there are good reasons not to have hyphens, then it would be better to make a case, rather than immediately revert. That is collaborative editing, and you would benefit from considering that first, Kwami. I would not want see a repeat of the debacle at Mexican–American War where after megabytes of text, the MOS (guidance) had to give way to COMMONNAME (policy). -- () 21:43, 4 April 2011 (UTC)

I strongly disagree. In the specific case of &quot;small cell&quot; vs &quot;small-cell&quot;, opinion was divided, without consensus. [[User:Axl|Axl]] ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 08:34, 5 April 2011 (UTC)

I am also against the hyphenation --- () 13:25, 7 April 2011 (UTC)
Hello everyone: I have been one of the biggest complainers about the &quot;hyphenation situation&quot;, and I am the above-mentioned individual who wrote nearly all of the article on large cell lung carcinoma with rhabdoid phenotype, which was originally NON-hyphenated, but is now hyphenated. I put a LOT of time and effort into this article, and I'd argue it's at least as good a reference on this topic as you can find ANYWHERE. When I wrote it, I read and/or cited nearly EVERY English reference available on the subject, and I don't believe A SINGLE ONE of them had the hyphenated form. I also reviewed and cited nearly all of the references available in English on combined small cell lung carcinoma when I wrote that one, and don't recall any significant number of them having hyphenated forms. That article is an excellent resource as well, IMO. I've admitted many times that it's quite obvious that Kwami has a TON of expertise in languages, and I respect that greatly. That being said, I also RESPECTFULLY OBJECT IN THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE TERMS to hyphenating the name of ANY form of lung cancer pathological variant EXCEPT &quot;non-small cell carcinoma&quot; and &quot;epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma&quot;, because the generally accepted WORLDWIDE standard on lung tumor classification is the 2004 World Health Organization system, which does NOT use the hyphens. I never thought there was clear consensus for the hyphens on ANY, although some &quot;votes&quot; were closer than others. Personally, I think the WHO standard should also be considered in this as well, but leave the &quot;weight&quot; of the consideration to you folks who have been around a LOT longer than me.

Help: historical psycho-pharmaceutical knowledge needed

Hello,

This is not related to this wiki project but I am seeking some help in deciphering some notes from an old psychiatric case book. There's an entry for a man in 1956 who had had a leucotomy some years previously and who was restless and agitated one night. They gave him a drug the details of which were: 1 cc M.H.A. I.M.

So I guess it's one cc of a drug given intramuscularly. Does anyone have any idea what it could be? Possibly a barbituate? It may or may not be a trade-name. If it is a tradename it will be a European/UK one. Thanks.  () 13:51, 8 April 2011 (UTC)

 Thanks for looking that up for me RexxS - that's one I didn't find myself. Unfortunately, I don't think that it's a likely candidate. It's got to be a hypnotic - that's the effect they were looking for and got. I guess it could be a typo or something as it's not one I've seen before and I can't think of any barbituate that went by a trade name in which those three letters would figure. Thanks again.  () 02:25, 9 April 2011 (UTC)
 Yes, it's a tough one. A barbiturate that might fit the bill (partially) is methohexital (as Acid, rather than sodium salt?), but our article gives its patent date as 1959. -- () 18:17, 9 April 2011 (UTC)
 Thanks again RexxS. As you indicate the date seems wrong but it's the strongest candidate yet. I've come across another reference to the drug in typed correspondence. There it is listed as M.HA with the same reference to giving 1 cc intramuscularly. It's not a major point, but it would be nice to know. Thanks again for your efforts it is much appreciated.

Can someone help me with a debate that might need to go to  ?  (one word, HOURS of debate)

Hello all,

Prior to possibly going to ..

I am hoping to get some help/advice from editors or admins that can direct me to the proper way of handling some struggles I'm having regarding the progress of a few articles I'm working on, in particular, &quot;vasectomy&quot;. 

I want to try and keep this short as I know everyone is busy!

I've recently (March/April) come back to the article and added a lot of content (I've been editing the article on and off for nearly 2 years).

I've been meet with constant opposition and resistance by a single individual forcing a virtual halt of the article's progress, at least as relates to my efforts because this user insists on taking the original text and either adding/taking away/changing it in a way that makes it either Unreliable, Wrong or Biased to his POV.  The content edits, believe it or not are, in some cases only one-word changes, but the changes affect a different perception of the definition in re.

Any reliable editor can look in to the history of this article, and make their own assessment of what is going on, but sadly it's become a war of protecting the article from edits that:
* Are incorrect or misleading.
* Supports a bias toward a PVPS POV.
* Leaves readers confused and possibly reliant on bad information.
 
Hoping for input by other editors, possibly experts in the medical area(s):
I feel that I cannot move forward until I can get some third-opinion input. 

Following is a link to the current revision of vasectomy by me &quot;Dijcks&quot;.
http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vasectomy&amp;oldid=423276870

Following is a link to the version the other editor wants in place &quot;Giancoli&quot;.
http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vasectomy&amp;oldid=423121873

The point of debate is the word &quot;sometimes&quot; in the lead of the article.  It's hard to believe but this one point of contention as led to hours of debate.  There are copious amounts of messages and &quot;talk&quot; regarding this, but I think if someone who is in a position here to urge one or the other edit-states, we may just be able to move on.  It is important to note that in this context, the word &quot;sometimes&quot; is misleading and may cause a great deal of confusion to a researcher, or potential patient.  There is ALWAYS some method of tying or sealing of the vas, in a vasectomy procedure, although there is one method/technique where one side of the vas is not sealed.  This method is not seeing mainstream use by virtue of limited data, and this editor's POV is coming in to play.

There are other issues with this editor's editorial bias, but the aforementioned is the most important one (I have tried hard to work with him)..

A good amount of this article's content has been added by me either recently or over time going back to 2009. Many editors take pride in the work they do here and I'm truly willing and happy to collaborate.  All I really want to see is a combined effort of similar minds that will bring this article up, and hopefully as stated, it will reach WP:GA.

I may need similar help with the article, Post vasectomy pain syndrome as well.

It's gotten to the point that this is all I'm doing, is fielding this continued debate.
Would someone be willing to come in and help a bit?
Thank you in advance,     22:11, 12 April 2011 (UTC)

It looks like Moonriddengirl and Rknight have joined the talk page discussion.  The talk page is not a model of calm discussion, and the article is now under full protection.  From my skim, Giancoli objects to conclusions about the relative safety of a class of vasectomy procedures being drawn from (exceeding?) a Cochrane review, and the claim that there's such a thing as a &quot;traditional&quot; procedure style.  
It looks to me like Moonriddengirl has the dispute well in hand, but if you have read http://www2.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab004112.html then it might be good to put the page on your watchlist, just in case a fourth or fifth opinion is needed.   () 01:31, 15 April 2011 (UTC)

Defining rape in the lead of the Rape article

Opinions are needed on the following discussion: . I [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rape&amp;diff=424122593&amp;oldid=424120016 reverted James500's edits] because the lead was already extensively worked out on the talk page, and James500's rewrite made the definition confusing and sloppy; not to mention...it defines rape first and foremost as the name of a statutory crime in England and Wales, Northern Ireland, Scotland and other countries...and he added text that clearly needed sources. Further, his tagging of various statements (with the tags &quot;dubious&quot;/&quot;where?&quot;/&quot;who?&quot;/etc.) are uncalled for. All it takes is tagging a section with one large tag. And when a statement says &quot;In America,&quot; it is pretty clear where...&quot;where&quot; is.  () 00:56, 15 April 2011 (UTC)

I suggested a merge of rape and sexual assault as the medical literature anyway uses the terms somewhat interchangeably. Expecially WRT epidemiology a lot of research are not very precise on the definitions. I do not know about the legal literature. We could than spend the first part of the article trying to get our heads around how these terms are defined / used.[[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 02:29, 15 April 2011 (UTC)

I don't think that these should be merged.  Sticking your hand inside a woman's shirt may be &quot;sexual assault&quot;, but it is never &quot;rape&quot;.  Both the social and the legal literature show far more understanding of the variety of attacks than the medical coding system bothers with.   () 04:22, 15 April 2011 (UTC)

This ref says it is &quot;rape is generally defined as forced or nonconsensual sexual contact.&quot;[http://www.clarku.edu/offices/dos/survivorguide/definition.cfm] and than uses the terms interchangeably. [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 00:11, 17 April 2011 (UTC)

The Oxford English Dictionary says &quot;sexual assault n. the action or an act of forcing an unconsenting person to engage in sexual activity; a rape; (Law) a crime involving forced sexual contact, variously defined as inclusive or exclusive of rape.&quot; [http://www.oed.com.cyber.usask.ca/view/Entry/177084?redirectedFrom=sexual%20assault#eid118068413] And &quot;a.  Originally and chiefly: the act or crime, committed by a man, of forcing a woman to have sexual intercourse with him against her will, esp. by means of threats or violence. In later use more generally: the act of forced, non-consenting, or illegal sexual intercourse with another person; sexual violation or assault.The precise legal definition of rape has varied over time and between legal systems. Historically, rape was considered to be the act of a man forcing a woman other than his wife to have intercourse against her will, but recently the definition has broadened. Under the Sexual Offences Act 2003, in the United Kingdom the crime of rape includes the penile penetration of the vagina, anus, or mouth of another person of either sex, where consent to the act has not been given. This includes marital rape: in 1992 the House of Lords, in its judicial capacity, decided that the previous understanding (i.e. that a wife had given an irrevocable consent to intercourse) was no longer part of the law. Sexual penetration of a child under the age of 13 also constitutes rape irrespective of whether consent is obtained. In the United States the precise criminal definition of rape varies from state to state.&quot;[http://www.oed.com.cyber.usask.ca/view/Entry/158145?rskey=SrotR9&amp;result=3&amp;isAdvanced=false#eid]

So well originally restricted to sexual intercourse it is currently more broadly used. Will bring this to the talk page though. [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 00:18, 17 April 2011 (UTC)
That &quot;variously defined as inclusive or exclusive of rape&quot; bit shows why the terms are not necessarily the same thing, though. Rape is a type of sexual assault, yes. But not every sexual assault is rape. That's the point WhatamIdoing was making. Most definitions and legal systems generally still stick to &quot;intercourse&quot; for defining rape, including the Oxford source you cited above. 

And which talk page? The Rape article already defines rape as a type of sexual assault.  () 00:25, 17 April 2011 (UTC)

Much literature uses the two terms interchangeably. This is true of both the medical and the legal literature. For example &quot;many states have renamed the laws of rape to sexual assult&quot; [http://books.google.ca/books?id=lcUbmtpzD2UC&amp;pg=PA248&amp;dq=Law+Rape+definition&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=IjWqTfCRLIj4sAPg7dH5DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Law%20Rape%20definition&amp;f=false] [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 00:34, 17 April 2011 (UTC)
That still doesn't make them always the same thing. It's like I stated before: While rape is a type of sexual assault, sexual assault is not always rape. That's reason enough to keep the articles separate. But we'll continue this at the Rape talk page.  () 01:06, 17 April 2011 (UTC)

Source request

Would someone with access to the Journal of the American Psychological Association mind helping me out?  The article is here http://apa.sagepub.com/content/57/6/1504.extract .  I'd like to use any quotes it has about Suzanne Segal's experience regarding depersonalization disorder.  Thanks very much.   17:00, 15 April 2011 (UTC)
One paragraph discussing Segal, on page 1507: &quot;More recently, Suzanne Segal (discussed by the authors on pp. 142–146) has written of her personal experiences with depersonalization, which led her Buddhist teachers to validate her loss of self as reflecting a high level of spiritual enlightenment. Allegedly, she eventually recovered memories of childhood abuse. Once again, I would wonder if this illustrates the phenomenology of a possible dissociative disorder, rather than simply depersonalization. The authors write of patients whose chronic depersonalization had an acute onset, at a specific moment. In some cases this moment might represent a “switch” from one enduringly dominant alter to another (as occurs in some patients with dissociative identity disorder). The authors ask a key question: “How does an individual, over time, create a predictable, cohesive sense of self?” (p. 173). Imagine the challenge this presents to severely dissociative patients. I told my first patient who had dissociative identity disorder that our goal was to integrate her various “people,” as she called them. She retorted that this absurd idea struck her as equivalent to telling all the children in a classroom to become one person.&quot;  () 17:16, 15 April 2011 (UTC)

How to initially define rape has now been moved to the Laws regarding rape article. I have an issue with the lead not defining rape as &quot;sexual intercourse/sexual activity without consent&quot; first and then going into the state/jurisdiction stuff, as well as with how the lead is formatted in general (my view that it is messy and needs cleanup).

It's not the same issue. That's why I posted it as a different topic. I see Doc James has combined the sections, for your benefit no doubt, but I'm really not seeing the problem here...other than your possible feeling that rape issues don't belong at WikiProject Medicine (which I wholly disagree with). For goodness sakes, that article's talk page is tagged as part of this project, and it's clear why (seeing as rape is a medical/health) issue. Maybe the laws discussion didn't belong here, but this one does and is a separate issue than the one I posted right before this one. But oh well.

This sounds great!  I think that Wikipedia ought to be part of every healthcare professional's education.  (Specifically, enough of an introduction so that they know that any patient waving around a print-out of Wikipedia that claims something odd might have edited the page immediately before printing it, and that if the article still contains garbage, that they can fix it themselves on the spot.)  This program seems like a step in the right direction.   () 17:17, 21 April 2011 (UTC)



Opinions are needed on whether or not the Sexual intercourse article should lean mostly toward human sexual intercourse. One view is that since &quot;sexual intercourse&quot; mostly refers to humans and we have other articles to cover sexual activity of non-human animals (such as Animal sexual behavior), then it is fine that the article mostly leans towards humans, similar to the Anal sex and Oral sex articles. The other view is that humans should not be given so much weight, since the term &quot;sexual intercourse&quot; also refers to non-human animals.  () 19:19, 21 April 2011 (UTC)

Redirect from &quot;chronic fatigue&quot; request for comment

List-defined references

I know that some of you are using  to get some or all of the bulky citations out of the article text.  (For those who aren't familiar with LDR, you name all the citations and place the full citations at the end, inside the reflist template.  Within the article, you use the name for all citations [exactly as if each citation was the second use of the named ref, rather than some of them being the first].  The software doesn't mind if you use some LDR and some regular in the same article.)

It's kind of a pain to migrate to this version, but it's often nice when it's set up, especially in densely cited articles.   appears to offer a script that will help with the conversion.  I haven't tried it out, but if someone knows about it, perhaps we can get a review.

TheHeart.org

 has made a number of additions using this website as a reference. We have been discussing on this user's talkpage why the website may not be ideal when matched against . I think it is useful for background reading but not as reference.  |  20:36, 28 April 2011 (UTC)

Without commenting on any particular edit, one of the things that's been on my mind is that the source needs to be proportionate to the claim.  If you're making a trivial claim (oh, &quot;Heart disease affects the heart&quot; or &quot;Severe high blood pressure can kill people&quot;), then a pretty weak source really is sufficient.  The more technical, detailed, or counter-intuitive the claim, the stronger the source should be.  IMO this sort of website is—at the very best—a sort of medium quality.  I wouldn't want to rely on it, for example, to say that treatment A is better than treatment B, or that X percent of people with Whosiwhatsis are successfully treated, but it might be okay for very general information.  In that sense, I classify it with typical mainstream media outlets:  they probably misunderstood half of what they were told, and they probably left out critical information, but the overall point is probably not completely wrong.
Providing the ideal source immediately might not always be our most pressing concern.  In the short-term, it might be preferable to have accurate information from a non-ideal source, than to have bad information—or to have the same information with no source named at all.  I'd rather have everything perfect from the start, but  for providing ideal sources.   () 21:12, 28 April 2011 (UTC)
 In my opinion, theheart.org is somewhat more reliable than a newspaper (such as the Daily Mail). I agree that it does not meet MEDRS's &quot;Ideal source&quot;. WhatamIdoing summarizes well. [[User:Axl|Axl]] ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 08:57, 30 April 2011 (UTC)

I think the editor in question is fully capable of finding the more appropriate MEDRS-compatible references. I have already requested this. In all honesty, those people who know how to read and understand TheHeart articles are also capable of finding good sources.

theheart.org is a new service for medical professionals, I do not think that should discredit any of their articles for many reasons.

Also, theheart.org have credible [http://www.theheart.org/about.do#editor-in-chief writers and contributors] who have authority on the subjects they write about and most of them have MD's from ivy league schools.

&quot;Popular press&quot; is probably not the best source for information, however, organizations like theheart.org, or The American Heart Association do not fall under that umbrella.

Heave describes an abnormal palpation of the precordium. An abnormal apex beat is sometimes described as a heave (or lift), but right ventricular heave or parasternal heave is a separate important sign in right ventricular dysfunction, particularly when due to pulmonary artery hypertension.
Finding sources for this stuff is very difficult, as there are not many articles about physical examination.  |  06:16, 19 May 2011 (UTC)

Expressive aphasia vs. aphasia

Can someone with expertise in this area help me understand... 

is Aphasia the same as Expressive aphasia? 

If yes, then I think these two articles address the same topic. 

If no, then can you help me understand the difference?

Thanks,

 () 02:41, 21 May 2011 (UTC)

Aphasia is basically a neurological condition involving the dominant hemicortex (usually left hemisphere) of the brain involving the Broca's area or the Wernikie's area. The Broca area is usually limited to pars opercularis and pars triangularis of the dominant hemicortex and is the place where speech is generated. Damage to this region therefore results in Broca's aphasia, non-fluent aphasia, or motor aphasia, or expressive aphasia where the person is able to comprehend speech but is unable to generate meaningful speech. Wernickie's aphasia however is due to damage to the wernickie's area located in superior temporal gyrus of the tempral left dominant hemicortex, and damage to this area can lead to inability to comprehend speech or language, but ability to speak and communicate, and so is known as fluent aphasia, receptive aphasia, or wernickie's aphasia. These are often outcome of a stroke involving one of the major arteries coming of the Internal carotid namely the MCA (Middle cerebral artery) or its tributaries. 

Long story short, no Aphasia is not the same as expressive aphasia, the same way that a Mercedes Benz is not the same as a car, even though it is A car, but to classify both in the same category causes confusion. Therefore Aphasia should be thought of as a class, and different subtypes as subclasses, namely expressive aphasia, etc. Hope this helps!   () 19:16, 21 May 2011 (UTC)

It might be appropriate to merge them though.  |  08:59, 22 May 2011 (UTC)

Negative pressure wound therapy

Hello there, I was pointed to this page as a possible source of help with a draft I've written for the Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) article. As explained at greater length in messages on  and on the , I've written a fairly long draft that adds a lot of information and reliable citations to the current article, and I am looking for help reviewing the draft and making edits to the article. 
You can read my draft here:

I'd just like to mention that I do have a working relationship with KCI, a firm that develops NPWT technology, and I know that this means there's a potential COI for any changes I make myself. That's why (although I've been careful to follow Wikipedia's guidelines) I'd like to ask that other editors to review my draft and give me constructive comments. Please take a look at my draft and let me know if there's anything that I need to work on, or if you think it might be ready to replace the current article. And if you've got any questions about the material or KCI, I'd be only too happy to answer them. Cheers,  () 17:43, 2 June 2011 (UTC)

IMO we can do all of the above here, but I think that some of us get sloppy (we write for ourselves, rather than for our readers) and some of us may think that since our highly technical sources use a given writing style, then that's the &quot;right&quot; way to do it (or perhaps we're trying to show off how smart we are, or perhaps we're following the source's style because we really don't understand the information and thus can't explain it in plain English).

Eyes Needed

There are significant changes being made to circumcision that dilute the neutral stance by removing a general global medical association statement on the medical merits of neonatal circumcision in the West. () 03:32, 4 June 2011 (UTC)
These statements are in the body of the text. The issue it appears is that some wish statements by regional bodies to appear in the lead. But will let others comment. [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 03:53, 4 June 2011 (UTC)
Here is what Doc James removed from the lead:
There is controversy regarding circumcision. Schoen states that circumcision provides important health advantages which outweigh the risks, has no substantial effects on sexual function, has a low complication rate when carried out by an experienced physician, and is best performed during the neonatal period.[11] Milos and Fayre state that circumcision adversely affects penile function and sexual pleasure, is justified by medical myths, is extremely painful, and is a violation of human rights.[12]

&quot;The American Medical Association report of 1999, which was &quot;…confined to circumcisions that are not performed for ritualistic or religious purposes,&quot; states that &quot;Virtually all current policy statements from specialty societies and medical organizations do not recommend routine neonatal circumcision, and support the provision of accurate and unbiased information to parents to inform their choice.&quot;[13]&quot;

And he instead installs:
&quot;Circumcision reduces the risk of HIV infection in populations that are at high risk.[11] Evidence among heterosexual men in sub-Saharan Africa shows a decrease risk of between 38 and 66% over 2 years[12] and in this population it appears cost effective.[13] Evidence of benefit in developed countries and among men who have sex with men is yet to be determined.[14][15]&quot; 

Doc James last sentence is not supported by the references and is presumptive. () 17:30, 4 June 2011 (UTC)

I'd have strongly considered removing the 1999 source, since it's rather out of date.   is usually defined as sources no more than five or ten years old.  I believe that the updated information (demonstrated to reduce risk in sub-Saharan Africa, no decent studies published elsewhere) is a reasonably accurate description of the current state of things.   () 18:25, 4 June 2011 (UTC)

The AMA statement refers to global medical association positions, which have not changed.  1999 is only 12 years ago.  The basic AMA statement has been affirmed recently by three national assosciations, two in 2010.  HIV doesn't belong in the lede of Circumcision. () 18:56, 4 June 2011 (UTC)

Why shouldn't it be in the lead?  Most of the recent sources about circumcision, especially in the general press, are about the relationship between HIV prevention and circumcision.   () 20:19, 4 June 2011 (UTC)

Wiki isn't a blog of recent news.  Yes, studies show public benefit might be seen where incidence exdeeds 3% in a population (WHO/UNAIDS).  That's not the case in the West.  Note the WHO/UNAIDS publication is 2007.  I.E. only part of Africa, and small pockets (IV users) in the West.  Other benefits are recognized as more important, and they are properly carried in the body.  Along with full information on HIV and infection rates.  So you think it belong in the lede?

Firefox tool to format PubMed citations

I've been working on a small add-on to Firefox to make it quicker and easier to format medical references. The add-on works like this: you just highlight a PubMed ID number (or any number) in the text of your browser window and right-click (or whatever the Mac equivalent is?) The pop-up menu will contain an option saying: &quot;Format PubMed ID for Wikipedia...&quot;. Select it and a box will pop up with the formatted reference (in  format), which you can cut &amp; paste into the article.It sounds a bit complex, but I've found it saves a ton of time since you don't have to juggle any additional windows to format PubMed ID's. You just right-click the ID number from PubMed, and you get a formatted reference ready to paste into an article. It calls Diberri's citation-formatting tool behind the scenes, so it won't work if that tool is down, but it seems to be working fine at the moment.Anyhow, I'm still ironing out a few final issues, and it's not particularly polished, but it works for me on Firefox 4.0.1 (haven't tested older versions). If you're interested, let me know... I may see about uploading it to the Mozilla add-on repository, or I can just send you the installation instructions, which are simple (and the source code, if you like).   17:08, 7 June 2011 (UTC)

* Thanks for the interest. I'm wrapping up a grant under deadline, but next week I'll polish up the add-on and distribute it to anyone who's interested. I understand the reluctance to beta-test - I'd be happy for any feedback, but there's no obligation to sink any time into it. If it doesn't do what you want, you can just remove it through the Firefox Add-Ons panel and be done with it. I can't say I've done much with Google Chrome - they have a totally separate system for developing browser extensions, and apparently they want you to pay $5 for the privilege of hacking Chrome (!)Wouterstomp's bookmarklet is a cool solution that should work across various browsers - I didn't think of that. You have to be a little bit careful in that you should only use bookmarklets on pages you know are legit (such as the PubMed site); there's a small security risk in using them on untrusted pages, although I don't know that it's been exploited in the wild and I'm not even sure it's particularly feasible. Overall, the bookmarklet might be the way to go.   16:16, 9 June 2011 (UTC)

Category that worries me

[[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2011 June 1#Category:Idiopathic diseases]]

This category ([[:Category:Idiopathic diseases|idiopathic diseases]]) is going to be a battleground. I am personally uncertain when to include a condition into that category or not. If a condition is partially understood, does it belong there? If the cause is known but the mechanism unclear, does it belong there? I think it is a very unhelpful category.  |  06:44, 5 June 2011 (UTC)

I've [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2011_June_1&amp;diff=434532687&amp;oldid=434245893 added links to the old AFDs], back when the cat's creator was trying to present this information in a list.  Most people involved in that discussion don't seem to understand how few medical conditions (except infectious diseases) have known, accepted etiologies that explain all cases. (Simple example:  smoking causes lung cancer.  But people who never smoked get lung cancer too, and nobody really knows why.  Lung cancer in those people is therefore an idiopathic condition.) 
I suspect that we're going to be stuck with this &quot;spam bait&quot; of a category anyway, so editors might want to keep an eye out for it being added to articles.   () 05:11, 16 June 2011 (UTC)

Experts are a useful thing to have around, even if we reject their advice on occasion (say, whenever they want to have a grammatically correct article title rather than the discipline-specific term). 
As for exactly what we want:  Do you have any sources that discuss lifetime risk as a concept?  If so, we should defer to them.  If not, then the things on my mind are these (and anyone should feel free to add to the list):
* How long is a &quot;lifetime&quot;?  (I believe it varies.)
* How is &quot;lifetime risk&quot; supposed to be determined?  I've seen one study that did a sort of &quot;real world&quot; lifetime risk, based on what people actually died from, but the breast cancer statistics (e.g., one in eight women will get breast cancer) are based on the unrealistic assumption that no woman dies before age 95 (yes, ninety-five, an age that only 5% of women achieve).  
* How does it compare to incidence and prevalence?

There are no &quot;narcotics&quot; used for the treatment of mental disorders, unless you consider buprenorphine, methadone et al. for management of opiate addiction. As drug regulation varies widely between countries, this would only really make sense in the context of the International Narcotics Control Board Yellow List, which does not contain a single &quot;psychiatric medication&quot; if memory serves.  (·) 21:22, 16 June 2011 (UTC)

Unfortunately the editorial lacks context a little bit. For one thing, it seems to suggest that the members of the WikiProject have written every entry. Furthermore, it is only a few paragraphs into the text that the reader understands that the WikiProject is part of Wikipedia rather than an independent effort. Is there anything we - as a WikiProject - ought to say in response?  |  18:19, 10 June 2011 (UTC)

At least it is positive even though there are many mistakes. The article confuses page views with monthly viewers And the bit that &quot;Chinese contributions are non-existent&quot;?

Source for obesity and bariatric articles

I'm sending an editor this way to discuss the suitability of a source for edits being added to two articles. This group is probably a better choice for evaluating the usefulness. Here's the , which includes links to his edits. The editor hasn't received much of a welcome, which is my fault; although I didn't revert the last edits, I did post [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Spam&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=431301031 this spam report]. Thanks for your help.  |  08:18, 16 June 2011 (UTC)
Yes will watch. Inappropriate sources agree. [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 04:44, 17 June 2011 (UTC)
Hi Doc James, Can you elaborate on the reasoning behind the inappropriate sources designation?
As I mentioned in my discussion with Flowanda regarding the &quot;Identifying Questionable Sources&quot; page under &quot;Questionable Sources&quot;, (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RS#Questionable_sources) it states, &quot;Questionable sources are those with a poor reputation for checking the facts, or with no editorial oversight.&quot; Bariatric Surgery Source easily passes these requirements, with extensive reference information provided at the bottom of each page and with complete editorial oversight of all pages by experienced industry professionals (again, the professionals responsible for each page are listed below each article's heading with a link to their profile). Many sites referenced throughout Wikipedia are commercial in nature (i.e. are &quot;for-profit&quot;), but as long as the content researched and presented is accurate, referenced and backed by credible industry professionals and as long as it contributes towards the &quot;completeness&quot; of each Wikipedia article, it seems that it should be include-able. For example, on one of the pages in question, Wikipedia has allowed Medscape to share information and reference their site as the source (http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/706394, reference #18). Medscape is also a for-profit &quot;commercial&quot; company (they are a part of the WebMD Health Network). Please help me understand the difference between their site and ours, other than their web site's traffic volume and company size. Thanks for your time.  — Preceding  comment added by  ( • ) 16:32, 17 June 2011 (UTC) 
We recommend strongly the use of review articles published in a reputable journal. This http://www.bariatric-surgery-source.com/fast-food-cause-obesity.html is not a review article. Some of the stuff on this page has overstated the evidence to put it mildly. [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 18:09, 17 June 2011 (UTC)

That website does not appear to be a reliable source for medical information. [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 17:02, 20 June 2011 (UTC)
Can you help me understand your reasoning?  It has an advisory council made up of bariatric professionals (licensed, practicing surgeons and dietitians) that write/review every page.  It has also been HON Code certified, indicating the intention of providing transparent and reliable data.  What would need to be changed/added/removed in order for that site to be considered reliable?  — Preceding  comment added by  ( • ) 17:09, 20 June 2011 (UTC) 

To be the highest quality class of source, it would need to become a peer reviewed medical journal or a textbook used by medical schools.
We are generally biased in favor of formal literature and against websites.   Anybody can create a website.  Even HONCode certification isn't difficult to get.   () 16:08, 21 June 2011 (UTC)

I understand your concern about just anybody creating a website and referencing it.  But our content has been written and reviewed by practicing bariatric professionals as indicated on our Advisory Council page: http://www.bariatric-surgery-source.com/your-bariatric-surgery-advisory-council.html .  Have you reviewed the content on our site to confirm that all information is in fact presented in a very unbiased and complete manner?  Does your response mean that our surgeons' knowledge and experience cannot contribute towards any part of the development of Wikipedia's knowledge base when holes in the content are found?  — Preceding  comment added by  ( • ) 20:23, 22 June 2011 (UTC) 
As you seem to be noting that this is &quot;your&quot; website, you should probably be sure to review our .  From my standpoint, we should be using peer-reviewed material per  and not websites.  Certainly any surgeon can contribute to sources for Wikipedia the way other medical professional others do - by getting published in peer-reviewed literature. () 20:32, 22 June 2011 (UTC)
If I re-publish the deleted contributions to the Bariatric Surgery page (percentage of excess weight lost data) and reference all of the peer-reviewed medical journals used to come up with that information instead of http://www.bariatric-surgery-source.com/, would that be allowable?
Material sourced to  compliant sources (peer reviewed secondary literature such as medical reviews) would be reliable where a website would not.  () 23:10, 22 June 2011 (UTC)
But wouldn't that be considered a form plagiarism (or &quot;gray area&quot; at best)? I found the information on Bariatric Surgery Source's web site and became aware of the peer-reviewed journal articles from their page's reference section. The surgeons at Bariatric Surgery Source (all of which have been published in peer-reviewed journals, by the way) obviously took time on Bariatric Surgery Source's dollar to research, compile and disseminate the information in a unique way.  Since the information is not brought together in that way on any other site, wouldn't re-publishing it on Wikipedia without referencing Bariatric Surgery Source be a form of plagiarism?  — Preceding  comment added by  ( • ) 23:26, 22 June 2011 (UTC) 
Republishing material that is not found in the medical literature in that form could be a form of , which is not allowed under our rules (without seeing the sources and the final material, I wouldn't be able to say for sure). That is why we rely on secondary medical reviews, which synthesizes the medical literature for us.  Instead of relying on that website as a source, it might be a better use of your time to look for medical reviews in the literature in order to improve the article.  () 23:30, 22 June 2011 (UTC)

You must , but you do not need to say where you got the idea to go look up a particular publication.  If you actually read a peer-reviewed paper, and take information out of it, you do not need to tell us which website/other publication/librarian/friend/physician gave you the idea to go read that paper.
NB that we prefer secondary sources like meta-analyses and reviews to case studies or original experimental reports.   () 00:42, 23 June 2011 (UTC)

OB/GYN standard textbooks and Major medical dictionaries

Hello all. There a bit of a brouhaha at , and this request is somewhat related to that (sorry).I am interested to know what books are considered the cream of the crop in OB/GYN. My understanding was that it was Williams Obstetrics and Gabbe's Obstetrics for obstetrics, but I couldn't exactly determine what it was for gynecology—Te Linde's Operative Gynecology? Is there anything else? In addition, are there are medical dictionaries besides Taber's, Stedman's or Dorland's that are very widely used by the medical community or by OB/GYNs in particular? Thanks, [[User:NuclearWarfare|NW]] ([[User talk:NuclearWarfare|Talk]]) 13:48, 17 June 2011 (UTC)

I can't speak to quality, but Blaustein's Pathology of the Female Genital Tract and Williams Gynecology sell slightly better at Amazon.com, and might be worth considering in your list.   () 21:15, 17 June 2011 (UTC)
IMHO Williams’ is pretty much &quot;the&quot; textbook. If you're looking for the cream of the crop, look no further. I have had the pleasure of translating several OB/GYN textbooks and Williams’ is still my go-to reference.  (·) 11:49, 19 June 2011 (UTC)
But which book?  The older Williams Obstetrics, or the newer Williams Gynecology?   () 16:37, 21 June 2011 (UTC)
I have the 22nd edition of Obstetrics and the 2008 Gynecology (I think it's the only edition so far). I meant Obstetrics when I answered, though. Just realized NW was looking for the opposite (GYN, not OB). I stand by my recommendation, though—Gynecology is excellent and I have used it as a reference as well.  (·) 18:19, 21 June 2011 (UTC)
Thanks! Is there anything else you would recommend? [[User:NuclearWarfare|NW]] ([[User talk:NuclearWarfare|Talk]]) 20:46, 22 June 2011 (UTC)
Beckmann's Obstetrics and Gynecology can be a pretty good source depending on your purpose. It is concise, ACOG-supported and its target audience is not OB/GYNs or OB/GYNs in training, but rather medical students doing their OB/GYN rotations, so it's sort of the physician's equivalent of a lay-oriented book, if that makes any sense.
As for dictionaries, you should be covered.  (·) 20:58, 22 June 2011 (UTC)

Polycystic kidney disease

Hello all -  I've just been looking at the articles on polycystic kidney disease, ADPKD and ARPKD.  It seems to me that there is a lot of duplicated content/confusion in these articles.  The plain old PKD article seems to get the majority of the hits, but it lumps together info on ADPKD and ARPKD and, to my eye, doesn't really make clear enough that these are different diseases. Also, it only has a few references.  The ADPKD and ARPKD pages seem to make this distinction more clearly and already have a number of references and work put into them.  

It seems to me that the (AD/AR)PKD articles need to be reorganized/disambiguated...perhaps with a brief polycystic kidney disease article stating that this is an umbrella term for several diseases and then with links to the more specific diseases.    Any thoughts/opinions on this?

 () 16:51, 19 June 2011 (UTC)
Agreed. These two conditions have very little in common except for the name, and have distinct and clearly defined pathophysiology and prognosis. The umbrella article should be kept as brief as possible, and direct readers to the pages on the specific conditions. -- () 16:41, 20 June 2011 (UTC)

Hmmm. When I Googled &quot;breast mouse&quot;, I got back a lot of pages marketing interestingly shaped computer peripherals. So I guess I learned something.

Cure for diabetes

Well, reversal (or &quot;cure&quot;) of type 2 diabetes has been described for ages—most recently, and with the best evidence, after bariatric surgery. This study certainly has worthwhile information that can and should be worked into our articles, but its findings are not the magical breakthrough portrayed by the media; the remarkable discovery here is how the reversal was brought about, not the reversal itself.  (·) 13:07, 26 June 2011 (UTC)
That's true. Though if a somewhat simple diet indeed does have the same effects as invasive surgery (with frequent complications), it should be worked in. I admit to be a layman in medicine, but I don't consider that kind of surgery a real &quot;cure&quot;. -- () 19:13, 26 June 2011 (UTC)
Well, you're not entirely mistaken: that's why most medical professionals would speak of &quot;reversal&quot;, not &quot;cure&quot; (which is a very loaded word). This may not be a cure at all either—its merits notwithstanding, this was a very small study with no long-term follow-up. That's why we shouldn't, and musn't, hurry to incorporate this sort of highly publicized research into WP.  (·) 06:33, 27 June 2011 (UTC)
It needs to be cited in a -compatible high-quality review before we can legitimately include it. The DPP already showed benefits of lifestyle modification, and the 2008 bariatric trials showed that DM2 can be cured. Let's not go along with the hype generated by the popular press. Every GP in the country already tells (or should be telling) their newly diagnosed diabetics that the disease can be reversed by weight loss.  |  13:28, 26 June 2011 (UTC)

Welcome, Berrie.

Well, I can't say I've added many sources, but unfortunately the article contained a fair bit of incorrect info which I've tried to correct. For example, PACs typically don't originate in the sinoatrial node, but rather from ectopic atrial foci. And they're not always followed by a QRS; if they're premature enough, they're typically blocked at the AV node during its refractory period. Anyhow, it definitely needs work and more sources, so I'll try to come back to it. As far as causes, PACs are more common in patients with structural heart disease, but they also occur occasionally, as an entirely normal and benign finding, in healthy people without heart disease. If you look hard enough, you'll find them in pretty much anyone.   04:10, 30 June 2011 (UTC)

External links on eye condition pages

Hello all,
I’ve been advised by Doc James to seek your advice/consensus on an issue.

I’d like to add external links from some Wikipedia eye condition pages to the eye condition pages on the [http://www.rnib.org.uk/ RNIB website] (Royal National Institute of Blind People). This is a large UK charity which is well regarded and a reliable source of info. Their eye condition pages are written in collaboration with the Royal College of Ophthalmologists (A professional body in the UK).

Having looked through  I understand the concern of avoiding “spammy” links, but I genuinely think those RNIB pages are useful sources of independent info, with a more human/patient focus than most of the Wikipedia info, which tends to be very science/medical research based. 

The RNIB pages cover the information in a different way, or go in to more background details (such as how the eye works) so I don’t believe it is something that could be added to the article itself, rather I think it is useful further reading that should be linked to.

The same could be said of the links to the National Eye Institute website which is linked to from most Wikipedia eye condition pages, but RNIB gives a different angle as it is UK rather than U.S focused.

For a specific example, the glaucoma page could benefit from a link to the [http://www.rnib.org.uk/eyehealth/eyeconditions/eyeconditionsdn/pages/glaucoma.aspx RNIB Glaucoma page]. 

It would be great to get your opinions on this, thanks.
 () 16:16, 29 June 2011 (UTC)

In general, the things we're looking for in external links are things we'd like to put in the article but can't, such as copyrighted material that can't be distilled into quotes and information (typically official or historical documents).  Other desirable external links include databases of statistics, images, and other things where the info can't be realistically added to a readable article.  We should probably re-evaluate why the NEI links are present if they have similar content, it's possible that .  It sounds like the RNIB content is general reference material on eye conditions, which is redundant from what our article should contain.  That Wikipedia's content is science/medicine/research-based is just a bias of what editors have been involved in the article, it's not an intentional limitation of content, though things like individual patient stories are probably something we wouldn't include.   () 19:50, 29 June 2011 (UTC)

Definition of pneumonia

People seem to use all sorts of definition for pneumonia. Anyone able to help with ours. Some people use the term broadly some (the majority) limit it to only infectious causes using pneumonitis for inflammatory conditions.[[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 00:06, 30 June 2011 (UTC)
In the very best sources, &quot;pneumonia&quot; is overwhelmingly used to mean &quot;lung infection&quot; (except when referring to noninfections conditions that have come to be called pneumonia by use, such as lipoid pneumonia or organizing pneumonia). This is also the general meaning of &quot;pneumonia&quot; in public health. I imagine our article should reflect this.
If you're working on the Pneumonia article, some nice straightforward reviews were published in BMJ and American Family Physician in 2005/2006 that can probably still be useful. There was also a comprehensive review of viral pneumonias in The Lancet in early April.  (·) 04:35, 30 June 2011 (UTC)
Yes thanks. Agree it is almost always used to mean infection but sometimes is used to mean non infectious causes. I have done my best to reflect this. Added the Lancet Viral Pneumonia paper. The AFP article deals with CAP not pneumonia in general as do most papers. And we do have Idiopathic interstitial pneumonia [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 05:18, 30 June 2011 (UTC)
 Unqualified, the term &quot;pneumonia&quot; is used to mean &quot;infectious pneumonia&quot;. Non-infectious pneumonias must have an appropriate qualifier to distinguish them. (By the way, the diagnosis &quot;organizing pneumonia&quot; is outdated. The histological finding is always interpreted in the context of the clinical features—and this usually should be called &quot;cryptogenic organizing pneumonia&quot;.)

Yes agree completely. May be it should be merged in to respiratory system? This is just a bunch of diseases. Or could be better as a list like List of cutaneous conditions [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 12:39, 30 June 2011 (UTC)

I'd personally like to see the article rewritten as a list; it certainly has potential, as it is a major class of disease. If consensus is reached that we'll write a list, I'd be more than happy to help out.   [[User talk:Tyrol5|[Talk]]] 17:08, 30 June 2011 (UTC)
I like the list idea.  List of cutaneous conditions is an excellent model.   () 14:17, 1 July 2011 (UTC)
There's a lot more to say about respiratory diseases than could comfortably fit in respiratory system, and the relationships among these conditions are too complex to be presented in a list. -- () 16:37, 1 July 2011 (UTC)
Personally, I think I prefer WaId's suggestion that we use List of cutaneous conditions as a model for a similar &quot;List of respiratory diseases&quot;. That page would have links to the (in-depth) articles on the individual diseases. Just let me know what you all want to do and I will pitch in.
 () 20:58, 1 July 2011 (UTC) (finally fixed that idiotic looking sig of mine - sorry folks)
 I oppose merging into &quot;Respiratory system&quot;. The latter already enough info in it to justify itself without the addition of disease info. And there is enough disease info for the diseases to have their own article. I agree that &quot;Respiratory disease&quot; requires clean-up, and may be better as a list.

Pseudoscience


The source is precisly about pseudoscience but editors continue to suggest the source is [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Fringe_theories/Noticeboard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=435571039 not published] or it is an issue that the source is [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3APseudoscience&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=435025153&amp;oldid=435021595 not a systemtic review]. Editors seem to have a personal disagreement with the mainstream source.

The serious matters that are a threat to public health are:

&quot;The ‘Keep libel laws out of science’ campaign was launched on 4 June 2009, in the UK. Simon Singh, a science writer who alerted the public about the lack of evidence supporting chiropractic treatments, was sued for libel by the British Chiropractic Association (Sense about Science, 2009). Similar examples can be found in almost any country. In Spain, another science writer, Luis Alfonso Ga´mez, was also sued after he alerted the public on the lack of evidence supporting the claims of a popular pseudoscientist (Ga´mez, 2007). In the USA, 54% of the population believes in psychic healing and 36% believe in telepathy (Newport &amp; Strausberg, 2001). In Europe, the statistics are not too different. According to the Special Eurobarometer on Science and Technology (European Commission, 2005), and just to mention a few examples, a high percentage of Europeans consider homeopathy (34%) and horoscopes (13%) to be good science. Moreover, ‘the past decade has witnessed acceleration both in consumer interest in and use of CAM (complementary and alternative medicine) practices and/or products. Surveys indicate that those with the most serious and debilitating medical conditions, such as cancer, chronic pain, and HIV, tend to be the most frequent users of the CAM practices’ (White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy, 2002, p. 15). Elements of the latest USA presidential campaign have also been frequently cited as examples of how superstitious beliefs of all types are still happily alive and promoted in our Western societies (e.g., Katz, 2008). On another, quite dramatic example, Science Magazine recently alerted about the increase in ‘stem cell tourism’, which consists of travelling to another country in the hope of finding a stem cell-based treatment for a disease when such a treatment has not yet been approved in one’s own country (Kiatpongsan &amp; Sipp, 2009). This being the current state of affairs it is not easy to counteract the power and credibility of pseudoscience.&quot;

The threat to public health is a statement made as a conclusion rather than an assumption. This is indeed about the topic pseudoscience according to the source. For example, &quot;This being the current state of affairs it is not easy to counteract the power and credibility of pseudoscience.&quot; 

One of the main pseudoscience points from full text is: &quot;As preoccupied and active as many governmental and sceptical organizations are in their fight against pseudoscience, quackery, superstitions and related problems, their efforts in making the public understand the scientific facts required to make good and informed decisions are not always as effective as they should be. Pseudoscience can be defined as any belief or practice that pretends to be scientific but lacks supporting evidence. Quackery is a particular type of pseudoscience that refers to medical treatments. Superstitions are irrational beliefs that normally involve cause–effect relations that are not real, as those found in pseudoscience and quackery. These are a serious matter of public health and educational policy in which many variables are involved.&quot;

The authors summarised the public health issue in the abstract. According to the source pseudoscience is a serious matter that threatens public health. It is OR if we don't summarise the main pseudoscience points because it would be taking the source out of context.

From abstract: &quot;Pseudoscience, superstitions, and quackery are serious problems that threaten public health and in which many variables are involved.&quot;

 The  compliant source must be restored and sumarised at Pseudoscience.

The Matute peer-reviewed source does not need to be a MEDRS qualifying review of pseudoscience literature. The text meets . It would be a violation of NPOV to imply a serious dispute where there is none. The text does not need to be attributed becuase editors disgree with researchers.

I think that a summary of Matutue et al. will contribute a lot to Pseudoscience#Demographics, Pseudoscience#Psychological explanations and Pseudoscience#Health and education implications.

For example, the following text will work well at Pseudoscience#Health and education implications as a starting point. --&gt; Pseudoscience, superstitions, and quackery are serious matters that are a threat to public health. Every time the high-quality source was restored it was quickly deleted in a matter of hours against Wikipedia's policy.  () 17:20, 4 July 2011 (UTC)

You say above that &quot;The WP:V compliant source must be restored and sumarised at Pseudoscience.&quot;
As a point of fact, it is not sufficient for a source to be WP:V-compliant.  There are thousands of WP:V-compliant sources on the subject.  It is actually impossible to include every singe WP:V-compliant source in this article.  Complying with WP:V tells you whether you may include the source.  It does not tell you that you must include the source.   () 18:48, 4 July 2011 (UTC)

Running an h-index check

Can someone do the calculations for the h-index of Bernard Lewinsky? I don't know how to run the algorithm myself, but it is essentially the critical tipping point for the AfD. [[User:Silver seren|Silver]][[User talk:Silver seren|seren]] 21:04, 5 July 2011 (UTC)
If someone's h-index is the tipping point for an AfD, then there's something horribly wrong with that AfD.   21:43, 5 July 2011 (UTC)
Everyone is focusing on the relation to Monica Lewinsky and saying that he doesn't obtain any notability from her so it should be delete, but at the same time, not considering his own notability as a leading breast cancer researcher on his own.

What MastCell said. But since you asked so nicely, I have done so and described the process on the talk page of the AFD. I'm a layman, so my process might be wrong, but I believe it is correct. [[User:NuclearWarfare|NW]] ([[User talk:NuclearWarfare|Talk]]) 22:30, 5 July 2011 (UTC)
Just a quick note here: as someone participating in said AfD on the opposite side from that of Silver, let me just say that I do not think this issue is &quot;essentially the critical tipping point for the AfD.&quot; Those arguing for keeping claim the person in question is a notable researcher, and the main point raised in favor of that view has been references to a supposedly high h-index. So it would be more accurate to say that the main argument in favor of keeping the article hinges on the h-index calculation, not the entire AfD. -- |  |   23:44, 5 July 2011 (UTC)
Fellow notability requirements

Does being a Fellow of the American College of Radiology falls under #3 of the notability requirements under ? [[User:Silver seren|Silver]][[User talk:Silver seren|seren]] 03:55, 5 July 2011 (UTC)
According to the [http://www.acr.org/SecondaryMainMenuCategories/NewsPublications/FeaturedCategories/ACRBulletin/Archives/2005/November2005/ACRFellowWhatDoesItSignifyHowIsItAchievedDoc2.aspx the ACR website] and their description of Fellows, approximately 10% of members are given the distinction of Fellow - I would find it hard to believe that 10% of radiologists in this country (or even 10% of ACR members, though I suspect most radiologists are members) are notable for Wikipedia by that distinction alone.  () 04:06, 5 July 2011 (UTC)
That section states that, in addition to the normal requirements of Fellowship that most societies have, they require that you have made a substantial contribution to radiology as well, which is why &quot;individuals typically apply and are recognized much later in their careers.&quot; So, essentially, they're even more restrictive than most Fellowship societies, so I don't really understand your argument. Not to mention &quot;Because only the ACR, no other major radiology associations such as ARRS, ASTRO, or RSNA, confers fellowship, the award is considered a mark of distinction in diagnostic radiology, radiation oncology, nuclear medicine, and medical physics.&quot; Thus, it seems to be the go to fulfillment of #3. [[User:Silver seren|Silver]][[User talk:Silver seren|seren]] 04:13, 5 July 2011 (UTC)
I read that they say they are more restrictive than others, but the fact remains 1 out of 10 members of ACR is a &quot;Fellow&quot;; if, as I suspect, ACR is the &quot;main&quot; professional society of the specialty, the vast majority of radiologists will be a member.  I personally can't imagine being in the &quot;top&quot; 10% of all radiologists in the country is a distinction that merits an article on Wikipedia by itself.  I may be persuaded otherwise if ACR has a particularly stringent membership criteria, where being 10% of that membership group really means something. As a comparison, since IEEE standards are used in the , [http://www.ieee.org/documents/fellow_stats_summary_years_2008_2010.pdf IEEE statistics] show that less than 2% of IEEE members are fellows (they are 5 times more restrictive).  () 04:31, 5 July 2011 (UTC)
Except you're missing one important fact. The American College of Radiology is made up of 34,000 members. Thus, their 10% of Fellows make up 3,400. In comparison, the IEEE is made up of 400,000 members. Thus, because of their higher amount of people, they have to be more restrictive, down to 2%. This means that they have 8,000 Fellows, more than twice as many as in radiology. The reason why the ACR has such a higher percentage is because they still have just as many people that do important accomplishments as in other fields, but they have less members than other fields, so their percentage rate will be higher. But their amount of Fellows overall as a number is far less, but still comparable I would think to other major Fellow groups. The ACR is just as restrictive, if not more so, but a higher number of their members meet those restrictions. Along with them being a lower amount of people overall, this creates a higher percentage, but this is not indicative of not being restrictive. [[User:Silver seren|Silver]][[User talk:Silver seren|seren]] 04:46, 5 July 2011 (UTC)
I read the comment above several times, but I just don't follow the logic of how 10% is &quot;just as restrictive, if not more so&quot; than 2%.  The mind boggles.  Maybe someone else could explain it to me.  () 04:56, 5 July 2011 (UTC)
Essentially, if you look at the statistics across the board for the number of Fellows from the major societies for the different majors, they all fall within about the same amount of Fellows for each society. Some may be half as much, like radiology, as others, because they have a smaller amount of members, but the numbers all even out. The Royal Society even meets this amount, at 8,000 Fellows. Overall though, regardless of the amount of members, they all have around the same number of Fellows. This is because, every year, they all nominate about the same amount of Fellows. 

I suppose the easiest question to ask is, regardless of percentages, does the added requirement of having to make a substantial contribution in addition to the other requirements of time and letters and other things, not make the ACR requirements more difficult than the ones for the IEEE? If yes, then the percentages are irrelevant. [[User:Silver seren|Silver]][[User talk:Silver seren|seren]] 05:15, 5 July 2011 (UTC)
To answer the second question, the answer would be no, as you can see if you looked at the requirements on the IEEE website.  You seem to be making the explicit assumption that there should be roughly equal number of &quot;Fellows&quot; in each academic field, regardless of the size of the pool of applicants in each field (i.e. a large pool such as engineering vs. a relatively much smaller specialty of medicine such radiology) - an assumption I can find no real compelling logical basis for.  Percentage as a rough guide for how stringent membership criteria is still seems a much better way of guiding us here.  () 06:01, 5 July 2011 (UTC)
The main issue I have is that, with that conclusion, 8,000 electrical engineers are now automatically notable under #3 of  and no radiologists are at all. [[User:Silver seren|Silver]][[User talk:Silver seren|seren]] 09:43, 5 July 2011 (UTC)
 That's right, it's only being &quot;a Fellow of a major scholarly society for which that is a highly selective honor&quot; that automatically confers notability by our standards. I read that to imply no radiologists are automatically notable via criterion 3 of ACADEMIC. There are of course another 8 criteria there (as well as GNG), so it doesn't mean that no radiologist is notable, just that their notability is to be established by other criteria. -- () 10:13, 5 July 2011 (UTC)
I don't know, that just seems biased, IMO, towards electrical engineers. Considering that if the ACR was considered selective enough, it would only be 3,600 people under the criteria anyways. I would have just thought that the single major society in each separate field of study that offers a fellowship would fall under #3. That seems the easiest way to do it, because otherwise you're trying to determine exactly what amount is considered selective. And that just leads to opinionated bias. [[User:Silver seren|Silver]][[User talk:Silver seren|seren]] 11:26, 5 July 2011 (UTC)
All the above seems to miss the basic point of . We only know that something or someone is notable if we can  it with substantial publications about them in . In other words, we'll know they are notable when someone credible takes published notice of them. That has absolutely nothing to do with how many fellows there are in a given college. [[User talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl!]] 15:14, 5 July 2011 (UTC)
 You would think so, indeed. Unfortunately, editors are idle and always want short-cuts, so instead of using GNG, they want an alternative that saves them having to go search for sources to establish notability. ACADEMIC is just such a short-cut, and relies on the fact that in any field a small number of individuals are very likely to be notable via GNG if they meet other (easier to establish) criteria. In the case of criterion#3, it is presumed that those 2% of the membership of the IEEE who have been elected Fellows are very likely to meet GNG anyway, so it saves us having to look. The mistake is extrapolating that to say that 10% of members of ACR are very likely to meet GNG, just because the radiologists have elected them Fellows of the ACR. The analogy with the IEEE breaks down because the ACR is less selective. The criterion (which is a guideline, of course) clearly indicates that only societies that are highly selective with their Fellowships can be expected to be useful as a short-cut to bypass GNG. -- () 16:26, 5 July 2011 (UTC)


I think that caveat #3 is important:  It's not good enough to meet the rule of thumb.  We must have independent, third-party sources about the subject.  It's entirely possible that these would be easier to find for the ACR fellows than for the IEEE fellows.   () 17:20, 5 July 2011 (UTC)

* Well, then,  needs to be rewritten, because it currently states that if you meet any of the criteria, you are notable, period. That would mean even without reliable sources. (Though the likelihood of there being no reliable sources if you meet the criteria is almost nil anyways, but still) [[User:Silver seren|Silver]][[User talk:Silver seren|seren]] 20:21, 5 July 2011 (UTC)
*Err, no? &quot;It is possible for an academic to be notable according to this standard, and yet not be an appropriate topic for coverage in Wikipedia because of a lack of reliable, independent sources on the subject.&quot; [[User:NuclearWarfare|NW]] ([[User talk:NuclearWarfare|Talk]]) 22:31, 5 July 2011 (UTC)
* Ah, I see. But doesn't that seem to be kidna messing up the concept of notability on Wikipedia? It's generally used that, if you're notable, then that's all that is necessary and that it is assumed that the sources exist somewhere. [[User:Silver seren|Silver]][[User talk:Silver seren|seren]] 22:36, 5 July 2011 (UTC)
 That's exactly backwards, unfortunately. For an article to be a suitable subject for Wikipedia, it has to have reliable sources – otherwise there's nothing for us to write, so we should be finding the sources first. The next step is to ensure notability, and guidelines like ACADEMIC are there to help us decide whether searching for sources to establish notability is likely to be fruitful, but it's not a guarantee. That's why the third general note (after the 9 criteria) contains the caveat that a subject may be notable by ACADEMIC, but still not suitable for a Wikipedia article if sources are lacking. -- () 00:09, 6 July 2011 (UTC)

I agree that ACADEMIC explains this fact poorly.  Perhaps someday we will improve it to more accurately and fully communicate the standards.   () 21:48, 6 July 2011 (UTC)

MEDRS complaint source

Editors at Chiropractic have claimed that [http://chiromt.com/content/18/1/3#sec6 Bronfort et. al] does not meet WP:MEDRS, because it was sponsored by the UK General Chiropractic Council, (&quot;The UK General Chiropractic Council provided the funding for this scientific evidence report.&quot;) and is therefore not independent of the topic. The authors state under the &quot;competing interests&quot; section that &quot;All authors are trained as doctors of chiropractic but are now full time professional researchers&quot; which to me would indicate that they are independent of the topic, and that this is not a reason for failing .

The decision to use a COI source comes down to  in combination with other policies such as  and . My personal opinion is that a blanket ban on using potentially biased or partisan sources is not helpful but equally if less biased/non-biased sources covering the same area are available they should generally be given preference or used instead. Is there a review of the same nature that can be used instead? Other editors here at WikiMED may have a different viewpoint and I am speaking as an individual by the way.--[[User:Literaturegeek|Literaturegeek]] | [[User_talk:Literaturegeek |T@1k?]] 06:13, 8 July 2011 (UTC)
Agree that  doesn't speak to the specific issue of funding status one way or another.  I also believe that, in general, funding status should have little to no bearing on whether or not an article should be included, provided that it is published in an an objectively peer-reviewed journal, otherwise we open a can of worms no one wants to open. As to the specifics of this case, I do not know the general reputation of the authors or journal to give an informed comment, though a chiropractic funded study, authored by chiropractors, and published in a chiropractic journal, would certainly raise a red flag for me to study the issue a little closer. I also note that this particular review is being sourced in the lead, and upon quick perusal of the section it is supposed to summarize, it appears it may be given too much  (other reviews seem to disagree with it, raising another red flag as to why only this review is cited about effectiveness).   () 15:56, 8 July 2011 (UTC)
Reviews do disagree, and that is why we follow . The article heavily relies on articles written by Edzard Ernst, a critic of chiropractic. Please feel free to study the issue a little closer, but to me, the issue that it is authored by chiropractic researchers (non-practicing, so no COI), and funded by a chiropractic organization isn't an issue, and I see those raising it as an issue as launching an ad-hominem attack. It is published in a peer-reviewed journal of high quality. Weight issues can be decided by consensus on the article talk page, it was more the COI/funding aspect that I wanted feedback on here, though feel free to participate further at the article talk page.  () 16:19, 8 July 2011 (UTC)
Right, with reviews disagreeing,  would suggest that this disagreement would actually be present in the lead (i.e. there would be some non-zero indication in the lead that there is disagreement rather than just the presentation  of one side by one disputed review). I don't plan on doing much editing in this area, as I have other priorities and articles I've been planning on updating/editing for months.  However, if the lead is any indication of what the quality of the article is like, I might have to add it to m to-do-list.  () 17:29, 8 July 2011 (UTC)

See :

&quot;Many medical claims lack reliable research about the efficacy and safety of proposed treatments or about the legitimacy of statements made by proponents. In such cases, reliable sources may be difficult to find while unreliable sources are readily available. Whenever writing about medical claims not supported by mainstream research, it is vital that , independent sources be used. Sources written and reviewed by the advocates of such  can be used to describe personal opinions, but extreme care should be taken when using such sources lest the more controversial aspects of their opinions be taken at face value or, worse, asserted as fact. If the independent sources discussing a medical subject are of low quality, then it is likely that the subject itself is not  enough to have its own article or relevant enough to be mentioned in other articles.&quot;

&quot;Whenever writing about medical claims not supported by mainstream research, it is vital that third-party, independent sources be used.&quot; according to . There seems to be some confusion. The source is a report not a traditional review. &quot;The UK General Chiropractic Council provided the funding for this scientific evidence report.&quot; A UK chiropractic report sponsored by the UK General Chiropractic Council is a low-quality source. See .

See :

&quot;Knowing the quality of the evidence helps editors distinguish between minority and majority viewpoints, determine , and identify information that will be accepted as evidence-based medicine. In general, editors should rely upon high-quality evidence, such as systematic reviews, rather than lower-quality evidence, such as case reports, or non-evidence, (e.g., anecdotes or conventional wisdom).  

The best evidence comes from meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and from systematic reviews of bodies of literature of overall good quality and consistency addressing the specific recommendation. Narrative reviews can help establish the context of evidence quality. Roughly in descending order of quality, lower-quality evidence in medical research comes from individual RCTs, other controlled studies, quasi-experimental studies, and non-experimental studies such as comparative, correlation, and case control studies. Although expert committee reports or opinions, along with clinical experience of respected authorities, are weaker evidence than the scientific studies themselves, they often provide helpful overviews of evidence quality. Case reports, whether in the popular press or a peer-reviewed medical journal, are a form of anecdote and generally fall below the minimum requirements of reliable medical sources.&quot;

&quot;Narrative reviews can help establish the context of evidence quality.&quot; according to . It is not our job to question the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Vertebral_artery_dissection&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=438082807 experts like Ernst].

 More eyes needed on Chiropractic, if possible, please. There is a dispute over the removal of [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18280103 Ernst 2008]] and its replacement with [http://chiromt.com/content/18/1/3 Bronfort et al 2010]. The former is published in J Pain Symptom Manage while the latter is from Chiropractic &amp; Manual Therapies. Personally, I think both views need to be mentioned, but there is a suggestion that Ernst 2008 is too old versus another suggestion that Bronfort 2010 fails MEDRS because it's not published in an independent journal. It really will need more opinions brought to the debate to forge an acceptable consensus. Thanks in advance for any help you can give. -- () 22:53, 9 July 2011 (UTC)
Please note, the discussion is over the removal of [http://chiromt.com/content/18/1/3 Bronfort et al 2010] and replacement with [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18280103 Ernst 2008]. The use of Bronfort et al 2010 as a source in the LEAD had achieved consensus 6 months ago [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Chiropractic/Archive_33#Changes_needed_in_the_LEAD]. This was until 1 of 15 controversial changes [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chiropractic&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=438340147&amp;oldid=438158704], made on July 7-8 by one editor without any prior discussion on the articles talk page, removed Bronfort et al 2010 as a source and replaced it with Ernst 2008. Again, Bronfort et al 2010 was included in the lead according to consensus [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Chiropractic/Archive_33#Changes_needed_in_the_LEAD]. Now Bronfort has been removed from the LEAD and replaced with Ernst 2008 before consensus was reached to do so. Please See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Chiropractic#Continued_deletion_of_Bronfort_et_al_2010_from_the_LEAD]. () 23:32, 9 July 2011 (UTC)
 Absolute nonsense. The debate is about removing [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18280103 Ernst 2008] from the lead, which clearly had no consensus 6 months ago (per the discussion you indicated:  and ), and has no consensus now. You were the only editor campaigning for it then and it is an insult to the intelligence of all the editors who participated to now suggest there is consensus for its removal. -- () 00:24, 10 July 2011 (UTC)
This diff [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=414268089] suggests that RexxS also supported the text in the article as it existed with Bronfort used as a source in the LEAD and Ernst only cited in the BODY. I suspect that the 1000 mass controversial changes [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chiropractic&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=438340147&amp;oldid=438158704], made by one editor, spread out over 15 edits on July 7-8, have confused other editors as to what was and what was not in the article before July 7. Furthermore,  shows that there were also other editors that supported the changes made 6 months ago, including someone else usually critical of chiropractic (BRangifer). The chiropractic article has included only Bronfort in the LEAD since February after discussion and consensus (see 2 diffs I have provided above in this post). Now Bronfort has been removed and replaced with only Ernst? Ernst does not accurately summarize the body (see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Chiropractic#Continued_deletion_of_Bronfort_et_al_2010_from_the_LEAD]), and there are no notable disagreements that need to be discussed in the LEAD. RexxS, please strike-out your accusations of my insulting other editors intelligence.  () 14:21, 10 July 2011 (UTC)

Offer to share images

[[File:BrugadaECGPedia.png|thumb|Typical ECG abnormalities in Brugada syndrome: ST elevation in V1-V3, without ischemia.]]Hey Guys. I have been in discussion with Dr. de Jong with respect to his sites http://www.cardionetworks.org , http://www.ecgpedia.org , http://www.echopedia.org , http://www.pcipedia.org . His group is interested in collaborating with use ( releasing their images under a license that we can use with appropriate attribution ). This is a great opportunity to increase our image coverage of some of these topics. Attribution will of course be attached to the image but what are peoples thoughts on attribution within the caption? Maybe a blue number link that brings people to ref section that than links to their page? [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 23:46, 10 July 2011 (UTC)

 (and a heck of a lot of discussion in the past, such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28proposals%29/Archive_25#Photograph_attribution_in_image_captions]) indicates that we shouldn't include image credits in the caption. If Dr. de Jong really wishes that we include credit in the caption as a condition for securing the release of the photographs though, I'm sure  trumps the Manual of Style. And I think that if that is going too far, your reference link idea is a nice compromise. [[User:NuclearWarfare|NW]] ([[User talk:NuclearWarfare|Talk]]) 01:52, 11 July 2011 (UTC)
Yes I am still in discussions. He received approval from his board to work on a collaboration with us. I am thinking the little blue link as in my example is a fair compromise. I believe that it is important from our end to give some recognition to partner sites that are willing to work with us ( I BTW have a few others that have expressed interested but am still working on specifics ). [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 02:02, 11 July 2011 (UTC)
Per previous discussions and guidelines linked by NW, we can't make in-article attribution part of the licence conditions. Note that if you print (e.g. to PDF) an article, then the image attribution is included. Lots of people contribute to an article but none of them get their names on the main HTML page. ° 07:13, 11 July 2011 (UTC)
I often link to the source of the image when I add images from other sites such as the CDC as done in the example here as this gives a reference to the image for verification purposes (6 of the images on the obesity page have refs in the caption). Comments regarding this? [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 14:11, 11 July 2011 (UTC)

If the caption text requires a reference then that's fine and quite routine. If the image is generated from information that needs to be sourced, the citation should be on image page (here or on Commons) so that the source of the data is available whereever the image is used. If the image is lifted from another source then that naturally gets mentioned in the image page. If the licence requires attribution then that too goes on the image page. I don't think these things should be on the article page at all. It seems like a nice generous idea but we can't treat some people differently to others. You'd really need to overturn the consensus at  and I disagree that this is the sort of thing  is for. ° 15:16, 11 July 2011 (UTC)

 The Wikimedia projects as a whole are rich in content, but relatively poor in images. I think that initiatives to enrich our stock of usable images should be encouraged, even to the extend of &quot;bending&quot; guidelines like  and I would support the discreet use of such an inline reference if that helped us to attract more quality media. Of course, the ideal solution would be to link to a wikipedia article about Jonas de Jong or his websites. Is there sufficient notability to justify that? -- () 14:50, 11 July 2011 (UTC)

There are all sorts of things we could do to improve the stock of photographs, but choose not to. For example, many people would contribute images if we could restrict them to be &quot;for educational purposes only&quot; or &quot;for Wikipedia only&quot;. What happens if the image appears on the main page? Do we have to stick the photographer's name there too? ° 15:16, 11 July 2011 (UTC)

Offers like this are very seductive, but there are clearly some pitfalls that would have to be worked through. Would all the wikipedias be able to use the images, or just :en? Could they go on ? Are the image technical formats suited? If not, are we licensed to convert them? Do we meet  criteria? Do we need a separate NFI justification for each use, or will one blanket one serve? Is credit on the  sufficent? If not, would a credit in the form of a link to a WP article about the source website suffice?  [[User talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl!]] 15:26, 11 July 2011 (UTC)
 @Colin: I've had a little experience with Main Page recently, and I can assure you that the images/thumbnails there don't have captions, so the question would not arise. If I understand James correctly, there's no issue of applying restrictive terms, just the gesture of duplicating the source attribution (already available at the image page) within an article. This kind of 'compromise of our principles' seems a small price to pay. In any event, we would have to make clear to Dr de Jong that we could not guarantee that any in-article attribution would remain in place, since a consensus of editors at a given article could override any actions we may make.
 @LSD: The only licence that meets James' description and our requirements is CC-BY-SA. In that case, the images would be fine for Commons or anywhere else, and derivative works would be allowed under the conditions of attribution. I wouldn't be interested in seeing images licensed under anything less. -- () 16:12, 11 July 2011 (UTC)

My understanding is that the CC-BY-SA attribution is considered to be met on wp by our link to the  on commons, where the details are provided. Would this satisfy them?  [[User talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl!]] 17:00, 11 July 2011 (UTC)

RexxS, the main page question was rhetorical, but highlights how unworkable an &quot;alongside the image&quot; attribution condition would be. The answer to the question: can we attribute the photographs on the article HTML page is simply no. One of our principles is fairness. No contributor, text, image or sound, is entitled to that sort of recognition. ° 17:07, 11 July 2011 (UTC)
Colin, with regards to your Main page comment,  quite regularly gives image credits, both to the original creator of the image as well as the graphics editor. [[User:NuclearWarfare|NW]] ([[User talk:NuclearWarfare|Talk]]) 17:43, 11 July 2011 (UTC)
I have not hammered out the details with ECGPedia yet. I am just looking at different options. I think the one I proposed is fair. Yes there is a minimum that we are required to do to meet CC-BY-SA which is what the images would be released under. This does not however mean that we must do the minimum. We could do more. If we wish to get more groups to work with us a bit of a compromise would be useful. I want to be able to approach further people after this is done and say 1) we partnered with this group 2) they got more traffic from Wikipedia because they allowed usage of content under a CC-BY-SA license 3) thus you should also consider working with us. Would hopefully also publish a paper based on these partnerships. If we insist on always giving the minimum legally allowed credit my job will be harder.[[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 18:18, 11 July 2011 (UTC)
This really needs to be discussed at . And if you are linking to the source site in-article, then at . Both guidelines would need to be overturned or altered to allow this.I really don't want to be so negative because more images would be great. But I'm very doubtful that the community would accept such a change. CC-BY-SA is fine, but the attribution is on the image page on the web and the bottom of the article when printed as PDF. This isn't really a WP:MED issue.  ° 19:13, 11 July 2011 (UTC)
I really only edit this project and am only working on increasing medical images. Before I go elsewhere would like support from people here if they are willing to give it. As the obesity article shows we already provide links in many captions. These links would be used as references rather than  thus EL would not apply. Per the discussion here [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style_%28captions%29#More_on_credits_in_image_captions] at WP:CREDIT it is unclear if our advice is compliant with the law. This is more a issue of . We have concerns over at Commons frequently regarding whether or not the image source is reliable. This will give some assurance of that. Images should be dealt a little differently from text. [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 19:16, 11 July 2011 (UTC)
The concept, where somebody gives WP something valuable, we mention them in an article and link to their website, and their website gets more visitors, sounds an awful lot like advertising. Wrt WP:V, any sourcing issues for the image should be dealt with on the image page, not the article page. Those sourcing issues are quite independent of where the image appears. So I'm still not convinced we can use WP:V as a rationale for including article attribution/links. ° 07:59, 12 July 2011 (UTC)
That is what we do every time we reference the NEJM or Lancet. We &quot;advertise&quot; for these journals. I do not see how this is any different. We are verifying the source of what we have here.[[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 15:00, 12 July 2011 (UTC)
We're not adding the link in return for some favour. And I've already said I've there's no problem with the image attribution/link being on the image page. Now, if the NEJM or the Lancet want to give Wikipedian's free subscriptions so we can all write better articles using their journals as sources, we could start talking about making cite journal template use a bigger bolder font and a click-through percentage for WP:MED members :-). ° 15:49, 12 July 2011 (UTC)
Not sure what you mean? What I am referring to is that whether an image was taken by a physician versus the lay public affects the reliability of the photo just as whether text content is support by a newpaper or the NEJM affects its reliability. Textbooks and journals give more apparent attribution than we at Wikipedia do. [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 16:18, 12 July 2011 (UTC)
WRT the above image I will be referencing the cardiologists interpretation of the ECG for the caption. Thus will not be referencing the image but the caption text. So for this collaboration with ECGPedia and EchoPedia attribution in the caption will be a moot point.[[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 20:21, 13 July 2011 (UTC)

Are we interested in collaborating with other sites?

I personally think collaborating with other sites is potentially good for all involved. We would be offering greater exposure, they would be offering high quality content / more editors / greater exposure. This is a form of  IMO but we are dealing with other sites / institutions. Is this something people here support me pursuing? [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 19:42, 11 July 2011 (UTC)
Yes, of course. Wrt image donations, I'm sure there are people on WP and Commons with loads of experience dealing with folk wanting to donate images and negotiating license terms and what they get in return. If you read the WP Signpost back issues you'll find examples and probably talking to those people will be more useful to you than the WP:MED project, on those sort of issues. ° 08:03, 12 July 2011 (UTC)

I don't really have any interest in collaborating with other sites, mostly because it seems like they get far more benefit than we do from such assistance.  I don't think that we want our content to depend on a willingness to spam links to other websites into our articles.  If some other website offers us an image, for example, they ought to be named or linked at the File: page, but not in the article—just like any image uploaded by a regular editor.  I'm not willing to accept  to get an image.   () 16:20, 12 July 2011 (UTC)
I do not see how this if that different from referencing the NEJM. We state where we get ideas from. Why not state where we get images from? There have been questions regarding the reliability of images based on who took it. We should make this more clear. Medical texts and journal give even more credits than what I am suggesting.[[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 17:59, 12 July 2011 (UTC)

Because when we're citing the NEJM, we're normally citing facts from the NEJM, not specific words or images from it.  &quot;If you're not sure that the information in this sentence is correct, it can be verified at &quot; is not the same as &quot;The folks at example.com were kind enough to give us this picture&quot;.   () 20:26, 12 July 2011 (UTC)

James, we do state where we get the image from. On the image page. I agree it is good to know this is a verified image of dengue rather than an amateur snap of what may be measles, say, but it benefits everyone to have that located with the image. There's no benefit to WP to moving or copying that attribution/verification onto the article page. This is a &quot;if everyone were allowed to do that&quot; problem.

I think WhatAmIDoing's point is that such collaboration needs to be on the same terms as we collaborate. All we get is a warm feeling inside from making information freely available (apart from the folk who are drug company shills and get paid, of course). ° 20:37, 12 July 2011 (UTC)
However Wikimedia Commons and Wikipedia are different sites. I know the lawyer says having attribution their is all that is required legally but I still think a little attribution for images on Wikipedia would improve Wikipedia not only with respect to increasing image donations but increasing reliability. Textbooks and journals give this sort of credit.[[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 19:39, 13 July 2011 (UTC)
Wikipedia gives image credit at the bottom of the page when &quot;printed&quot; as a PDF book. Textbooks may give image credit in some appendix rather than next to the image. Online resources rarely give image credit. In fact, clicking on the sites above that started this discussion, I'm finding it difficult to find any image credits. Images seem to link to a missing image page on Commons. Is their website broken? ° 21:02, 13 July 2011 (UTC)
I have emailed the site for clarification of this... [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 21:39, 13 July 2011 (UTC)
Jonas states:
*Where personal acknowledgment is important (almost exclusively ECGs) images will have a 'courtesy of' notice on the image itself
*If there is no ecgpedia.org logo / text on the image, there is often a reason, such as an image from a third party with usage exclusively for ecgpedia (such as the Wilde rhythm puzzles), so it would be good to discuss these images before re-use.
*Images with an ECGpedia logo, but no 'courtesy of' are often made by myself or on my request (by e.g. a payed student / illustrator) and they can be used with acknowledgment to ecgpedia, without personal acknowledgement.
Thus it appears that almost all images are by the creator of the site. And the attribution he wishes is to ECGPedia.
