 Renaming WikiProject Medicine to WikiProject Human Medicine? 

There is currently a very one-sided argument going on at T:ANAT about the renaming of the project. The scope is human anatomy, and one non-project editor feels this must be conveyed in the name, despite the lack of a general animal anatomy project to differentiate from. My concern is this could eventually follow over to WP:MED. Feel free to weigh in. -- ser:CFCF|CFCF ser talk:CFCF|üçå (pecial:EmailUser/CFCF|email) 09:56, 7 October 2014 (UTC)

 Are a  [https://www.healthtap.com/what_we_make/overview HealthTap] doctor's answers a useful references in these projects?  If so, in what context?  

I am a physician working for [https://www.healthtap.com/what_we_make/overview HealthTap], recently I have taken a personal interest in making our content more available to the public because we have many millions of doctor-authored answers to lay questions on health topics.   I feel like our public content could be immensely valuable within Project Medicine.   I am hoping to find a legitimate unbiased way to contribute HealthTap content to Wikipedia's body of knowledge.  

Are there any editors involved who could advise me?   I am curious to know if you think HealthTap is a useful primary source and how I could best contribute.   Here are some examples of questions and answers that I thought provided unique insights that would be valuable: 
* [https://www.healthtap.com/user_questions/796280 answers on experimental treatment] 
* [https://www.healthtap.com/user_questions/607297 answers that reveal doctors attitudes toward clinical practice]
* [https://www.healthtap.com/user_questions/571344 answers that reveal clinical treatment of hard to reach or understudied populations]
* [https://www.healthtap.com/user_questions/265121 answers that reflect clinical knowledge of rare conditions] (especially where treatment citations are requested)
* [https://www.healthtap.com/user_questions/1487422 answers to new or unresearched medical topics of interest to the public where clinical opinions might be the best resource] 

In case you haven't heard about HealthTap, I want to give some context.  
* We were founded on principles of social entrepreneurship.  
* The articles written by doctors on HealthTap provide unique insights into how doctors practice; because they represent voluntary contributions and insights from the front lines of clinical care in the US. 
* Each answer to a clinical topic or question is ‚Ä≥Peer Reviewed‚Ä≥ and shows the degree to which other doctors ‚Ä≥Agree‚Ä≥ with it. So the content on HealthTap reflects the collective practical knowledge of the world's largest network of medical authors (now over 63,000 doctors in over 137 specialties). 
* HealthTap content is without commercial bias or influence, because HealthTap takes no advertising or sponsorships ( HealthTap generates revenue from helping individual doctors deliver healthcare to their patients.)  
* HealthTap generates content dynamically, however the citations listed here are fixed URLs with content that will not change over time. 

I am experimenting with posting citations directly using the citation by contributor template,  requesting edits on talk pages, and using the request edit template.  But I am new to Wikipedia, and hesitant about doing anything more than suggesting citations to more experienced and unbiased editors.  I would appreciate feedback.   

Thank you!  And thank you from all doctors for the fantastic resource that Wikipedia has become for health information! 

Respectfully,
Andrea Burbank, MD

Hello l|Doctor drea. This looks like a useful source to be accessed directly by patients, but the site cannot serve as a reference for medical content in the way one would use a journal article or medical textbook. This is covered in P:MEDRS, our sourcing guideline. Please have a look &amp; I hope this is reasonable. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW¬†|¬†ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 20:40, 6 October 2014 (UTC)
Hello, I just messaged you on your talk page. I have read a lot about HealthTap and have thought about collaboration with Wikipedia also. I am glad to find that you had the same idea. I would like to talk more with you, either on your talk page, off-wiki, or here as you like. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 20:44, 6 October 2014 (UTC)

Thank you for the prompt (and kind) responses!  I read the  P:MEDRS sourcing guideline.  I thought it was fantastically well-written and should probably be mandatory reading for all scientists.  The discpline of  &quot;hinking, Fast and Slow|slow thinking&quot; often needs refreshers!  Yes I believe according to the sourcing guidelines  we would be a primary source and therefore not valid in the context of a single citation.  Our peer review process is more similar to a &quot;panel of experts&quot; and most answers do not cite primary sources although they can be interpreted as summary opinions.  As ser:Jfdwolff|JFW mentioned we are intended to operate as a complementary source for patients where [https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3A+healthtap.com%2Fuser_questions+Medial+Medullary+Syndrome&amp;oq=site&amp;aqs=chrome.5.69i57j69i65l2j69i60l2j69i59.2629j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;es_sm=119&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=site%3A+healthtap.com%2Fuser_questions+%22Wikipedia%22 doctors interpret and summarize reference sources] such as journal articles and textbooks (and even Wikipedia) for patients.

I have thought about it some more and I believe that our content could be valuable to Project Medicine in one other way: as accessible examples of a point made in a secondary source.   I came to this conclusion because I got distracted by your feature article on orensic facial reconstruction|forensic facial reconstruction.   I noticed it dealt with a fairly controversial subject in a unbiased manner citing secondary sources, but that it also included individual examples of successful identifications from reconstructions.  According to the sourcing guideline: &quot;One possibility is to cite a higher-quality source along with a more-accessible popular source, for example, with the ara|laysummary parameter of l|cite journal.&quot; 

Now examples can be very vivid, so while content such as [https://www.healthtap.com/user_questions/1105779-can-you-tell-me-if-i-have-a-five-days-old-baby-and-i-just-fund-out-i-have-hiv-coud-the-doctor-tell-if-my-baby-have-hiv this question/answer set] might be too vivid a example in the article on the anagement of HIV/AIDS I suspect it could be very relevant in an article on nternational_health#Harnessing_the_Power_of_Technology|harnessing the power of technology in international health.  However I think that out of respect for the culture of Wikipedia, incorporation of these examples is best done organically from within Wikipedia rather than suggested by people affiliated with HealthTap.  

ser:Bluerasberry|Blue Rasberry I would love to meet and learn other ways that HealthTap and our doctors could collaborate constructively on this project.  I do want to clarify one thing from ikipedia:Teahouse/Questions|a similar talk page on the teahouse, although we have a commercial offering for the provision of health care, we have millions of doctor answers that [https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;es_th=1&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=site:+healthtap.com%2Fuser_questions+%22public+health%22 are publicly available] for free and that is the content I am suggesting would be valuable to editors in this context.  Our doctors volunteer their time like Wikipedia editors do; with similar motivations but complementary tactics.   Once again, thank you for all you do!Drea 19:55, 7 October 2014 (UTC)

It would be useful if physicians who volunteer their time looking for high quality sources to answer questions for HealthTap also checked the relevant content on Wikipedia and if it is not well sourced / written edit it based on the sources they have found.

You seemed to be asking whether this is a hoax. It appears not to be. As to whether it is a genuine &quot;psychological disorder&quot;, and thus comes under the remit of P:MEDRS, that is another question entirely. The article cites one source from a medical journal, [http://web.archive.org/web/20131030034543/http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/199914/000019991499A0260258.php] but I'm not sure that is sufficient in of itself to answer the question. I suspect that this might possibly be one of those edge cases that medical anthropology likes to look at - a culturally-bound medical condition. Which one could argue is &quot;only in people's heads&quot;, and thus not a real condition. Except of course that one could say the same thing about osttraumatic stress disorder. The fact of the matter is that people do frequently exhibit 'real' symptoms as a consequence of psychological stress - though whether the mismatch between the 'real' Paris and a Japanese 'idealised' Paris is enough to stress unfortunate Japanese tourists to the extent that medical intervention is likely to be needed is likely to remain open to question - not something one is likely to be able to do conclusive research on, given the variables involved, and the ethical problems one would face in trying to conduct some sort of organised trial. ser:AndyTheGrump|AndyTheGrump (ser talk:AndyTheGrump|talk) 00:21, 8 October 2014 (UTC)

Historically, activists of one sort or another have turned Wikipedia's psychiatry and psychopharmacology drugs into some of the most unbalanced and difficult to maintain articles on the site. When I started editing Wikipedia 2 years ago, the SSRI article contained 25 lines describing the drugs' uses (mainly quoting Kirch's controversial claim that they don't do anything at all in depression), 250 lines on adverse effects and drug-drug interactions, 100 lines of mechanistic speculation based on primary in vitro studies, and a 50 line Criticism section mainly describing the views of those who don't believe psychiatry is a legitimate field of medicine.  Peter Breggin, David Healy, and Joanna Moncreif's views were extensively discussed, but no mention made of the treatment guidelines issued by NICE or the APA.  If folks recruited from an anti-psychiatry website can be convinced to follow the rules and add content that is NPOV, I'm all for it.  But it brings to mind the TV show &quot;Walking Dead&quot; and its episode on efforts to train zombies to be good citizens and to not to eat people. I think it will be very challenging at best. ser:Formerly 98|Formerly 98 (ser talk:Formerly 98|talk) 20:18, 8 October 2014 (UTC)

 Categorization of OD symptoms 

A reviewer at the FAC wanted me to convert the text covering the symptoms in mphetamine#Overdose into a wikitable format due to the long chain of wikilinks in the current version (P:SEAOFBLUE issue).  That said, I'm not 100% certain that I categorized all these symptoms appropriately by system, so I figured I'd paste the table here for feedback on the table before pasting it into the section. I've added the current section beneath it just for comparison.

I like the tables and their implementation, and I could get over the fact they are full width on my screen. My only concern is about &quot;extremely large overdose&quot;. The word extremely doesn't feel professional enough for an encyclopedia, and if this is to be an example we can use in other articles I suggest it be changed. It retracts from what you really mean - &quot;Very large&quot; or even just &quot;Large&quot; would suffice. -- ser:CFCF|CFCF ser talk:CFCF|üçå (pecial:EmailUser/CFCF|email) 18:28, 8 October 2014 (UTC)
I've removed the forced 100% width and centered the table.  The current table is roughly the best I can make it look without the two symptom columns being unequal in size or specifying a px width (which would cause problems in some browsers). It looks ok on my laptop; looks better on my phone.  Edit: The main reason I used the term &quot;extreme&quot; here as opposed to &quot;very&quot; is to emphasize that those effects require a much larger dose than that taken to produce symptoms of a moderate overdose (an order of magnitude usually - therapeutic doses range in the tens of mg with a max of 60 mg (per the FDA and NCHEM); recreational doses typically range from 500mg to 5g).  Another minor reason I worded it that way is that the symptoms of a moderate OD may occur at idiosyncratically low doses - extreme OD symptoms do not (most of them are medical emergencies). ser:Seppi333|Seppi333¬†(ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert¬†2¬¢¬†|¬†pecial:WhatLinksHere/User:Seppi333/Maintenance|Maintained) 21:02, 8 October 2014 (UTC)

If straight-up Google results for the term in quotes are any indication (which they might not be), then probably not, I would say. There are 15 results for the phrase on PubMed, none of which are MEDRS compliant, so it would probably become a quackfest if we accepted it through AFC.

 Extending or adding infoboxes 

My english isn't very good, but I'll try to explain what's on my mind...I'm sure this has been discussed before, but there are some things I miss here on Wikipedia. I was thinking that disease articles could've had additional infoboxes with general information like case fatality rate, laterality (e.g. unilateral in the case of pneumothorax, or bilateral testicular torsion, etc.), typical biological markers, incidence rates, affected sex (male, female, both), prognosis (poor, good, very good), typical symptoms, contraindications, etc. Perhaps even more technical information, like typical blood count values and so forth. Please provide a link if this has been discussed before. What do you think? ser:Gautehuus|Gautehuus (ser talk:Gautehuus|talk) 17:07, 12 October 2014 (UTC)
Off the top of my head, I'd say it's quite hard to come up with numbers that are useful because it all depends on context. For example, incidence--where? In the US? Worldwide? How long before those figures are out of date and become inaccurate? Blood values vary with age, and prognosis is tremendously dependent on all kinds of things (how prompt the diagnosis was, access to services, probably socioeconomic status, age, general health of the patient).ser:Basie|Basie (ser talk:Basie|talk) 20:00, 12 October 2014 (UTC)
Some of these are possible.  Perhaps a different box under Diagnosis would be good for blood tests.  A box listing symptoms under Symptoms is also possible.  I wonder if that would tend to introduce editing problems.  Some people might think that a box for symptoms needed to contain all the possible symptoms (and especially whichever symptoms they personally experienced).  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 23:18, 12 October 2014 (UTC)
If we do decide on something like this we would need some firm guidance on where and how many items these contain. We should be trying to write in prose rather than list form IMO. And with more boxes things can get become poorly formatted / more confusing rather than less. ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk ¬∑ pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs ¬∑ pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 23:34, 12 October 2014 (UTC)
If you're interested, we could try collaborating on a dummy/sandbox article just to see how it would look, and to find out whether it will work or not. I imagine it will be hard to create a one universal infobox, but to start this off, I think we could make one that can be used in the larger articles on common diseases. ser:Gautehuus|Gautehuus (ser talk:Gautehuus|talk) 14:17, 13 October 2014 (UTC)
|Gautehuus I am very supportive of this idea. For medicine there is less work in trying this than there is in economics. There are several issues to overcome. One is the creation of the infobox, another is deciding how to store the data which goes into the infobox, and another is deciding which datasets to present. For medicine deciding which data to present can be difficult as there are arguments about whom to trust.
For economics there is more consensus in many datasets, and at eta:Grants:IdeaLab/Global Economic Map there is a proposal to make an infobox for all regions which presents the economic data by year and updates automatically every year. This proposal is not being developed by anyone but I think if it were funded for economics then based on that precedent we could try something with medicine.
What you suggest is an excellent idea and it must be the future of Wikipedia. The biggest problem right now is finding someone who is able to apply for a grant to do the necessary development to make this happen. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 13:36, 14 October 2014 (UTC)

--ser:Mrjohncummings|Mrjohncummings (ser talk:Mrjohncummings|talk) 04:54, 15 October 2014 (UTC)

mrjohncummings, i believe that under privacy laws like HIPAA you are going to find very little detail published in reliable sources about his or any other individual's treatment.    speaking generally, folks have wanted to add lots of information about specific patients treated with ZMapp and I have been trimming that.  The reasons are a) the article is about the drug  b) what happened with the individual cases tells us little about whether the drug is safe and effective, which we'll only know from aggregate data from testing or using the drug in many people  c) the structure of the article is set by P:MEDMOS which rightly doesn't have space for individual case studies; some content on these individual treatments has been retained in the History section since they were big news; d) little information about these individual treatments is available from P:MEDRS compliant sources, so there is little we can say anyway (except that they happened) - in other words, these studies are History, which is OK to source from sources other than biomedical reviews and statements by major scientific and medical bodies (the kind of sources we use for actual health/medical content). ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 09:33, 15 October 2014 (UTC)

projectmed members, i've been even keeping names out of the article - again, the identity of the patients is irrelevant with respect to the drug, and in my view there are privacy issues (I know that people's names were reported in the media, but we don't have to do that here as well).

If my opinion were wrong than we could never move something from one Wikipedia article to another. 
I could have explained my position with respect to Rolandic epilepsy better. Epilepsy syndromes are types of epilepsy and these types have causes that can be described separately from those of secondary epilepsy.

 Health statistics: US vs global 

When editing pages is it better to use US statistics, global statistics, or both?  For example, many of the cancer pages only list a 5 year survival from a US perspective.  Global stats seem more prudent to me, and I wouldn't be opposed to including both.  Just wanted to get people's opinions on this.  Thanks.  ser:Muscat Hoe|Muscat Hoe (ser talk:Muscat Hoe|talk) 14:40, 13 October 2014 (UTC)
We should always use global statistics, whenever possible! We do have a US-bias, but only because many editors come from the US and are savvy about the situation there, and will more likely be interested in such numbers. Additionally we aren't limited to US or global statistics either, but should display UK, EU, Japan, China etc. etc. whenever they are notable (mentioning these as they are more likely to have statistics on a variety of diseases as opposed to say Rwanda).
US statistics aren't premiered in any way, and if for example industrialized countries have a certain incidence, which is the same as the US, we are safe to assume that readers can extrapolate that the US is an industrialized country and it would not need independent mention, unless on a more list-type epidemiology article. -- ser:CFCF|CFCF ser talk:CFCF|üçå (pecial:EmailUser/CFCF|email) 14:52, 13 October 2014 (UTC)
I agree with CFCF. Ideally, we would feature global statistics whenever possible. If there are significant differences in different areas of the world, different ages, or different gender, or specific occupations than it is important for us to use these statistics, too. We have a long way to go to do this in a consistent way in most health articles. Sydney Poore/ser:FloNight|FloNightser talk:FloNight|‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• 16:09, 13 October 2014 (UTC)
I'd agree that we should use global statistics, but in some cases the U.S. data is collected and available and the global information is not. The CDC, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Healthcare Utilization Project, and other databases do provide much more epidemiology info than is sometimes available on a WW basis, and the EU has similarly detailed info on many topics. I'd hate to see useful local statistics that one can in many cases extrapolate from excluded in favor of non-existent stats of a more global nature. ser:Formerly 98|Formerly 98 (ser talk:Formerly 98|talk) 16:20, 13 October 2014 (UTC)
I take the point as a general one, but for cancer, regulars here have at least 3 copies of World Cancer Report 2014 (World Health Organization. 2014. SBN|9283204298), and CRUK's [http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-info/cancerstats/ CancerStats] sub-site has good global and UK figures.

On this issue, as part of my training work, a ikipedia:WikiProject_CRUK/Angel_training#Participants.2C_stats_team number of CRUK specialists from the stats team added basic UK stats to several cancer articles on October 3rd - eg [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prostate_cancer&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=628093603 this], with [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Prostate_cancer&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=628093953 this note/disclosure] on the talk page: &quot;Hi, I'm from Cancer Research UK and going to add some UK stats to the epidemiology section complied from ONS, ISD Scotland, Welsh Cancer Intelligence and Surveillance Unit and the Northern Ireland Cancer Registry as summarised on the Cancer Research UK website&quot;.  They now plan to do the rest of the 35 cancer types they cover in the same way. At a later stage I hope we can add more on global figures and patterns, but this is a welcome start I think. I'm thinking a standard edit summary with a reference to a version of this explanation on the CRUK project page will be enough, without a talk page section each time. Do people agree with this? The figures will be sourced &amp; referenced to the CRUK CancerStats sub-site, which they write.  I expect most of you will be familiar with my pitch that for the UK stats these are the best source for us to use, as the figures published by the various official stats bodies are mostly in forms designed for professionals, so I won't repeat that.  What is great is that they are keen to incorporate this into their standard updating procedures, so after I am gone from CRUK new figures will be updated on Wikipedia.  ser:Wiki CRUK John|Wiki CRUK John (ser talk:Wiki CRUK John|talk) 12:44, 14 October 2014 (UTC)

utdentI don't feel we should limit ourselves to English-speaking countries, seeing as it would be a major disservice to our readers from other countries, (of which we have very many). My fear is we could end up with list-type entries of all available statistics (even if we are far from that today), and I think we need to take the notability of a statistic into account. What I mean is that there is nothing inherently more notable about US-numbers as opposed to say Chinese statistics. Arguably the same holds when you compare US vs. Canada, with the only caveat being the difference in number of citizens. To many, US-state statistics are relevant, and Texas, Florida or California statistics cover more people than Canadian or even UK ones do.

So where do we draw the line? For a similar problem concerning regulation: lectronic cigarette was split into a daughter article egal status of electronic cigarettes (more list-type). The main article mentions: US FDA regulation, EU regulation and Western Australia regulation, while the list article goes into much more depth with individual countries and US states. US, EU and Western Australia is hardly balanced, and maybe there is need to chisel out which statistics/regulations etc. are notably mentioned in the main article. ikipedia:WORLDVIEW gives little info on how to solve these issues, and maybe this is something for P:MEDMOS? -- ser:CFCF|CFCF ser talk:CFCF|üçå (pecial:EmailUser/CFCF|email) 07:53, 15 October 2014 (UTC)
I agree we don't want a long list, and US &amp; UK are mostly broadly similar (as rates). On the other hand they are very high quality and of of interest to lots of readers. We could look at Euro figures too, and Canada and Australia where they are different from other English-speaking countries.¬£ (see below) The WHO has Asian figures, which are often considerably different, but I think raw numbers here won't convey too much, nor perhaps % of global cases/deaths. We'd need rates.  Likewise Africa, though I think the figures there have more issues. I suggest we work up one or two cancer article sections as models. Maybe lung and esophagus, which both vary a good deal around the world? Ideally we want to concentrate on what broad rate differences reveal about the causes and different patterns of treatment, but of course this involves a good deal more work. And we should have more on age and gender incidence in many cases. ser:Wiki CRUK John|Wiki CRUK John/ ser:Johnbod|Johnbod (ser talk:Johnbod|talk) 09:30, 15 October 2014 (UTC)

Agree with just about everybody (I think) that we should be aiming at a worldwide perspective, though as WAID points out anything decently reliable is better than nothing. Certainly, if our information on the alaria#Epidemiology|distribution of malaria, say, were restricted to large, non-(sub)tropical English-speaking countries, then that would indeed be a concern... More generally, it's normal for the distribution of just about any disease to vary by geography, as well as age, gender, socioeconomic factors etc. It's also true that the common availability of official statistics for certain developed countries, including the USA, UK, etc, makes it tempting to give them extra weight. Ideally, I think it would be good to see members of organizations such as (and hopefully not limited to) CRUK using their expertise to help build a well-balanced global perspective, rather than focusing specifically on (for example) UK statistics. But I recognize that this is by no means straightforward, as organically conceived contributions require an ongoing familiarity with WP processes and etiquette that takes time (and regularity) to accrue. Fwiw, I'm happy to collaborate with CRUK and other editors on developing sophageal cancer#Epidemiology, per |Wiki CRUK John|John's suggestion above (though I won't be around much in the next few days). I've had useful tip off that an ideal source (I believe) on the subject is due to be published tomorrow, so that should help considerably.

 RE &quot;...what broad rate differences reveal about the causes and different patterns of treatment&quot;: MEDMOS of course foresees a &quot;Causes&quot; section which implicitly covers that I think.

Agree. Unfortunately this is one of Wikipedia's P:systemic biases. This includes articles about training pathways for specialists, costs to the US health system, random healthcare statistics from the US health system, drug names from the US, epidemiological figures from the US, and so on and so on. I would fully support a move towards national-level statistics. The issue then becomes what statistics - there are so many countries. One way to divide this up would be by population, extremes (ie countries with good/bad states of care), or by English-speaking countries (likely to be the majority of our readers), or a combination. This is similar to a problem we face in P:ANATOMY where the &quot;Society and culture&quot; sections of articles are usually hollowed out and do not make any reference to the rich histories or knowledge of anatomical structures in rabic medicine, yurvedic medicine and raditional Chinese Medicine, not to mention other cultures and ethnic traditions. --ser:LT910001|Tom (LT) (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 00:32, 16 October 2014 (UTC)

Agreed, I think it's premature to call the US cases an &quot;outbreak&quot;. The West Africa cases are considered an outbreak by the CDC as seen here (http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/outbreaks/2014-west-africa/distribution-map.html#areas), but use of the word outbreak might really cause feelings of panic in those who read that language.

Agree. Given that the two locally transmitted cases (i.e. other than the index case) were not in the general population, but rather health care workers inside the index case's isolation, calling it an outbreak would really be straining the term beyond the breaking point.

It is not sensational and we are using the WHO definition on the other articles, as Gandy and Ozzie point out. The expected number in America is zero as Whatamidoing notes. We've now got 3. There are 76 healthcare workers who had contact with Thomas Duncan who are currently being monitored. The CDC expects more cases. The virus is not endemic in America nor is the suspected natural reservoir, fruit bats, in America. In addition, this page has been moved numerous times to the point that when it was moved by another editor this last time, I asked an admin to protect the page from further moves. It's too disruptive. An editor on the talk page right is saying move it now, and we'll move it again when he's satisfied it's an outbreak. That's the problem. This is exactly why I asked the admin to protect the page. It can't be done on whim. Also, keep in mind the American officials are trying to prevent any panic, but there might also be political motives, as they are always present in any event that disrupts commerce and business as usual.

LOL. An outbreak would be scary and it's not politically correct to be scared of Ebola in the US. Yet.  This reminds me of the discussion we had on ukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster about the wisdom of calling some accident a &quot;disaster&quot; on Wikipedia, even if nobody had been actually killed, and it wasn't at all clear if anybody would ever be killed. How much a disaster can that be, considering all the man-made disasters there are? It was certainly a public relations disaster for nuclear power, but that was about it. Compare with the worst coal mine accident that killed over 1500 people and is not graced with the word &quot;disaster&quot; on Wikipedia: enxihu Colliery. It turns out, after some research, that natural disasters (like the 011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami itself) are not called disasters in specific on Wikipedia. Just because. While man-made accidents are called &quot;disasters&quot; on Wikipedia sometimes and other times not. With no particular rhyme or reason [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster/Archive_20#Use_of_the_word_.22disaster.22_in_titles_of_articles_about_disasters], and it varies greatly by category, and nowhere are the worst things called &quot;disasters&quot; more than the others. But I was told to just follow what the press called it. We don't worry about stirring up fear, since we follow the press and the press certainly doesn't worry about that.  For example, consider Islamic-extremist terrorism. Clearly we fear THAT a lot more than aging and disease, since we've spent $1 trillion on wars since 2001 vs. $300 billion for all government biomedical research in that time. But this use of money is not a disaster because the press doesn't feel it is. In any case, if this unfortunate Ebola emergence or outbreak (inability to deal with which, has been at least partly to cuts in biomedical research in the last 11 years while we dropped bombs on Iraqis) ever should become a &quot;plague&quot; according to the press, we'll be sure and let you all know. So that we can change the name here on Wikipedia, like the good mirrors of official public sentiment and nomenclature that we all are.  At least we know that no Ebola outbreak and failure to contain it, will ever be a &quot;disaster.&quot;  Not on Wikipedia.ser:Sbharris|Sser:Sbharris|Bser:Sbharris|Hser:Sbharris|arris 03:09, 16 October 2014 (UTC)
According to this definition from UCLA (http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/bioter/anthapha_def_a.html), the term epidemic could be used though that obviously carries similar fear-inspiring connotations. Are those fears justified? Probably a matter of debate, but in terms of meeting the criteria, it appears that the cases in the United States meet the definition of an epidemic. &quot; A single case of a communicable disease long absent from a population or the first invasion by a disease not previously recognized in that area requires immediate reporting and epidemiologic investigation; two cases of such a disease associated in time and place are sufficient evidence of transmission to be considered an epidemic.&quot; (partial quote). The Manitoba government's definition of outbreak (seen here: http://www.gov.mb.ca/health/publichealth/cdc/protocol/investigation.pdf) also seems appropriate for the U.S. cases. Therefore, I will revise my stance on this question and say that outbreak or epidemic are both acceptable from a definition standpoint regardless of the &quot;political correctness&quot; or the fear that these words will likely instill in readers.  ser:TylerDurden8823|TylerDurden8823 (ser talk:TylerDurden8823|talk) 09:02, 16 October 2014 (UTC)

 Cross-wiki infoboxes 

Category:Templates using data from Wikidata has some templates that we (meaning people more technically adept than I) might want to look over.  It should, in theory, be possible to use this to automagically fill in a parameter (e.g., an ICD code) based on Wikidata if the parameter isn't specified in the article itself.

The documentation is at ikipedia:Wikidata#Infoboxes (Phase 2), and it's not completely up to date.  I believe that if we figured out how to do this, and then ported the changes to the other Wikipedias, then this would work everywhere, which might be very convenient for translators.  I may be wrong, of course, but I believe that it might make it possible to type just nfobox disease at the top of the page, and have the entire infobox filled in, without needing to have a dozen lines of confusing, case-sensitive code at the start of every lead.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:58, 8 October 2014 (UTC)
|WhatamIdoing Yes, what you say is correct, and this is already done in some places.

 Sounds like a great idea, especially for things like the ongoing translation project this would probably be of great value. I am however a bit concerned with editing those data; if you look at the cross-language interwiki links, it has already become incredibly hard to do anything other than adding one language link (which can still be done with the wikipedia interface, anything more takes you to wikidata and beware if two different wikidata items exist linking to the same topic in different languages, things start getting ugly very quickly then). It would be nice if wikidata's interface could be improved a bit before this. Alternatively (but less optimally), the locally specified values could overrule wikidata values, so if you put in an infobox it would take all data from wikidata but you could still enter different data in the article itself. --ser:Wouterstomp|WS (ser talk:Wouterstomp|talk) 20:06, 13 October 2014 (UTC)
 |Wouterstomp To start I think the hope is to minimize need for anyone to localize data. Propagating things like links to WHO pages would be a good start. Numerical data which is widely accepted is another option. I do not think Wikidata's interface will be improved without a trial of this, and a trial of this is not going to be easy until Wikidata's interface is improved. This is why we have halted. I would love for someone to apply for a grant at the meta:Grants:IdeaLab space to get the resources necessary to prototype a model for this so that discussion and development can continue. The project will only be messy and problematic in the beginning. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 13:41, 14 October 2014 (UTC)
I think we pretty much need one or two advance scouts to go figure it out and report back, so we'll have a clearer idea of what to do.  ICD numbers seem like a good place to start, since they're the same all over the world, or maybe OMIMs would be good.  
ing|Scottalter, do you think you could figure out how to adapt the infobox to read something from Wikidata (only if the item were blank in the article)?  The en.wp template side of the matter seems more accessible to me than the Wikidata side.  If someone else could figure out how to get the Wikidata record fixed (just for one article; I'll suggest the incredibly low-traffic DDD as a target), then we could try a test run to see if it works.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 21:36, 14 October 2014 (UTC)
Thanks for the challenge. I think I've figured it out. The DDD article now has its infobox data at ikidata:Q17148148 and the article uses emplate:Infobox disease/sandbox. The sandbox infobox just draws the data right from Wikidata and ignores any parameters passed to the template from the article itself. But another if statement could be added for each variable to use existing data piped to the template if the Wikidata does not exist, or vice-versa. (Which data should take priority - info from Wikidata, or info in the local Wikipedia passed directly to the template?) Also, if any of you guys are admins, any chance I could get the template editor right? emplate:Infobox disease is protected to that level. Thanks. --ser:Scottalter|Scott Alter (ser talk:Scottalter|talk) 07:21, 15 October 2014 (UTC)
 A while ago I wrote a module, odule:Wikidata, that I intended to be usable for getting data from Wikidata into infoboxes. It takes a parameter which can be either a locally provided value or &quot;FETCH_WIKIDATA&quot; - in the former case it just returns the parameter (even if it's &quot;&quot;); in the latter case it returns the data from Wikidata or nothing if the data does not exist. If it is invoked from within a template using e.g. | data1 = invoke:Wikidata |getRawValue |p494 |ICD-10|FETCH_WIKIDATA} , then having a local parameter called 'ICD-10' in the infobox takes precedence; otherwise it attempts to fetch the data from Wikidata. You may be able to understand from the module documentation how you can use it, or examine some working examples at l|infobox person/Wikidata or l|infobox video game series/Wikidata. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 10:11, 15 October 2014 (UTC)
That looks great, Scott.  A one-line, zero-parameter template adds everything.
I like the idea of being able to override it locally whenever we want, so I'd be happy to see you and RexxS work out how to do that.
Also, would the next admin passing by please grant that request for templateeditor rights?  Scott has been one of the primary maintainers of l|WPMED for years.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 23:42, 15 October 2014 (UTC)
RexxS, do you know how CPU intensive the module is? Another possible use of your module is to have a second function like &quot;FETCH_WIKIDATA,&quot; but called &quot;FETCH_KEY&quot; that gets the language-specific name of the field. That way, the language-specific field names can be pulled from Wikidata, and then only 1 infobox code is needed for every language Wikipedia. This could be useful, but I am not familiar with how to write modules to access Wikidata, and it would take me a long time to try and reverse engineer all of your code.
The other options regarding combining Wikidata and explicitly mentioned parameters are: 1) to include an if statement for each parameter in the template, or 2) maybe simply ICD-10|property:P494} would do the job. The complexity of data display comes with how to parse the data for linking, rather than how to get the data. Since the data is just stored as one string, it needs to be cut up using string functions to format it properly for templates like l|ICD10. (Unless we change how those templates work, which I would be fully supportive of. CD10|Q|87|8 seems excessive, when CD10|Q87.8 could do the same job.) --ser:Scottalter|Scott Alter (ser talk:Scottalter|talk) 07:20, 16 October 2014 (UTC)

 PubMed reference template generator makes reference at the bottom repeat ‚Äì DOI generator does not ‚Äì recommendations? PubMed ID recommended over DOI? 

I just finished watching the ‚ÄúWelcome to Wikipedia and Wikiproject Medicine‚Äù introduction video, and it mentions PubMed as a good choice.

If I were to use a paper, and it has a PubMed ID, should I use that to generate a template over using a DOI generator?

The following tool allows you to input a PubMed ID:

|Roxy the dog |Dominus Vobisdu I agree with you both that efficacy of treatments without backing from MEDRS literature ought not be implied. In this case, I think the intent is to explain history and culture rather than make a medical claim, and if that is not apparent then I wish it could be made so. There are a lot of texts on the concept of &quot;history of medicine&quot;, and if I understand Dominus, it seems that one position could be to say that the history of medicine starts about 100 years ago with the advent of evidence-based medicine. I do not think that view can be reconciled with the more common view that medicine's history goes back much further. Are you able to propose some way for these Sanskrit words to be tied to some modern concept? Every culture has child health practices before modern medicine, and tying those to pediatrics seems not unreasonable especially since Wikipedia's precedent is to allow articles like ediatrics to say that quacks like alen, ippocrates, and ristotle are part of the history of medicine. Do you have any suggestions for how Wikipedia can reconcile its current practice to allow modern health articles to link out to Western historical figures when you are uncomfortable allowing articles on non-Western medicine to even link in to modern health concepts? ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 12:26, 16 October 2014 (UTC)

There is no need to translate the terms at all, as a brief definition is given with each. In any case, translating them using the names of modern evidence-based medical fields is beyond the pale.

Bluerasberry's right:  while at the time these figures were mainstream, their beliefs would now be deeply &quot;alternative&quot;.  This may not be obvious to people who don't know much about them, or who are more inclined to focus on their general lasting values instead of their many wrong and harmful ideas.  Galen pushed heriac as a panacea.  Our article on ulse diagnosis unaccountably fails to mention Galen, although his diagnostic methods included both feeling the pulse and ream interpretation.  Hippoocrates thought that arteries were filled with neuma|air that maintained ital heat.  They also believed in umorism.  None of that sounds too different from the ideas believed by some altmed folks I've encountered (Are you not feeling well?  You must need to balance your chakras), except that no Western altmed person is likely to tell you that women were biologically too deficient in vital heat to be as smart as men‚Äîbut Aristotle did, and his declaration was one of the &quot;logical&quot; reasons for suppressing women's rights for centuries.  
Saying they're not quacks (by modern standards) is a bit like lionizing Darwin for getting natural selection right, without taking a moment to laugh at his claim that the giraffe had such a long neck because successive generations had stretched higher, or that the blacksmith's son had large muscles because the results of his father's daily exercise were inherited. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 22:33, 16 October 2014 (UTC)

My point on stating that Galen, Hippocrates, and Aristotle were not complete medical quacks (the word complete being the keyword) is that they did a lot of good for medicine as well; their legacies are clear on that. There was good mixed in with the bad. ser:Flyer22|Flyer22 (ser talk:Flyer22|talk) 22:47, 16 October 2014 (UTC)

Also, in the case of Galen, if dissection of human adavers hadn't been outlawed, and he didn't have to therefore resort to dissections of primates and pigs to better understand human anatomy, I'm guessing he would have been right about a lot more things relating to human anatomy [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Galen&amp;diff=629552893&amp;oldid=629552889#Contributions_to_medicine than he already was right about by just dissecting those animals].

utdentI feel we are losing some of our focus here. No matter what crack-pot theories Galen, Aristotle, Hippocrates etc. had, they were responsible for major developments in medicine, and are generally considered very influential. That being said, there are numerous influential sources in India and China and other countries that deserve mention.

What needs to be done is to hold a high standard, and to avoid using low quality sources, preferably using P:MEDRS. Ayurvedic journals are poor sources, as are the encyclopedias of Indian medicine above. Just because something is PubMed indexed or in a book doesn't make it a reliable source, neither by P:RS or P:MEDRS standards. daptogen previously held numerous references to a book called &quot;The Tao of Medicine&quot; which I deleted. You have to take a number of things in account, looking at the publisher, the intended audience, etc. etc. and MEDRS is an excellent guide on how to do this.

That said, the major reason I suggest we stick to MEDRS is because it simplifies these arguments, and most of it holds true when it comes citing facts relating to anything on the history of medicine. When we say modern medicine has evolved from ayurveda we are given ayurveda legitimacy it does not deserve, when all that can really be said by reliable sources is that ayurveda preceded modern medicine. -- ser:CFCF|CFCF ser talk:CFCF|üçå (pecial:EmailUser/CFCF|email) 06:48, 17 October 2014 (UTC)

Such claims cannot be actually found in other reliable sources(including non MEDRS) either.

As has been discussed what is needed are translations for  these Ayurvedic terms. . Nor do translations need to be MEDRS compliant. Why would a scientist research translation or linguistics or etymology. Whether we call Ayurveda clap trap or not is not the issue here. WP is full of articles that are about clap trap. What is necessary is that this ancient system is understood and since the terms are Sanskrit, modern day readers need to understand the terms and  what these physicians thought/think they were/ are doing. We aren't judging, a NPOV position, we are simply providing information.

I agree with Littleolive oil.  Our job is to describe the subject to readers.  &quot;It's shalya tantra&quot; does not describe the subject to English speakers.  &quot;One branch, called shalya tantra, dealt with urgery&quot; describes the subject.  Only an idiot would assume that ancient surgery (Indian or otherwise) looked anything like modern surgery.  We do not have a policy of assuming that readers are idiots.  P:NOTCENSORED isn't just about pictures in sex articles; it's also about not hiding verifiable facts just because some idiot might read them and might come to the conclusion that ancient Ayuvedic surgery for, say, cancer worked just like modern oncosurgery, instead of being only slightly less horrifying than the Western version of the same surgery at the same time (less horrifying because Indian surgeons made better use of opiates). 
And if you really can't stomach calling the ancient practice of slicing people open with sharp implements for curative purposes &quot;surgery&quot;, then you'll have to argue for removing the many similar links from ncient Greek medicine and other istory of medicine articles.    ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 23:35, 17 October 2014 (UTC)

 Scientology sources used as a source in pages: 

I've found a few pages, including the sychology page itself using itizens Commission on Human Rights websites as a source. I've removed them and have done a crude search on Google for other pages on Wikipedia that use them. I've removed the ones on the English language Wikipedia, but there's a few in other languages that do.

The pages were:
* sychology
* ebMD
* ational Alliance on Mental Illness

Please add them to your watchlist if possible. 

I believe the CCHI sources were added in good faith by editors who were unaware of the affiliation of the group, and do not represent any kind of concerted effort by Scientologists to get their material on there. --ser:Harizotoh9|Harizotoh9 (ser talk:Harizotoh9|talk) 13:23, 17 October 2014 (UTC)

 Lists of ebola patients and articles on individual ebola patients 

I am finding articles like ist of Ebola patients and like this ikipedia:Healthcare workers contracting ebola (I know, wrong space -  i have asked its creator to move it).  But i am more concerned with the desire to create articles on these individuals and list their names in WP. I am aware of 3 AfDs (I started one of them): ikipedia:Articles for deletion/William Pooley (Ebola patient) and ikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ruth Atkins (UK nurse) and  ikipedia:Articles for deletion/Thomas Eric Duncan.  What do you all think of these lists and the individual articles. In my mind the individual articles generally violate P:BLP1E and listing their names is a pretty ugly invasion of medical privacy.  I am tempted to start deletion discussions on the lot of them, for any who are notable only for getting sick, but before I launch on that, wanted to check my head. thanks  ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 07:33, 18 October 2014 (UTC)
I agree that these articles are BLP1E and privacy does matter, in addition I can't help feeling that there is an element of racism in singling out a few individual first world victims while thousands of West African victims remain just nameless numbers - but that is a problem of the [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/08/ebola-illustration-andre-carrilho_n_5955192.html systemic bias of the Western media] -- ser:Dodger67|Roger (Dodger67) (ser talk:Dodger67|talk) 07:57, 18 October 2014 (UTC)

I can't get very worked up about these. In ist of Ebola patients, only one (Pooley) is still alive, and he has been doing extensive media interviews this week, with one quoted in the article. The bravery of many of the medical dead deserves memorializing I think, and BLP issues only apply to the living. The Western cases have received massive media coverage, &amp; imo short bios, probably best as sections in a list-type article, are appropriate. Each case has raised legitimate issues about local healthcare. ser:Johnbod|Johnbod (ser talk:Johnbod|talk) 14:07, 18 October 2014 (UTC)
I don't think that these individual people qualify for separate articles.  I think that Dodger is probably right about the systemic bias:  we cover mostly what's in English-language sources, and they cover what their (mostly white, mostly non-African) audiences will pay for.  But these are BLP1Es as far as I'm concerned.  IMO the best way to handle it is probably to replace them with full-protected redirects to a list.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 15:42, 18 October 2014 (UTC)
There are numerous English newspapers, broadcasters and news websites in West Africa. I blame Google for never including them when one uses their &quot;News&quot; search filter. Even the largest solidly mainstream news sources in South Africa are excluded from Google searches whenever one selects the &quot;News&quot;  option. Yet they take special care to include every single inconsequential Nowhereville community blog as long as it's in North America or Europe. ser:Dodger67|Roger (Dodger67) (ser talk:Dodger67|talk) 16:37, 18 October 2014 (UTC)

 ikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Non-melancholic depression 

Hello again, medical experts.  Here's another old AfC draft which may be of interest.  Is this a notable topic? ‚Äîser:Anne Delong|Anne Delong (ser talk:Anne Delong|talk) 19:57, 10 October 2014 (UTC)
Sort of but not really as put across here as it is somewhat misleading. It will already be covered in ajor depressive disorder. I'd not use it. ser:Casliber|Cas Liber (ser talk:Casliber|talk ¬∑ pecial:Contributions/Casliber|contribs) 20:30, 10 October 2014 (UTC)
Should that term redirect to typical depression?  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 22:41, 10 October 2014 (UTC)
Tempting...but I always took non-melancholic to be broader than atypical depression. The latter predates adjustment disorder with depressed mood really and harks back to days of endogenous vs reactive depression. ser:Casliber|Cas Liber (ser talk:Casliber|talk ¬∑ pecial:Contributions/Casliber|contribs) 00:03, 11 October 2014 (UTC)
The lead of atypical depression should probably be revised to reflect the distinction. ser:Seppi333|Seppi333¬†(ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert¬†2¬¢¬†|¬†pecial:WhatLinksHere/User:Seppi333/Maintenance|Maintained) 01:06, 11 October 2014 (UTC)
|Casliber,ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing, |Seppi333, there is already elancholic depression. is this the opposite? Neither ajor depressive disorder nor typical depression mention &quot;Non-melancholic depression&quot;, so, for a reader, redirecting the term to one of these articles would be misleading, because that would indicate that it was a synonym.  If this is a legitimate medical terrm, and if it's a type of ajor depressive disorder, can that article be expanded with a short paragraph describing it?  Then the draft can be turned into a redirect to the main article.  Alternatively, if the topic is notable, but the article just has misleading information, maybe it could be stubbed, leaving a paragraph explaining (with a wikilink) that  it's a kind of Major depressive disorder, which, I presume, doesn't include melancholic symptoms, and let the reader then follow the link to find out more about MDD. The second option seems better to me, because it would make it easier for someone to add sourced content in the future. ‚Äîser:Anne Delong|Anne Delong (ser talk:Anne Delong|talk) 13:54, 15 October 2014 (UTC)
What I was referring to was the 2nd sentence in the lead of typical depression, &quot;In contrast, people with melancholic depression generally do not experience an improved mood in response to normally pleasurable events.&quot; The fact a distinction is made with melancholic depression only makes it seem that this is &quot;non-melancholic&quot; depression. ser:Seppi333|Seppi333¬†(ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert¬†2¬¢¬†|¬†pecial:WhatLinksHere/User:Seppi333/Maintenance|Maintained) 14:01, 15 October 2014 (UTC)

Anne, my impression is that this was a legitimate medical term, but that it's been superseded since then.  
What made me think of atypical depression was the description that it's the most common kind.  It's always amused me that the most common kind of depression has been called atypical, because (by definition) the most common type ought to be called typical.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 20:24, 15 October 2014 (UTC)
There are 269 papers on google scholar since 2010 - mainly from Gordon Parker and colleagues, who promote the distinction with melancholic depression. I think it probably warrants a stub maybe. ser:Casliber|Cas Liber (ser talk:Casliber|talk ¬∑ pecial:Contributions/Casliber|contribs) 03:42, 16 October 2014 (UTC)
I have postponed its deletion so it won't disappear before something can be done with it.  It's longer than a stub now, but I guess if there's an overlap with Atypical depression some of the detail can be omitted and a link added to that page. Perhaps someone who understands this could do that, and then the draft can be moved to mainspace. ‚Äîser:Anne Delong|Anne Delong (ser talk:Anne Delong|talk) 03:49, 19 October 2014 (UTC)

I believe that the more usual outcome is that someone starts a broad list, like ist of physicians, so that most articles can be &quot;de-orphaned&quot; without needing to find a meaningful way to P:Build the web to some borderline-notable person.

Also, I have sometimes seen in AT:O a consecutively listed series of closely related medical articles, for example, a series of articles about enzymes.

 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine merge 

atnote|aka DMA
I have virtually no interest in this article/topic, but given that it has very high traffic, has crappy references (e.g., lots of erowid-type refs), and I'm probably the most familiar medical editor with the article topic, I figured I'd un-crappify the article.  That said, I plan to merge ffects of MDMA on the human body (or, probably delete most of it, since it also has very crappy references and is largely a duplicate of MDMA) with DMA.  

Does anyone have any objections before I go ahead with this merge?

I plan to use MID|18973636 (a paywalled review that covers amph, meth, and mdma individually) and [http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search2/r?dbs+hsdb:@term+@rn+@rel+42542-10-9 this HSDB-TOXNET MDMA entry] to add/edit/source content to the adverse effects and overdose sections of MDMA following this merge.  There's a lot of subsections in MDMA that I plan to prune or merge with other sections in order to reduce redundancy as well, so it will probably be about as long as it is now if I go through with merging the articles and copyediting the MDMA article. ser:Seppi333|Seppi333¬†(ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert¬†2¬¢¬†|¬†pecial:WhatLinksHere/User:Seppi333/Maintenance|Maintained) 02:43, 16 October 2014 (UTC)

The phrasing &quot;these are their ugly babies&quot; gave me such a giggle, Wiki CRUK John. Thanks for that.

Hmm perhaps. Although the swallow looks at the upper GI while the enema looks at the lower ser:Cannolis|Cannolis (ser talk:Cannolis|talk) 02:26, 10 October 2014 (UTC)
Yes, that and the route of application of the contrast medium are the major differences between the enema and the swallow. Medical uses, indications, contraindications, adverse effects, mechanism, interpretation, accuracy and specificity are largely similar and in most cases identical for all. A sub-section on each under the heading &quot;Types of Barium contrast imaging&quot; should high light the differences. The terms Barium swallow, meal, and follow through are used somewhat ambiguously or interchangeably in the literature, but most authors use the term swallow for studies of the pharynx, larynx and esophagus,(and sometimes stomach) while the terms meal and follow through are most frequently used for examinations of the stomach and small intestine. ser:Ochiwar|Ochiwar (ser talk:Ochiwar|talk) 04:04, 10 October 2014 (UTC)

|Ochiwar These are different studies used for different indications. I am unsure if a merger is definitely the way to go. A &quot;barium swallow&quot; looks at the swallowing mechanism in real time and may identify problems with the oesophagus. A &quot;barium meal&quot; is a longer contrast investigation under fluoroscopy that has effectively been replaced by the upper GI endoscopy. A follow-through study is generally used to look for abnormalities in the small bowel and requires a number of fluoroscopic exposures to identify strictures and fistulae.
The &quot;barium enema&quot; studies examine the large bowel, and could be merged into one. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW¬†|¬†ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 19:29, 12 October 2014 (UTC)
|Jfdwolff, I am also unsure if a merger is definitely the way to go, that is why I am mentioning it here for discussion. I am aware that swallow, meal, follow through and enema examine different areas of the anatomy. After having gone through the available literature it also appears that the terms are often used ambiguously (at least as far as the first 3 are concerned) which complicates the issue. When you say fluoroscopy has been largely replaced by endoscopy, you are certainly right if you are considering only the part of the world you live in but in many other parts of the world this may not apply yet. While I am not sure of the definitive way to go, I had hoped to be able to combine all these terms and terminologies, similarities and differences in one single well referenced article leaving redirects, because at the end of the day there are more similarities than differences between these procedures. And as you have pointed out, they are being replaced by more advanced technologies as we speak. I have started a draft along this line of thinking (I have not gone very far yet) in ser:Ochiwar/sandbox|my sandox and would appreciate if you could take a brief look at it. Let me know please if you think a merger along these lines is useful to the encyclopedia or rather not. I would not want to be wasting my time. In any case I feel the present state of the named articles is not up to encyclopedia standard and updating each one individually would entail unnecessary duplication. I will put my draft on hold until I get some feedback and face other projects. ser:Ochiwar|Ochiwar (ser talk:Ochiwar|talk) 20:23, 12 October 2014 (UTC)

|Ochiwar I agree that I was exhibiting systemic bias by presuming that some barium studies are now almost obsolete. You are also correct that the terminology is confused - in the UK the studies called &quot;barium swallow&quot; and &quot;barium meal&quot; are typically combined, although &quot;meal&quot; is also used for small bowel follow-through. As such I am willing to support a merge of all the &quot;proximal&quot; studies, but I would leave the large bowel studies separate. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW¬†|¬†ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 21:43, 12 October 2014 (UTC)

Simple English
The question of the type of English we should use in the lead has arisen again on the Ebola article.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Ebola_virus_disease#Basic_English] My position is we should use simple English wikilinked to the technical term.

Other options are using the technical terms followed by the simple description but that can clutter the lead.

 My preference is to always give the simplest commonly used terms with the medical jargon in parentheses - either then may be wikilinked. The point of showing the medical term is that it helps the reader familiarise themselves with the jargon, so that they understand if they encounter the term later in the article (and we often need to use the exact term in the subsections for reasons of accuracy). We should never rely on wikilinks to explain a word; it can be very disruptive to the reader if they have to follow a link then find their place again in the main article, just to make sense of that article. This is sometimes compounded by having to follow another link in the linked article because it doesn't explain its jargon either. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 02:48, 20 October 2014 (UTC)

I agree with James here, and think we should avoid using terminology for terminology's sake. There is a whole lot of jargon out there that doesn't fill any purpose, and it needs to be a matter of judgement where to use medical terminology and where not to.

 Amazing multilingual AIDS advertisements 

ellcome Trust is a UK-based charity which promotes health research. In February 2014 they were kind to host ikipedia:WikiProject Medicine/Wellcome Library Editathon 2014|an editathon and over the past 1-2 years |Fae has been working with them on their [http://wellcomeimages.org/ Wellcome Images] project, which is an effort to make some health-related media archives more available. Wellcome wanted the media they collected to be available under Wikimedia-compatible licenses. There were some questions about that and I trust Fae when he tells me that Wellcome was more diligent than most in sorting their rights to share these images, and that their images are appropriate for sharing on Wikimedia Commons.

Wellcome shared about 300 GB of health images. [https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=67477 Sharing this much content was complicated]. These files should be sorted somehow, and perhaps someone in WikiProject Medicine would like to comment on what should become of this donation. I cannot say what should happen with them. Not all of this is uploaded to Commons yet.

All of the images from this donation are in Commons:Category:Files from Wellcome Images. Files which need categorization are in Commons:Category:Files from Wellcome Images (categorization needed). If anyone wants to help, browsing that category and adding more categories to interesting pictures would make it easier for others to find and use those pictures. I am interested in Commons:Category:AIDS posters, which is a collection of AIDS public health advertisements in many languages. Many of these posters have never been publicly available otherwise, so this is a unique opportunity to add images to Wikipedia articles on a popular health topic in many languages. 

This collection of AIDS posters is probably going to be featured in a post on the WMF blog.

 Extracting PMIDs

I am guessing, but I believe Jake wants the actual PMIDs since there are excellent programming [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25500/ tools] for extracting bibliographic data including URLs from PubMed if one has a PMID or PMCID. I am also guessing Jake wants to calculate mpact factors based on how many times a paper has been cited in Wikipedia. ikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval/JL-Bot 7|JL-Bot creates statistics for ikipedia:WikiProject Academic Journals/Journals cited by Wikipedia/Popular1|how many times each journal is cited as a Wikipedia source.  Perhaps that bot could be extended to extract PMIDs so that a list of the most cited papers in addition to the most cited journals could be obtained. For efficiency, the bot works on a ikipedia:Database download|dump of Wikipedia rather than interactively parsing one article at a time which would take forever and puts a lot of strain on the wikipedia.org servers. ser:Boghog|Boghog (ser talk:Boghog|talk) 08:37, 21 October 2014 (UTC)

As WhatamIdoing alluded to, PubMed indexed articles that are used as refs on WP but the PMID or PMCID is not given would be excluded. There are some bots running around adding those parameters, but in my experience, there are many refs to articles that are in PubMed that don't give the PMID or PMCID. - - ser:MrBill3|MrBill3 (ser talk:MrBill3|talk) 09:49, 21 October 2014 (UTC)
True, but at least within the scope of P:MED, there is a ikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources_(medicine)#Searching_for_sources|strong bias to use citations that include PMIDs.  The advantage of using PMIDs is consistency and ease of obtaining related bibliographic information.  For completeness, for citations that do not contain PMIDs, it would be good to extract DOIs.

I might consider doing that. The low lying fruit would be to add missing PMIDs/PMCIDs to l|cite journal templates that have DOIs. It may be possible to locate other PMIDs with the PubMed [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/batchcitmatch citation matching tool], but this method is not fool proof. ser:Boghog|Boghog (ser talk:Boghog|talk) 10:30, 21 October 2014 (UTC)

Yes, please, Boghog!
I'd also like to see non-templated citations have PMIDs and DOIs added at the end, just in plain text.  This would be easy to do for the ones that have the PubMed URL that already contains the PMID number.  The batchcitmatch tool looks interesting, but the work looks like it would be tedious, and we could be talking about tens of thousands of these.  If someone sets up a simple system for reviewing them (i.e., does this citation match what the tool thinks it matched?), I'd be willing to review a hundred of them.  I don't think I can realistically commit to more than that in the near future.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:35, 21 October 2014 (UTC)
Let me first do some tests on citations with PMIDs to see how accurate the citation matcher is. I am far more concerned about false positives than false negatives. Also it will be trivial to flag citations where citation matcher returns more than one possible match. If the citation matcher looks fairly accurate, then the process can be full automated.  Parsing of URLs for PMIDs and DOIs and adding them at the end as plain text should also be fairly easy. ser:Boghog|Boghog (ser talk:Boghog|talk) 06:35, 22 October 2014 (UTC)
I have actually already written a little Python script to parse through ref cites, extract PMIDs and then do a lookup using them against PubMed to get the article type, etc and dump the output in a nice formatted table.

The two sources above were removed from the article. The relevant part of MEDRS is ikipedia:Identifying reliable sources (medicine)#Medical and scientific organizations. Read under: &quot;The reliability of these sources range from formal scientific reports, which can be the equal of the best reviews published in medical journals, through public guides and service announcements...&quot;

Can we go [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electronic_cigarette&amp;oldid=630008124 back to the version before the original research was reverted back into the article]? Trying to remove original research from the article should be easy at the electronic cigarettes article if there were more collaborating.

&quot;While some raised concern that e-cigarette use can be a cause of indoor air pollution,[2] the only clinical study currently published evaluating passive vaping found no adverse effects.[37]&quot; Original research ans misleading text.

&quot;A 2014 review found that at the very least, this limited research demonstrates it is transparent that e-cigarette emissions are not simply &quot;harmless water vapor,&quot; as is commonly claimed, and can be a cause of indoor air pollution.[3] As of 2014, the only clinical study currently published evaluating the respiratory effects of passive vaping found no adverse effects were detected.[38] A 2014 review found it is safe to presume that their effects on bystanders are minimal in comparison to traditional cigarettes.[38]&quot; Sourced text and neutrally written text (that was blindly reverted). See lectronic cigarette#Second-hand aerosol.

I removed the original research and replaced it with sourced text. I clearly explained it in my [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electronic_cigarette&amp;diff=629958073&amp;oldid=629952953 edit summary] the problem with the article.  I removed the POV selected quotes. I expanded the safety section a bit. I replaced original research with sourced text for the second-hand aerosol section. Then another editor recently blindly reverted back in [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electronic_cigarette&amp;diff=630009762&amp;oldid=630008124 original research] and deleted sourced text. I think we should go back to [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electronic_cigarette&amp;oldid=630008124 here] before the blind revert was made. I hope editors at WikiProject Medicine here will help remove the original research from the electronic cigarettes page and help restore the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electronic_cigarette&amp;oldid=630008124 sourced text]. Another editor blindly reverted back in the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electronic_cigarette&amp;curid=11996885&amp;diff=630009762&amp;oldid=630008124 original research] and other problems. ser:QuackGuru|QuackGuru (ser talk:QuackGuru|talk) 18:14, 17 October 2014 (UTC)

First objection to QG's statement above: His statement 
&quot;back to the version before the original research was reverted back into the article&quot;
Should more accurately be read as:
Please go back to my preferred version, with all the changes i've made to the article, that have been reverted.
The latter would have been the correct description, while the former is unsubtle P:CANVAS|canvassing. --ser:KimDabelsteinPetersen|Kim D. Petersen 20:35, 17 October 2014 (UTC)
Second objection here: It seems like QuackGuru at the moment is cherry-picking every negative source that he can find, without actually putting them into context with real secondary review papers. The CDC material that he is quoting here, is handled within several review papers, that he chooses not to use. That would be a rather blatant breach of P:MEDRS's don't use primary sources to contradict secondary sources. In my eyes QG is using this forum to win an edit-war to keep his own version of reality, instead of working with other editors to find material that actually would gain consensus, and be supported by the P:WEIGHT of secondary sources. --ser:KimDabelsteinPetersen|Kim D. Petersen 20:43, 17 October 2014 (UTC)
Final note: The claim that another editor &quot;blindly&quot; reverted is incorrect, since that editor has taken part in every thread where QG's changes to the article have been discussed. And the OR version that he claims, is the original version of the article, before QG's edits. --ser:KimDabelsteinPetersen|Kim D. Petersen 20:49, 17 October 2014 (UTC)

The other discussion shows that there is P:CON that the ikipedia_talk:Identifying_reliable_sources_(medicine)#Medical_and_scientific_organizations including the CDC are generally reliable. ser:QuackGuru|QuackGuru (ser talk:QuackGuru|talk) 20:50, 17 October 2014 (UTC)
Translated as &quot;QuackGuru reads that discussion as a blanket OK to use all material on the CDC's website no matter what other sources say, or whether it is primary material (such as the weekly &quot;Notes from the Field&quot; is)&quot; - i would read the consensus differently as: &quot;Material that the CDC produces is generally of high-quality and can be used when the content and context is appropriate&quot;, which i agree with completely. I would be very surprised if any source is generally reliable for all material, and context. --ser:KimDabelsteinPetersen|Kim D. Petersen 20:56, 17 October 2014 (UTC)
I would assert that any source that states:
The data in the weekly MMWR are provisional, based on weekly reports to CDC by state health departments.--ser:KimDabelsteinPetersen|Kim D. Petersen 21:04, 17 October 2014 (UTC) 
Is a primary source, and should be used with caution, and certainly not to contradict or expand on secondary review papers. --ser:KimDabelsteinPetersen|Kim D. Petersen 21:05, 17 October 2014 (UTC)

Let me quote the authors guide[http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/author_guide.html] for the Weekly reports that QG wants to use:
D. Notes from the Field
Notes from the Field are abbreviated reports intended to advise MMWR readers of ongoing or recent events of concern to the public health community, without waiting for development of a Full Report. Events of concern include epidemics/outbreaks, unusual disease clusters, poisonings, exposures to disease or disease agents (including environmental and toxic), and notable public health-related case reports. These reports may contain early unconfirmed information, preliminary results, hypotheses regarding risk factors and exposures, and other similarly incomplete information. No definitive conclusions need be presented in Notes from the Field.
That to me reads almost the very definition of a primary source in P:MEDRS. If this can be used without caution, then i'm not sure why other sources are being rejected. --ser:KimDabelsteinPetersen|Kim D. Petersen 21:18, 17 October 2014 (UTC)
As detailed above by ser:KimDabelsteinPetersen|Kim D. Petersen and extensively debated [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Electronic_cigarette&amp;oldid=630035194#Possible_source on the Talk Page], there is no evidence that the MMWR &quot;notes&quot; meet the reliability criteria for MEDRS. Even if they did, we cannot possibly consider they hold enough P:WEIGHT to be used against multiple secondary sources.Otherwise, ser:QuackGuru has been engaged in a sustained pattern of P:TEND|disruptive editing on this article, as discussed on the talk page [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Electronic_cigarette&amp;oldid=630035194#Continued_disruptive_editing_contrary_to_Talk_page_consensus], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Electronic_cigarette&amp;oldid=630035194#Inappropriate_language], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Electronic_cigarette&amp;oldid=630035194#Marked_off_second-hand_aerosol_section_as_NPOV_suspect], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Electronic_cigarette&amp;oldid=630035194#Emissions_in_lede_info_being_removed], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Electronic_cigarette&amp;oldid=630035194#Exact_copying_from_sources], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Electronic_cigarette&amp;oldid=630035194#POV_problems_are_more_and_more_sneaking_in...._Again.21].

A little off the beaten track for the Medicine page, but would appreciate some eyes on DDT with regards to MEDRS sourcing and what I regard as some well-out-of-the-mainstream interpretations of the motivations for banning DDT in the U.S. ser:Formerly 98|Formerly 98 (ser talk:Formerly 98|talk) 16:00, 21 October 2014 (UTC)

Yes, thanks for looking.

No, I always hate it when people source potentially controversial statements to obscure books, but I guess its allowed. I guess I'm not sure what that particular passage is supposed to add to the article - I initially thought he was adding it to make the agency look silly, but it turned out he really believes that DDT is innocuous.  IF this is being added as a health related claim or to imply one, it falls under MEDRS, but I'm not sure I can make that case.

 New entry on ACTH for retinopathy of prematurity? 

I'd like to write a new entry on drenocorticotropic hormone|ACTH as a treatment for retrolental fibroplasia, later known as etinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Experimentation and later trials on ACTH for ROP in the 1950s (described in the middle of [http://www.nature.com/jp/journal/v22/n4/full/7210700a.html this source]) had a major impact on the development of neonatal evidence-based medicine. The associated RCT is sometimes described as the first RCT in neonatology. I think there is plenty of material to support its own entry. If this sounds like an okay idea, what would I title the article? ACTH for retrolental fibroplasia? ACTH for retinopathy of prematurity? ACTH retinopathy trial? Babies' Hospital ACTH trial?

I'm a little mixed on this.  Where &quot;women&quot; can be swapped with &quot;people&quot; without injury to the text (&quot;people with PCOS&quot;) I see no harm.  However, &quot;people with ovaries&quot; seems rather awkward, yet the proposed changes still haven't dealt with other text like &quot;daughters&quot; and &quot;female&quot; in the genetics section, which are then inconsistent.  Rather than going back and forth I think it may be preferable to take the bull by the horn and say, early on, that &quot;women&quot; refers to iological sex rather than ender.  Except... it's possible that this isn't always true; for example, it's possible that in an older general health survey the distinction between gender and sex wouldn't be considered.  Ratios like &quot;5-10% of women&quot; may not even technically be valid if the number of people diagnosed with PCOS is divided by the number of &quot;women&quot; listed by a national census, though of course with a range that approximate the error is insignificant.  Using a term taken from a source is never really wrong, but it might be improved on with an accurate explanation.  Ultimately my feeling is that changing the summary of that many sources all at once based on a global find-and-replace is hazardous, and the flow of the article is adversely affected. ser:Wnt|Wnt (ser talk:Wnt|talk) 15:28, 25 October 2014 (UTC)

Being thought of as neither male nor female is usually a hird gender or enderqueer matter.' The same applies to ransgender people (at least when you exclude genderqueer people from the category of transgender); they usually identify as male or female and/or as a man or a woman. 'I'm not aware of science having actually identified a third sex, though intersex people and ermaphroditic non-human animals are sometimes classified as a third sex (by being a combination of both)... ...but ender is a broader field and researchers have identified three or more genders (again, see the Third gender article).'&quot; For how we are generally supposed to treat anatomy and medical topics on Wikipedia when it comes sex/gender, see alk:Phimosis/Archive 2#Definition.  

As seen in that Phimosis discussion, I brought up the recent occasional push of people of giving P:Undue weight to intersex and transgender matters at anatomy and other medical topics.

We should use the language of the sources. We could switch to male and female rather than men and women if that would make a difference. People with ovaries is silly.

It should be easy to find both &quot;women&quot; and &quot;females&quot; in sources.
This comes up regularly.  Flyer's probably right in assuming that this is a question of intersex and transgender issues.  There's also the question of whether &quot;females&quot; or &quot;women&quot; would be better writing style or easier for English-language learners to understand.  This is something that MEDMOS should address directly.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 22:18, 25 October 2014 (UTC)

I see these issues come up only occasionally, but definitely more frequently as time goes on. And all of these aforementioned cases, including the ones noted in the previous WP:Med discussion, concern presenting inclusive wording for intersex, transgender and genderqueer people. This is despite the fact that, like I've stated above, the vast majority of intersex and transgender people (excluding the genderqueer categories) identify as male/man or as female/woman. ser:Flyer22|Flyer22 (ser talk:Flyer22|talk) 22:26, 25 October 2014 (UTC)

d fwiw, i looked at the edits and it is clearly about female to male transgender.  the other edit brought sources (not very good ones) but one of them was an interview with a doc at Mt Sinai in NYC who said he is gathering data for a study he intends to publish showing that fTm transgender have higher prevalence of the condition, probably due to testosterone treatments.   which is plausible/interesting but that is like a pre-primary source.  i searched pubmed and there are no secondary sources on the increased risk nor any primaries yet.  if there were i would be 100% in favor of figuring out better language.  as it stands, b/c we don't have good sources for the transgender issues for this condition, it is trickier - it is all about what editors prefer.  i would be in favor of language that is more inclusive. &quot;people with ovaries&quot; is sure clunky but it does the job. &quot;XX males&quot; is more compact but I think it is jargon.   and btw, flyer22, for somebody who is going through or has gone through sex reassignment treatment  - the gender identity would be clear, but to me, the sex would not be clear at all... ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 22:35, 25 October 2014 (UTC)

ser:Jytdog|Jytdog, I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;for somebody who is going through or has gone through sex reassignment treatment  - the gender identity would be clear, but to me, the sex would not be clear at all.&quot; The chromosomal makeup will not change, and the person is either going to assing (gender)|pass as that gender, not pass, or not pass well. As for wording, &quot;people with ovaries&quot; is jargon, in my opinion. My issue regarding these topics is what I have stated above -- we should be sicking to what the WP:Reliable sources state with WP:Due weight. In the aforementioned WP:Med discussion above, for example, I pointed to alk:Human penis/Archive 1#&quot;male humans&quot; should be changed to &quot;humans assigned male at birth&quot;; that was a WP:Due weight issue. I worked out a compromise wording for the lead in the case of that article, as seen in that discussion. But as for the rest of the uman penis article, we should not be stating &quot;people with penises&quot; throughout the article and avoiding the word &quot;man&quot; and/or &quot;male.&quot; If we are talking about anatomical sex, then it stands that a rans woman who has not undergone reconstructive surgery to change her genitalia has a penis; this does not mean that she is a man. What it does mean is that her genitalia is male...at least going by the vast majority of definitions for male and female sex organs. Stating that the penis is a male sex organ is not negating her gender identity. And in the case of rans men, they usually know (once they become well-informed on the topic of transgender issues) that not having a penis does not mean that they are any less of a man. Transgender people often distinguish anatomical sex from gender identity, and often state that their bodies do not align with their gender identity. For many trans women, the penis, as a male sex organ, is a body part that is somewhat foreign to them and is not something they want to own. And, generally, anatomy and other medical topics should distinguish anatomical sex from gender identity in cases such as the ones noted above; by that, I mean, for example, Wikipedia editors should not edit with a WP:Undue weight approach regarding intersex, transgender and genderqueer people simply because they assume that &quot;because we are calling this a male sex organ, it means that we are calling that individual male or are stating that all men have a penis.&quot; or that &quot;this condition being exclusive to anatomical females means we are stating that this person is therefore a female/girl/woman, plain and simple.&quot; ser:Flyer22|Flyer22 (ser talk:Flyer22|talk) 01:36, 26 October 2014 (UTC)

 DYK for Acute flaccid myelitis 

I've been trying to scrape together the available news about cute flaccid myelitis.  I say &quot;news&quot; because in this breaking story there's certainly nothing like the sources people here usually favor, but given that I've expressed the tentative nature of the data, I think it is very worthwhile to collect what's been reported by what really is a pretty impressive group of doctors, released via the CDC and professional societies.

I think that a much wider viewpoint is needed on the e-cigarette article on its categorization, wider than this catagory. IMHO it appears that a medical agenda is in charge of what is a consumer device and is dictating exactly what point of view should be thrust into the face of visitors. This is sad because for the most part little is known from a medical point of view. The article imho and the medical category need to be separated. The health effects section would still be governed by P:MEDRS regardless of what category its in. But the involvement in the structure of the article, which is now a medical style for a consumer device that does not require a prescription, and is not sold as a medical device is just just wrong. ser:AlbinoFerret|AlbinoFerret (ser talk:AlbinoFerret|talk) 21:38, 25 October 2014 (UTC)

Except of course that this isn't an alt-med topic, and that some classify it as such, might explain rather a lot. No one is claiming that this has alt-medical effects, and nothing in the article is sourced to alt-med sources. In fact all medical/chemical/etc. material except some negative material (from the CDC &quot;Notes from the Field&quot;) is sourced from respected secondary review articles by P:MEDRS. --ser:KimDabelsteinPetersen|Kim D.

for fuck's sake, |KimDabelsteinPetersen|kim i said &quot;it is as bad as alt-med&quot; - editing alt-med articles is unproductive and ugly because people who work on them don't listen or try to reach consensus and often don't understand or apply policies and guidelines well.  and you are a case in point kim.  you are now 0 for 3 on this board with regard to dealing with what i've actually said and your understanding of policies and guidelines, yet you are adamant as hell.  which is par for the course for what i am talking about. ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 22:44, 25 October 2014 (UTC)

@ ser:Jytdog|Jytdog I will agree that the article has become &quot;joyless wikipedia hell where editors have completely lost track of the mission and key principles, like that we actually try to work toward consensus.&quot;. Consensus isnt being used as a principle, but like a weapon. 
By the specific way the article is presented you would think the title isnt Electronic Cigarette, but Health effects of Electronic Cigarettes. I have had to remove health effects claims that are repeated from the health effects section from almost every other section including Components. The NPOV was long gone before I started editing last night. The article read like a jumbled up number of claims with no direction and no focus other than to be negative.
Another editor Levelledout on the talk page had commented [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AElectronic_cigarette&amp;diff=630720762&amp;oldid=630719238 that the way the topics on the page were setup added to the NPOV problem]. I changed the order to match the lede of the article and avoid the problem because it made sense to me. Only to have that changed in an edit war. Now we have editors removing NPOV tags and banners when there is a RFC on them only days old with no consensus either way. The prominence of the Health effects section is a NPOV problem. Not its existence, not the reliable sources. To Doc James credit he left a lot of the changes to the page alone and only changed the order of the sections back.
I dislike editors posting to other pages when it looks like they are the lone party to disagree and bring in people who dont really edit the page, but revert. So ya, its hell. I dont like when editors use warnings on other users talk page to stop them from acting, and then do exactly what they warned others about. I dont like others using a guideline clearly designed for something completely different (medical devices on a consumer product) to force changes that lead to NPOV problems. Ok I think I have said enough. ser:AlbinoFerret|AlbinoFerret (ser talk:AlbinoFerret|talk) 23:19, 25 October 2014 (UTC)
you can like what you like or not, but posting to a relevant message board is 100% OK in Wikipedia.  Getting mad about people doing what is OK, is unproductive - it is being part of the problem.  You can choose to be part of the problem or not.   On the health thing -- I think that the #1 reason anybody thinks about using an e-cigarette is health.  The #1 controversy over them is health.  I don't see how you can get around having the most P:WEIGHT (if you have never read that, please do - it is an essential part of the policy, P:NPOV) in the article be devoted to health.  That's my perspective, anyway.  ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 23:28, 25 October 2014 (UTC)
I disagree that the number one focus of most people with E-cigarettes is a health issue. There is a large and growing community of users that doesnt revolve around health related information.

I think the simplest way to look at this issue is to follow the P:NPOV advice of looking at how it is being treated in reliable sources.  Try the following Google searches:
* NYTimes e-cigarette
* WSJ e-cigarette
* Newseek e-cigarette
* Time Magazine e-cigarette
* CBS News e-cigarette

There are few or no media stories leading off with a discussion of what sort of fashion statement e-cigarettes are making, how they are constructed, what the latest e-juice cocktail is, where they are made, etc.  90% of what you will see in the media is stories debating the health effects.  And leaving aside Pubmed, searching Google scholar for &quot;e-cigarette&quot; will bring up no article on the first page of hits that are not health related. 

The argument that this is not primarily a health-related article flies in the face of what strongly dominates the result of every search you can perform on the internet. ser:Formerly 98|Formerly 98 (ser talk:Formerly 98|talk) 03:04, 26 October 2014 (UTC)
