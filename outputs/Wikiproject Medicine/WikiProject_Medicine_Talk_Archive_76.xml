		<segment id="id49017336">Model release - medical photos and more - legal review - WMF grant proposal

I am seeking comments and hopefully endorsements on a draft request to the Wikimedia Foundation for grant funds. If you like, please comment at [[meta:Grants:PEG/Wikimedia New York City/Legal review and templates for model release]].

For some time I have been collecting examples in Wikimedia projects in which there is some disagreement about whether an image violates personality right and would require a model release to host in Wikimedia Commons. See examples in the discussion sections at 
*[[meta:Grants talk:IdeaLab/Development of a model release process for photos and video]]

For context on Wikimedia Commons policy, see
*[[:Commons:Commons:Photographs of identifiable people]]
*[[:Commons:Commons:Country specific consent requirements]]

Currently, the major criteria for determining if an image is appropriate for inclusion in Commons is whether it has a free copyright license. Some other criteria, including personality rights, are discussed sometimes. My expectation is that Wikimedia Commons will continue to consider only copyright, but in some cases, when someone voluntarily seeks a model release and the photographer and model together agree to post their release in Wikimedia Commons, then I would like for such contributors to have access to a standard model release form which has legal review and is backed by community input.

I found a nonprofit organization with expertise in model releases. They are the [http://fashionlawinstitute.com/ Fashion Law Institute] and are based in New York City. Among other things, they provide curricula to law schools and fashion schools which want to present classes on fashion law. They also help fashion, advertising, and media companies set policy regarding fashion and communication. I have assisted them in partnering with [[:meta:Wikimedia New York City]] in drafting an application for a Wikimedia Foundation grant ([[meta:Grants:Start]]) to do legal review on the issue, provide expert opinions about when a model release may be used and should not be used, and to draft both a model release document and summary templates to apply to Commons uploads. In my opinion, this kind of legal research can only be done with some payment, and this is an appropriate organization to do this. One of their lawyers has had a Wikipedia account for some years as , and he is my point of contact.

This relates to WikiProject Medicine for several reasons, including the following:
*Some of our contributors take photos while using their own model releases, and it would be good to give them a reviewed standard model release
*It happens that sometimes we face trouble for using photos without model releases
*It might be nice to continue to confirm last year's US Copyright Office Decision that medical imaging is in the public domain as non-creative data

Again, comment at [[meta:Grants:PEG/Wikimedia New York City/Legal review and templates for model release]] if you will. I am showing this to WikiProject Medicine participants before I show this more generally around Wikimedia projects.

You've clearly put a lot of work in to this project, and it is commendable. I would use a standardized release form were one available, because the survival of images is more guaranteed than at present, when it seems that any image can be removed by overzealous deletionists on commons at any time.  () 16:09, 16 December 2015 (UTC)
The release would be different between health care providers and non health care providers I image? Health care providers need to keep image release forms for their licensing body.
The Wikimedia Movement should not be handling these release forms. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 16:15, 16 December 2015 (UTC)
 My expectation is that consent forms will never be managed in a Wikimedia project or in OTRS, which would make this process different from [[:Commons:Commons:Email_templates#Declaration_of_consent_for_all_inquiries|the copyright release]]. I would like Wikimedia projects to provide a CC-By text of a sample model release, then offer this to institutions or individuals who could use it. The validity of the text would come from its recognition in the Wikimedia community and also from the legal opinion of the Fashion Law Institute, who will endorse at least the initial version and perhaps later versions also. There might be an OTRS process in which an institution can say, &quot;We confirm that we hold the model release&quot; but I would not want them to actually share the model release.
If the release is used then I would expect local institutions to keep the document and information like the model's name. The host institution or individual uploader of the image would confirm &quot;The subject in this photo agreed to this model release&quot; and the template confirmation on Commons would only say that the uploader claimed to have the release. We would  from there just as we do now.
I am not yet sure whether the form would need to be different for patients modeling for medical journals versus models posing for fashion magazines. If there is reason to differentiate then multiple versions could be produced. Fashionethics anticipated that perhaps one form and one release could be used in most cases. The nature of the release would be that the model confirms understanding of free licensing and distribution of their photo generally on the Internet, and not only in Wikimedia projects. Personality rights are a separate but related issue - I am not sure how those would be addressed in this system but Fashion Law Institute might be able to say what is and is not generally appropriate.

Getting rid of MEDRS safety information when merging articles?

The articles E-liquid and Electronic cigarette aerosol were merged recently following a inconclusive discussion at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Electronic_cigarette#Merge_Discussion_-_Sub_articles_Safety.2C_Aerosol.2C_and_E-liquid], but with the removal of nearly all safety information from the articles. The following edit gets rid of several sections concerning the safety and health effects of the substances [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electronic_cigarette_aerosol_and_e-liquid&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=695821525&amp;oldid=695820785]. [[User:CFCF|CFCF]]  21:25, 18 December 2015 (UTC)
That is incorrect. The information that replaced it was from the &quot;Safety&quot; page. Its all &quot;safety&quot; information. Chemical claims were moved to the Safety page, they were not simply removed. Though most of it didnt need to be moved because the article as it sat was not a daughter page, but simply a copy and paste coatrack. This was done in accordance of consensus at a merge discussion.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Electronic_cigarette#Merge_Discussion_-_Sub_articles_Safety.2C_Aerosol.2C_and_E-liquid] Unilaterally replacing things you fought against in that closed discussion but were not found in your favor isnt how things should be done. Opening a discussion on the page and finding if there is consensus to have the material in the page is the way, not running to a wikiproject first before discussion on the articles talk page. [[User:AlbinoFerret|AlbinoFerret]] 22:24, 18 December 2015 (UTC)
Patent nonsense from the editor who deleted the information – despite intense criticism and lack of any support for getting rid of the edits. The merge itself was premature, and was performed to the horribly named new article Electronic cigarette aerosol and e-liquid. The problem with these articles is that they are overlooked by the majority of medical editors, and this needs more eyes.It should not be possible to avoid scrutiny by removing content in a questionable merge that would never have removed through ordinary editing process on an article.  is an essay, while the section  &quot;Keeping summary sections and detailed articles synchronized&quot; is an editing guideline! [[User:CFCF|CFCF]]  07:11, 19 December 2015 (UTC)
Generally when performing a merge the content should be copied verbatim from the source and its provenance labelled clearly in the edit summary (for license integrity reasons). Then (or beforehand) it can be fettled. If somehow during this process excisions were silently made that were non-neutral, that would be a concern. Unless agreed as part of the merge discussion, I would expect a merge operation not to result in any lost knowledge in our overall content. Given some of the problematic history of these articles, I'd expect any editor performing a merge to be alert to the need for caution.  () 07:33, 19 December 2015 (UTC)
This was more than a simple merge. The article &quot;Electronic cigarette aerosol&quot; before the work done was a coatrack. The page was not about aerosol, but toxicology, simply copied and pasted claims from Safety of electronic cigarettes, not broken out as a daughter page is normally done leaving a summery and link to the new page. Leaving two pages on toxicology, and the aerosol information still on Safety. This was discussed in an earlier section of the main articles talk page,[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Electronic_cigarette#New_article] linked to in the merge discussion.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Electronic_cigarette#Merge_Discussion_-_Sub_articles_Safety.2C_Aerosol.2C_and_E-liquid] The toxicology information was moved back to safety per the merge discussion. The aerosol section was moved to the aerosol page per the merge discussion. A summery was left in its place and a link to the page added. Then e-liguid was merged in. What we have now is a true daughter page, that can be synced and everything was copied verbatium. Nothing was lost. The information all exists on WP, its just on different pages. The so called &quot;removal&quot; of information can be found here [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_of_electronic_cigarettes#Comparison_of_levels_of_toxicants_in_e-cigarette_aerosol]. Each claim that was taken off of Aersol either already existed in the toxicology section of Safety or was moved there. All done per a merge discussion, that was closed by an uninvolved admin as having consensus. What this section is, is forum shopping and since the original post was non neutral, canvassing.

Clyde cancer cluster

Hello, people of WikiProject Medicine. I've created this message to notify active members of the project, especially to those who know a lot about or are interested in cancer. If you are, I need help improving my article about the Clyde cancer cluster, a cancer cluster in Clyde, Ohio that has received a massive amount of news coverage. I'm not at all saying minor edits or improvements are bad, but I'm specifically looking for people who can help me long-term with a lot of co-research to improve the article to reach Good Article status. If you're interested in helping, the things needed to be improved are listed on . In other words, more material needs to be added to improve the article, and I want more people to edit because I feel like I'm the sole editor. Regards,  ()
will look (added two MEDRS refs)-- () 13:24, 29 December 2015 (UTC)
Many of the sources used are poor or cite popular press for statements that should require higher sourcing standards. Also there is no clarification as to why these cancer cases are thought to be related beyond being from the same area. An incidence of two cases per year in a small town isn't remarkable on its own, you need something better before defining it as a cluster. For a cluster you need a markedly increased rate compared to the averagewhich can not be explained through random chance (preferably also of similar types of cancer). I hate to tell you, but it's unlikely this can reach GA at all, if it even reaches . [[User:CFCF|CFCF]]  13:52, 29 December 2015 (UTC) 
  I see what you're saying, and don't take my words wrong, thanks for criticizing, it's constructive. But isn't Wikipedia all about what it says in the sources? Pretty much all the sources refer to this incident as &quot;the Clyde Cancer Cluster&quot; (notice they often capitalize cancer and cluster incorrectly) or something similar, like the Ohio Cancer Cluster, or the Sandusky County Cancer Cluster, Clyde Area Cancer Cluster, Clyde, Ohio Cancer Cluster, etc. If it weren't actually a cluster, we should at least say that &quot;most people believe it's a cluster but it's actually not&quot; in the article or something like that. Because even if it wasn't even what people call it, it still qualifies for an article, because it's an incident of concern. From what I've gather, and I didn't put it was necessarily true in the article, but I'm pretty confident that it was, at least mostly, Whirlpool's fault for dumping the PCBs and emitting illegal gases. I think most other people, at least in Clyde, would agree with me on that one, even the attorneys themselves.  () 21:50, 29 December 2015 (UTC)
  Some official court documents and such define the Clyde cancer cluster as real as well. Again, please see , for a full list of references I'm going to use for the rewriting of the article.  () 21:59, 29 December 2015 (UTC)
  Oh, and about the challenge you gave to the article about &quot;pure chance&quot;, I would like to note to you that, and I did know this from the start, it still could've happened by pure chance, or for another fault than Whirlpool's. I don't think you'd ever find a reliable source that said &quot;It was definitely Whirlpool's fault.&quot; All that happened was they found PCBs in a public park that they used to own in one of the surrounding towns, and found benzaldehyde in people's homes, and assumed that it must have been emitted from the factory. There is no evidence that these two things are linked with the cancers at all, but it is extremely likely that it is. Because it is still technically unconfirmed what caused the cancers even at this point, the Clyde cancer cluster can still have an article telling about all the investigations and court cases regarding the cluster, because there are like a hundred sources out there regarding the incidents. People are indeed assuming that Whirlpool was at fault because of the their confirmed dumping of illegal toxic waste into a public park, and I don't blame them because this actually seems like a logical explanation; to ignore something like that in a court case about the cluster is inhumane.

I have a programming background and could probably take this on if I had to, but at this point, for the simple information for a small WikiProject I'm looking for, I think I'll just wait for the information to be added to the WikiProject Directory.  They are already listing editors who've worked on project-included pages; it should be a minor additional step to indicate how much or what they're editing.

Moving Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura to Immune thrombocytopenic purpura 

Hi folks.  Let me start by saying I'm no doctor, but I know a bit about ITP.  There has been a very slow moving discussion about making the move described above to the article Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.  Web sources are split from what I can tell (the Mayo Clinic still goes with Idiopathic, Merck with Immune).  I think there is general concensous that this is an autoimmune disorder and so isn't really Idiopathic (if I'm using those words correctly).  In any case, I'd like to hear what folks who know more about general naming conventions in medicine and medicine in general think.  Thanks.  () 03:10, 30 December 2015 (UTC)

Yeah, but as I said, reliable sources like the Mayo clinic ([http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/idiopathic-thrombocytopenic-purpura/basics/definition/con-20034239]) use Idiopathic.  On-line sources seem split.  Just thought to do an obvious search [https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_ylo=2014&amp;q=blood+itp&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,23] and I think that's pretty convincing.

The article on ICD-10 says that the Czech government adopted all the updates, and specifies four different years during the last decade or so.  Therefore, I suspect that names like this are getting updated roughly every three years on average.  ICD-11 will probably be released in two years.  I don't see any urgent need to change this before then (and if ICD-11 doesn't choose &quot;Immune&quot;, what would you do in 2018?  Revert it back, since we guessed wrong about which name they would prefer?).    () 08:15, 2 January 2016 (UTC)

Help with possible medical advertising
It's recently come to my attention that some possible promotion has been going on with the articles Strep-tag and Streptamer. I don't have access to the references cited in the articles, but the claims made there seem awfully puffy. It'd be much appreciated if someone could take a look for any issues or poorly-supported claims.   12:34, 5 January 2016 (UTC)
They do look a bit puffy, but the target audience for those articles is highly sophisticated and basically immune to puffery, so I'm not terribly concerned.  The articles are definitely not scammish or fringey.  () 13:50, 5 January 2016 (UTC)
Good to know, wanted to be sure. Thanks for taking a look.   15:11, 10 January 2016 (UTC)

Strep-tag is not really a medical product, just a biochemical research tool.  It's just another affinity tag that can be expressed recombinantly, like a FLAG tag, a His tag, or an HA tag—but newer and not (apparently) nearly as often used (at least so far).  Looks like it gets at least a modest number of cites, though.
Streptamer is a bit more problematic as an article.  It both seems more 'puffy', and it gets into some therapeutic claims that seem to be entirely unsupported—the entire Applications and advantages section is unsupported by inline references.  The word &quot;streptamer&quot; only pulls [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?cmd=search&amp;term=streptamer 16 hits on PubMed] since the original 2007 publication, so one might have concerns about how widely used or accepted this concept/method is.

Only problem is that google will use them and steal our traffic... [[User:CFCF|CFCF]]  16:29, 12 January 2016 (UTC) 
 If you become better equipped to speak authoritatively I met the guy at Mayo Clinic who manages the relationship with Google. Google, I think you know, gets all their data from Mayo Clinic. He would take our call or presentation if we reached out, and he said that in some limited way as a pilot he was open to the idea of Mayo contributing content to Wikipedia. Nothing is firm, and who knows what they would do if pressed, but he suggested that Mayo Clinic might begin negotiation by donating really weird marginal health information, like rare disease info or health effects of odd co-morbidities or effects of odd drug interactions. Whatever else Google and Mayo are, they are diplomatic and will talk to anyone with community backing and authority to speak. They know very well what they are doing. [[User:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ]][[User talk:Bluerasberry|(talk)]] 16:52, 12 January 2016 (UTC)
Google still uses a lot of our stuff. For example see [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Len3nEb0AXttyvUDRxVHaiN633uYjaBDP69n3YncxhY/edit#gid=0] which should be the google search for Japanese encephalitis vaccine. I see us supporting the center box, side box, and are hit number 4.
Data for all the vaccines on the WHO essential medicines list is here [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Len3nEb0AXttyvUDRxVHaiN633uYjaBDP69n3YncxhY/edit?usp=sharing]
Of course for more common medications they have moved to a more structured boxes with data drawn from a bunch of people. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 06:16, 14 January 2016 (UTC)
With respect to speaking with the medical information teams at Google or Mayo, not sure how we could collaborate. I tend not to use Mayo as a reference as a few years back I found their site contained support for a number of urban legends.
Also I do not believe that Google is using our structured data. I very much imagine that they have their own and it is much much farther along than ours. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 06:33, 14 January 2016 (UTC)

Clinical infoboxes
Added a few further details to a new more person centered box here. Some is pulled from Wikidata but I am finding Wikidata so slow to edit that it will be much faster to hand build here on EN WP.

Also not sure how to bring over refs from Wikidata. Does anyone else? [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 02:41, 21 December 2015 (UTC)

About that box:  Overall I like it, and of course we just leave out any item that's too long or complicated to list.  But is there a generic &quot;treatment&quot; section, or is it just &quot;medication&quot;?  I see that &quot;medication&quot; is listed in the example at Gout, and I expected to see dietary changes included, since diet modifications are important for that condition. 
I'm not sure how to get the refs from Wikidata, but do you actually need them?  In theory (for a reasonably well-developed article, etc.), there should be almost nothing in that infobox that isn't written and sourced in the article itself.   () 17:24, 21 December 2015 (UTC)
I find the new infobox is much cleaner and far more usable (if I need to look up the ICD-code I'm happy to scroll down to the bottom of the page). I agree that it is preferable to edit these things on Wikipedia for now (they can always be imported once we have enough data). 
There are some additional issues that we would solve by doing this as well:
#Adding sources to Wikidata is difficult: I tried to find a way to add alopurinol and got stuck when I tried to source itand as you say, even when it is sourced, it isn't visible.
#Ibuprofen is just one of an entire class of NSAIDs that may be used to treat gout, and the preferred type varies between countries and patient's other risk-factors (Cochrane review ). I can't find a way to add a class of medication, only single medications to this list, this would be very easy on Wikipedia.
[[User:CFCF|CFCF]]  17:43, 21 December 2015 (UTC)
P.S. The same is also true of prednisone, which is not used very much in Sweden, in favor of prednisolone, so it would be more apt to link the class glucocorticoids. [[User:CFCF|CFCF]]  17:55, 21 December 2015 (UTC)

 We need to stick with what the sources say. The reference on Wikidata () is http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Gout/ and that makes no mention of ibuprofen. I have changed that Wikidata entry to read  as is indicated in the reference, and that has now been automatically reflected in the Gout infobox. We could, of course, override that with any text we choose by supplying a value for a  parameter in the infobox. -- () 18:26, 21 December 2015 (UTC)

Question about a source

OK, so there is something called aerotoxic syndrome (defined as illness caused by bad airplane cabin air).  In March 2015 a coroner released a report about a death of a british airways pilot - it is [https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Westgate-2015-0050.pdf here], and it has become a key document in disputes about whether cabin air is really bad or not, and whether it harms people or not.  The key part is section 5 which says:
During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows . -
# That organo-phosphate compounds are present in aircraft cabin air.
# That the occupants of aircraft cabins are exposed to organo-phosphate compounds with consequential damage to their health.
# That impairment to the health of those controlling aircraft may lead to the death of occupants.
# There is no real time monitoring to detect such compounds in cabin air.
# That no account is taken of genetic variation in the human species, such a would render individuals tolerant or intolerant of the exposure

I would feel much more comfortable if videos were posted with just the logo and not a link to the website. Khan Academy is a different story since they are a non-profit, and the poster above is not being truthful by claiming that Osmosis is a spin-off. Their CMO is from Khan Academy and only joined them a few months ago, whereas Osmosis has been around for almost 3 years. Imagine Bank of America posting info videos with a link to their website on wiki pages regarding personal finance. Comment left unsigned by 
These are a great resource, but I wonder whether there's a formal/transparent process for peer review and feedback? For example, the video on [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cirrhosis.webm liver fibrosis/cirrhosis] states that fibrosis is irreversible, but that's clearly incorrect; people with cirrhosis due to HBV, and sometime those with cirrhosis due to HCV, experience regression of fibrosis after treatment (e.g. ). More generally, these videos have no explicit sourcing to MEDRS, they do not come from a recognized secondary source (this is a commercial entity, in fact), and their peer review process appears to be internal (the video I'm commenting on here was &quot;reviewed by&quot; Rishi Desai MD/PhD who is a the CMO of the company). While it might be hard for them to source these in the way we would an article, they would be far more valuable if these issues were explicitly and rigorously addressed. I will reiterate that I'm excited about their contribution of these videos - I just want to ensure that they are up to the standards (including process for improvement) of WP/WPMED. (I should also disclaim that I helped their founders with Osmosis during its early days, but I have no stake in the business) —  () 03:44, 25 December 2015 (UTC)
I've noted another error - in the leukemia video - on its talk page [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File_talk:Acute_myeloid_%26_lymphoblastic_leukemia.webm here].

I'm uncertain whether that single study will change what is otherwise considered a pretty well-founded truth. First if we can source the statement to a secondary source should we change it. It would be great if they could release their scripts prior to filming, we could definitely critique those without too much effort. [[User:CFCF|CFCF]]  16:03, 25 December 2015 (UTC)
 To what single study are you referring? Do you mean to refer to the review article I cited, which is just one example of multiple secondary sources that say the same thing, summarizing quite a few studies? (another example is , a review article published in a first-rate gastroenterology journal and for which the senior author is Scott L. Friedman) Also, to what well-founded truth do you refer (and what is the basis for your claim - since I have cited a MEDRS and you have not)? —  () 10:50, 26 December 2015 (UTC)

That said, I think these videos will be a useful resource. —  () 04:05, 31 December 2015 (UTC)

Typical doom and gloom article in Time

*[http://time.com/4180414/wikipedia-15th-anniversary/?xid=homepage Why Wikipedia is in Trouble], from Time
Regular readers will find no new substance in this article.

What is new and weird about this is that it starts with an anecdote that the narrator goes to a doctor, and the doctor does not know what to do, so it seems natural to both of them that they go to Wikipedia to get information to inform the therapy to be recommended. This article takes for granted that doctors and patients recognize Wikipedia as the place to get health info, then goes on to give critical commentary about editor numbers.

Also, our own  gets no credit for health contributions or Cochrane relationships, but is recognized for her support for  who need biographies. [[User:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ]][[User talk:Bluerasberry|(talk)]] 22:35, 14 January 2016 (UTC)
Yes, it was disappointing that the author referred to my work with Cochrane so trivially as as topic experts doing brown bag lunches. He had a predetermined idea for the article and looked for comments to support his opinion. :-( Sydney Poore/ 22:55, 14 January 2016 (UTC)

Couple of things
#I find it interesting that the number of warning tags is going down. Hopefully that means quality is improving.
#I am not convince that &quot;the core community of Wikipedians are too hostile to newcomers&quot; is the main reason we are no longer growing. I would instead argue that there are so many other web 2.0 sites such as facebook that we are competing with for contributors. Facebook has more women than men per hour spent.&quot;Facebook, which is used by 71% of the online population, is dominated by women (76 percent) as opposed to men (66 percent). On average, women have more than twice as many posts on their Facebook walls and they have 8% more ‘friends’ than men.&quot;[https://www.brandwatch.com/2015/01/men-vs-women-active-social-media/]

[[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 07:51, 15 January 2016 (UTC)
On #2, we unfortunately have evidence to demonstrate that &quot;hostility&quot; is a significant factor.  &quot;Hostility&quot; encompasses a lot, including reverting good-faith edits instead of collaborating with them.  How many times a day do we remove factual information for lack of the preferred kind of source?  Even material that we suspect is probably accurate?  From the POV of a new editor, that's a hostile action.  In surveys, former editors have said that they go back and check to see whether their edits 'stuck', and when they didn't, they conclude that they aren't good enough and aren't wanted here.  One person with  and an itchy trigger finger can do a lot of damage in an evening.   () 09:17, 15 January 2016 (UTC)
We have a lot of Wikipedias that have plateaued for long periods or have shrunk.[https://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/SummaryZH.htm zh], [https://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/SummaryHI.htm hi], [https://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/SummaryES.htm es], [https://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/SummaryMS.htm ms], [https://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/SummaryPT.htm pt], [https://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/SummaryRU.htm ru], [https://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/SummaryJA.htm ja], etc. There are few exceptions.

Is the suggestion that all of these different versions and sites got less friendly around 2007 - 2010?
I am not saying it is not a factor, I am just not convinced that it is the &quot;main&quot; factor. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 09:48, 15 January 2016 (UTC)
I agree with Doc James. Although I think hostility plays a big factor (and I used to think, the main factor) I think the difficulty in doing simple tasks that we consider essential (try explaining to a new user how to use the same reference for 3 sections of an article, or even finding a high quality image to illustrate a page, or even participating in 2 medium length talk page discussions on the same page), or getting bogged down in long discussions (which certainly dissuades me from acting boldly as I once may have done!) play just a big role in keeping editors away. -- () 09:57, 15 January 2016 (UTC)
I think this is an exceedingly interesting question and one that would benefit from further study. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 10:50, 15 January 2016 (UTC)
One issue specific to this project is how to deal gently with new editors who add medical material based on poor or no sources. I edit plant articles, mainly, and herbal uses are always being added without MEDRS-compliant support. What would be useful would be to have an essay written in language that new editors will find understandable explaining why such material is not accepted. Referring new editors to , as of course I do, isn't helpful, in my experience; for them, WP:MEDRS is far too long and far too full of WP jargon.  () 11:06, 15 January 2016 (UTC)

&quot;Hostility&quot; is one problem, &quot;lack of friendly support&quot; is another. In NYC we refuse 90% of presentation requests for in-person training. Requests are never ending and it feels bad that the demand seems to be omnipresent but there is no plan to meet it. As it is we had 38 public &quot;anyone invited&quot; meetups in 2015  and at least as many private meetups, plus classroom outreach and combined events with other digital communication nonprofits. There are a huge number of people who would spend their time in Wikipedia training and social events if only somehow training needs could be met. This is hard to do in person, and no one offers online classes. There is no video outreach plan. [[User:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ]][[User talk:Bluerasberry|(talk)]] 14:35, 15 January 2016 (UTC)
Agree with much that has been said above. Hostility is a problem; is it the main one? Who knows. However, on the subject of in person training, while this sounds like a good idea, it has a very poor record when it comes to converting people attending the training into regular editors. This is something else that needs looking at.  () 14:39, 15 January 2016 (UTC)
 In NYC many people do not start editing Wikipedia on their own until after coming to 4-5 meetups, which is a huge commitment. After anyone comes that many times retention rates jump from the ~1% meetup norm to something approaching 100%, but then also, going lots of times to anything over a period of months is a complicated thing to predict. Practically every other outreach strategy involves single-event recruitment. Not many places in the world have pools of 10 million people within a 30-minutes of any arbitrary meetup location, so meeting in NYC is unusual, and I am not suggesting that meetups are the answer anywhere. Something that is certain is that lots of people really like the idea of attending meetups and learning how to use Wikipedia, and the available training options in all circumstances are lacking. For most volunteer projects the bottleneck is in recruitment, not training. With Wikipedia, there is huge demand for outreach but not service for training. To say that Wikipedia's editor numbers are in decline is not like saying that the website is becoming less popular or that demand is decreasing. Demand for training remains huge in practically every location and online. I am not sure what should be done in response to this. [[User:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ]][[User talk:Bluerasberry|(talk)]] 19:11, 15 January 2016 (UTC)
Very interesting what you say. I have wondered whether more sessions is an important part of making training better. And I agree with your earlier point about using video training.  () 22:21, 15 January 2016 (UTC)
Bluerasberry, I'm not sure what you mean about a &quot;video outreach plan&quot;.  I can think of several different things that might fall into that category.   () 06:39, 17 January 2016 (UTC)
We were supposed by now to have a good set of online tutorials, including some video, to reduce the need for in-person training, and including more advanced stuff.  But I don't know what happened to that.  Editing WP has got harder over the years, not least because as the general quality of articles improves (which it does, slowly), edits that improve them become harder to make.  This is especially true with referencing. I expect many editors who are now very experienced made first edits that would now be lucky to survive. People (especially young ones) often begin by trying to edit very popular articles that are fiercely patrolled, and so on. ISPs don't get welcome templates, and so on.  I must say I'm not aware that London has the same unmet demand for training that NYC seems to, and the number of the curious never-edited at meetups is generally small.  () 10:49, 20 January 2016 (UTC)
 I concur with everything that  said. [http://bluerasberry.com/2015/04/survey-of-videos-about-wikipedia-2015/I said more about video] on my blog.
John, some people in WM UK have talked with Pharos and I about WM NYC events and they said the same thing. I am not sure what to think after hearing this from you also. It takes little effort here to accept invitations to present an editathon here, and the advertising for the event is usually done by the venue which is what creates the stream of new users. We sort of manage our own outreach to existing contributors but even for them, they are mostly on their own to sign up for mailing lists and watch for event notices themselves. There is little reflection of what happens here and I cannot explain it, but it seems like people in NYC do more recruitment more easily without trying than sometimes happens in the UK with effort. If this the case - and this might not be because I have not seen UK outreach data - I do not think it is because of anyone doing anything thoughtful or clever here. It might be geography and convenience (Manhattan is tiny compared to London) or it might be that institutions here convince each other to do events without needing persuasion from Wikipedians. UK definitely works harder and seems more organized from my perspective. I proposed that UK manage WM NYC because we are good with events but do little tracking or administration, and I think many people here would be grateful if UK oversaw us as an English Wikipedia organizational authority.

This is a common tension between WP:Pharmacology and WP:MED.   For things like binding efficiency and other Pharmacodynamics in vitro studies are definitive.  In vitro studies are not so useful for Pharmacokinetics of course.  In my view the tension is pretty easy to resolve as long as the PD information is presented clearly and is limited to simply describing the PD information, and no conclusions are drawn with regard to efficacy or safety in humans or animals.

i agree that PD information shouldn't be disallowed in the PD section b/c it is in vitro.  that is silly.  I have a harder time when folks use primary sources for this kind of information; secondary sources remain best generally speaking (reproducibility blah blah blah).  But if the only sources are primary then i reckon they are ok but if someone challenged on the grounds of primary sourcing, i would have a hard time arguing against that. (again, the problems with reproducibility in the biomedical literature and our mission to provide &quot;accepted knowledge&quot; to the public)    () 21:33, 12 January 2016 (UTC)
Refusing to use primary sources, when no secondary sources exist for this information, is another case of trying to use MEDRS as a substitute for MEDDUE.  Basic pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic information for a regulated medication is always DUE, exactly like a birth and death years and places are always DUE in a biography.  You must use a source that meets (and ideally exceeds) the bare minimum requirements for reliability, and you should (RFC 2119) use one of the best sources that you have access to, but if the best you (or anyone else) can get is a primary source, then you should use that, and nobody should give you any grief over it.

Redirecting to the original point: 1) quercetin and other polyphenols would not be on our radar if they weren't being proposed as supplements or food additives with human health benefits, so relevance to the human condition is a foundation. The discussion is valid to question whether early-stage in vitro studies on these compounds - years/decades from proof of relevance in humans - are just topics of preliminary research to be challenged as &quot;non-fact&quot;, warranting removal per  and  or at least presented in general, comprehensible non-jargon prose that research is proceeding on these mechanisms. It is not a matter of whether the in vitro finding is &quot;truthful&quot;, because we accept the scientific process as providing the diligence on that, but rather the challenge is whether the finding is too premature to be accepted as &quot;factual&quot; in vivo. Stated in , #6 - &quot;Wikipedia is an encyclopedic reference, not a textbook. The purpose of Wikipedia is to present facts (my emphasis), not to teach subject matter&quot;; 2) primary in vitro studies on a human estrogen receptor, even though grouped in a review of primary studies, should be challenged as a non-secondary source, in my opinion; i.e., summarizing primary sources does not make primary source material secondary); 3)  and the hierarchy of evidence under  should prevail for more general statements about in vitro work in lay language until verified for relevance in vivo. -- () 17:13, 13 January 2016 (UTC)

Perhaps  should tell me what you mean by &quot;non-fact&quot;.  Is &quot;The weight of this molecule is 302 g/mol&quot; always a fact in your definition?   () 20:23, 14 January 2016 (UTC)

 1) for quercetin and like phytochemical (non-nutrient) compounds, characteristics described &quot;in glass&quot; are by definition [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro &quot;outside their normal biological context&quot;], so are pre-fact findings, preliminary non-facts under study to further test in future research if their properties exist in vivo. By analogy, a new chemical entity (NCE) is typically studied first in vitro (or in computo) to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_development#Pre-clinical elaborate if its characteristics might apply to humans] via testing of its intended properties to become a drug. A NCE is not a drug; likewise, in vitro evidence is not fact, but rather &quot;fact in development&quot;. 2)  applies to this discussion just as you point out because [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quercetin#In_vitro_pharmacology in vitro description like this] could not possibly stand on its own as an article - it is too premature and uncertain about biological fact, yet, in this case, has a place in an article possibly misleading a lay user to believe it is fact.

Zefr one thing that people do too often is try to draw claims about efficacy based on in vitro findings and both WAID and I are opposed to that. But you can only talk about things like binding efficacy with in vitro studies and that kind of information is useful - it just cannot be used to draw broader conclusions.  I don't think you are hearing us.  () 23:28, 14 January 2016 (UTC)

Listening carefully, .

yep in my view that is good content.  i really don't know what you mean about &quot;confirming in vivo&quot;.  how do you measure receptor binding in vivo? (i don't think you can)  People in drug discovery/development are for sure increasingly interested in understanding what they call &quot;target engagement&quot; (see [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960894X14013845 here] but that is often done indirectly.    () 23:58, 14 January 2016 (UTC)
&quot;How do you measure receptor binding in vivo?&quot; Same as defining specificity to confirm a receptor's (or NCE's) mechanism: by using a better known competitive agonist or blocking agent, with in vivo imaging if possible. Either way, as the &quot;target engagement&quot; article shows, true facts about the receptor - the fact-building part of target engagement - aren't established until in vivo work succeeds = my point. Nice article, BTW. Thanks. -- () 06:17, 15 January 2016 (UTC)
Zefr I am sorry but you don't seem to understand the science here.   I don't want to belabor the science anymore.  You have my answer on whether the content in Quercetin is OK and why. And I think you know by now that I am consistent about removing information about health that is not appropriately sourced.    () 14:28, 15 January 2016 (UTC)

Zefr, I think you want to read , the main guideline on what happens to facts that (a) do not qualify for their own articles but (b) do belong in another one.  NFRINGE doesn't mean that the information must be removed from the whole encyclopedia.  It only means discusses whether a subject gets its own, separate page.    () 09:10, 15 January 2016 (UTC)

Facts
Okay, Zefr, I gave you a chance to explain what fact means to you, and you didn't, so I'm going to supply you with a definition, and maybe we'll be able to communicate.

;Fact
Anything that could be empirically known.  Any given statement of fact may be true or false.  &quot;Hydrogen is an element with one proton&quot; is a true fact.  &quot;Hydrogen is an element with twenty-seven protons&quot; is a false fact.

Using this definition, then yes, absolutely:  Those are statements of fact.  I do not personally know whether they are true facts or false facts, but I am certain that they are statements of fact.  (They are definitely not statements of theory or statements of values, which are the other significant options in this model.)

It seems to me that your real question is not &quot;Is this a fact?&quot; but &quot;Should we include this information, given that I personally believe that the evidence base is merely typical, rather than extraordinarily strong, and because I worry that including any sourced, factual information about this substance will encourage some readers to eat this stuff?&quot;

IMO the only possible policy-based reply to that is &quot;&quot;:  We do not remove sourced facts about chemistry from the encyclopedia merely because we worry that some readers might make stupid choices about their health as a result.  Wikipedia is not in the business of hiding information from readers.

By the way, I don't know if you've thought about it much, but most people won't bother reading a wall of confusing chemical jargon.  If you truly don't want people to read this information, then it would be logical for you to stop demanding that the relevant section be made easy for them to read.   () 09:10, 15 January 2016 (UTC)

 A &quot;fact&quot; established for human health is reached from progressively narrowing in vivo evidence via significant scientific consensus, as required for establishing recommendations on nutrient intake or approving drugs as effective to treat a disease. For compounds like quercetin (implied in that article as being a candidate nutrient and drug), the [http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/ucm073332.htm#system categories of evidence quality are summarized here] and [http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/ucm073332.htm#system here]. This process involving human physiology is at a different complexity than defining chemistry facts.

I do not bring up this discussion because I wish to persuade consumers against using quercetin supplements or fortified food. Rather, my preference is to see WP in vitro discussions presented in non-jargon more generally as only preliminary research in progress without implication to proof as receptors or mechanisms as currently exists in the Quercetin article. 

I think we are finished with this topic now. Thanks to you and others for interacting. -- () 17:10, 15 January 2016 (UTC)

 There are facts whose existence is not contingent on having direct implications to human health.  Discussing facts in the way you are doing is nonsensical.  It would be sensical, although still not defensible, to state that unless effects on human health are proven, the subject matter is not notable. What seems to be your real concern is that someone might misinterpret what is written and assume it has implications for human health.  However the article already makes clear that no benefit to human health has been demonstrated.  So I seriously doubt anyone could be possibly be mislead by this &quot;jargon&quot;.  () 17:50, 15 January 2016 (UTC)

*  content about a compound binding to a receptor is not itself content about health.  As I wrote above, I would object if someone wrote something like &quot;quercetin binds to COX-2 so has anti-inflammatory activity&quot; and sourced that to in vitro studies.  Saying simply &quot;quercetin binds to COX-2 with X affinity&quot; is not information about health nor even really biomedical.  The extra statement has to be there, drawing some claim about effect, for MEDRS to come in.   That is the distinction that you seem not to be making.  () 18:19, 15 January 2016 (UTC)

Raising this issue has never been about applying MEDRS to in vitro findings. MEDASSESS and MEDANIMAL were referenced because they are the closest guides we have pertaining to the extent encyclopedia space is devoted to early-stage bioscience. There is no clear guideline for discussing in vitro findings implied by some editors as important to more advanced in vivo evidence. My challenge is that in vitro discussions are pre-fact subject matter, not yet facts; as stated in , #6: Wikipedia is an encyclopedic reference, not a textbook. The purpose of Wikipedia is to present facts, not to teach subject matter. -- () 23:27, 15 January 2016 (UTC)

Analytical methods and MEDRS question

Hi everyone! I wanted some second opinions on [http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2003-154/default.html the NIOSH manual of analytical methods]. It doesn't meet MEDDATE but it's an &quot;official statement from an agency&quot; that has some really useful information for lab tests. There's a lot here I could use to expand articles, but I don't want to butt into MEDRS problems. Thanks!   () 17:00, 28 January 2016 (UTC)
 To add to what Emily said, part of the reason these documents are so old is because we don't always find a new way to measure chemical concentrations. That said, the manual does get updates (there are entries from as recent as 2015), so it is not like it is an old, abandoned publication.  () 20:26, 28 January 2016 (UTC)
The evidence base for medical diagnosis and treatment tends to change relatively rapidly. The evidence base for the reliability of lab tests generally doesn't. I don't think this is an issue.  () 21:13, 28 January 2016 (UTC)
I don't think descriptions of analytical methods fall under MEDRS anyway, as such descriptions themselves don't make biomedical or health claims.    However, if the content goes further and says something like: &quot;A measurement of X in bioloigical sample Y using assay Z means the person will die&quot; or something, that is a health claim that these sources shouldn't be used for.  The only other thing I have to say is these documents are very technical (see [http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2003-154/pdfs/1604.pdf this one], randomly chosen);  it is not clear what kind of encyclopedic plain english content can be generated from them...  () 05:10, 29 January 2016 (UTC)
 Statements to the effect of &quot;measurements of X amount of chemical Y will cause injury&quot; would not be documented in the Manual of Analytical Methods, but published as recommended exposure limits by NIOSH and permissible exposure limits by OSHA (as well as other values from other organizations, such as ACGIH's threshold limit value). The NIOSH REL and OSHA PELs should be considered reliable medical sources as they are official statements from national health/safety government agencies.  () 22:10, 29 January 2016 (UTC)

Agree it's &quot;heterochromia iridis&quot;. [http://omim.org/entry/142500 OMIM is also an excellent source] in situations like this. The last sentence of the first paragraph in that OMIM entry states that &quot;iridis&quot; (singular) applies to heterochromia in one iris, and &quot;iridum&quot; (plural) when the two irises differ in color. I do see a few MEDRS that use &quot;iridium&quot; when discussing the topic in passing, clearly (IMHO) consistent with a typographical/cognitive error - but I have not found a MEDRS describing &quot;iridium&quot; as a misspelling (so that critique in the lead sentence seems like ). Might be better to describe that spelling as uncommon.  —  () 00:02, 1 January 2016 (UTC)
 This was raised in 2011 at  and I've commented there. I would suggest sticking to what we can find in sources. As far as I've been able to ascertain, neither &quot;iridum&quot; nor &quot;iridium&quot; are found in classical Latin, because Iris was the name of just one goddess and wasn't used in the plural. It's only much later that we adopt the word iris for a part of the eye in English and have attempted to create a plural form in pseudo-Latin. Both the &quot;-um&quot; and the &quot;-ium&quot; endings are found for other comparable (third declension) words in Classical Latin, so either would seem to be possible. We just can't say that one or the other is &quot;not correct Latin&quot;. Is there a problem with picking the commonest from &quot;heterochromia iridis&quot;, &quot;heterochromia iridum&quot; and &quot;heterochromia iridium&quot; as the title, and having the other two as redirects? -- () 02:10, 1 January 2016 (UTC)

  As a linguist with classical training, I can assure you that I'm perfectly aware of third declension nouns and i-stems. You may hold the opinion that Iris is an i-stem, but there is no evidence whatsoever that it is the case. A noun which is only found in the singular in Classical Latin cannot possibly be determined to be an i-stem or not. &quot;Neo-Latin&quot; is a made-up language with no ability to reference usage beyond the Vatican, and the scientific/medical usage of pseudo-Latin terms that never have existed previously cannot claim to derive its authority from Latin.

 Yes, I'm also sorry I reacted sharply. As you have worked out, I meant to say &quot;the opinion that Iris is not an i-stem&quot;, and I'm sorry for the confusion. I accept completely the points you make about modern usage, but still maintain that Latin (i.e. Classical Latin if you follow the link) sheds no light on the genitive plural of &quot;Iris&quot;. I've yet to find a Latin concordance that shows any usage for &quot;Iris&quot; in the plural, although it's [http://latin.packhum.org/concordance?q=iris use in the singular is abundant]. As someone who was able to read the Aeneid in the original in the 1960s, I have a real respect for Latin, but I have less regard for its use in modern times to coin new words as it often has the effect of obscuring meaning for the lay audience.
 Finally, the debate was precipitated by the text that Anthony added, which asserts that &quot;iridium&quot; is incorrect in Classical Latin (as you can see from the wiki-link). I don't believe it is possible to make that determination, and don't think our encyclopedia should be making unsubstantiatable claims. Cheers -- () 19:03, 21 January 2016 (UTC)
