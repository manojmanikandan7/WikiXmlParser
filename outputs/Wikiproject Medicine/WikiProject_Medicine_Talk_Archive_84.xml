Except in the cases where the sources note the significance of the pricing (which did have consensus), there is no consensus to add the pricing to the articles. There were several ways to present this information proposed in the discussion (such as wikidata).  Please feel free to start a follow-up discussion regarding that. -  09:42, 9 July 2016 (UTC)

I have been including pricing information in medication articles. We have a good source [http://erc.msh.org/dmpguide/resultsdetail.cfm?language=english&amp;code=SAL01D&amp;s_year=2014&amp;year=2014&amp;str=100%20mcg%2Fdose&amp;desc=Salbutamol&amp;pack=new&amp;frm=INHALER&amp;rte=INH&amp;class_code2=&amp;supplement=&amp;class_name=%28%29%3Cbr%3E here] that gives the price range found internationally and in a number of countries in the developing world. Often the variation between prices is less than 5 fold. I have also been providing the US price as presented in [https://www.amazon.ca/Tarascon-Pharmacopoeia-2015-Professional-Reference/dp/1284075087/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1463352135&amp;sr=8-7&amp;keywords=tarascon+pharmacopoeia this book] but there are other good options. The US is not only a large portion of the EN speaking population but a large percentage of our readership. Also most other countries are somewhere between the global price and the US price.

A few late notes:
* Most of the sources provide average wholesale prices – the price paid by pharmacy buyers, not the price paid by individual consumers.  
* Most of the sources provide a price range, not a single number. 
* We have sources that provide both US wholesale prices and global wholesale prices.  There is no need to provide prices only from the US.
* Most drugs are generic, and the typical price for most generic drugs is relatively stable for years.

Support including pricing details
*Support as proposer per the following reasons: 
The most important reasons to provide this information is that it is useful to our readers, it is notable, and it can be well referenced. More useful I would argue than which episode of which American sitcom a disease or medication occurred in. A whole sub-domain of medical research is based on prices, that of cost benefit analysis. I would like to address some of the opposes:
*We do not have prices for all countries so we should therefore provide none.
**Organizations like the IDA Foundation sell at the prices we are quoting to all low and medium income countries (this is more than 100 countries).[http://erc.msh.org/mainpage.cfm?file=2.1.cfm&amp;id=13&amp;temptitle=List%20of%20Suppliers&amp;module=DMP&amp;language=english#IDA] This is better than we typically have regarding rates of diseases. Often rates of disease are only available for the United States and Europe and yet we still include them.
*We do not give prices in all currencies.
**We provide lot of numerical information such as the worth of a company in one currency. People know how to convert. We could build more tools to make conversion easier but that is another topic.

*Prices change widely from year to year.
**This is simply not true. If we look at the price data over time for salbutamol in the graph, prices generally remain stable for years. When they do change widely this is often commented on and should be included in WP. Prices do change when a med becomes generic but this is also notable and only occurs once.
*Prices vary widely between similar countries
**Also not true. We are quoting the wholesale prices available in all low and middle income countries. Prices in high income countries are also relatively similar. Typically for expensive medications there is no availability in the developing world other than going to the developing world and buying it.
*Some people have some coverage in certain countries so they should not care
**People are either paying directly as an out of pocket expense or indirectly via insurance or taxes. If you are lucky enough to have some entity paying on your behalf, how much they are paying is at least as interesting as what receptors something works on.
*Some of the arguments appear to be that because we cannot provide perfect information we should provide no information.
**We do not have perfect information for anything else either. How well does medication X work in Armenia or the DRC? We typically do not know as it has never been studied their. Or how well does medication X work among those with comobidites Y and Z? We also likely have no idea as meds are usually studied in a healthier than normal patient population (most people are excluded from trails). This however does not mean we should not provide data were it has been studied and among who it has been studied. Some applies to cost information.

Knowing how slow Wikipedia and Wikidata can sometimes be in updating information, it might be prudent to always associate a price with its date: &quot;The average 2015 wholesale price in the U.S. was x per standard dose. The average 2015 wholesale price in Australia was y per standard dose.&quot; -- ( ·  · )  04:14, 16 May 2016 (UTC)

*support only per my comment in the middle previous discussion, and not in infoboxes: &quot;If, as with some cancer drugs, the cost is exceptionally high, placing them out of reach of many patients even in the West, and that has been the subject of RS (it need not always be MEDRS-compliant) coverage, then certainly that should be added, in a section in the text. In England these matters are done in public in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence approval process, generating lots of RS coverage in some cases. Equally that aspirin is dirt cheap can easily be referenced. But I think we should avoid saying much about the mass of mid-price drugs, for the reasons set out above, plus the need (which we may not be able to cope with) to update when they come off-patent etc. We should just cover the extremes.

*Support. I wish to respond to Kashmiri's opposition arguments below, because they are all excellent reasons which must be directly addressed.
**Kashmiri refers to this English Wikipedia policy which historically says, &quot;no prices&quot;. . There is more discussion on this topic at . I do not think the prohibition in the policy is on prices specifically, but instead, the prohibition is on primary data and information which is not backed by reliable sources. Prices often are those things, but not always. Sometimes reliable sources make price information available for consumer reference, and in that case, Wikipedia might include the information.
**I agree that if price data is included then there has to be continual mindfulness about global markets. It is not acceptable to present only United States prices. I do not think Wikipedia has to be global, but there should be diversity in presenting data. If prices were presented, they could either be &quot;international&quot; somehow, or they could present more than one marketplace.
**I disagree that price data is irrelevant in OECD countries. I work for a consumer organization, Consumer Reports, which does activism and lobbying that more medical pricing data be made more public. Consumer REports advocates for greater public awareness of how drugs are purchased, and what happens to the many people who for whatever reason seek to buy drugs on the open market without the support of other funding programs.
**I am able to provide an organizational opinion that providing drug pricing information is not medical advice. Consumer Reports has published drug price information for decades and has done so in a way is not medical advice, and that establishes a precedent. Example publications presenting price information include the yearly [http://consumerhealthchoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/BBD2015BestDrugsForLess.pdf Best Drugs for Less] report, [http://consumerhealthchoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/BestPrice-FINAL.pdf educational materials directing consumers to consider price], and consumer guides for ~50 classes of drugs ([http://consumerhealthchoices.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/BBD-Statins-Full.pdf statins, for example]) which compare &quot;effectiveness, safety, and price&quot;. It often happens that there can be multiple drugs available to treat a medical condition and price is a major guiding factor in choosing which one is appropriate for the patient. It is politically difficult to acknowledge that people get different medical care depending on the money they have, but it is the reality, and having access to information on drug prices makes it easier for consumers have discussions with their health care providers about what sort of treatment matches their health care needs and the money they have.
**I might agree that there is not consensus to add prices, but at the same time, I disagree that there is consensus to exclude them. I think it would be best to say that lots of people have varying opinions on the matter, and it is difficult to come to agreement on what is best. I do think there is consensus that without good sources to cite, Wikipedia definitely should not attempt to include price information.
Here are things that I would want to see if prices remained in Wikipedia articles:
#Excellent sourcing. Right now [http://erc.msh.org/dmpguide/ International Drug Price Indicator Guide] and the [https://www.amazon.ca/Tarascon-Pharmacopoeia-2015-Professional-Reference/dp/1284075087 Tarascon Pharmacopoeia 2015 Professional Desk Reference Edition] are proposed as sources. It might be worthwhile to critique these or any sources to confirm or deny that they are respected, reliable, and presenting the sort of information which meets Wikipedia goals to be international and meet general reader needs.
#Discussion about what kinds of prices are acceptable, and what are not acceptable. For example, there might be consensus that Wikipedia only present prices at the consumer level, and exclude prices at the industry or wholesale level. Whatever the case, perhaps it would be helpful to discuss restrictions and limits in advance.  makes a sensible suggestion that only the best established prices be mentioned. In the case of drugs, it is easier to describe the cheapest off-patent drugs and the latest, most expensive and highly controlled drugs. Discussing the mid-level markets where the variation is greatest is most difficult. I am not sure what is possible.
#There should be discussion about international relevance. I have a lot of sympathy for India, which Kashmiri mentioned. In India practically everyone buys out of pocket from local pharmacies. India is a major drug market and would be a great contrast to pricing information from OECD countries. Even if there is no ready solution to providing drug information relevant to Wikipedia readers in India, I think it would be helpful to state that it is a problem if Wikipedia were presenting price information for some places but was not providing a solution for price information in India. China would be another good market to address, but I think it would be easier to eventually get data relevant to India since India's drug market responds to international drug import and export markets more than China's more state controlled market.

* Cautious support. We're not a price comparison website (CHEAP VIAGRA HERE) but medication pricing is a public health issue and would be encyclopedic.  |  09:48i, 19 May 2016 (UTC)
*Strongest possible support wherever sources are available. This is a major factor in the profitability of drug companies, and what drives the profitability of a particular company is almost always important information about that company.  Not knowing that the vast majority of Cephalon's $2.8g in profit comes from two types of fentanyl (fentora, actinq) that either have expired or soon to expire patents and wo types of modafinil (provigil, nuvigil - yes guys sorry but they are the same damn thing,) might lead one to false conclusions about the future profitably of Cephalon - a company that makes 3b now - but only made 400m a year before they bought the rights to modafinil through the orphan drug program only to jack them up to what they are now - unless Cephalon manages to find another similar drug to exploit, their profits are likely to decline significantly within seven years. Such price increases greatly increase the skepticism the orphan drug program, and explains why some support policies similar to India's.  This is at the extreme end, but one of the drugs I am on costs approximately $20,000 a month while costing, if I'm reading the DoJ report correctly, under $20 to produce.  This combined with wikipedia'a article made more clear the reason behind the behavior of the pharmacist's at the pharmaceutical company - they've been under continuous threat of losing exclusivity for not reporting safety events. When you have tens of thousands of patent that costs you $20 a patient a month and make you $20,000 each, you're going to be obsessive about reporting any perceived safety event, while aggressively gaslighting you regarding any actual significant safety event that occurs.  Since it's a risk evaluation management drug w/ fda, I guess I'll be talking to the FDA and the state board of pharmacy tomorrow. I already had objections to things like the orphan drug program, but reading relaed articles on-wiki as well as this debate itself was certainly to me. Even if we reach a general 'no', I'd say still include price data for a drug patented by someone who works at the VA 9/10 of the time that treats a disease frequently acquired in war.. that he made too expensive for the VA, his regular employer, to pay for much of the time.  Sorry for the random typos keyboard issues today.  |

* Support - I am a registered Pharmacist in India and this is a useful information to have on Wikipedia. National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority controls pricing for drug and prices are stable most of the time. Net worth of a company or organization is given only in one currency and people are smart to convert it in local currency.  () 10:25, 2 June 2016 (UTC)
 Just to respond briefly to this; I am sure we can all appreciate that there might be value in having access to wholesale prices determined by the NPPA in India, by the NHS in England and by others in other jurisdictions. The first issue is whether that is a proper role for wikipedia. I'd argue no, for reasons others have given elsewhere in this discussion. But second, this isn't even what is being proposed here, which is a range of wholesale prices made up from partial data taken in spot instances in specific places to give a range of values, which might be different by 100 or 1000 times. It'll be utterly useless for determining anything much about the likely wholesale prices in India or in any other jurisdiction that isn't known to be at one or other end of the range of prices.  () 14:01, 2 June 2016 (UTC)
Would be useful JMWt if you provided some evidence to support your claims. The IDA Foundation sells pharmaceuticals in India and they are typically within the ranges that are being provided. So yes the price range provided for low and middle income countries does help one determine the price in India as it is one of those countries. The price range in this group of countries for salbutamol is 1.12 to 2.64 USD.[http://erc.msh.org/dmpguide/resultsdetail.cfm?language=english&amp;code=SAL01D&amp;s_year=2014&amp;year=2014&amp;str=100%20mcg%2Fdose&amp;desc=Salbutamol&amp;pack=new&amp;frm=INHALER&amp;rte=INH&amp;class_code2=&amp;supplement=&amp;class_name=%28%29%3Cbr%3E] I highly doubt you could find a med that has a difference of 10 times let alone 100 or 1000 times on [http://erc.msh.org/mainpage.cfm?file=1.0.htm&amp;module=DMP&amp;language=english this website] [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 14:48, 2 June 2016 (UTC)
 It'd be useful if you didn't just keep pointing to the same source and instead tried reading what others are saying. For example [http://www.searo.who.int/publications/journals/seajph/issues/complete-issue.pdf#page=82 this WHO report] which showed significant variations on the wholesale purchasing prices within India, with some states paying more than the lowest available retail price for salbutamol (page 83 of that paper). Even within India the WHO found significant variations in wholesale price for salbutamol - a sample medication you've introduced for discussion and not me. I don't know whether India is within the range you've described (I doubt it given the booming local pharma industry there) and cannot see how you could possibly know whether the wholesale price in other developing countries was within 10 times of the lowest stated.   () 15:20, 2 June 2016 (UTC)
This &quot;'paying more than the lowest available retail price&quot; is one reason why we should include this information:-) The lack of transparency / availability of prices is one of the reasons why this occurs.  is from India maybe he could answer your question regarding if India is in this the price range presented.

 I was born with severe Asthma and Salbutamol literally saved my life in difficult times. I purchased it from various locations over a period of time. It is available in given price range. As I was born in rural India - it was difficult to understand how it worked and I learned about pharmacodynamics using Wikipedia. Along with functionality, pricing is another angle which is equally important and awareness can save many lives. Most of the drugs are subsidized in India and 'on humanitarian grounds' - Price range can help/encourage people to buy drugs and it might be useful to keep a check on malpractices.

An example of this may be &quot;people in most parts of Africa have issues getting access to drugs due to the staggering price&quot; hurts the readers perception of Africa. Instead of excluding the successful countries in South Africa explicitly in the sentence, creating awkward phrasing, and feeding into the perception of Africa as a monolithic structure. By providing the raw data, it can help relieve this bias and provide the reader with a better picture of why a health issue effects a region more than another. As long as the information comes from a reliable, third party source, I see no issue with this. I also wonder if WikiData integration would also be possible.

Oppose including pricing details
* Strongly oppose on various grounds, including WP policies:
**  states clearly that Wikipedia is not a sales catalogue and item's current pricing is NOT encyclopaedic information.
** Wikipedia articles are (mostly) about specific compounds used in pharmacology; WP even requires use of INN names. Whereas pricing can only be given for commercial products.
** Per , Wikipedia is a GLOBAL ENCYCLOPAEDIA and the majority of English Wikipedia readers are based outside of the US.[https://stats.wikimedia.org/wikimedia/squids/SquidReportPageViewsPerLanguageBreakdown.htm#English]
** US drug prices are among the highest in the world [http://www.statista.com/statistics/496169/price-ratio-canadia-to-foreign-drug-prices/] [http://mic.com/articles/125688/here-s-how-much-more-the-us-spends-on-medicine-than-everyone-else-in-6-charts]. Consequently, quoting US prices will be very misleading.
** The majority of OECD countries offer public health insurance coverage to their populations, with many (or sometimes all) drugs paid for by the state. Prices found in US pharmacies are utterly irrelevant for those populations.
** We run a real risk that if we advertise lower prices, patients might be discouraged from buying the medicines they need, instead hoping to find them somewhere cheaper; and thus harming their health. That's the reason Wikipedia is very clear that .
** From the links listed by OP, there seems to be a consensus on not adding retail pricing on Wikipedia at all.

You missed the qualifiers at  which is &quot;unless there is an independent source and a justified reason for the mention&quot;
It is not a medical product unless you can actually buy it.
43% of our readers are in the USA [https://stats.wikimedia.org/wikimedia/squids/SquidReportPageViewsPerLanguageBreakdown.htm#English]
As mentioned we are providing a range of prices which applies to dozens if not more than a hundred countries. There is also a global market in medications.
US prices are among the highest in the world and therefore giving US prices typically provides an upper limit.
That the majority of OECD countries pays for medications for outpts will need a reference. It is not the case in Canada.

*I don't really know what section to comment in. Is the question whether prices can sometimes be included, or that we should include prices routinely? I don't think anyone will argue that pricing information is never appropriate – but if the proposal is to include prices routinely, then the proposal appears to violate . From NOTDIRECTORY, the use of pricing information requires a &quot;justified reason,&quot; and specifically excludes &quot;passing mention.&quot; The prices [http://erc.msh.org/dmpguide/resultsdetail.cfm?language=english&amp;code=SAL01D&amp;s_year=2014&amp;year=2014&amp;str=100%20mcg%2Fdose&amp;desc=Salbutamol&amp;pack=new&amp;frm=INHALER&amp;rte=INH&amp;class_code2=&amp;supplement=&amp;class_name=%28%29%3Cbr%3E here] appear to be passing mentions; the source is a database page with no commentary or context. I don’t have access to the Tarascon Pharmacopoeia, but I infer from the description that it's similar. 

The standard here is that inclusion should require a source that includes the price as part of a discussion; simply listing it should not be sufficient. This is also in accordance with the comments of several other editors, including a couple in the discussion section that I think are otherwise most easily categorized as Opposes. If e.g. a drug's price has been criticized in the media, that's important information and it should be sourced appropriately. But finding the price in a database, or in any other context where it is presented without commentary, does nothing to establish its relevance to the article. 

I also agree with the editors who oppose listing of prices in infoboxes; I see not listing prices in such a manner as one of the key qualitative differences that distinguish us from catalogues and other commercial websites. But inclusion in Wikidata is a different matter, and could be worth considering assuming that their policies allow it. [[User:Sunrise|Sunrise]] () 19:53, 16 May 2016 (UTC)

* Oppose. Nothing good can come out of this - what seriously is it supposed to achieve? We know for a fact that the British NHS pays within a five-fold (what does that mean? 5 orders of magnitude? Five times?) difference of the wholesale price in India?  I think, knowing how international products are traded, that's highly unlikely. And a conversion from USD to the local currency is going to mean almost nothing, as the wholesale price in any given market is going to vary enormously based on many different factors, so suggesting that it is &quot;available&quot; for this price means almost nothing outside of the USA.  And the fact that 43% of readers are in the USA (which I doubt anyway) means that 57% are not.  Why should the rest of us be fed information which is only relevant to a minority of readers in the USA? If you want USA-centric information, why don't you start your own digital encyclopedia.

  I don't think I can access that page, but there is pretty good evidence that global prices vary much more than the quotes you've given, which appear to compare spot prices in a small number of locations. It is fairly easy to find wide disparities in price for specific medications in the literature, for example this recent article from the Lancet [http://thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X%2815%2900156-4/fulltext] &quot;The price per bottle of all originator DAAs varied substantially: for sofosbuvir it ranged from $300 (India, Pakistan) to $20 590 (Switzerland); for daclatasvir from $175 (Egypt) to $14 899 (Germany); for simeprevir from $241 (Egypt) to $14 865 (Australia); for ledipasvir-sofosbuvir from $400 (Egypt and Mongolia) to $24 890 (Germany); and for ombitasvir-paritaprevir-ritonavir (or 2D regimen) from $400 (Egypt) to $20 215 (Switzerland).&quot; I accept that's not talking about wholesale prices, but I'm not sure why we should have confidence that the reference you're using is fully comparing the full range of prices worldwide.

The prices quoted by the IDA Foundation is avaliable in more than 100 countries per [http://erc.msh.org/mainpage.cfm?file=2.1.cfm&amp;id=13&amp;temptitle=List%20of%20Suppliers&amp;module=DMP&amp;language=english#IDA]. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 09:50, 2 June 2016 (UTC) 
Strong, strong oppose per  who makes a number of very good points including about our global nature, national insurance schemes, not listing prices, and misleading readers. A global wholesale price doesn't reflect at all the large amount of other English-speaking countries who may subsidize or nationally or regionally negotiate or mandate prices. Some of these other large countries include the UK and India and as per  57% of our readers. As a non-US reader I am completely opposed to a misleading and potentially harmful effort that doesn't reflect the reality of sale prices for 57% of our readers, nor take into account insurance rebates etc. I don't think this issue can be dealt with in the same nuance that we'd expect of a WP article, and such a nuance certainly not in an infobox.-- () 02:27, 18 May 2016 (UTC)

Strong oppose - see my comment in the discussion below for my rationale, and 's excellent comment. This does not belong in Wikipedia.  () 03:29, 18 May 2016 (UTC)
* Strongly Oppose. Per NOT. While there are many cases where prices can and should be included as part of encyclopedic content, it has to be on a case-by-case basis. Unless I'm overlooking something, I'm not seeing arguments that clearly show NOT should be overruled for all medications. -- () 17:52, 20 May 2016 (UTC)
* Weak Oppose with basically the same caveats as Johnbods support above. Per WP:NOT we shouldn't attempt to become a pricing list but where price has been a factor in the coverage then prices should be included. I don't think it should be in the infobox as it will always need more clarification than an infobox can provide as to where and when the price is from.  () 16:03, 24 May 2016 (UTC)
* Oppose I am not terribly excited about this, but I generally agree with the foregoing opposes, and in any case I am generally reluctant to support any form of tabular data that requires regular updating. It is an invitation to error, confusion and embarrassment, as well as being doubtfully encyclopaedic. I an unconvinced anyway, that any such table could give comprehensive and intelligible information on the subject, but am not inclined to study how deeply I am in error on this point.  If instead there were to be a link to an off-WP site that could supply the service, I reckon I could hold still for that.  () 14:56, 25 May 2016 (UTC)
*(Summoned by bot) Oppose, basically per  above, with no opposition to inclusion on a case to case basis (when price of a single drug or a group of few drugs has been discussed by an RS); strong oppose to listing retail prices in a particular country.
The most deciding argument in my mind is &quot;which price&quot;? Just as for pretty much any product, &quot;the&quot; price does not exist as there are various retail/wholesale prices (this has been said multiple times already), but unlike any products, few if any drugs have a large international market with listed prices for similar products. On a particular day, bananas or oil have an &quot;international&quot; value on the market (despite minor differences among the products); drugs except maybe aspirin or other big-quantity-sellers do not have that.
I think however that the updating issues is not a problem, if we decide we want to include prices we can just use prose with . [[User:Tigraan|Tigraan]][[User talk:Tigraan|Click here to contact me]] 11:45, 27 May 2016 (UTC)
* Oppose. Preditable, price info depends on: country, insurance policy, personal situation, drug process. There is no single reasonable 'single' cost estimation. - () 20:56, 29 May 2016 (UTC)
** Do  realize that we're talking about the wholesale prices, not what a particular person pays at the pharmacy counter?  Also, do you realize that while there's no &quot;single&quot; cost, there are very good sources that provide price ranges, which would let us make well-sourced statements along the lines of &quot;two to five cents per dose in most countries, as of 2016&quot;?   () 15:48, 30 May 2016 (UTC)
Even 'wholesale prices' are fragmented by region, insurance policy, legal policy, paybacks, prescription incentives, dose-per-cure, other marketing tools, etc., in general. Legal drugs do not have a free market (unlike e.g. oil and copper). Worse, wholesale prices are not public and so rather meaningless to our Reader. Even if we simplify the problem to regions only (price in a country), we enter a 200-point data row. (the similar legal status of  infobox drug has 8+1 separate regions/jurisdictions; rightly there are questions about this infobox data expansion into vapourspace). - () 11:36, 31 May 2016 (UTC)

*Oppose, Wikipedia's purpose is not to provide specific pricing information, especially in something as specialized, complex, and variable as drug prices. However, when multiple reliable sources actually discuss (as opposed to just list or note) an item's price, it may be suitable for inclusion in that particular case. (The Martin Shkreli incident would make a good example.) But as a general practice, no, we do not and should not routinely include pricing.   13:28, 31 May 2016 (UTC)

 I did mean to get back to you on this, but have been rather swamped. Something like that doesn't discuss the price, just lists it. That's the exact type of thing that doesn't justify including pricing information. In order to provide  to including information on price (which should be an exception, not the rule), reliable references should go into detail about why the price matters. That could be something like the Shkreli incident, or conversely, if sources discuss how a new treatment will revolutionize practice by making a formerly prohibitively expensive treatment affordable, we should reflect that in the article. But we shouldn't ever be including pricing information as a matter of course just because a source happens to list the price, it would require significant coverage.   09:36, 17 June 2016 (UTC)

 If the prices are discussed (not just mentioned) in reliable sources, I'm fine with that. I've changed the title of my vote so it is more clear that I am only opposing conditionally.

* Strongly oppose. There are four basic reasons: 1) if you start including sales information on one product, there is no reason to exclude another; 2) price information on most commodities changes too often to renew it all the time, and outdated information lowers the quality of the articles; 3) price information on any kind of products tends to be unclear and dubitable, which in turn opens the way to NPOV; 4) Wikipedia is too Amerocentric as it is, there is absolutely no need to tilt it even more. -- () 21:55, 3 June 2016 (UTC)

The English Wikipedia isn't a global encyclopedia, per se, even though it aims to have as broad coverage as possible - its in English, which automatically cuts out the billions of people that don't speak English. What makes the Wikimedia projects global is that there are Wikipedia encyclopedias in 250+ languages. [[User:Nathan|Nathan]][[User talk:Nathan|  T  ]] 13:32, 4 June 2016 (UTC)
 Rubbish. It is a global encyclopaedia edited in English by people around the globe and reflecting topics important in a range of different geographical locations. What it clearly is not is an &quot;American Wikipedia&quot;. That's an incredibly offensive position.  () 14:00, 4 June 2016 (UTC)


*Very Strongly oppose. I won't recite the policies and guidelines listed by the other editors who also oppose this idea, but I completely agree them. Do we really want the encyclopedia to become the place where consumers come shopping for the best prices on medications? What about medical equipment? Therapies? Surgical supplies? Also I have concerns with the assumption that a medication manufactured here in the US, under the watch of the FDA is the same medication sold in Namibia or Haiti. Just because a drug has a certain 'title' does not mean that the other ingredients such as fillers are identical. Also, in less regulated countries, there is no guarantee that the drug even contains its active ingredients. Some global entrepreneurs may see this new information on a drug as a marketing tool and begin to influence the pricing structure to attract mail-order sales. In the poorest countries, I envision the nightmare of a whole industry springing up based upon the lowest pricing 'proven' by citing Wikipedia. I love Canada and have gone there to pick up some medications that were much less expensive that were subsequently confiscated by US Customs as I reentered the US. (I didn't know that this was illegal, oh well, now I do.) If some wants prices on medications, let them go to Google. This new proposal is humorous and ironic, since I recently had information about the availability and prescription requirement on a biological 'drug' deleted from an article with no explanation. So at best, this practice of providing pricing information is currently inconsistently practiced. Another concern is that the prescribing requirements differ between countries. If I am a consumer and I see that a prescription drug is slightly more inexpensive in Mexico AND I don't want to or can't afford to pay a physician in the US to prescribe it, I most certainly would drive across the border to purchase my self-prescribed medication. Are we also going to include the information that a drug is NOT available at any price in the US, Canada, UK, Australia? But hey, according to Wikipedia there is another country where you CAN get it? Please no. Best Regards,

 we do not include medication dosing information but yes we do include where a medication is and is not available already. The discuss is to include wholesale price as described by reliable sources. This is different than just googling the price.[[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 16:29, 4 June 2016 (UTC)
*Oppose. What I pay my pharmacist, what the pharmacist pays the wholesaler, and what the manufacturer receives from the wholesaler, are likely to be very different amounts. And there's likely to be a subsidy paid by, or a tax received by, my country's government. Pharmaceuticals are  nothing like oil, aluminium, bitcoins, or even cars, which are all, more or less, fungible.
*Oppose any exact numbers, per WP:PRICE. On the other hand, qualitative analysis of prices may be  included in case-by-case basis depending on the notability of the corresponding research, per  .  () 22:09, 9 June 2016 (UTC)
*Oppose except in specific cases like Oseltamivir or Pyrimethamine where the price is a genuinely significant part of the story. Including pricing as a matter of course has far too many potential downsides—confusion when prices vary between countries, patients who don't understand wholesale pricing and think their pharmacist is ripping them off when they get charged more than &quot;what Wikipedia says the price should be&quot;, patients who are discouraged from seeking treatment when a high price spooks them, patients outside North America who don't understand that US/Canadian prices are generally much higher than elsewhere and thus assume the medication they're being sold at  of what Wikipedis says is the going rate must be a placebo rather than the real thing so don't bother taking it… Remember, Wikipedia's main readership is primarily comprised of people with a medical knowledge no higher than &quot;aspirin for headaches, antihistamines for hay fever&quot;. For us to include information with such a high potential to cause confusion (and which would create a permanent maintenance backlog, since the prices would need to keep being re-checked) there would need to be a clear and obvious benefit; I can't see a benefit in this case, since to most readers prices would at best be meaningless clutter and at worst be actively misleading, and those who do want to know the wholesale prices can easily find them elsewhere, likely with more up-to-date data than that being used by Wikipedia. ‑  22:32, 9 June 2016 (UTC)
*Oppose – the information is highly variable both spatially (due to different prices in different countries) and geographically (due to changes in prices over time). It will be difficult to provide this information in a globally comprehensive way and it will have a strong tendency of becoming outdated over time. Due to these factors, Wikipedia in general avoids including pricing information on anything (not just drugs), but there is no reason to treat drugs differently here from anything else. The existence of reliable sources for pricing information doesn't overcome the concerns about the information's high spatiotemporal variability, since however reliable they may be, they are generally speaking non-comprehensive sources giving prices only in certain markets at certain times. If a drug is exceptionally notable for being of high price (see e.g. media stories about whether private insurance companies or public health systems should pay for some extremely expensive drugs), there can be a justification for including information on its price in those specific cases, but not generally.  () 08:06, 11 June 2016 (UTC)
*Oppose - I agree with the guidance at  that was should not be including prices. I find the other examples of exceptions to that guidance unconvincing, as they all seem to be instances when the price was an important part of that particular subject, like a first at a a particular pricepoint or extensive coverage of the price in particular. There are also a few articles which, despite being FAs, have prices which wouldn't survive an RfC on the subject (if anyone cared that much). What's proposed here is a blanket exception not for a particular article but for an entire category. There are some good arguments in favor, don't get me wrong, but I think for an exception to  to be made on that scale, there needs to be (a) truly compelling reasons, or else (b) a discussion at  about the application of that guideline, absent something more specific. For the record, though, it seems reasonable, if there's agreement on a source/database, to include an external link to price information (for example, in an infobox). — [[User:Rhododendrites|Rhododendrites]]  \\ 19:37, 11 June 2016 (UTC)
WP:NOT says &quot;An article should not include product pricing or availability information unless there is an independent source and a justified reason for the mention&quot;. The proposal is simply to follow WP:NOT. The proposal is to use independent sources and there is a justified reason as this represents an entire sub field of medicine. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 00:08, 12 June 2016 (UTC)
So, this may be an area of ignorance for me. Are you saying that in the body of reliable sources about a particular drug, there would be sufficient coverage of the price such that you could make a claim of ? I would be very reluctant to say that any whole category of product is going to have price be one of the things the sources cover to a sufficient extent. That's because the bigger issue with  is the part you left out: &quot;Wikipedia is not a price comparison service to compare the prices of competing products, or the prices and availability of a single product from different vendors or retailers.&quot; Together I understand this to mean that price does not have inherent informational value relevant to Wikipedia. While we have the effect of influencing purchase decisions, that's not the point. So we need more than just the informative value of the price to merit including it in an article, and wouldn't include the price by default even where a affordability is a relevant subject to the broader subject. We should include prices when there's a weight claim to include in a particular article, with sources that discuss the price as an aspect of the subject, not at a point of data. — [[User:Rhododendrites|Rhododendrites]]  \\ 14:49, 12 June 2016 (UTC)
There are agencies in many countries that set maximum allowed prices for prescription pharmaceuticals. They do this by reviewing the prices in different jurisdictions. For essential medicines the World Health Organization does a cost benefit analysis for each of them. So for essential medicines at least there is plenty of sources to justify .
I would argue that this information deserves more weight than say [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hydrocodone/paracetamol&amp;curid=9651517&amp;diff=724939213&amp;oldid=721698385 what song lyrics it occurs in] [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 15:34, 12 June 2016 (UTC)
That's more or less in line with what I would presume: that there are some articles for which price should be included given . But that's already allowed under current policies/guidelines, as you've said, and an RfC wouldn't be necessary for that. I interpret this RfC as seeking consensus for a blanket exception such that any article in a particular category could/would include price regardless of weight.
As an aside, you won't typically get an argument from me if you want to remove &quot;in popular culture&quot; sections/sentences. :) — [[User:Rhododendrites|Rhododendrites]]  \\ 15:54, 12 June 2016 (UTC)
It's a hard call, but I think Doc James is probably right.  It's probably more efficient to have an RFC about whether to do this generally (not &quot;always&quot;, but under appropriate circumstances) than to fight a hundred individual battles with editors who have never read anything more of NOTPRICE than its shortcut, or who have difficulty understanding that the line in NOTPRICE that says &quot;unless there is an independent source and a justified reason for the mention&quot; means &quot;if you have an independent source and a justified reason, then you actually should include the price&quot;.  Or who just misunderstood the goal, as evidenced by the themes in multiple comments here.  We could mash several together to get an objection that amounts to, &quot;Don't include wholesale prices in developing countries in Africa, South America, and Asia, because no two Americans pay the same retail price for a drug.&quot;  Unless they go to Walmart, in which case hundreds of them cost $4.  () 16:58, 12 June 2016 (UTC)
Right about what? Or, more specifically, what is the point of disagreement which I have wrong? I can't really blame anyone for being confused, as this is an RfC with no question to answer. The question has to be inferred by a general statement that someone has been adding price information and the section headings (&quot;Support including pricing details&quot; and &quot;Oppose including pricing details&quot;). Hence I don't see how one could interpret this RfC as anything other than seeking consensus to add prices to articles about medications broadly. Of course I wouldn't interpret an RfC to mean &quot;should we follow the rules as they current exist&quot;, because consensus is already established for that and opposition here wouldn't actually overturn those rules. — [[User:Rhododendrites|Rhododendrites]]  \\ 17:29, 12 June 2016 (UTC)
I think that Doc James is right to start an RFC.  Even though what he wants to do already is permitted under the &quot;rules as they currently exist&quot;, many editors are unaware of what the rules actually say.  Having this discussion helps people get on the same page. Besides, we seem to be learning useful things, e.g., from Nathan's comments about the incompleteness of the data behind the U.S. numbers.

I personally don't feel like we should include price information in an encyclopedia. Here's why:
* The price varies depending on country
** In Canada, the end-user price varies depending on province/insurance. Wholesale prices are controlled to some extent by the government.
** In the UK, the end-user price is a flat fee set by the NHS. Prices are controlled to some extent by the government.
** In the US, the end-user price varies depending on insurance status (have insurance vs. paying cash) and insurance benefits (lots of different ways to handle drug coverage - percentage-based, flat copays, deductables, etc). Additionally:
*** It varies based on what pharmacy you go to (store X (e.g. CVS) vs. store Y (e.g. Walgreens), retail vs. discounted retail (e.g. Walmart) vs. mail-order)
*** It varies if you use discounts, which can be third party (&quot;drug savings card&quot;?), manufacturer coupons (usually time-limited), manufacturer-paid (low income programs), etc
*** It varies based on the pharmacy benefits manager used and the drug formulary.
*** It varies based on insurance plan
Another major point is that when a generic for a brand-name drug comes out, prices can change drastically overnight. Medication prices are always changing, and there's no way that we can keep up with prices, which will be completely inaccurate for anyone seeking pricing information anyways as we're generally listing wholesale prices, which do not factor in several additional layers of profit margins, and are utterly useless to the average person.
Here's a personal example for a hypothetical drug (although this is actually based on a real medication I'm on). I pay a fixed copay for this drug of $A. The pharmacy claims the drug cost $B on the info accompanying the drug (and that my insurer saved me $(B - A)). My insurer's report says they paid the pharmacy $C for the drug. $B is much greater than $(A + C). The cash price that pharmacy would charge for the same drug is $D according to GoodRX, which is close to the pharmacy's official cash price of $B. If you use GoodRX's discount program, you would pay $E.
Confusing, right?  () 23:55, 15 May 2016 (UTC)

*I don't much like the idea of simply including the price indiscriminately or as a matter of routine. And considering what Garzfoth said just above, it may be better to use wholesale than retail pricing, or to indicate a range of prices. But I think the decision about whether to include pricing at all depends upon context. As Doc James said, it becomes relevant in the context of cost-benefit analysis, etc. So if, for a particular drug, there is content about something significant concerning cost-benefit or other analyses or classifications, then specific pricing information can and probably should be stated explicitly in that content. On the other hand, simply saying routinely for each drug that its typical price is such-and-such strikes me as unencyclopedic, and I would not want to see prices in infoboxes. -- () 00:22, 16 May 2016 (UTC)
** We are using the whole sale price and we are providing a range of prices. We are not writing for &quot;patients&quot;. Someone pays. Many people care about the price and price often determined what meds are covered.

 has some interesting ideas, but I don't think that they hold up under scrutiny:
* &quot; states clearly that...current pricing is NOT encyclopaedic information.&quot;
*# PRICE says that encyclopedic relevance can be established if the prices are discussed in good sources, and discussion of price is typical for generic drugs and universal for drugs still under (or recently released from) patent protection.
*# Who said that it would only include &quot;current pricing&quot;?  It'd be far more interesting to include information about how the price changed over time (e.g., once a decade for as far back as our sources go).
* &quot;pricing can only be given for commercial products.&quot;
** If it gets sold, then it's a commercial product, so this seems like a tautology.  Perhaps you mean that prices can only be given for particular combinations of brand name/manufacturer/location/time?  That wouldn't be factually true; we have good sources that give wholesale prices from around the world, based upon the compound itself.
* &quot;quoting US prices will be very misleading....Prices found in US pharmacies are utterly irrelevant for those populations.&quot;
** Who said that we'd be quoting only US prices?  Who said that we'd be giving prices for any pharmacy?  The goal is the wholesale price, not retail.
* &quot;We run a real risk that if we advertise lower prices, patients might be discouraged from buying the medicines they need&quot;
** Wikipedia is , even to protect people from their own ignorance about the difference between global wholesale prices and local retail prices.   () 13:34, 16 May 2016 (UTC)
*It strikes me that WP is the wrong place for such data to reside, though (depending on discussion results) it might be a good place for readers to find it. Price data is still data, and there's no real reason to bind it to an English language text format. It would be much more at home on Wikidata in a language-neutral form. Then insertions, revisions, national prices, currencies, and references inserted there once will be reflected on all using wikis simultaneously. We should avoid creating a local crapheap on w:en that just has to be cleaned up after the fact.  [[User talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl!]] 16:12, 16 May 2016 (UTC)
Yes Wikidata has now been set up from what I understand to handle this data. I am not much of a Wikidata editor though.
I have just shown that the price of salbutamol internationally has not changed in 20 years  so not sure what &quot;cleanup&quot; you are referring to? Yes medications become generic once in their existence. We have a number of currencies that are used internationally with the USD and Euro being two of them.

 Doc James: For sure you mean Zimbabwe?

But ok, let's agree on USD or EUR, that still does not address the key questions raised above. And BTW even if price of salbutamol, a patent-free small molecule, has not changed in 20 years (I can't locate your proof, though), the most problematic and expensive drugs are those still covered by patents and/or in the marketing exclusivity period, and their prices can vary several orders of magnitude between countries. — [[User:Kashmiri|kashmiri]] [[User talk:Kashmiri|TALK]] 17:58, 16 May 2016 (UTC)
If you look at were I provide prices for salbutamol by year you will notice a link to the reference beside each.
With respect to countries that like USD I am thinking of Cuba, much of Central America, and much of Africa. In Tanzania they request payment of not only bribes but entry fees and hotel rooms in USD. Iran also requires payment of hotel fees and tour fees in either USD or Euro. 
You mention &quot;vary several orders of magnitude between countries&quot;. Several orders of magnitude fold is very small. If they varied by 10 or 100 fold that would be a stronger argument.
We already give a price range of salbutamol of 1.12 to 50 USD. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 18:15, 16 May 2016 (UTC)
It's probably worth pointing out here that one order of magnitude is 10 fold; two orders of magnitude equals 100 fold. In any event, I'm not entirely convinced that it is a good idea to quote an &quot;international price&quot; in USD due to currency inflation and changes in forex valuations.

I'm not saying an international price shouldn't be quoted in USD; if one quoted at all, it should be in USD because that's easily the most actively traded/liquid currency in the world.  I'm just not convinced that a USD quote would be particularly useful to someone who doesn't live in the US because they'd literally need to look up their exchange rate and convert it to their currency for context (i.e., to compare the price of the drug relative to the price of other things they buy in their currency).

[[User talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl!]] 18:49, 17 May 2016 (UTC)
 ok, but that's quite misleading, because there are lots of reasons why products have different wholesale prices in different markets. An item might well be available for $x in the USA but be a completely different price elsewhere. Given that some medications are particularly sold in some jurisdictions at or below cost and some are vastly expensive in others, some spot wholesale price in one place is totally useless when one desires to know how much it would be to get a wholesale purchase where I am, Unless I happen to be in the USA. There is no &quot;global wholesale&quot; price of anything. How are you imagining this information would be informing the global WP reader?   () 21:25, 17 May 2016 (UTC)

 It's not a red herring at all. It's a real problem that is resolved by listing the US price with the price quoted in other major English speaking countries' currencies; the converted price needs to be updated with the closing exchange rate from the preceding day in order to circumvent the issue. [[User:Seppi333|Seppi333]] () 22:28, 17 May 2016 (UTC)
@ not just a matter of exchange rates at all. You can look at how national pricing of the new Hepatitis drugs such as  to gain some insight into the determinants of pricing in non-US countries. As you may have encountered there are legislative approaches to essential and nonessential drugs, pricing of generies, and national or regional negotiation strategies that countries employ -- not to mention that many of these costs are not passed on in many non-US countries to the end users, who may have national or private insurance policies that reduce or rebate the costs of the drugs. Not an issue that can be simply dealt with by exchange rates.-- () 02:32, 18 May 2016 (UTC)
I realize this.  There's 4 price issues that have been discussed in this section: wholesale price variability in USD over time, USD inflation, pricing USD in other currencies, and the additional cost of a drug above the wholesale price which is unique to each nation and varies by government subsidization and/or private insurance. I'm just talking about the forex issue here. [[User:Seppi333|Seppi333]] () 02:42, 18 May 2016 (UTC)
It seems rather obvious that we cannot provide &quot;it costs X at the retail pharmacy at the corner of Main and Bank in city Y&quot; for every retailer. Sensible retail pricing is likely not going to be at all feasible. It might be attainable to say that globally the wholesale prices for a standard quantity range from a low seen at about INR M to a high seen at about SFR N, with dated USD equivalents and citations of the form &quot;On that date, one SFR was worth USD d. The reader can do the arithmetic if sufficiently interested, it's good practice for them. [[User talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl!]] 16:19, 18 May 2016 (UTC)
So many editors keep focusing on individual consumers.  There's more to the economy than the guy who got prescribed antibiotics this morning and is trying to figure out whether he can save a little bit of money by going to a different pharmacy.  Average global wholesale prices are far more important (to the world, to public health, to the global economy, to governments) than whether a given individual pays X or Y.  
Also, we should just use whatever currency is used by our sources.  It happens that it will be mostly US dollars.   () 14:49, 19 May 2016 (UTC)
break
The problem is, &quot;global average prices&quot; simply do not exist. Of course, if a drug is sold in US for $100 and in Bhutan for $1, one could say its &quot;global average price&quot; would be $50.50. But of course nobody sane will agree - the two economies or populations simply don't compare. An improvement would be, of course, to weight the &quot;country wholesale price&quot; for country population, getting closer to median price per global inhabitant. But this would not account for actual drug price, because drug consumption per inhabitant varies greatly from country to country. So, a still better way would be to try to calculate the mean price per unit sold globally – this would perhaps be the most informative of anything we can ever have. Not the &quot;US wholesale price&quot; as proposed by OP. However, the problem is that quite a number of payers (for example, nearly all payers across EU) procure drugs (or at least all reimbursed drugs) under confidential contracts and never disclose the quantities purchased or the prices paid; nor is patient aware of the price if the drug is received through government-funded healthcare.

These are all considerations one has to keep in mind when proposing to come up with any statistics that involve a large number of countries as well as data that is only estimated, not actual.  And that's the reason we don't have sources that give &quot;global average price&quot; for drugs. — [[User:Kashmiri|kashmiri]] [[User talk:Kashmiri|TALK]] 16:04, 19 May 2016 (UTC)

 it would be interesting to hear you describe what you think an average wholesale price is, and what specific usefulness it might provide to any reader. I'm not opposed at all to having cost information in some or many drug articles where relevant, but it may be more useful to phrase it in terms of &quot;average cost of therapy&quot; (i.e. Avastin is $300k for a course of therapy treating X, $150k treating Y, etc.) But drug AWPs probably don't mean what most people would naturally assume them to mean, and even for an economic analysis would probably be of limited value. [[User:Nathan|Nathan]][[User talk:Nathan|  T  ]] 18:00, 3 June 2016 (UTC)
Agree with you about &quot;average cost of therapy/course of treatment&quot;. I tend to use what the sources say.
The primary meds I have been working on are those on the WHO list of essential medicines. They are typically the only ones within this reference.[http://erc.msh.org/dmpguide/resultsdetail.cfm?language=english&amp;code=SAL01D&amp;s_year=2014&amp;year=2014&amp;str=100%20mcg%2Fdose&amp;desc=Salbutamol&amp;pack=new&amp;frm=INHALER&amp;rte=INH&amp;class_code2=&amp;supplement=&amp;class_name=%28%29%3Cbr%3E] For the price in the developing world they list it per dose aswell as provide the defined daily dose. Am not providing the average but the range of available prices in the developing world. These ranges are typically fairly small. If one is buying for an NGO, pharmacy, or government in the developing world these details are useful. The price the consumer pays than is this plus markup. We say how much a Toyota_Prius_C costs as well as many other goods which I also think is useful. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 20:49, 3 June 2016 (UTC)
That's why I asked the question of what you think a wholesale price for a drug represents, because generally speaking the reported wholesale prices (which are tracked as an average in the United States, and published by data aggregators like Medispan) are often higher than what a consumer would pay. The AWP of a drug might be $100, but the price to the pharmacy could be $3 and to the consumer $45. This is why I'm not convinced that including wholesale prices (which often don't reflect an actual price paid by anyone in any part of the supply chain) is very useful. If you had references for average manufacturer price or average sale price (AMP and ASP), or used the federal upper limit (FUL), this would be at least somewhat more useful data for the US. [[User:Nathan|Nathan]][[User talk:Nathan|  T  ]] 13:30, 4 June 2016 (UTC)
 The proposal is to at least include the wholesale price in low and middle income countries (of which there are more than 100) and as provided by this source for essential medicines.[http://erc.msh.org/dmpguide/resultsdetail.cfm?language=english&amp;code=SAL01D&amp;s_year=2014&amp;year=2014&amp;str=100%20mcg%2Fdose&amp;desc=Salbutamol&amp;pack=new&amp;frm=INHALER&amp;rte=INH&amp;class_code2=&amp;supplement=&amp;class_name=%28%29%3Cbr%3E] [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 16:50, 4 June 2016 (UTC)
So my question is this: do you think these wholesale prices actually mean anything to anyone? See below for a somewhat more detailed explanation of why I think they may not.

, I don't think that the goal is to provide .  I think the goal is to educate readers about general economic issues, e.g., by teaching them how much prices vary between developed vs developing countries, how stable the prices for generic meds normally are, and how the cost of drug #1 generally compares to the cost of drug #2 (e.g., a drug that's off patent or from a different class).   () 03:16, 5 June 2016 (UTC)
Again - if the prices you are reporting don't reflect any particular reality, and don't even fit in the same frame of reference as you comparatively report them, then the usefulness of the information and the comparison is really questionable. A wholesale price in the US, reported as an average of wholesale prices reported by a sample of wholesalers, doesn't reflect anything close to what anyone pays and isn't meant to. Its similar to the sale vs list price phenomenon in that it is a marketing tool; Amazon will list something at $500 and then discount the price to $425 and say you are saving $75, even when all other sellers of the same item also charge $425. Similarly, a drug with a wholesale price of $500 or $1000 or $15,000 might have actual sale prices anywhere between 1% and 80-90% of that amount - with no pattern in the variation. This is all true for US wholesale prices; if wholesale prices in other countries follow a more rational pattern, then any comparison is intrinsically apples and oranges. Not to put too fine a point on it, but if a pharmacy in the U.S. typically sells medications for 60-75% below the average wholesale price then reporting the wholesale price without that critical context is misleading at best. [[User:Nathan|Nathan]][[User talk:Nathan|  T  ]] 02:47, 6 June 2016 (UTC) 
What does &quot;typically sells&quot; mean to ?  Is that &quot;the pharmacy bought the drug for $20 and I paid $5 (and my health insurance company paid $15, but let's ignore that, so we can say it's a 75% loss)&quot;?  Or &quot;the pharmacy bought the drug for $20, I paid $5, and my health insurance company's marginal cost was $0, but they paid a flat fee of millions of dollars to the pharmacy chain, so their actual cost, after properly allocating everything, was rather higher than $0&quot;?  Or something else?   () 03:28, 6 June 2016 (UTC)
The sale price in this context is the combination of the patient payment and any third party payment, i.e. the whole amount paid to the pharmacy for the drug dispensed. Total reimbursement is typically a lesser of calculation with an average wholesale price discount (between 15 and 30%) as a baseline, and then various other discounts which combine to make AWP - 75% a common overall rate of reimbursement. [[User:Nathan|Nathan]][[User talk:Nathan|  T  ]] 12:58, 6 June 2016 (UTC)
On further reflection, it seems to me that there are varying reasons for someone to want such information: to compare costs of different products within one jurisdiction; to compare cost of one product across jurisdictions; or to compare costs over time as one product moves through development to patent licensing and then to generic or orphan status. Each of these would, if suitably sourced, be information of value to some readers. None depends on retail/wholesale price ratios, except to the extent that such markup varies between jurisdictions. So it should just boil down to the question &quot;Can we reliably source this?&quot;  [[User talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl!]] 19:00, 3 June 2016 (UTC)

While it is no doubt reliable, their website [https://www.bnf.org/products/data-licenses/ strongly suggests] that they are restrictive about licensing use of the data. I am inclined to doubt the applicability of such restrictions, to databases of facts, but before we get too far down that path, we should have an informed discussion of whether we need to be concerned about them. Alternatively, we could pursue getting an explicit WP compatible license. [[User talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl!]] 21:32, 3 June 2016 (UTC)

The articles on computers, cars, videogames etc list the price at the time of release; Sunbeam Tiger and PowerBook 100 mention what they sold for in 1964 and 1991, not annually-updated cites to Auto Trader and Computer Shopper to list what one can currently buy one for, and when we talk about including pricing info we're certainly not proposing &quot;Methadone cost nine pfennigs per gramme when it was introduced in Germany in 1937&quot;. Yes, Sunderland Echo lists the current price, but that's because the concept of a paid-for local newspaper is so unusual in Britain (even behemoths like Metro and Manchester Evening News are given away free and funded by advertising) that it has to be pointed out, since otherwise readers will assume that it's a freesheet. ‑  23:09, 9 June 2016 (UTC)

Public health issue

The price of medications are a critically important aspect of global health. Yes many people in the developed world are partly shielded from the issue of price by their governments. But governments still address these issues and Wikipedia is write for all including those in government.

Our article on the rabies vaccine for example contains &quot;The wholesale cost in the developing world is between 44 and 78 USD for a course of treatment as of 2014. In the United States a course of rabies vaccine is more than 750 USD.&quot;

That information makes it perfectly clear why when a child gets bitten by a dog in the developing world, they often do not get immunized against rabies. The family and the NGOs can often not afford the ~50 USD and therefore the vaccine is often not available / given. This explains the current situation where we have a perfectly preventable disease continuing to kill about 50k people a year. To put that into context Ebola killed 11k people over 2 years.

Removal of pricing details will mean that Wikipedia will continue to tell you [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabies_in_popular_culture what video game, television shows, songs, and books feature rabies]. Our readers will continue to be able to figure out which Beavis and Butt Head and House MD episode featured the disease but will struggle to figure out why it continues to kill so many people.

Any other BibSonomy users?

Does anyone else here use BibSonomy to manage bookmarks and/or references? I've been wondering if a WP:MED-oriented [http://www.bibsonomy.org/help_en/GroupFunctions group] there might be useful for collecting and sharing sources, articles about medical content on Wikipedia, and handy online tools (see [http://www.bibsonomy.org/group/bibsonomy_dev bibsonomy_dev] for an active example). I do not envision it replacing anything that currently exists here. It would be an additional resource -- for everyone: open-source (LGPL), 100% web-based, collections publicly visible by default.

Just thought I'd put the idea out there to see if anyone is interested. — ‹› 13:10, 10 July 2016 (UTC)

Reverts of inter-wiki links

Could perhaps someone tell Andreasmperu not to vandalize my inter-wiki links linking medical articles of the English and the German WP? Things like that had happened before, and it had turned out pointless to talk to this person. And could you please reinstall these three edits:

Well, probably not.  Wikidata is a different project, and German is a different language.
Are  edits absolutely, incontestably correct translations of the names for these psychiatric conditions?    () 05:42, 7 July 2016 (UTC)

For further information, just one example: Endolymphatic hydrops needs to be linked to the German sister article [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrops_cochleae Hydrops cochleae]. The usual installation of the linking, however, is in this case blocked by the wrong association of the German item to some useless - mysterious bureaucratic - item. So, this false association must first be deleted. Once this is done the installation of the EN-DE linkage works fine. Now, this user Andreasmperu in Wikidata appears to refuse to understand the problem of the false association that first needs to be deleted. Andreasmperu reinstalled the false association, which again precluded the EN-DE linkage. It is just silly and hopeless. As I said, this happened several times before, and I do not know what else to do. Greetings. -- () 10:45, 7 July 2016 (UTC)

PS. The link to Endolymphatic hydrops could now be fixed from the side of the German article. So I must give another example, which cannot be fixed either from the English or the German side: Borderline personality disorder is now linked to German sister article but not to the articles of the other languages. -- () 11:22, 7 July 2016 (UTC)

PPS. I could now also fix the Borderline personality disorder problem. Hope Andreasmperu will not revert it this time. -- () 18:59, 8 July 2016 (UTC)

It has happened again. Andreasmperu undid the correct EN-DE link and reinstalled the false one. Now he again threatened to block me. See [https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Saidmann&amp;diff=356604380&amp;oldid=282304558 here].

Please help.

Borderline personality disorder needs to be linked to [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline-Pers%C3%B6nlichkeitsst%C3%B6rung Borderline-Persönlichkeitsstörung] and not to [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_instabile_Pers%C3%B6nlichkeitsst%C3%B6rung Emotional instabile Persönlichkeitsstörung], which is definitely wrong.

It is hard to understand that expert knowledge is blocked by a person who apparently has no clue on the issue. And Wikidata does not seem to provide a channel do deal with such problems.

Please help.

Depending upon your computer setup, you may already have the software to do this.  For example, QuickTime Player on a Mac can make screen-capture recordings, for any part of your computer screen.  I've made videos on how to trigger a bug in the visual editor a few times with it.   () 02:09, 14 July 2016 (UTC)
*You said CT rather than MRI, and did not mention the body part, but I think it's worth noting in this context (posting medical images) that when one is dealing with head imaging the images may be difficult to de-identify because 3D reconstruction can render a recognizable face. Not an issue for other body parts, and CT is generally not suitable for 3D reconstruction of skin. Just FYI. —  () 02:59, 14 July 2016 (UTC)

Try asking your favorite web search engine for information about &quot;screen capture video on windows&quot; (whatever version you're running).  It looks like some versions come with tools for this.  () 03:22, 14 July 2016 (UTC)
*Do you know what filetype they are? Using a direct converter may be simpler than filming off the screen. DICOM can be stripped of identifying data and then converted directly into gifs or videos. If they are jpeg they can be combined to gifs or videos, while they can also be uploaded individually, which allows for some interactive scrolling solutions. 
If direct conversion is not possible, there are programs such as [http://gifster.mentalstack.com/ Gifster] that take a screen and record it into a gif. The problem with this solution is that you will need smooth scrolling of the images, otherwise they will look choppy, so scrolling with your mouse or mouse-wheel can cause them to be low quality and will distort the image.

If author Pall was a WP editor, we'd admonish his/her edits as . The review article resembles synthesizing primary in vitro and animal studies into a conclusion described as clinical fact, which normally we would refuse as non-MEDRS. The epidemiological studies of Table 3 are not MEDRS quality RCTs. No I'd say this review is not MEDRS-compliant. Similarly, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3780531/ this review] assembles basic research to support a case for VGCCs as the site of neurological abberation by EMFs, another example of  and  if it were a WP article. These Pall articles and [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Pall+ML the author's publishing history] show a fondness for speculating, as there are numerous papers published in [http://www.medical-hypotheses.com/content/aims Medical Hypotheses], not a location for conclusive clinical research, and certainly not MEDRS quality. -- () 22:45, 8 July 2016 (UTC)

Didn't MEDRS say something like &quot;Do not perform a detailed peer review&quot; once upon a time?  I believe that it still says something about not rejecting a review article on the grounds that you don't like its inclusion criteria.  Also,  applies to editors, not to sources; the reason that review articles and other high-quality types of secondary sources are so valuable to us is precisely because they synthesize content for us – including &quot;subjective&quot; content.
IMO the relevant policy-based reason for being concerned about this is DUE, not (MED)RS.  Alex, if I were you, I'd start by asking myself the question, &quot;Isn't there some guy named Martin Pall who writes a lot about Multiple chemical sensitivity?&quot;  A minority POV is still a minority POV, even when that POV is presented in a peer-reviewed review article in a real journal.  The source can be &quot;RS&quot; (including &quot;MEDRS&quot;) and still not be worth including (or in need of careful framing, e.g., &quot;Proponents such as Author claim that...&quot;).  
On the more general issue, I know that a lot of us are comfortable with MEDRS, but we've got to get out of that &quot;I've got a hammer, so everything's a nail&quot; mode.  Stuff that's undue should be rejected as being undue – or else, one of these days, someone's going to turn up with nonsense from a major journal, and we'll have trouble.  Every major journal has published a bad paper at some point – and will again, in the future.  You need a bigger toolbox, if you want to protect Wikipedia from overemphasizing minority POVs.

New WikiProject Medicine Main Page

Together with  we are a bunch of editors who have been redesigning the WikiProject Medicine page, in part because it was a jumble of things built up over 10 years. We've tried to strip out the essentials, while leaving anything that still is useful — trying to make the most often used parts more accessible.

One major reason why this was done is to make it easier for new editors to understand what our project is and to make it easier to join. The beta is available at  and includes new links and new tools as well as a rework of the old.

Before this is pushed live, I want to know if you have any questions or comments or any features you feel are missing.

Looks good, although I'm not too enthusiastic about the banner. I don't think most of the images will be meaningful to most people - either they require specialist knowledge to identify/appreciate (why show a keratometer instead of something immediately recognizable like a microscope?), or their primary contribution appears to be aesthetics (what's added by a picture of some syringes?) I also don't think it's representative of the full range of medical topics - I think it's overemphasizing hospital and laboratory work, and underemphasizing the social aspects of medicine among other things. There's nothing immediately recognizable as relating to infectious disease, nutrition, clinical research, and so forth. That said, some of these things probably don't have any good pictures available, so it might be difficult to address this. [[User:Sunrise|Sunrise]] () 13:21, 24 June 2016 (UTC)
