 Maternal mortality  
ile:Rod of asclepius.jpg|20px|right

I don't know if anyone would like to beat me to it, but I believe articles such as eath of Shalon Irving[https://www.npr.org/2017/12/07/568948782/black-mothers-keep-dying-after-giving-birth-shalon-irvings-story-explains-why] and eath of Lauren Bloomstein[https://www.npr.org/2017/05/12/527806002/focus-on-infants-during-childbirth-leaves-u-s-moms-in-danger] are deserving of coverage. As I mentioned here previously, I recently started a similar article, eath of Chaniece Wallace. If anyone knows of other high-profile maternal mortality cases feel free to chime in. I just know that US media has focused on this issue because of poor US outcomes. Thanks. ser:Biosthmors|Biosthmors (ser talk:Biosthmors|talk) 22:22, 26 May 2021 (UTC)
I'm not sure those should be individual articles. I'm not downplaying the tragedy of the deaths, but we're not a news site or a memorial site, and it doesn't appear to me that those women were notable outside of the news generated as a result of their deaths. It seems to me that an article about aternal mortality in African-American women might be a better way to cover this topic in a more comprehensive fashion. ♠ser:Premeditated Chaos|PMC♠ ser_talk:Premeditated Chaos|(talk) 00:41, 27 May 2021 (UTC)
Created halon Irving with a redirect to lack maternal mortality in the United States#Racism and auren Bloomstein as a redirect to ELLP syndrome#Notable cases as an interim or more permanent measure depending on consensus. Given P:1E that seems a reasonable way of ensure that content related to those women can be found by readers. ser:Klbrain|Klbrain (ser talk:Klbrain|talk) 15:14, 29 May 2021 (UTC)
I'm reasonably confident, from a not-in-depth search, that eath of Lauren Bloomstein is a viable article, and have put it on my mental list. I can find several years of sustained coverage, and the NPR/ProPublica article, to quote another source, &quot;contained an unusual amount of detail&quot;. ser:Vaticidalprophet|Vaticidalser talk:Vaticidalprophet|prophet 16:48, 29 May 2021 (UTC)

Afraid I don't really agree with attempts to create articles about individual patients whose condition has been emphasised only to illustrate broader points about variation in care. This does a disservice to those whose care was suboptimal but did not come to the attention of journalists. We will achieve much more by including information about variations in care in the broader sense.
I have said something similar on the RFD for the auren Bloomstein article.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Redirects_for_discussion/Log/2021_June_2&amp;diff=1026660742&amp;oldid=1026659454]  ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 15:08, 3 June 2021 (UTC)
&quot;Other stuff doesn't exist&quot; is a poor argument how you're using it. We have tons of 'Death of' articles who happen to be the person whose death for a certain reason caught media attention, and if anything those are far more comparable than &quot;lots of women who've died in childbirth didn't get media coverage&quot;. ser:Vaticidalprophet|Vaticidalser talk:Vaticidalprophet|prophet 15:29, 3 June 2021 (UTC)

It seems a rather American phenomenon and I can't think of many examples in the UK (where there has also been a concern about maternal mortality, as per [https://www.rcog.org.uk/en/news/mbrrace-uk-report-response/ MMBRACE]). Are we ironically looking at introducing systemic bias? ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 15:57, 3 June 2021 (UTC)
No, and that's a frankly absurd argument. If it's systemic bias to write one (1) article about an American subject, we may as well shut down the project, because people aren't going to stop doing that. There are many, many articles for &quot;people who died of a not-rare-but-not-common cause and who, unlike most people who died of such a cause, received media attention for it&quot;; urder of Bella Bond (GA), eelah Alcorn (FA), eath of Ms Dhu (FA), urder of Irene Garza (GA), to name a few. Do you plan to take those all to AfD, because they do a disservice to murder/suicide/etc victims who don't have articles? ser:Vaticidalprophet|Vaticidalser talk:Vaticidalprophet|prophet 16:35, 3 June 2021 (UTC)

In my opinion each article created as part of this effort will need to establish notability. I will stop now, because I think others should weigh in rather than us getting into entrenched discussions. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 21:55, 3 June 2021 (UTC)
I've read about several of these deaths, and I appreciate the editors who are working on lack maternal mortality in the United States.  
I have wondered how many of these individual deaths will still be reported on in five or ten years.  The overall subject, I hope, will continue to get attention for as long as the disparity exists, but I wonder whether the individual examples of the problem will be the same, or if the media will move on to other examples.
I therefore wonder whether this information might be more durably placed in a well-sourced list, with substantial descriptions and redirects, rather than individual, and therefore individually disputable, articles. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 01:59, 4 June 2021 (UTC)

 Repeating links 

I was thinking about one of the problems of reading Wikipedia articles on mobile devices.  The mobile web site (not the app) [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer looks like this].  If it thinks you're on a desktop device, all the sections are auto-expanded, just like they are on the desktop site.  But if it thinks you're on a mobile device, then all the sections are auto-collapsed, and they function sort of like the table of contents.  You look down the list and pick the section you're interested in – maybe it's Signs and symptoms, maybe it's Cause, hopefully it's Society and culture (as that's the section I had the most fun researching ten years ago) – but you pick your section, tap on it, and it expands so you can read it.  You don't see any of the content that you haven't expanded.  

Naturally, since you're skipping to the section you want to read, you're not reading the article straight through, from top to bottom (and almost nobody actually does that, even on the desktop site), this means that you have missed a whole lot of background information, and you've missed a lot of opportunities to hover over links and figure out what the various words mean.  I've been wondering whether we should be adding links more generously, maybe even once per section for key words.

I finally looked up P:REPEATLINK, which says surprised me by encouraging that some links be included more than once, specifically &quot;in ikipedia:Manual of Style/Infoboxes|infoboxes, tables, image captions, elp:Footnotes|footnotes, ikipedia:Hatnote|hatnotes, and at the first occurrence after the lead.&quot;  So if you are inclined to be more generous in adding links, then please consider these options. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 02:46, 4 June 2021 (UTC)
I've been talking a ton about this lately, including at a medical GAN and medical pre-FAC PR. I always link at least once per section, and have occasionally done so more if it's a weird word in a long section, or if non-editor readers have re/inserted the link (i.e. there's clear reader demand for it). If I'm writing with jargon, and in this area I always am, then the majority of readers need repeated links to even understand an article at all. (And that's pretending all desktop readers are reading through, which they aren't either.) It's not what the current MOS says; it is, I am sure, what the MOS will say in two years. ser:Vaticidalprophet|Vaticidalser talk:Vaticidalprophet|prophet 02:57, 4 June 2021 (UTC)
I think the MoS is a bit contradictory here. It begins &quot;Generally, a link should appear only once in an article&quot; but the &quot;first occurrence after the lead&quot; exception would, in any substantial sized article following guidelines, likely repeat nearly all the links of the lead. Something that is therefore routine should not be written as though it is the exception to the rule. Of course we know of many articles where the lead bears no resemblance to a &quot;summary of the body&quot;, but that's the goal. The text &quot;if helpful for readers&quot; seems redundant, since that should always be our goal, including ignoring MoS if necessary. I suppose if we want this relaxed or reworded to consider how readers generally use our articles, rather than assuming they are robots or FAC reviewers reading from top to bottom, then we'd need to discuss this at the MoS page. I also think the &quot;once&quot; restriction is too much, especially for very unusual terms. Even if the reader has read sequentially, they may not have felt the need to know (more) when reading the earlier usage. -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 07:43, 4 June 2021 (UTC)
I agree that it would be good to reconsider these rules at some point.  Readers don't benefit from too many links (although reasonable people might disagree on exactly how many constitutes &quot;too many&quot;), and it's also bad to have too few.  But for right now, the word-of-mouth approach differs so significantly from the written rules that I think that merely following the written rules would be a significant improvement in longer articles. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 15:30, 4 June 2021 (UTC)

 Opinion sold as fact in ircumcision 

Decisive statement in referenced source:
&quot;Claims that MC causes psychological harm were contradicted by studies finding no such harm.&quot;

Current article text reporting this statement:
&quot;Overall, as of 2019 it is unclear what the psychological outcomes of circumcision are, with some studies showing negative effects, and others showing that the effects are negligible.[83]&quot;

Proposed altered version, in order to be in line with P:YESPOV:
&quot;In a review from 2019 it was stated that claims MC caused psychological harm were contradicted by studies finding no such harm.[83]&quot;

Obviously a version of this classical conflict: Do we write &quot;it is&quot; or do we write &quot;XY stated that is was&quot;?

 Annoying opinion, but I don't consider the statement in the source necessarily decisive (although it may be depending on the rest of the paragraph it is in).

 Lack of medically reliable sources at eter Pan syndrome

Thanks for this note, @ser:Ezlev|Ezlev.  I am intrigued by how much this article has changed over time.  In 2007, the lead said (in its entirety):
uote|Peter Pan Syndrome is a pop-psychology term used to describe an adult male or female who is socially immature.  The term has been used informally by both laypeople and some psychology professionals in popular sychology since the 1983 publication of The Peter Pan Syndrome:  Men Who Have Never Grown Up, by Dr. Dan Kiley.  Kiley also wrote a companion book, The Wendy Dilemma, published in 1984. &quot;Peter Pan syndrome&quot; is not listed in the iagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.
It was merged and redirected to uer aeternus for several years, and then re-split.  Now it begins:
uote|Peter Pan syndrome describes one's inability to believe that they are of an older age or to engage in behaviour usually associated with adulthood. This syndrome affects people who do not want or feel unable to grow up, people with the body of an adult but the mind of a child. They do not know how to or do not want to stop being children.

Yeah, this is a bit of an annoyance I've had a few times before, both on wikipedia and in real life. People create &quot;new&quot; psychological diagnoses and phemonema often without much regard for how this fits into existing literature and then popularize them in self-help books or blogs to the point that they start seeping into &quot;folk&quot; understandings of psychology, mental health and psychology and need to be addressed because they are having an impact. These novel psychological constructs can be politically motivated, and can scratch and itch of a particular world view. The liberal will view someone as trapped by a toxic culture, and gaslit by those around them, the conservative will diagnose them with a &quot;victim mentality&quot; and say they are &quot;projecting their personal failures onto others&quot; and must learn to take more responsibility to escape their victim mentality. And so the game is played. 
 Worse these novel diagnoses start leaking into therapeutic psychology, and perhaps psychiatry, particularly when you have a nursing population who aren't necessarily well versed in the more scientific concepts - where they can be used in service of a care-providers personal and politically biases and legitimize these concepts, rather than provide an understanding in terms of more studiend psychological constructs. This is all helped by the fact that psychology terribly complex. 
 Psychiatrists and psychologists don't seem to address these novel diagnoses, probably because they aren't part of the literature and maybe because they have better things to do. 
 I don't really know what to do about it. Wikipedia's job isn't to fix wrongs, but to reflect verifiable literature. The problem is that there doesn't seem to be a literature on these topics other than proponents of the novel diagnoses that has it's own &quot;pseudoscientific&quot; literature body - pseudoscientific in the sense that it is unconnected to the main body of science. 
 What really needs to happen is somone with a PsyD or MD after their name to write an article entitlted &quot;Theoretical understandings of novel psychological constructs&quot; and get it published and peer reviewed (though we should note P:Parity) ser:Talpedia|Talpedia (ser talk:Talpedia|talk) 14:52, 13 June 2021 (UTC)
We need several of those articles, and then to have someone summarize them in a review article.  (Of couuse, I think this about every subject.)  Does any of this come up in recent textbooks?

 Advice on new article name (Littmann) 

Hi all, I'm thinking of starting a new article on the Littmann brand of stethoscopes produced by M. I'm surprised that there isn't such an article already given the near-total worldwide domination of the stethoscope market by the brand, and the fact that other 3M brands like ost-it Note,  cotch Tape and excare have articles. However, I'm conflicted as to what to name the article.

Clearly ittmann on its own is not suitable as it is already a disambiguation page for the surname. The official website and logo use 3M™ Littmann® Stethoscopes whilst other 3M sources also describe it as 3M™ Littmann® Brand,  3M Littmann or just Littmann. I don't think it's necessary to include the &quot;3M&quot; part as that seems to be a corporate branding exercise, so I'm currently stuck between ittmann (brand) and ittmann Stethoscopes for the article name. The advantage of the latter is that it provides natural disambiguation, but &quot;Littmann Stethoscopes&quot; is not the terminology preferred by the manufacturer, which uses either the full corporate name or just Littmann. 

What do other editors think?

P.S. if you don’t feel this merits an article at all please say so as well! ser:Elshad|Elshad (ser talk:Elshad|talk) 18:59, 16 June 2021 (UTC)

@ser:Elshad|Elshad, brand-specific articles are often targeted for deletion, especially if it's a brand that average, non-healthcare editors have never heard of (because most people haven't ever heard of any brand of any stethoscope).  Since it is about a product that is currently for sale, some editors may take a very strict view – to the point, in some cases, that they will say that even though there were hundreds of words about the product in a newspaper, they believe that some of the information in the company (e.g., sales figures) came from the company and therefore the whole thing is tainted and non-independent and no better than a press release. 
I recommend starting with a section in tethoscope about brands (in general), and maybe turning M#N95 respirators and the COVID-19 pandemic into a section about their healthcare products in general, rather than just the one product line in a single year.  Having established that it's appropriate content for the English Wikipedia, and try to split it if appropriate later. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 20:36, 16 June 2021 (UTC)
Since &quot;Littmann Stethoscopes&quot; isn't the name of the company, I think the naming convention would be ittmann stethoscope, rather than a capital S or plural, and would be more natural if that was not just a brand but a kind of stethoscope that had become identified by its brand name. That doesn't seem to be the case as they make many kinds. WAID is right about the approach. The section in tethoscope would (as it does already) concentrate on the technical innovation by Littmann/3M and on the brand dominance (if you can find sources commenting on it) within stethoscopes. But you will need to watch you cover other innovations/brands if possible per P:WEIGHT, otherwise editors might think you were promotionally editing. The section on 3M would be more on how successful or otherwise the brand has been for them, and less on the details about technology. A problem with filling up either would be that it may produce an unbalanced article, that someone objects to and trims. Another approach would be to prepare an article in a sandbox to get a feel for how much material there is. I think, if you have the material, ittmann (brand) is the most appropriate. -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 09:31, 17 June 2021 (UTC)

 WHO Fact Sheets 

I've been looking at Epidemiology sources for hronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There aren't many recent reviews (MID|32800187 is one). There is the [https://goldcopd.org/2021-gold-reports/ GOLD Report 2021], which has excellent credentials wrt explanation of how it reviews the literature, expert consensus, and transparency of where the figures are coming from. It doesn't say much wrt epidemiology, though is likely useful for many other aspects of that article.  Currently the Wikipedia article makes strong use of a WHO Fact Sheet: [https://www.who.int/en/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-(copd) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)]. It is very attractive to use, being regularly updated and coming from a respected organisation. This draws on their [https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/the-top-10-causes-of-death The top 10 causes of death] statistics. And that draws on [https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/mortality-and-global-health-estimates Global Health Estimates: Life expectancy and leading causes of death and disability] which offers summary and raw data. Very quickly on that webpage, you are looking at low-level figures for Afghanistan or Albania or ... There are details on the methods and data sources: [https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/gho-documents/global-health-estimates/ghe2019_cod_methods.pdf?sfvrsn=37bcfacc_5 WHO methods and data sources for country-level causes of death 2000-2019]. All of this data is created and published by WHO. And summarised and presented in pretty graphs by WHO.

If you look at [https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/the-top-10-causes-of-death The top 10 causes of death] it reads like a commentary on whatever the authors thought was interesting about the current figures and trends. The charts have no precise numbers on them, so you only get numbers if the authors thought it worth mentioning in prose. And when their news room revamp the figures next year, they may not care to mention your disease. Ok, so I can look at the raw data? [https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/mortality-and-global-health-estimates/ghe-leading-causes-of-death Global health estimates: Leading causes of death] has a downloads link and one is to [https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/gho-documents/global-health-estimates/ghe2019_cod_global_2000_20194e572f53-509f-4578-b01e-6370c65d9fc5.xlsx?sfvrsn=eaf8ca5_7 Global Summary Estimates] which is a spreadsheet with figures for lots of diseases in 2019, 2015, 2010 and 2000. Could I take those figures and comment on trends? The notes say q|&quot;Depending on the available data sources, the cause-specific estimates will have quite substantial uncertainty ranges. Explicit uncertainty ranges are not included in this spreadsheet, but will be available from the above-mentioned website, as part of the comprehensive GHE 2019 estimates dataset that includes cause-of-death estimates by age, sex, and year. Due to changes in data and some methods, these estimates are not comparable to previously-released WHO estimates. The &quot;above-mentioned website&quot; is [https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/mortality-and-global-health-estimates this]. Where I can't find any figures on uncertainty ranges.

The WHO Fact Sheet says with confidence q|&quot;Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death worldwide, causing 3.23 million deaths in 2019.&quot; The spreadsheet above has 3,227,873. A 2013 estimate [https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(14)61682-2/fulltext in The Lancet] had an estimate 2931·2 thousands but with a confidence range of (2626·3 to 3215·8), which is large, or as WHO puts it &quot;quite substantial&quot;. Can anyone find the figures for the confidence range on WHO data? I don't think &quot;causing 3.23 million deaths&quot; is an honest way of presenting a vague estimate.

Any other experience or opinions on the WHO Fact Sheets? How does that fit in with MEDRS? The studies aren't published in a medical journal. They aren't then reviewed in another article that we cite. There's just a database on a WHO web server, with a fancy front-end, and they have an in-house &quot;news room&quot; of writers who create lay-friendly fact sheets. Looking at journal articles that cite WHO, such as with [http://www.who.int/respiratory/copd/burden/en/ this link], it seems WHO decided to reorganise their web site in 2020, and broke many links.

Although there isn't a formalized task force anymore, I see articles routinely being translated to a variety of languages. It's very possible that this isn't the best way to present the information, though; the issues with cross-project communication make it hard to figure out how and where to centralize things like this. ser:Vaticidalprophet|Vaticidalser talk:Vaticidalprophet|prophet 01:18, 20 June 2021 (UTC)

 Adding a manual citation for a consensus document 


Sent here from the ikipedia:Teahouse.

I was interested to enhance the sourcing in a couple of the ECG articles by adding references to consensus guideline documents, which Wikipedia recommends as a high quality source (as do cardiologists :) ).

The citation tool seems to struggle with these URLs perhaps because they have a lot of authors.

So I manually wrote up one citation, stashed it in my ser:Edinburghpotsdam/sandbox|sandbox and added it to dioventricular_rhythm|this article.

I'd be grateful if anyone could look this edit over, and offer any pointers. My questions are:
* is there any reason this is not a good choice of citation?
* have I made the raw edit text too hard to read with this big citation?
* have I chosen the authors to include appropriately?


If it looks good then in future I think it would be nice to fill out some of the ECG articles with references to the consensus guideline documents where appropriate.
Thanks,

 I definitely think the use of consensus documents in the absence of RCTs quoted in systematic reviews is a good thing. I might be a little cautious about using them for statements of fact quoted with Wikipedia's voice. E.g. &quot;Surgeons recommand applying negative pressure&quot; versus &quot;Negative pressure decreases the chance of amputation&quot;. Consensus documents have this nasty habit of turning opinion into fact over time and mixing up the reasons for particular interventions, healthcare workers are no doubt aware of this - hence the existence of evidence driven medicine. We should make sure we are aware of this as wikipedians. ser:Talpedia|Talpedia (ser talk:Talpedia|talk) 15:06, 20 June 2021 (UTC)

 Cross-cultural synthesis at ndian childhood cirrhosis 

|Metaknowledge drew my attention on P:Discord|Discord to the article ndian childhood cirrhosis, which has an odd synthesis of two apparently unrelated conditions going on. The bulk of the article is about a condition affecting children in India; a small proportion and some of the references are about a condition affecting Native American children. The article is a stub that doesn't justify a true content split, but there's certainly a strange lumping going on, and it would be good if anyone can take a look at the article and expand/split/etc the subjects. ser:Vaticidalprophet|Vaticidalser talk:Vaticidalprophet|prophet 05:37, 22 June 2021 (UTC)
I had a look at the 2008 editorial (one of the references) and ndian childhood cirrhosis does seem to be a distinct condition. The Native American content was listed as a variant which I think is misleading, so I've changed that subheading to see also given that there is already an article on orth American Indian childhood cirrhosis. ser:Klbrain|Klbrain (ser talk:Klbrain|talk) 12:14, 22 June 2021 (UTC) 
I've added another article or two, and the pathophysiology of the Indian condition does seem to be distinct, and has a history going back to the 19th century in India. So, there's plenty of 20th century literature to explore if someone was in the mood to expand it.

One consideration here is that GAs as a whole are much more common than they used to be (contra FAs, which have been a stable proportion of articles for more or less the project's entire history). On 1 January 2011, 1 in 330 articles were GA, while on 1 January 2021 1 in 189 were (per P:GASTATS). There are both pros and cons about this -- it can, as well as &quot;we're improving more articles to GA status&quot;, be read as &quot;people aren't taking enough articles to FA&quot; or &quot;people are waving through GANs&quot; or &quot;we haven't done a GA sweep in over a decade and there are substandard articles clogging the long tail&quot; -- but it's there regardless, and it does change the projections. ser:Vaticidalprophet|Vaticidalser talk:Vaticidalprophet|prophet 23:57, 21 June 2021 (UTC)
|Bibeyjj, |WhatamIdoing: I've been thinking about this one over the past couple days, and I think the ideal solution might be to have FA and GA+FA targets, rather than FA and GA targets -- that is, we move this second goalpost to &quot;500 combined GA and FA articles&quot; (while keeping the separate &quot;80 FAs&quot; target). This would incentivize the production of high-quality content in all venues, rather than having a specific GA target, which comes with the unintended consequence of incentivizing stopping at GA to chase a target. It's the best way I can think of to handle the issues I brought up in my last comment re.

@ser:Ozzie10aaaa|Ozzie10aaaa Thank you for being specific in your feedback. I appreciate it.

Considering that primary hyperoxaluria (PH) is a rare disorder with only 1 FDA approved therapy (approved in Nov 2020), a vast majority of the literature, especially clinical results, are primary in nature. The reason I cited the ClinicalTrials.gov reference for the clinical trials on recently approved/investigational therapies in PH is that it is a fairly reliable source (hosted by NLM) for information on ongoing clinical research and is not behind a paywall. 
That being said, I did find some recent review articles on investigational therapies for PH. They are behind a paywall, but I have added them as references instead of ClinicalTrials.gov to be in line with MEDRS. I have also qualified the statements coming from primary sources as such (e.g based on two studies) and will make every effort to update with secondary sources as and when they are published. 

Your feedback from more than a month ago was mainly that the 1) list was extensive and that 2) you did not see my logic. I have considerably decreased (by about 50%) the scope of the list since then, which addresses your first point. Regarding your second point, I respectfully disagree with your assessment. The page on PH is fairly outdated and lacks citations for many of the statements made. I am therefore requesting other interested editors to take a look at the request I have proposed.

I created the ABD article to deal with the second less forensic use - partly because editors seemed very keen to make the other article about the controversial forensic diagnosis of &quot;excited delirium&quot;.
* Regarding ABD, I think it's important to remember that medical professionals re regularly chemically and physically restraining patients on the basis of this descriptor. ser:Talpedia|Talpedia (ser talk:Talpedia|talk) 18:27, 1 July 2021 (UTC)

 Retracted covid-19 vaccine paper 

Journal Retracts Terrible Study That Claimed Widespread Covid-19 Vaccine Deaths
https://gizmodo.com/journal-retracts-terrible-study-that-claimed-widespread-1847219596

uote|Even with this decision, some scientists have questioned how the paper got through the peer-review process in the first place. Two of the three reviewers were anonymous, and none brought up any of the issues that resulted in the retraction. The current fiasco isn’t the only one to have involved MDPI, the publisher of Vaccines and many other open-access journals. In its past, some scientists have accused MDPI of being a predatory publisher, more eager about the quantity than the quality of the research it publishes—criticisms that were still being made this year before the latest retracted paper.

The page is doubtless included under the MED project because of its pertinence to human health (for example, as a means of suckling human babies).

 Naming COVID-19 vaccine articles

Frustrated with the current lay titles of COVID-19 vaccine articles that go against P:MEDTITLE right from its very first sentence, yesterday I posted two RfCs to move two vaccine articles to the INN names:

* alk:Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine#Requested move 3 July 2021
* alk:Moderna COVID-19 vaccine#Requested move 3 July 2021

Yet, it seems that a large portion of commenters prefer the easy, familiar names used by the popular press, and they frequently quote P:COMMONNAME.

@ser:Kashmiri|Kashmiri, I haven't looked at the discussions.  Are you familiar with the background on vaccine naming in general?  Vaccines usually aren't generic drugs (each manufacturer's version is unique and non-interchangeable, although that should be less true for the RNA vaccines than for conventional types), so they should usually be named the same way you would handle another name-brand product.
(Also, you meant to set those up as ikipedia:Requested moves, not RFCs, right?) ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 03:15, 5 July 2021 (UTC)
|WhatamIdoing, Yes, but the manufacturing method or number of manufacturers (one vs many) is irrelevant. Of course, there is a difference between proprietary and generic drugs, we all here know it very well I hope. Yet, our naming convention applies to all drugs, not to generic drugs only. These two vaccines have WHO-assigned INNs, and so our naming rule should equally apply in my view. — ser:Kashmiri|kashmīrī ser talk:Kashmiri|TALK 08:43, 5 July 2021 (UTC)

The general rule is that predictable molecules get an INN but biologics are named by another group:  [https://www.who.int/teams/health-product-and-policy-standards/inn/inn-bio/inn-bio-inn &quot;Within the INN Programme, names have not been assigned to natural human blood products or vaccines. For those groups of biological products, the WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization (ECBS) has been adopting the scientific names of the biological products within the definitions of respective requirements.&quot;]
Since these mRNA vaccines seem to have been given INNs, the question on wiki is whether to follow our convention for naming vaccines, or our convention for following therapies that have INNs.

Unfortunately, besides the research article of [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32330472/ Dr. Hansen's technique] by Hansen et al., there isn't much else on the subject that mentions his method of repair besides [https://www.annalsthoracicsurgery.org/article/S0003-4975(21)00932-2/pdf Rudolph and Nam], who did a case report using resection versus rib plating (Dr. Hansen's method). That is the only article that I can find that cites Dr. Hansen's research, so I do not believe there are other articles currently that mention it. There is no meta-analysis on the subject that mentions his technique that I can find. Would an acceptance path of action be to utilize the study and the case report temporarily until meta-analysis of the topic can be completed?

 Medical articles written by a prolific hoaxer 

I have recently been trying to clean up a web of hoaxes by pecial:Contributions/Klaus Bells|User:Klaus Bells and their sockpuppets; the context is described at ser:Vahurzpu/July 2021 hoaxes. They wrote two medical articles,  ypotransferrinemia and FE H63D gene mutation; can someone with appropriate medical knowledge look over those and verify their correctness? The article subjects are real, unlike the other articles that were entirely fake, and a spot check didn't turn up any blatant falsehoods. However, pecial:Diff/937238783|this since-deleted section gives me pause, and looking up that section's topic on Google Scholar gives preprints that I suspect are tied to the hoaxer.

Thanks, ser:Vahurzpu|Vahurzpu (ser talk:Vahurzpu|talk) 21:46, 9 July 2021 (UTC)
Hypotransferrinemia should probably redirect to transferrinemia. The sources don't support the idea that it is a distinct condition from congenital atransferrinemia - OMIM and Orphanet list it as a synonym; Pathobiology of Human Disease states &quot;hypotransferrinemia is a very uncommon autosomal recessive disorder where transferrin is very low or absent (atransferrinemia)&quot;; Hemochromatosis: Genetics, pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment has a section titled &quot;Hereditary atransferrinemia (hypotransferrinemia)&quot;, etc... several of the other sources are not directly related to the topic. The redirect is a little ambiguous since the term 'hypotransferrinemia' can technically refer to low transferrin from any cause rather than strictly congenital hypotransferrinemia, but it seems to be more commonly used in the latter sense. ser:Spicy|Spicy (ser talk:Spicy|talk) 01:36, 12 July 2021 (UTC)

 Question on updating and/or adding Cochrane references 

Hello - I've been editing for about a year working to add and/or update references for Cochrane systematic reviews in related medical articles.  I am not a medical professional.  I am retired and enjoy spending a bit if time with Wikipedia in this manner, my professional background was in behavioral health and addiction services.  Recently an editor pointed out to me that I had updated a reference that was &quot;embargoed&quot; until sometime next year.  I will admit that I had never noticed this before but upon further research found this to be true in a number of cases.  The result was an updated reference where the full text of a review was not available, only the summary.  I had thought that the PubMed summary was sufficient in the past and that many, if not most general Wikipedia users would not have full access to articles anyway unless they were associated with a university or medical system.  Can someone clarify this for me?  I don't want to do this incorrectly but had never come across this feedback before.

Thank you
ser:BDD user|BDD user (ser talk:BDD user|talk) 14:28, 12 July 2021 (UTC)

 Fraudulent Trials in Systematic Reviews – A Major Public Health Problem 

&quot;Now I'm seriously skeptical about all the systematic reviews I've ever done&quot;.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BXEOey62O4]
bThis is horrifying, but also speaks directly to our mission to reflect &quot;accepted knowledge&quot;. If systematic reviewers are skeptical of their reviews, where does that leave us, who regularly look to such reviews as the gold standard? ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 08:25, 13 July 2021 (UTC)

It's more than an hour long.  Maybe someone could post an outline of the key points? ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:24, 13 July 2021 (UTC)
 Background listening. Some points:
 Systematic review editors trust papers are not fraudulent, outsourcing verification to journal editors who do not do due diligence.
 Fraudulent research exists and has got into systematic reviews and influenced medical policy. The example of a revoked NHS guideline is given, and one of the speakers who wrote systematic reviews, gives examples of having discovered fraud in a paper he wrote.
 Editors are non-responsive at times and not doing due diligent to prevent this. Speakers give example of nonresponse and &quot;losing&quot; data when requests are written
 Some suggestions are made. Anonymized data should be recorded and available, a reputation economy where journals and individuals are ignored if fraudulant papers are written.
 Examples are given where there are &quot;open secrets&quot; that work is fraudulent, but this does not show up in literature or retractions. 
 Some speakers cite fear of litigation as a reason that fraudulent work is not challenged. ser:Talpedia|Talpedia (ser talk:Talpedia|talk) 18:24, 13 July 2021 (UTC)
 Interesting stuff. They are kind of asserting that more than 1% of papers results are fraudulent... I'm not sure I believe this. I think there's a bit of conflation of &quot;bad methodolgy&quot; with &quot;fraud&quot; going on at times. This issues affects *all* academic publication - it's just these people are helpful trying to solve it for systematic reviews, to avoid propagating the errors in reviews. 
 I think there's a bit of &quot;don't go in the sausage factory&quot; going on here - insofar as the results presented by systematic reviews may still be &quot;mostly alright&quot;. 
 This reminds me of the &quot;Bad Science&quot; stuff that Ben Goldacre has been going on about forever.
 A few thoughts come to mind here: the idea that there might be knowledge of &quot;good paper/ bad paper&quot; the floats around the scientific community, but is hidden from other people. I wonder how wikipedia could get access to this, and note that it is a recipe for bias. I note that the &quot;completeness&quot; of systematic reviews ties editors hands here - historically they might just &quot;magically&quot; decide to omit bad papers for unknown reasons. I guess they might still be able to magically say &quot;bad methodology&quot;. Books and more theoretical works might avoid some of the problems of systematic review, since they represent the views of authors more than reviews.
 I find the fear of litigation particularly interesting... ser:Talpedia|Talpedia (ser talk:Talpedia|talk) 14:41, 13 July 2021 (UTC)
I watched the first 50 minutes at 1.5x speed. I agree it is shocking. It sounds like there is a real problem with fraudulent research and most journals making no effort whatsoever to detect it or to investigate for themselves, and not responding professionally to anyone questioning things. Even basics of phoning up the lead author's institution and asking whether or not they actually work there and whether they did such-and-such a trial. Data can be relatively easily statistically analysed for fabrication -- surely that could be outsourced to some team at low cost. One presenter suggested a checklist of things to look out for. I read &quot;The Checklist Manifesto&quot; recently and would agree that is a good idea. -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 17:27, 13 July 2021 (UTC)
Someone posted this paper a while ago:
ite journal|last=Else|first=Holly|last2=Van Noorden|first2=Richard|date=2021-03-25|title=The fight against fake-paper factories that churn out sham science|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00733-5|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=591|issue=7851|pages=516–519|doi=10.1038/d41586-021-00733-5|issn=0028-0836
and I suppose this is the obvious consequence:  if fraudulent papers get published, then the fraudulent results will make their way into systematic reviews.  The systems might be resilient enough to cope with a small amount of fraud, but eventually, it could take over the system. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 19:22, 13 July 2021 (UTC)
One of the speakers on the video said clinical guidelines had been updated to give advice that actually harmed patients. There doesn't appear to be any &quot;resilience&quot; at all. Rather than being able to &quot;trust&quot; the results of a systematic review, the whole system is actually built on assumed trust in the good indentions and competence of those conducting the trials. The process for systematic review totally assumes the data is right but merely insufficient on its own. That amassing enough of the right kind of data can be analysed to generate a statistical confidence in the result. But if the data is wrong (fictitious or manipulated) then it completely breaks down. The whole idea of a systematic review is that one has to collect all the data that matches the defined algorithm, to avoid bias. That idea is broken, though I don't know to what degree. We might actually be at a stage in some fields where a review that cherry picks studies from institutions and researchers one personally trusts and knows, is a safer approach.
On the other hand, one speaker cautioned that companies that wish to destroy research that goes against their commercial interests (nutrition, tobacco, global warming, etc) already put considerable effort in questioning the papers they don't like. So efforts to improve the checks and requirements needed to publish will get exploited.
That people will try to publish invented or fraudulent papers is not surprising: scientists are as human as anyone else. The number of fraudulent texts and phone calls I get, and the rise of ransomware attacks, are testament that there is no shortage of people who lack a moral compass. What is surprising is that journal editors and peer reviewers appear to lack the inclination or ability to perform basic checks. -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 11:48, 14 July 2021 (UTC)
Doing effective in-depth anti-fraud reviews for a couple dozen papers every month would probably be expensive.  Some would be easy to catch, but you'd have to do the full investigation on all of the good papers (and hope that a genuine, natural &quot;data anomaly&quot; isn't mistaken for fraud).
(Was the harmful clinical guideline example about the hronic fatigue syndrome treatment#PACE trial|PACE trial by any chance?  My impression of that was that there was no fraud involved, just poor methodology and disputed definitions of what's &quot;actually&quot; ME/CFS.) ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:24, 14 July 2021 (UTC)

Blind faith in reviews has never been a good thing. However it is cultivated even in some areas here. If you ever scrutinized the flood of reviews by Brian Morris fanatically advocating ircumcision you would throw out most of them. What we need is a critical attitude towards all reviews. --ser:Saidmann|Saidmann (ser talk:Saidmann|talk) 18:13, 14 July 2021 (UTC)
Well, this is the flip side as covered in the presentation: advocates with an agenda (like this editor) invoking research fraud to challenge research that doesn't serve their purposes. Fortunately the circumcision topic, as well as being comparatively trivial, has a very wide and mixed research base and a plethora of reviews. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 19:02, 14 July 2021 (UTC)
WhatamIdoing, it doesn't appear that an &quot;in-depth anti-fraud review&quot; is even approaching the level of sophistication needed to catch the cheats. A straightforward ID check on the lead author would be a start. There are organisations that do that sort of thing all the time as part of employee recruitment processing, so I'm sure that could be built into the process. They had an author of many papers who claimed to work at an institution that was just some PO box and not somewhere patients were treated, and the hospital that supposedly ran the trial had never heard of him nor the trial. And then there were the additional authors on the paper who didn't actually know they were authors on the paper till it got published. So those are some very cheap and quick checks. 
Secondly, the data itself was obviously corrupt. I'm no statistics expert but the same rules that the tax authorities use to spot people fiddling the books can be used to spot invented data. I think this is elementary stuff that could be outsourced, as everything is these days, to somewhere that labour is cheap.
Then with the trials themselves, they got cases where the numbers recruited and the numbers appearing in various tables didn't add up. And that surely is part of any peer review. And trials where you'd expect a certain degree of mortality or drop outs but where the numbers were suspiciously abnormal. A checklist would ask reviewers to confirm those things. It really does actually make one wonder what the peer review process is checking at all.
I agree with Alex - skip the into speaker and watch it at 1.5x.-- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 09:02, 15 July 2021 (UTC)

 Getting some eyes on ensory integration therapy 

I came across our article on ensory integration therapy and noticed it needs a lot of work. It appears overly promotional of the therapy and doesn't provide appropriate context, such as the lack of evidence that supports the therapy. Brief searches online have uncovered this highly cited systematic review from 2012 [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1750946712000074] which says that SIT is not evidence-based. I'm hoping someone with better expertise at writing articles and who is more knowledgeable about this kind of topic would be able to adjust this article to better reflect SIT's status. ser:Chess|Chess (ser talk:Chess|talk) (please use lx|reply to|Chess on reply) 06:44, 16 July 2021 (UTC)

It looks like this might benefit from a little more focus on what it is.  There's almost nothing in the article that gives you a sense of what this therapy looks like:  whole-body movement (swings, rocking chairs, spinning), scented objects, textured toys, etc.
If someone's interested in the subject, it might be faster to ignore what's there and re-write from scratch. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 04:45, 17 July 2021 (UTC)

 Research fraud - addendum on ivermectin 

On the various vermectin pages a number of med editors have (with some difficulty) been holding the line to exclude numerous recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses showing ivermectin's benefit for COVID. This could be done, apparently flying in the face of MEDRS, because there were documented published concerns about the underlying data and because all the major health organizations were saying, effectively, &quot;not enough evidence&quot;.b
Now [https://gidmk.medium.com/is-ivermectin-for-covid-19-based-on-fraudulent-research-5cc079278602 this] (&quot;the most consequential medical fraud ever committed&quot;?) whereby it seems that one piece of obviously suspect research has been in large part responsible for a hefty portion of the world's population being treated for with an apparently ineffective drug, sometimes in lieu of vaccination.b

Fwiw (very much just just a imho impression :), actually I suspect overreliance on checklists could sometimes actually be part of the problem; if individuals are being required exclusively to apply standardized checklists to screen studies and extract data (in a quasi-algorithmic manner), it's not hard to envisage how even quite striking tell-tale detail may be slipping through the net. pecial:Contributions/86.186.168.143|86.186.168.143 (ser talk:86.186.168.143|talk) 17:20, 18 July 2021 (UTC)
I suspect we are both speculating, but you may be right that they could give a false sense of security.

 ransgenerational trauma

Since this isn't necessarily a biological process, I wouldn't expect too many classic MEDRS-style sources to exist.  This is more like &quot;if the previous generation of your community survived the Holocaust/forced assimilation of indigenous people/chattel slavery/etc., things aren't going to be normal for you, either&quot;.

Most of the article is still making direct statements about medical conditions, and if we don't have the necessary sources then the associated content needs to be removed. There are even sections with the specific titles &quot;Symptoms&quot;, &quot;Affected groups&quot;, &quot;Transmission&quot;, and &quot;Treatment&quot;. I think you may be interpreting the term &quot;trauma&quot; metaphorically? But even if the &quot;transmission&quot; is not biological, the effects being discussed definitely are, and besides the way that people get specific conditions requires MEDRS sourcing regardless. ser:Sunrise|Sunrise (ser talk:Sunrise|talk) 15:03, 20 July 2021 (UTC)
It may not be quite metaphorical, since omplex post-traumatic stress disorder is a possibility for individuals in any of the generations.  But it's a sort of group diagnosis, which isn't the DSM's view of the world.
I think the people who added all this stuff about epigenetics were actually looking for pigenetics of anxiety and stress–related disorders.  For this subject, it's enough that you grew up in a community deeply traumatized by a past event, to the point that it affected their everyday behaviors.  Think &quot;it's hard to have a normal relationship to food, or broader society, if your parents and grandparents were nearly starved to death by that same broader society&quot;, rather than &quot;if a pregnant woman experiences severe stress, that might affect the baby's DNA&quot;. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 15:54, 20 July 2021 (UTC)

 Feedback needed on Costochondritis  

Hello Wikipedians, I'm a new editor trying to improve an article that need TLC and a bold human. I've been working on ostochondritis. 

* I am nervous about the lead section, I tried to update it to reflect everything else based on what's under the &lt;--&gt; things but it feels empty and naked now. 
* The last two paragraphs in the causes section I did not edit. They're primary sources, and I can't really find this information in the recent resources I have. 
* Tried my best to wrap my brain around pathogenesis, as many articles are saying this and that regarding the etiology, causes, pathogenesis, and pathophysiology of costochondritis. It was all mixed up/jumbled and it made me more confused.
* The diagnoses was basically a list before, I expanded on it A LOT. The image in the section doesn't quite make sense to me because it's mostly muscle related. Does anyone know of any better images that could be used?
* The treatment section had a lot of the Mayo Clinic cited. I put all these things that I couldn't find elsewhere in recent reviews at the end with the original citation. I was unsure if it should stay or be removed.
* There are 3 links at the end in external links to Mayo Clinic, MedicineNet, and Patient.Info. I don't know if these are appropriate to keep in the article?
* The article definitely needs some people to review it, making sure everything is grammatically correct and all.
* Additionally, the article is rated as Start-class. Can it be re-rated after the improvements I made, and how do I go about getting it done? 

This is the first article I have decided to be bold on. I made a alk:Costochondritis#Updating|talk section on the page to discuss things if anyone has/had any concerns. Thank you. :) ser:Jebbles|Jebbles (ser talk:Jebbles|talk) 16:44, 19 July 2021 (UTC)

 When is something a review or lit survey, hence secondary? 

I was just wondering if the terms literature review or survey which are characteristic of certain types of published papers which can then be used as P:SECONDARY sources in Wikipedia articles, are well-defined terms or not? 

Consider the article [https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cdev.13528# Cultural Components of Sex Differences in Color Preference] in hild Development (journal)|Child Development by J. Davis, et al. (This question arises in the context of my searching for more secondary sources for the WP article endered associations of pink and blue, which has a lot of primary sources in the endered associations of pink and blue#Academic research|#Academic research section.) The journal article starts out with a long intro, summarizing and linking dozens of other studies, and anecdotally commenting on their conclusions, and drawing some groups of opinion out of the collection. But about 1/3 of the way down, the article switches gears to describing the study which was carried out by the authors, involving disparate populations in Peru, Congo, Vanuatu, and Australia; the rest of the article is similar to any published study, and clearly P:PRIMARY in the Wikipedia sense.  

But what about that long intro, listing and evaluating all those other studies?  Does that make it a &quot;survey&quot; thus P:SECONDARY as well, and thereofre a better choice for inclusion in endered associations of pink and blue than some of the PRIMARY studies already cited there?  What qualifies an article as a &quot;survey&quot; or a &quot;literature review&quot;?  Is it the absence of any primary study results by the author(s) being reported, and sole attention on other studies, accompanied by an attempt to standardize the disparate data so they can be reanalyzed collectively as a whole? Thanks, me ser:Mathglot|Mathglot (ser talk:Mathglot|talk) 03:02, 21 July 2021 (UTC)

@ser:Mathglot|Mathglot, you won't be surprised to hear that this has come up before.  The general conclusion is that this is, indeed, technically secondary content.  However, it's usually secondary content that's being selected to prove a particular point.  That point, and the selected content, might be perfectly fair (many times it really is), but there is a risk that it's not.  Consequently, while that section is technically SECONDARY, if you rely on it, the end result might not be DUE.
Having said that, if that's one of the best sources you can find, then &quot;better&quot; is better than &quot;worse&quot;, and we do not want to make erfect be the enemy of the good.  If you're using the best sources you can find (more recent, more scholarly, more secondary, more independent, etc.), and you're being careful about how you use them, then that might be the best approach to that rather narrow and culture-dependent subject. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 03:34, 21 July 2021 (UTC)

 e|WhatamIdoing, thanks for the nuanced response. I couldn't help thinking, while reading Davis et al., what went into their choice of narrative, and how they were evaluating results of other researchers' studies, and whether there was cherrypicking going on (or cherry-evaluating?).  In the endered associations of pink and blue article, I think we're exactly in the situation you describe: we have very little in the way of recent secondary reviews, so we may have to gingerly use some of this one qua secondary, and hope for the best, till something more solid comes along. For this article, the Jo Paoletti book is widely respected, afaict, but it dates to 2012 and a lot has happened since then; but I am also interested in the generalized question, which I think you've addressed as well, so thank you for that. If others want to chime in with their ideas or experiences, I'm all ears. ser:Mathglot|Mathglot (ser talk:Mathglot|talk) 04:43, 21 July 2021 (UTC)
I haven't taken a look at the article at all.  With that caveat, I expect that (if you haven't already) it would be useful to look for sources about non-Anglophone/non-Western/non-Christian countries (non-Christian because arian blue had gendered connotations in Europe).  If you grew up with &quot;pink is for girls&quot;, then it might be surprising to discover that most of the world didn't follow that model. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:00, 21 July 2021 (UTC)
 Not surprised. Also, it already has some (non-western Christian), and should have some more, but has to follow the studies that are out there. ser:Mathglot|Mathglot (ser talk:Mathglot|talk) 08:02, 22 July 2021 (UTC)

 I've been thinking about precisely this question for a while, thanks for asking it. In some fields, it seems to the the case that you don't have reviews and paper introductions are picking up the slack (I'm thinking about the machine learning field here). 
 The other thing I was thinking about at the same time as thinking about this was large epidemiological studies and whether these actually show up in reviews and whether they constitute a different kind of paper ser:Talpedia|Talpedia (ser talk:Talpedia|talk) 09:12, 22 July 2021 (UTC)

eflist-talk
It's been discussed at length, multiple times, on the article Talk page, and Research fraud - addendum on ivermectin|above here too. Bottom line, it's a suspicious paper[https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/ivermectin-is-the-new-hydroxychloroquine-take-2/] with undisclosed COIs, based in part apparently on fraudulent research[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/jul/16/huge-study-supporting-ivermectin-as-covid-treatment-withdrawn-over-ethical-concerns] and which makes P:EXCEPTIONAL claims that would undercut what all the major medical bodies (EMA, WHO, FDA etc) are saying. So it's not being used. Higher-quality research is underway so decent sources should be available before long. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 05:26, 23 July 2021 (UTC)

 PS, while I am glad to see the long-needed rewrite underway, I am quite concerned that ser:Kilopylae might not be familiar with P:WIAFA|FA standards, and is adding uncited text, and very old sources, so some guidance will be helpful.  I am traveling all week, and unlikely to have time to pitch in here.  The article is LONG overdue for a trip to P:FAR, which I have held off on because WP:MED has so many other articles in need of FAR. Perhaps someone else has time to guide Kilopylae in FA standards and high quality sourcing.  Tackling a medical article of this scope, and one which is so outdated, requires considerable experience, and unfortunately the main author, ser:Eubulides has been long gone for many years now. ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  22:13, 25 July 2021 (UTC)

 Manipulative surgery and faradism 

Hi, I have just created a biography of orton Smart (died 1956), a Scottish physician who is generally described as a &quot;anipulative surgeon&quot; and practised &quot;anipulative surgery&quot; (according to all of his obituaries). He was also an expert in aradism (medicine)|faradism, which was the &quot;use of induced rapidly alternating electric currents to stimulate nerve and muscle activity&quot; [https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095810419]. None of these terms have Wikipedia articles. I have literally no medical or scientific training, but from what I can gather they are no longer used in the medical profession; manipulative surgery seems to have been a specific form of orthopedic medicine which entailed fixing injuries by using the hands, and faradism was apparently used to treat muscle conditions. Morton himself did not like to be called an orthopedic surgeon. Should we have articles on these topics? —ser:Noswall59|Noswall59 (ser talk:Noswall59|talk) 15:26, 24 July 2021 (UTC).

@ser:Noswall59|Noswall59, [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0140673601228943 this old source] says that &quot;manipulative surgeon&quot; is the same thing as a onesetter.  [https://books.google.com/books/about/Manipulative_Surgery.html?id=_hJdL3G2lbgC This 1932 book] says &quot;Manipulative surgery may be defined simply as the art and practice of moving joints for therapeutic purposes&quot;.

Thanks all for these responses. His entry in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography calls him a &quot;manipulative surgeon&quot; and that was his title in the Royal Household, but then the ODNB also mentions that he &quot;did not regard himself as an orthopaedic surgeon ... [and] practised essentially as an orthopaedic physician&quot;, so I'll add that to the article. I imagine, based on [https://www.nature.com/articles/133516c0 this] book review in Nature (which says &quot;the practice of manipulative surgery is almost a monopoly of the bone-setter&quot;), that this was a sub-practice of bone-setting, in which case it might be worth a brief mention there? As for faradism, yes, he did invent the Smart-Bristow coil – I'll mention that too. —ser:Noswall59|Noswall59 (ser talk:Noswall59|talk) 07:50, 26 July 2021 (UTC).
