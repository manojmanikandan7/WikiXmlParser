I've tagged some claims in Venowave, and I wonder if the subject is notable. Any guidance on the notability of medical devices? I don't know the particulars of this article, but does one randomized controlled trial on a device establish notability, for example? Biosthmors (talk) 20:18, 13 July 2012 (UTC)
Not medically notable for its own page until a review article appears or discussion in a major textbook IMO.Doc James (talk ·  · ) (please reply on my talk page) 02:38, 14 July 2012 (UTC)

Technically, it's the same as any other commercial product, so  applies.  That generally means that you need two completely unrelated sources (two different authors and two different publications, and none of them controlled by or employed by the manufacturer) to qualify for an article.  A review article by someone connected to the manufacturer is a secondary source, but it's not an independent/third-party source, which is a critical point for notability.  (.)

Article: Eschar



as stated in the headline I have a Question regarding the medical Article Eschar. I am slightly confused by the image included in the Article. The caption states the wound in question to be covered by an Eschar (scab). Searching for scab though leads nowhere near the Article in question. This leads me to the following I would like to inquire: Is the object in the picture a wound covered in an Eschar or in a scab? (Especially since the term &quot;black wound&quot; redicrect to Eschar and the picture shows no such thing.) If it is the latter, the picture would have to be removed. The former leads to the second question. Are scab and eschar synonyms (Addendum: per the greek origin)? If yes it would follow that appropriate consequences be taken in the article scab. If not, the word would have to be removed from the question.

I sinccerely appreciate your input and would like to thank you for your time.

Clinically all eschars are scabs, but all scabs are not eschars.  An eschar is dry, black, hard necrotic tissue (see: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1360405/]).  In dermatology, some remember a basic differential for an eschar with the mnemonic CAGES T: Clostridium/Calciphylaxis, Aspergillus/Anthrax, Group B strep, Ecthyma gangrenosum, Spider bite, and Tache noir from ricketssial spotted fevers.  Hope that helps.  ---My Core Competency is Competency (talk) 15:23, 14 July 2012 (UTC)

Hello Jmh, Hello My core,

thank you for your quick answers. (This is cross posted in the medicine portal and on Jmhs' talk page as per his request.) My core and you, Jmh, answered the questions I raised halfway. Namely you state An eschar is dry, black, hard necrotic tissue. The picture in the WP-article does indeed show no such thing. While the scab shown it might be dry and hard, it is certainly not black. (Wherefore I assume it is not an Eschar.) Also, since you made the distinctions clear, might it not be necessary to alter the article about wound healing (to which scab redirects) in such a way that the logical distinction becomes clear? The caption under the image in question also remains in its illogical state. I raised the question because I did and do not feel qualified to edit medical articles and the logic of both of them seemed contradictory.

Artificial nutrition and hydration in end-of-life care.

The Liverpool Care Pathway, the UK NHS protocol for care of the dying in the last hours of life, is in the news again.
 
Following a Daily Mail piece last month that it's all a plot to starve and dehydrate the elderly to an untimely death, the story has been taken up by more papers yesterday and today,  generally in a sensationalist and utterly uninformed way, following a letter to the Daily Telegraph by six usual suspects grinding some rather worn axes.

After the DM piece, the wiki article has unfortunately acquired a &quot;Controversy&quot; section, which currently leaves rather a lot to be desired.

I'd be grateful if anyone with a good grasp of palliative / end-of-life care could step in and sort out the wheat from the chaff. Jheald (talk) 03:12, 10 July 2012 (UTC)

I was thinking along those lines too, so have simply removed the &quot;Controversy&quot; subheading, leaving the text under &quot;Reception.&quot; --Anthonyhcole (talk) 06:30, 16 July 2012 (UTC)

Yes. The remaining content doesn't characterise the controversy very well, doesn't clarify whether it is a popular or scientific controversy, and doesn't really establish the existence of a  controversy. Perhaps we should continue this on the article talk page. --Anthonyhcole (talk) 05:13, 17 July 2012 (UTC)

Orthostasis: request for advice

I've redirected orthostasis to standing, as that is the literal meaning of the term. However, &quot;orthostasis&quot; previously linked to orthostatic hypotension, and orthostasis is linked extensively elsewhere, presumably in some cases with the intent of linking this other meaning.

This is where expert help is needed. Are there any other things &quot;orthostasis&quot; and/or &quot;orthostatic&quot; could mean? Could some of the page linkers have intended other meanings, such as orthostatic intolerance. orthostatic hypertension, orthostatic tremor? 

For some links, see:
* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Orthostasis (currently from 11 mainspace articles)
* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Orthostatic (currently from 6 mainspace articles)

Can anyone here help with this, please? -- The Anome (talk) 17:30, 16 July 2012 (UTC)

Ayurveda safety concerns

The lead of the article on Ayurveda contains a paragraph on safety concerns, which are a major issue in the discussion in independent reliable sources.

Secondary or primary sources?

And continues to insist that primary sources can be used to refute secondary sources. They are using this primary source [http://progressreport.cancer.gov/doc_detail.asp?pid=1&amp;did=2007&amp;chid=71&amp;coid=707&amp;mid=] to refute this secondary one [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3039795/?report=abstract]. See discussion here [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Prostate_cancer#NCI_secondary.2C_then_primary_going_deeper_same_line_of_thinking] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Healthy_diet#NCI_secondary.2C_then_primary_going_deeper_same_line_of_thinking] among other places. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your talk page please reply on mine) 15:42, 16 July 2012 (UTC)

I read wiki rules treat NCI &quot;Cancer Trends Progress Report&quot; as secondary.  It's used elsewhere as secondary.  NCI should be senior to BJC review.  ie a review of reviews (NCI) is better than one underlying (BJC) review.

I plan to use http://www.dietandcancerreport.org/cancer_resource_center/downloads/WCRF%20Policy%20US%20Summary_final.pdf to supplement the NCI.32cllou (talk) 16:52, 16 July 2012 (UTC)

Great and I am happy with the reference. However please do not remove other recent secondary sources. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your talk page please reply on mine) 17:05, 16 July 2012 (UTC)

[http://progressreport.cancer.gov/introduction.asp &quot;The report is based on the most recent data from the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, other federal agencies, professional groups, and cancer researchers.&quot;]
That does not sound like a primary source or an original study to me.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 17:22, 16 July 2012 (UTC)
However this bit is [http://progressreport.cancer.gov/doc_detail.asp?pid=1&amp;did=2007&amp;chid=71&amp;coid=707&amp;mid=] and is looking at the consumption rates of fruits in vegatables in the USA rather than specifically the cancer risk associated with said consumption.Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your talk page please reply on mine) 17:40, 16 July 2012 (UTC)
 I don't agree that [http://progressreport.cancer.gov/doc_detail.asp?pid=1&amp;did=2007&amp;chid=71&amp;coid=707&amp;mid=] is a primary source. The connection between diet and cancer is complex, with apparently reliable secondary sources contradicting each other.

There's lots of work to do in those three articles(diet, healthy diet, prostate cancer) based on this review and policy statement(s), and please help (be constructive, not obstructive).  We only have space for the best secondary, not one BJC review which (lone) says different stuff and confuses stronger findings.  Do not remove NCI statements re antioxidants, high heated meat, and fruit and vegetable (spec types of plant foods) consumption and reduced risk of specific cancers.

So if I understand you correctly you plan to continue to try to remove this review article from 2011 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=10.1038%2Fsj.bjc.6606032]? Is it that you disagree with its conclusions? Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your talk page please reply on mine) 17:21, 16 July 2012 (UTC)
We have plenty of space.  Adding one extra sentence to say that things aren't 100% proven doesn't cost us a dime.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 17:24, 16 July 2012 (UTC)
OK BJC leave in, but generally isn't http://www.dietandcancerreport.org/cancer_resource_center/downloads/Policy_Report.pdf  ie peer committee findings policy review of reviews superior to that single BJC review?  Isn't it bad to place BCJ inferior review where it will harm stronger secondary?32cllou (talk) 17:45, 16 July 2012 (UTC)
Again, I don't think this is a binary either/or situation. We can cite both sources (and I agree with WhatamIdoing that both are secondary). The sources don't really differ much, except by putting a slightly different &quot;spin&quot; on existing data. The NCI source says there is &quot;some suggested evidence for a lower risk of cancers&quot; with a healthy diet, whereas the 2011 Br J. Cancer review says there is &quot;little to no evidence&quot;.To me, the sources are basically agreeing that there isn't very much or very strong evidence. But there's also nothing to lose by encouraging Americans to eat a healthier diet - no one is going to be harmed, and there are proven benefits in the non-cancer outcomes - so the NCI puts a slightly more positive spin on the limited evidence for cancer risk. This falls squarely under &quot;experts reviewing the same data reach slightly different conclusions&quot; category, and we should just explain and cite both positions. MastCell Talk 18:52, 16 July 2012 (UTC)
Agree and will add back in a summary using [http://www.dietandcancerreport.org/cancer_resource_center/downloads/WCRF%20Policy%20US%20Summary_final.pdf ] &quot; It is recommended that people maintain a normal weight (limiting consumption of energy dense foods and sugary drinks), eat plant based food, limit red and processed meat, and limit alcohol.&quot; Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your talk page please reply on mine) 20:42, 16 July 2012 (UTC)

PS looks like we need that selenium sentence back Doc from secondary see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22648711 32cllou (talk) 17:50, 16 July 2012 (UTC)
Yes there is a relationship between selenium serum levels and cancer per the ref. This report on page 150 states [http://www.dietandcancerreport.org/cancer_resource_center/downloads/Policy_Report.pdf] that a trial of supplementation did not find benefit. I will add this. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your talk page please reply on mine) 17:53, 16 July 2012 (UTC)
Higher selenium blood levels have been associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer, a trial of supplementation however did not find benefit.
Good.  I came back here just now to please add the concern that users would (they should NOT) think supplements are beneficial.32cllou (talk) 18:42, 16 July 2012 (UTC)
I'm slightly troubled by this - the association between selenium levels and prostate cancer is supposed to be a preliminary result which generates the hypothesis that selenium supplementation might prevent prostate cancer. That hypothesis has been tested, and it didn't pan out. To go back to the statistical association reported in cohort studies seems silly, when this idea has already been tested in a prospective, randomized fashion. But that's me. MastCell Talk 18:55, 16 July 2012 (UTC)
I was the one who took it out, but then finding the review Doc used thought he might want it back.
Yes so we now state there was tentative evidence that their was an association with selenium but that it did not pan out.

How about this http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15110491 to paraphrase a short sentence from this quote:
&quot;High concentrations of IGF-I were associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer (odds ratio comparing 75th with 25th percentile 1.49, 95% CI 1.14-1.95) and premenopausal breast cancer (1.65, 1.26-2.08) and high concentrations of IGFBP-3 were associated with increased risk of premenopausal breast cancer (1.51, 1.01-2.27). Associations were larger in assessments of plasma samples than in serum samples, and in standard case-control studies compared with nested studies.
INTERPRETATION:

Circulating concentrations of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 are associated with an increased risk of common cancers, but associations are modest and vary between sites. Although laboratory methods need to be standardised, these epidemiological observations could have major implications for assessment of risk and prevention of cancer.&quot;32cllou (talk) 22:22, 16 July 2012 (UTC)
The other one is a little newer (2009 verses 2004) thus I would use the newer one. But they both say the same thing. &quot;High levels of IGF-I are linked to prostate cancer&quot; maybe Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your talk page please reply on mine) 23:24, 16 July 2012 (UTC)

Antioxidants and cancer

Can I use this research? http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15523104 abstract below
For a short sentence like Consumption of antioxidant rich foods may reduce cancer risk.

&quot;Epidemiological studies show that a high intake of anti-oxidant-rich foods is inversely related to cancer risk. While animal and cell cultures confirm the anticancer effects of antioxidants, intervention trials to determine their ability to reduce cancer risk have been inconclusive, although selenium and vitamin E reduced the risk of some forms of cancer, including prostate and colon cancer, and carotenoids have been shown to help reduce breast cancer risk. Cancer treatment by radiation and anticancer drugs reduces inherent antioxidants and induces oxidative stress, which increases with disease progression. Vitamins E and C have been shown to ameliorate adverse side effects associated with free radical damage to normal cells in cancer therapy, such as mucositis and fibrosis, and to reduce the recurrence of breast cancer. While clinical studies on the effect of anti-oxidants in modulating cancer treatment are limited in number and size, experimental studies show that antioxidant vitamins and some phytochemicals selectively induce apoptosis in cancer cells but not in normal cells and prevent angiogenesis and metastatic spread, suggesting a potential role for antioxidants as adjuvants in cancer therapy.&quot;32cllou (talk) 15:47, 17 July 2012 (UTC)

PS  Are you all sure I can't use that NCI Factsheet to make the same statement?  How about if I don't list any specific foods like the NCI factsheet did?32cllou (talk) 15:48, 17 July 2012 (UTC)
The thing is we have a number of excellent recent studies which has found that supplementation of antioxidants actually increases cancer risk. Will provide them shortly. The human body uses oxidation to destroy cancerous cells thus anti oxidants may not be a good idea. And well some foods may decrease the risk of cancer there is little evidence that this occurs via antioxidant mechanisms.Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your talk page please reply on mine) 16:02, 17 July 2012 (UTC)

There are a lot of good systematic reviews on this question - but in this instance, the Cochrane over-arching one is really solid  . The reviews are very controversial in this area, partly because it's hard to understand how on earth relatively slow-growing cancers could appear so quickly. So it's not causing, but accelerating, perhaps.

PS consistently supplements are bad, fruits and low calorie density vegetables good.32cllou (talk) 16:45, 19 July 2012 (UTC)

Those claims in that article aren't supported by the evidence: the evidence suggests something else completely. The article is the personal point of view of a single person, writing in 2004 without any formal review of the evidence. It has a very high risk of bias, and it is very out of date. In some areas, 2004 information could still be current, but not in something as heavily researched as this. You don't see studies specifically about fruit and vegetables: it's a part of a dietary pattern, and so assumptions are made. You might find the discussion about that in the American Cancer Society Guidelines useful : for a big picture explanation on nutrition, it looks quite good. (For the issue of supplements, then the Cochrane review I cited before.) But these contradict, in important points, several statements in that 2004 opinion piece.

I'm beginning to think that might actually be a good thing. In a way, it penalizes us when we've based an article on a ridiculously large number of sources, which generally means that we've lost sight of either MEDRS or UNDUE. However, the truth is changing citation types needs article consensus, so in effect tools need to support all types. Of course, citation bot can convert to the article's dominant form anyhow, but how much better to do it right the first time? LeadSongDog come howl! 05:32, 18 July 2012 (UTC)

You will never produce a comprehensive, balanced or unbiased article on Obesity, for example, by only citing medical journal reviews. And I agree with WhatAmIDoing that big-topic articles should be built on books, not reviews, and never primary studies (though we all agree on that one). But this is off-topic and I agree that our standard citation templates are a dreadful implementation and more complex than just writing the citation. Colin°Talk 07:36, 19 July 2012 (UTC)

* If they generated citations without templates, it would work fine here and also be useful on any of the thousands of non-Wikipedia websites using Mediawiki software in the world.

* If they can offer two options that would be best. Many editors use the citation templates so unfortunately cite journal is an inevitable requirement.

On a sidenote, I sense it's really interesting to see key organizations like NCBI and the WHO giving this sort of collaborative attention to Wikipedia. Imo, it's an indication that they recognize the relevance of Wikipedia as a real-world source of biomedical information. That relevance is something that I personally find rather scary, but I'm also beginning to see as a challenge. My feeling is that input like this is a really encouraging sign.

Dissociative Identity Disorder


... has serious problems with reliable sources, original research, undue weight, and possible meatpuppetry.  I do not feel I can edit the article neutrally, but I would appreciate if some MEDRS-conversant editors could take a look at it.  There is a very stark disconnect between the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dissociative_identity_disorder&amp;oldid=502512698 old, stable article] and the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dissociative_identity_disorder&amp;oldid=502641833 radically rewritten version] created by a single purpose agenda account.

Please read what he wrote this morning.  I don't want a battle. I just want an unbiased page on DID. I am totally open to help from unbiased editors! See his last note under Howdy on his talk page. This man has so many friends on WP and so much power it's been impossible to work without being completely micromanaged by him in the past - so much so that I don't think I have actually ever even had one edit stay on the page until now. In this paragraph titled &quot;Howdy&quot; he plays victim, which is so far from the truth it's insane. Those that oppose him usually get banned from the DID page or give up and go away. This might be the wrong place to take this, but the admin board is where many of his friends hangout. Please give me advice! By the way - how am I a meatpuppet when I am pretty much in there by my self? The last revert however is a suspicious act by another reverting back to WLU's old version.~ty (talk) 16:52, 17 July 2012 (UTC)
The article needs attention from accounts with access to the sources and a willingness to put in the time, but mostly from accounts who are familiar with the policies and guidelines (or even manual of style - even the table of contents illustrates some of the problems on the page).

Without any intended offense to Tylas, who clearly has put a lot of effort into the article, but the article seems to have taken a very large step backwards compared to what it originally looked like, in terms of prose and neutrality (there's 4 lines about the DSM-IV, but multiple paragraphs about the theoretical publication DSM-V? Really?).  I think a mass revert would probably be in the best interest of the encyclopedia; everything is stored in history so that that well sourced material to MEDRS compliant sources can be added slowly.Yobol (talk) 22:30, 17 July 2012 (UTC)
The idea of WP is to give information. The information there now is far superior to what it was. Let me work on it. Give me suggestions. I will happily fix them. Please read the article and give me things to work on rather than taking it back to the version that honestly - was embarrassing to those who do know about DID. Better yet! Help me fix the the problems you see. Even WLU admits that the old version of the article needed a complete rewrite. I believe his argument is that he wants the controversy to bear the same weight as the mainstream consensus in the field of DID research. By the way - I have hardly touched the section you just refereed to.  That is pretty much how it was. I had no problem with that at all. There is a huge amount of work being put into the changes in the DSM 5 right now that are of interest to the field of DID.

A revert to the old version and slow editing to retain limited improvements would be a good idea in my opinion.  The page portrays the traumagenic position as unapologetically correct and any who disagree to be simply wrong.  The lead doesn't even mention the iatrogenic position.  There is far too much name dropping.  There are semi-headings like &quot;New Era of Better Therapy&quot; and &quot;Life Does Not Begin With A Unified Identity&quot;.  The page reads about as smoothly as a roller coaster.  The page doesn't follow anything close to the MOS or MEDMOS.  Citations are included as plain text numbers like [1] and [2] instead of hyperlinked citations.  Citations are incomplete.  Images are spammed throughout and bear tenuous connections to the text.  The section on etiology doesn't mention the primary controversy over DID - whether it is caused by trauma or inappropriate therapeutic techniques.  The controversies are ghettoized to a &quot;controversy&quot; section, which is inappropriate per .  Tenuous theories are presented as unabashed facts.  The voice is wrong, with statements like &quot;Virtually all we have to direct us...&quot; and &quot;Integration is a confusing term, since we know we do not begin life integrated.&quot;  Review articles are deprecated in favour of books which are quite one-sided.  There is an obvious copyright violation.  All of these issues are ones I can glean just from scanning the page, I haven't even given it a thorough read through and I haven't delved into the actual sources (let alone conducted the careful parsing of sources required to determine ).  I very much agree with Yobol, the page does need a revert and attention from experienced editors beyond just myself.  My attempts to engage and discuss, despite my constant reference to policy, are dismissed with accusations of bias ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Editor_assistance/Requests&amp;diff=502820735&amp;oldid=502672820 for instance], that I'm a member of the False Memory Syndrome Foundation), gross misrepresentation of my actions (for instance, another editor [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:WLU&amp;diff=502743624&amp;oldid=500776377 leaving me a message] is canvassing) and the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Dissociative_identity_disorder&amp;diff=495337260&amp;oldid=495335694 bizarre nonsequiters].

You did not argue a bit with him when he made those suggestions. This was my first contact with him ever, but he appears to be an advanced WP editor who had tried in vain to edit the DID page in the past and was never allowed, I assume by the award he put on my [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tylas&amp;diff=501453896&amp;oldid=501427578 talk page] as defender for those who were abused as children. WLU, I have read a vast amount of research the last couple of weeks and not one paper has said that the views are equal. They state the trauma view is considered mainstream, but there is controversy. That is how the lede is arranged per Daniel Santos. I did have quite a bit more in there before that time, but I must agree that he was correct. Simply point out what you view as a violation and I can fix it or you can, but does not mean reverting all the last 1,000 edits or so. In this version there is a huge controversy section, adding things you did not even have on the page about the iatrogenic position. There is even a large section totally on the iatrogenic position. I was interrupted by all this today, but I was adding such to the history as well. The problem with this argument, which you probably know well, is that the average editor does not have a clue what it is we are talking about when it comes to the weight of each argument, but they can go and read the research and see for themselves - which I would love. WLU, you are again playing victim when that is so far from the truth it's ridiculous. You have only allowed those you can micromanage to ever edit that page - or that write what you personally agree with - your POV. There is a very nice editor there on the DID page now who is helping me with WP rules. I am fixing the points WLU said here. All he had to do was mention them on the talk page or fix them instead of reverting all this work back to an old version. I never called him a member of any organization and do not care. My point is that he pushed the iatrogenic POV even though it is not mainstream. I have very much included it in the article, but it is not equal to the trauma view per all the articles I have read - including review articles. I have included both books (which I read many) and reivew articles. No review article is excluded on the page. [User:Tylas|~ty]] (talk) 00:17, 18 July 2012 (UTC)
 I'd support a revert to an earlier, stable version, as it seems quite a mess now - bunches of citations in the lede etc. - on an on. - have any brain studies definitively shown parts of the brain to be associated with DDD, rather than just &quot;trauma&quot; in general? The iatrogenic view is not a quack position. Just my view. I haven't been involved in the writing of the article, but I was startled by the massive, sudden changes without consent of the participating editors apparently. MathewTownsend (talk) 02:01, 18 July 2012 (UTC)
The problem with that is that anyone that edits the article WLU runs off. It's not that people have not tried over a great period of time - they are just not able.  WLU stepped back and let me, so I did. I have spent the day fixing anything that editors are pointing out. A revert back to the version that no one is allowed to edit would be simply wrong and I hope that is not WP is and it is a version that even WLU says is in need of a rewrite. It is not the better version. I built on the existing version step by step - over 1,000 edits. I did not run off in the dark and make a new page and spring it on everyone. If WLU will work with me instead of reverting every edit, I am quite happy to work with him. ~ty (talk) 02:05, 18 July 2012 (UTC)
No, I'm sorry, the present version is not better. Many changes seem to have been made without reference to Wikipedia general policies and content/style guidelines. Reverting to the earlier version should pave the way for appropriate incremental improvements with more eyes on the article. —MistyMorn (talk) 08:13, 18 July 2012 (UTC)

Tylas has done 2189 edits this year (and 260 before that). It looks like all the edits this year are in connection with Dissociative identity disorder. That might be a sign of a dedicated expert working to improve the encyclopedia, but given the lack of real communication on the article talk page (which looks like a series of &quot;I WONT BE CONTROLLED by you or anyone else&quot;), it is much more likely that the descriptions of problems given above are accurate. The current article has an image with caption &quot;Early experiences with caregivers gradually give rise to a system of thoughts, memories, beliefs, expectations, emotions and behaviors about the self and others.&quot; that appears to be , and text like &quot;It is imperative to get the right diagnosis so a patient receives correct treatment&quot; is a good indication of advocacy. I support reverting the article to the old version. Improvements should be incremental and based on policies, with collaboration being paramount—any issues must be responded to without digressions about other editors. Johnuniq (talk) 10:07, 18 July 2012 (UTC)
Tylas is not a dedicated expert, as she discloses on her talk page she is currently in therapy for DID.  If you look in the archives, I have spent a lot of time indicating why I object to specific changes on policy and guideline grounds, and have basically had my concerns dismissed because &quot;I just don't understand DID&quot; [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Dissociative_identity_disorder&amp;diff=500064839&amp;oldid=500063929].  I copied the last stable version to a subpage and have added some text based on a recent review article.  I plan on, when I have the time, continuing to update that subpage version based on recent review articles and what improvements Tylas made that are genuine improvements.  But it is exhausting to do on my own when my  are ignored.  WLU (t)  Wikipedia's rules:/ 13:48, 18 July 2012 (UTC)
The article should be reverted to its last stable version in my view. Among other (massive) problems, there are 22 citations in the lede alone. For example, the sentence in the lede, &quot;Dissociative disorders, including DID are often mistaken for various disorders by those that are not trained or educated in trauma psychology.&quot; is sourced to a Polish journal article, and two Japanese articles, all of which are primary sources. MathewTownsend (talk) 14:21, 18 July 2012 (UTC)
I have referred to this discussion on the DID talk page, suggesting the DID main page be reverted to the last stable version (plus the changes mentioned above, per my sub-page draft).  See .  WLU (t)  Wikipedia's rules:/ 14:52, 18 July 2012 (UTC)
It's true that people with a medical condition can be experts, and that experts in an area sometimes develop the conditions they are experts in.  After all, some people go into a particular field because they have a personal interest in it, and being a cardiologist doesn't make you magically immune from hypertension or cholesterol problems. 
But it's also true that patients tend to believe that their personal experience is the sole truth for everyone.  People who subjectively feel better if they swallow a dozen pills each day tend to believe that herbal or homeopathic treatments really work, even if it's been proven that the contents of the pills don't matter.  People like Tylas, a self-disclosed person with DID, tend to have strong views that what they believe is the cause of their own DID is the cause of everyone's DID.  People with multiple chemical sensitivity tend to be angry when anyone points out that most people who say they have MCS actually have treatable anxiety or depression rather than an actual problem with &quot;chemicals&quot;.
This is just how the human brain works.  With the best will in the world, someone in Tylas' situation is likely to accidentally misread sources in ways that show the source to more strongly support their own personal beliefs than the source actually does. 
As for the advice to slow down:  Tylas has made [http://toolserver.org/~daniel/WikiSense/Contributors.php?wikilang=en&amp;wikifam=.wikipedia.org&amp;page=Dissociative_identity_disorder&amp;since=2012-07-01&amp;until=&amp;grouped=on&amp;order=-edit_count&amp;max=100&amp;order=-edit_count&amp;format=html 635 edits to the article this month], and claims on the talk page to be editing [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Dissociative_identity_disorder&amp;diff=502543977&amp;oldid=502543328 &quot;slowly - oh so slowly in fact&quot;].

My reasoning why this is wrong is written on the DID page under &quot;&quot; also listed here for your convince. 
The problems with this are the usual things you have done on this page WLU.
# You have now taken total control again. Before this last round of edits which you entirely reverted, I was not allowed even one edit to remain. You did the same with TomCloyd. He was a content expert and knew WP well, yet you still would not allow him to make one edit! (if one or two were allowed, I am sorry, but I think you did full reverts of anything either of us tried to do.) Notice, even a small edit like removing the symptom paranoia resulted in a revert war. You would not allow me even one edit of something that was flat out wrong.
# You then let FF edit, as long as you could control (micromanaged) her edits. I announced I will not be controlled (micromanaged) by you, and that statement was taken out of context and used on the med page.
# You cried victim when I started to edit. You cried victim when TomCloyd tried to edit, claiming - again out of context that he called you a psychopath. He said you exhibited psychopathic behavior, which you do. Yet you twisted that to say he was calling you names on the playground and he got banned by the same folks that seem to show up in your favor when you have conflict.
# Most of those who said anything on the med page are the same that came to your aid to ban TomCloyd. I would think this sort of thing needs to be brought in front of an unbiased crowd instead of you calling forth your buddies to vote your way.
# Even now you say YOU will put back in my edits that YOU deem good. Also as soon as I started to edit today you reverted the whole thing to a version you were working on in your sandbox. What makes you sole judge? Why can't I and other editors also work on the article? I know many how have tried to edit this page have that same complaint.

Not true. I too believe the iatrogenic position, but I also believe the mainstream model and that is the traumatic model. As I have pointed out, even the most current 2012 review in favor of the iatrogenic position says that the trauma model is the model of Conventional Wisdom. Quote from it: &quot;[http://cdp.sagepub.com/content/21/1/48.short challenge to Conventional Wisdom]&quot; I of course believe both models should be presented, but they are far from equal and you would like them to be - this is NOT my opinion - this is simply how it is. I have never, ever read anywhere that they are even close to being equal. ~ty (talk) 22:48, 19 July 2012 (UTC)
Also, I did not say MathewTownsend is too biased. I quoted exactly what he said - in the talk where you and he discuss how you will both go about working on the DID page - including using your draft from your sandbox.

More like address your points or ignore them. Your edit made personal attacks on WLU, inserted text to change the meaning of it within text others had written, and just generally did not belong. You should be lucky it was taken away, as it prevented people from seeing your personal attacks and bad behavior more readily. Keep in mind that a number of edits and reverts he made to DID that Tylas is complaining about would have been made by me other editors there if WLU hadn't gotten there first. He has strong support in general for his actions, and if Tylas isn't getting her way, it's because she doesn't have the same support. Looks above at the number of editors saying Tylas' edits were not appropriate -- seeing that, how can you or her say that what WLU is doing is wrong? Frankly, everything you and Tylas have accused him of (like personal attacks, edit warring, bias, etc.) appears to be behavior that you and Tylas are actually doing quite severely yourselves but are too emotionally attached to judge your own actions clearly.

Passive smoking

An editor has tagged this article with a NPOV tag and has stated they feel the lead is non-neutral and &quot;shrill&quot;. Some input from others on the talk page may be helpful to resolve this dispute. Yobol (talk) 13:09, 24 July 2012 (UTC)
We need people to support claims of POV with references. Not just stating that they do not like the conclusions of the evidence. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your talk page please reply on mine) 21:57, 24 July 2012 (UTC)
I have a certain level of sympathy with the editor.  Here in California we are subjected to a barrage of TV ads about second-hand smoking that reach heights of absurdity, certainly not supported by scientific data.  You could easily get the impression that a whiff of second-hand smoke is worse than first-hand smoking a pack of cigarettes.  It would be nice if our article didn't play into that hysteria -- however I don't really know enough detail about this issue to make any concrete proposals. Looie496 (talk) 23:02, 24 July 2012 (UTC)

Wikipedian in residence at WHO

The general goal of the position would be to accomplish the work of the WHO and to engage some of the 900+ interns which come to the WHO every year. In addition to this position, I predict that in the future other health organizations would also like to have a Wikipedian in residence. I am employed in such a position and am happy to talk with anyone about what I do - in summary, I present Wikipedia to non-Wikipedians and introduce them to editing Wikipedia.

I actually redirected Parkinson's disease and Diet, another page they created today back to Parkinson's disease Diet section. Most of the material on that page appears to be redundant to the information we already have in both Parkinson's disease and Management of Parkinson's disease, and probably doesn't justify its own page yet (not to mention the use of non-MEDRS, etc).

Health information on the internet is a relevant concern for general medical journals such as the BMJ (and a few weeks won't change that). Wikipedia is a special case in some ways, both because of its crowdsourced (participatory information sharing) characteristics and its high profile on the internet. Communicating thoughtfully with the scientific medical community through journals such as the BMJ can only be a good thing, imo. As regards responses to this particular BMJ letter, these have to go through the online &quot;Rapid response&quot; [http://www.bmj.com/about-bmj/resources-readers/responding-articles]. This is open to anyone, and it might be a good, relatively informal way of clarifying some of the issues raised in the Letter, such as the apparent eccentricity of citing a New York Times article about a major study rather than the study itself (per Anthony's suggestion). But it might also provide a way for the Project to communicate its broader plans -- I guess there's a fair likelihood the BMJ editorial committee could consider a more &quot;official&quot; submission of this sort for publication in its print edition. 2c, —MistyMorn (talk) 19:29, 1 August 2012 (UTC)
Proposed response to BMJ letter
Response to Kint and Hart, &quot;Should clinicians edit Wikipedia to engage a wider
world web?&quot; BMJ 2012;345:e4275 doi: 10.1136/bmj.e4275 (Published 3 July 2012)

Up to 80% of internet users in developed countries search the internet for health information - problems, symptoms, diseases and treatments - and a Wikipedia page is often at or near the top of search engine results for an English medical term.[1] Wikipedia medical editors take this prominent position very seriously and have put in place systems and policies to monitor and improve the accuracy of Wikipedia's medical content. 

Using a frequently updated page listing recent changes to Wikipedia medical articles,[2] a team of volunteers, in many time zones, constantly checks the quality of sources supporting new content, and confirms the content is evidence-based, current and relevant to the article in question.

Wikipedia content is governed by policies and guidelines. Content must reflect &quot;reliable sources.&quot; For health-related content, &quot;reliable&quot; usually means recent expert reviews published in peer-reviewed scholarly journals; recent graduate-level textbooks; current professional, national or international guidelines (e.g., ICD 10, DSM); etc.[3] Content that is not supported by such sources may be deleted from the encyclopedia. Well-sourced, relevant content is rarely removed. 

WikiProject Medicine[4] is an informal group of physicians, researchers and other volunteers who share a commitment to ensuring that Wikipedia medical articles are comprehensive, reliable and understandable. We are presently establishing a non-profit corporation aimed at making all current medical knowledge freely available online to all people in their chosen language. Discussions regarding the nature and aims of that body are underway, and input from physicians is welcome.[5]

We understand the suspicion with which many physicians view Wikipedia, but given its prominence, the fact that their patients and carers and many of their colleagues and students use Wikipedia medical articles, and given the systems and policies in place to monitor quality, we hope that physicians might consider writing, reviewing or correcting a Wikipedia medical article. The policies and guidelines are a little elaborate at times, but the volunteers at WikiProject Medicine[4] are always willing to help and guide. Articles or paragraphs that reflect the current scholarly consensus, are based on reliable sources and are relevant will be watched over and defended by medical volunteers, and are often consulted by hundreds or thousands of readers per day.

This is a first draft. Suggestions? --Anthonyhcole (talk) 09:56, 2 August 2012 (UTC)
Just my 2c, no more... I would suggest sending that sort of response in an unofficial capacity, as a personal consideration from an individual member of the Project (eg by rewording &quot;We are presently...&quot; to &quot;Wikipedia is presently...&quot;, and  &quot;We understand...&quot; to something like &quot;I think we all understand...&quot;; then maybe leaving &quot;we hope that physicians...&quot; as it stands). Personally, I feel that a more official response from the Project would do well to acknowledge openly some of the real underlying issues regarding Wikipedia's prominent role as a source of health information online, showing that we recognise their complexity and are working to address our current limitations in ways that are both ambitious and realistic. More generally, I sense that the Project is on the cusp of a sea change, and that part of that change should involve the Project engaging with the EBM community (eg via journals such as BMJ) on its terms rather than just (or mainly) ours. As I say, just 2 small cents, —MistyMorn (talk) 10:37, 2 August 2012 (UTC)
Obviously, it's important to specify in the &quot;statement of competing interests&quot; membership of the Wikipedia Medicine Project. This in itself should help contextualise any response from an individual member(s) of the Project. —MistyMorn (talk) 11:33, 2 August 2012 (UTC)
  Kint and Hart's letter demonstrates a fundamental lack of understanding of how anonymous editing works and the constraints it imposes on sourcing. Although they may be prepared to uncritically endorse a particular primary study based on their own expertise, we don't have the luxury of deferring to any editor's claims of authority (as the Essjay case clearly demonstrated). Nor are we constrained to be &quot;up-to-the-minute&quot; in tracking novel reports; we are first and foremost an encyclopedia, a digest of accepted knowledge, and have no remit to stand in place of medical journals, where it is appropriate for primary research to be documented.
 Rant over: I'm not suggesting that we need to make those points so forcefully, but I do believe that it is important to try to make the nature of Wikipedia clearer, in the interest of reducing the chances of outside groups &quot;talking past&quot; us because of their inaccurate assumptions. --RexxS (talk) 10:50, 2 August 2012 (UTC)
Yup, I think that's an important point. Also, it doesn't take a sub-speciality expert to compile quality tertiary source information on a particular topic. I'd also thought of addressing some of those more specific points in a separate individual response to their letter. But I'm going to be out of action for a couple of days. —MistyMorn (talk) 10:57, 2 August 2012 (UTC)
There is no hurry. I think your and RexxS's points are well-made. I was very aware as I wrote the above it was far from perfect and invite you both, and everyone else, to propose a draft. I think that a letter endorsed by many regulars here would be more authoritative (and probably just better) than any individual response I could contrive, though I'd encourage individual responses too, if something you consider important doesn't get into the group letter. Whatever. BMJ has essentially opened the discussion, and we should join it somehow. --Anthonyhcole (talk) 12:02, 2 August 2012 (UTC)
What I was trying to convey is that there's room for multiple responses from individual members of the Project clarifying specific points (as, for example, in your draft). Yes, a collective letter would certainly be more authoritative, but equally certainly more taxing: it would constitute a peer-review publication in its own right which could be cited in the future as direct or indirect evidence of the Project's position (and perhaps also attitude) at this juncture towards many wider issues. Some caution required here, imo. In haste, —MistyMorn (talk) 12:21, 2 August 2012 (UTC)
Maybe. I see this as an opportunity to address a lot of physicians, and want to make the most of it. I fear that a clutch of disparate individual responses may result in the journal's editor picking one less relevant response over three or four crucial points for publication. --Anthonyhcole (talk) 14:29, 2 August 2012 (UTC)
As with any source, a reader gets more value from a Wikipedia article if they understand something of the mechanism that produced it. The simple act of clicking on &quot;View history&quot; will reveal recent revisions to an article, but readers often simply do not know this. It is perhaps the single best tool that diligent readers have for assuring themselves they are not being mislead by a vandal. I'd suggest adding a reminder to that effect.

 Thank you to Biosthmors for drawing this to our attention.

 I'd like to wait a day or so for more input from others here before adding anything. My proposal was just a talking point and I'm quite prepared for a group letter to be very different from that.

Yup, it seems like there's a desire to reply as a Project, which I fully recognise is the right thing. My concern, largely stemming from my experiences as a medical writer, has been to give some thought about how best to reply.

These are the topics covered in the study. Some were red links and I have just redirected them to a synonym or an article with a section covering the topic. I'd appreciate a second opinion on those redirects, particularly the last one, Lymphatic malformation → Cystic lymphatic malformation.

However, the current Cystic lymphatic malformation page doesn't mention the term &quot;cystic lymphangioma&quot;.That leaves the small question about what to do about the topic of  &quot;lymphatic malformations&quot; as a whole . - Do we need a separate Lymphatic abnormalities [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh?term=lymphatic%20abnormalities] page? - Or, specifically for the malformations, Congenital lymphatic abnormalities? —MistyMorn (talk) 09:07, 1 August 2012 (UTC)

Neoplastic drug resistance

This article from the BBC [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-19111700] indirectly got me wondering whether we have an issue with neoplastic drug resistance. The Drug resistance page currently seems heavily skewed towards antibiotics, especially as regards the Mechanisms. One quick fix might involve importing material from the Neoplastic resistance section of the Multiple drug resistance page. I also feel that the Chemotherapy page should somehow have a bit more on resistance (in ?). Thoughts? —Misty (talk) 09:38, 6 August 2012 (UTC)
The article on chemotherapy introduces the topic by saying that it is treatment with a antineoplastic drug, but antineoplastic drug redirects to chemotherapy. It is not appropriate to have definitions redirect to each other. I might speculate that the reason why neoplastic drug resistance is not featured in other articles is that it is not possible to do so when the term is not defined in an article on Wikipedia. I am not sure where to begin on this.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 18:23, 6 August 2012 (UTC)
Sorry if I didn't make my concern clear. As regards Chemotherapy, I just felt there should be a bit more on resistance (if only a &quot;See also template&quot; or a wikilink something). On the other hand, I would have expected to find more more mention of chemotherapy (and perhaps also insulin therapy) on the main Drug resistance page, where the opening sentence of the lede doesn't seem to be reflected in the main article. Does that make more sense? —Misty(MORN) 19:30, 6 August 2012 (UTC)

 That Cochrane review compares clozapine with typical antipsychotics. I'm not sure how relevant that is; it depends on what you are trying to show I suppose. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21302867 This article] compares clozapine with other atypicals. This looks like a more balanced paper. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21348048 This] is another useful paper.

 According to the current text in , we're not supposed to consider any possible bias in [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ben/cds/2011/00000006/00000003/art00007 Raja's paper]. Axl ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 16:44, 9 August 2012 (UTC)

I'm mostly looking for a current summary of adverse affects and contraindications, not use or choice versus other neuroleptics; judging by the above discussion it looks like Raja is probably fine for the former point, but not for the latter.

Welcome back. It rather depends what you mean by &quot;Natural Medicine&quot;. Evidence-based medicine is of course based on an applied knowledge of natural processes, but all too frequently people get the idea that all forms of complimentary and alternative medicine are &quot;natural&quot; and somehow &quot;better&quot; or &quot;safer&quot;. Those ideas find little support in evidence when examined closely.  operates a bit differently than , but there is some overlap. Naturopathy for instance has a foot in both camps: it comes under WikiProject Alternative medicine, but also under . We have to look closely at the quality of sources for medicine- and for CAM-related articles. LeadSongDog come howl! 21:04, 6 August 2012 (UTC)

I quite agree with LeadSongDog. A large proportion of the most succesful medicines have their origins in biological substances. Statins as fungal metabolites, ACE inhibitors from the venom of Bothrops jararaca, vinca alkaloids from the Madagaskar periwinkle, many antibiotics from fungi etc. The thing is, once such a substance has a good evidence base it becomes mainstream medicine. In that sense, &quot;natural medicine&quot; is a bit of a tautology. JFW | T@lk 17:23, 7 August 2012 (UTC)

Ok, I mean herbal medicine, if that clarifies anything. If not, then I mean using plants, basically the way you pick them, maybe soaked or whatever, for treatment of disease. So yeah, applied science, but it doesn't have to have any papers published about it. Basically used as-is, not extracting it like the drug industry. Arlen22 (talk) 01:46, 10 August 2012 (UTC)

There are whole journals devoted to herbal medicine.  You might also be interested in traditional medicine.  Also, a good deal of self-care might be relevant, such as ginger or peppermint teas. WhatamIdoing (talk) 04:22, 10 August 2012 (UTC)

&quot;Alternative medicine is any practice claiming to heal &quot;that does not fall within the realm of conventional medicine.&quot; It may be based on historical or cultural traditions, rather than on scientific evidence.&quot; Based on that definition, which I don't feel includes either psychology or ?physiology?, I would prefer to stay with a more scientific type of project. This isn't a proposal or request by any means, I'm just trying to get a feel of things. Would herbal medicine be under the scope of this WikiProject or not? Arlen22 (talk) 12:38, 10 August 2012 (UTC)
The evidence-based parts of natural or herbal medicine would fall under WP:MED, though generally I would call it simply &quot;medicine&quot; (others would call it an [http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/herbal-medicine-and-aristolochic-acid-nephropathy/ uncertain dose of an ingredient with unknown efficacy], often accompanied by [http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/economically-motivated-herb-adulteration/ pharmaceutical adulterations]).  Also, your definition of &quot;alternative medicine&quot; is off - alternative medicine is basically any approach promoted as medicine that lacks acutal proof of safety and effectiveness.  By definition it is &quot;unproven claims&quot;.  Proven claims, to repeat myself, are simply medicine as they are incorporated into the treatment recommendations of doctors.  
To answer your original question - I would say &quot;natural medicine&quot; doesn't fall under WP:MED since it is more marketing than science. The proven parts of &quot;natural medicine&quot; are simply medicine.  The unproven parts are alternative &quot;medicine&quot; (and really more like bare assertions).  However, the debunking of alt med claims would probably fall within WP:MED - in particular because making medical claims requires  and alt med (again) by definition lacks such sources.  WLU (t)  Wikipedia's rules:/ 14:22, 10 August 2012 (UTC)

[I'm the same person who started this section; different IP.] The DSM got rid of homosexuality because the experts (the majority anyway) concluded that homosexuality is not a mental disorder or paraphilia. But sexual orientation and sexuality topics deal with mental health regardless, which makes them a medical issue. I obviously agree with WhatamIdoing. How is the gynandromorphophilia topic not a medical issue when some people consider this attraction to be a mental disorder, when it is assocated with gender identity disorder, and when sources on it are expected to pass ? I don't understand why this project is generally restrictive in what it considers to be a medical topic, cutting off topics that are most assuredly considerded &quot;medical&quot; by many experts. The fact that it is a &quot;medical issue&quot; is why the deletion discussion is partially speaking of it in medical terms.  (talk) 02:42, 8 August 2012 (UTC)

On the general question, a WikiProject is a group of editors, and we get to pick what we want to work on, just like any other group of volunteers.  If we were to decide that we wanted to work on Hello Kitty, then we could declare that it was within our scope.  If we decide that we don't want to work on Cancer, then we could declare that it's not within our scope.  We generally prefer to have a sensible scope, but we're permitted to make whimsical decisions, and defining some types of sex-related articles (and most anatomy-related articles) as being outside of our scope is one of our occasional variations from a strictly predictable scope. 
None of which says that we wouldn't accept this, or that you don't need help.  I hope that some people with more knowledge than I have will look into the question about whether it should be merged into a larger/related topic or not. WhatamIdoing (talk) 21:08, 8 August 2012 (UTC)
WhatamIdoing is correct  that academic sexology traditionally comes out of psychiatry; however, the greatest relevance in medicine is actually for primary care and behavioural medicine: That is, knowing patients' sexual orientations and behaviours helps in the assessment potential health needs and risk factors.  Gynandromorphophilia, as these RS's keep saying, is one the ways in which patient's say that they are heterosexual, but whose behaviour indicates that there are other relevant factors at play.  Such cases are an important part of diversity issues in the practice of medicine.  It is one of the issues for which I am called upon to lecture to residents. — James Cantor (talk) 22:02, 8 August 2012 (UTC)

Biosthmors, it seems that you are defining &quot;medical&quot; in the same restrictive sense that this project generally does. But besides what others in this section have stated about what &quot;medical&quot; extends to, see the Psychiatry article and the Sexology article linked above.

WhatamIdoing, I get your point. Although I don't believe that including Hello Kitty within the project's scope and declaring that cancer is outside of its scope would go over well. I just feel that a project devoted to medical topics should be open to covering all medical topics, instead of a &quot;We only cover certain ones, with the possibility of addressing others&quot; type of thing. And since this project is limited in that way, at least make that very clear on the project page so that the &quot;wrong type&quot; of issues aren't brought here. I know that WP:MEDRS is a guideline and not a WikiProject, but it would be silly if it was limited to only certain medical topics. And  shows other topics that fall under the medical scope. I'm not saying that you should work on medical topics that you don't want to work on. I'm saying that the project shouldn't act as though the term &quot;medical&quot; is only or generally limited to physical disorders and diseases. And looking at , I see that it is not very active and that merging it with WP:MED is suggested because WP:MED is active and anatomy is a medical topic (such as Human heart). Not including these other medical topics within WikiProject Medicine's scope can cause editors who join this project and are interested in working on all types of medical issues to generally ignore anything that doesn't have to do with a physical disorder or disease because they see that the project marks it as &quot;not our problem.&quot; I believe that that's why other medical issues continue to be overlooked or turned away by this project.  (talk) 00:36, 9 August 2012 (UTC)
One of the reasons why I have removed many of the sex and anatomy related article from this project is a while ago a journal published a list of our 20 most viewed medical articles and at that point in time they included: sex, anal sex, vagina, clitoris, and penis among others. The author used this as a way to discredit our work. We want to attract academics and concentrating on diseases will help in having people take us seriously. I am involved in a number of WikiProjects as are most of the people who edit here. Nothing says one just has to edit articles within Wikiproject Medicine. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 00:51, 9 August 2012 (UTC)

I saw that not long after I [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine&amp;diff=506479364&amp;oldid=506478643 changed my text about the Human heart article], you [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Human_heart&amp;diff=506479520&amp;oldid=492538318 removed Human heart] from this project. I can understand removing most of the sex articles. But to remove articles like Human heart? I very much doubt that most academics would argue that the topic of the heart isn't a medical issue; it's largely a medical issue. I also doubt that most academics would argue that mental disorders aren't a medical issue, especially since they are sometimes labeled diseases as well. Anorexia nervosa is both a mental and physical disorder, but the only reason you've probably left it as part of the project is because it is a physical disorder. All I'm saying is that physical disorders and diseases (&quot;disease&quot; as separate from mental disorders unless we're talking about a physical disease that affects the brain...such as Autism) are not the only things that are covered by the word &quot;medical.&quot; Just because a journal is narrow in its definition of what medical means, it doesn't mean we have to be as well. And although topics like the penis and vagina are more medical to me than they are sexual, meaning there are more medical issues or a combination of sexual and medical issues regarding them than just sexual issues alone, I don't much mind those topics being excluded. You know, since you've explained about medical journals maybe not taking Wikipedia seriously, even though this site is generally discredited anyway. But topics like the human heart and mental disorders should be branded by this project. You say &quot;Nothing says one just has to edit articles within Wikiproject Medicine.&quot; But my point is that this project generally turns away any issue that isn't completely or mostly medical or isn't medical in the restrictive sense of relating to a physical disease, just like you did when I brought the topic of this section here...despite its ties to the medical community. But it is what it is. I know that my comments on all of this aren't going to change how this project generally works.  (talk) 23:20, 13 August 2012 (UTC)
Anatomy is removed because there's already a perfectly good little group, WikiProject Anatomy, that supports those articles.  There is no need for us to work on everything that has some connection to medicine, and we don't tag anything that we aren't willing to work on (per official guideline, BTW).  
If you want to see our current guidance on what to tag and what not to tag, then have a look at .  WhatamIdoing (talk) 23:38, 13 August 2012 (UTC)
&quot;A perfectly good little group.&quot; From what I've seen, &quot;little&quot; is the keyword, which is why there have been suggestions to merge that project with this one. They need a lot more help from this project, even if it's just commenting on a matter, as they've stated before. But you're right that you get to choose what you want to work on. Different reasons have been given here for why you guys don't help out more with other type of medical aspects, but at least you took the time to give me reasons. So thanks for that.

Wikipedia's ranking compared to other sources



How fair is it to say that Wikipedia is one of the single most consulted sources of health information in the world? Surely if we are talking about single media sources, Wikipedia must be one of the most consulted sources, right? Is Wikipedia the single most consulted source of health information in the world?

Is anyone aware of any scholarly source which tries to quantify just how much Wikipedia is used in comparison to any other single point from which health information can originate? What sources exist which approach this sort of assessment? I am aware of this list of sources compiled by Doc James but not aware of someone making an outright comparison of Wikipedia versus the world. Is there one?  Blue Rasberry (talk) 18:20, 9 August 2012 (UTC)
That is a good question. It is one of the most used medical sources but is it the most, that I do not know. We have survey data from physicians and medical students that show usage of 50-70% / 100%. We have page views for some sites. We discuss some of this in this paper http://www.jmir.org/2011/1/e14/ 

Now our medical pages get 200 million page views a month. Wikipedia as a whole gets ~18,000 million page views. That means the medical content is 1.1% of all Wikipedia usage. Wikipedia is user by about 14% of the global internet users daily * 1.1% = 0.15% of the global population.

Per Alexa the NIH is used by 0.3%, medscape is used by 0.04%, NHS 0.04% uptodate by 0.007%. And per table 1 in the above paper none of the other wikis come close. Of course these numbers are very rough estimates and have made a great number of assumption. Can we make them better? Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 19:00, 9 August 2012 (UTC)
Wait we should only be using page views for English :-) The number should be 11,630 million. This than gives us 0.26% of global Internet users visit Wikipedia's medical pages daily. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 19:14, 9 August 2012 (UTC)
So to conclude Wikipedia's medical content is consulted more than the NHS, WHO, UpToDate, and WebMD (Medscape/Emedicine) and slightly less than the NIH. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 19:23, 9 August 2012 (UTC)

#Pageviews for medical English content June 2012 193M[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Medicine/Popular_pages]
*Therefore proportion of pageviews for medical content is 2.55% multiply this by the three month daily reach per Alexa for Wikipedia as a whole (13.6%)[http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/wikipedia.org] and one gets a medical daily reach of 0.35% Thus one could say that Wikipedia is the most used health care resource on the Internet!Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 22:14, 11 August 2012 (UTC)

Barefoot running

Aloha.  I'm currently reviewing Barefoot running, a .  If someone could take a look at Barefoot_running#Health_and_medical_implications and scan the article for any unusual claims when they have free time, I would appreciate it.  No hurry on this. Viriditas (talk) 10:18, 7 August 2012 (UTC)

I've taken a quick glance through the section and have made a couple of minor copyedits. The style seems generally good, imo. A few points might gain from better contextualization. For example, the reader is currently just told that &quot;oxygen consumption was found to be approximately 4% higher in shod versus barefoot runners&quot;, while the cited secondary source [http://sportsci.org/jour/0103/mw.htm] helpfully adds &quot;An increase in oxygen consumption of ~4% is of little importance to the recreational runner, but the competitive athlete would notice a major effect on running speed&quot;. (Also, try wikilinking oxygen consumption rather than just oxygen.)As regards sourcing, I notice the focus often seems to be mainly on primary studies, as commented in sources not always listed on PubMed. Here are a few suggestions for some reliable secondary sources, per , which aren't currently cited:
* One focused review that I think certainly deserves consideration is [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21622635 Barefoot running claims and controversies: a review of the literature, Jenkins and Cauthon (2011)]. 
* Another recent review article, by [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19741354 Vormittag et al (2009)], although not specifically about barefoot running, may also be worth a look. 
* Overall, I feel sure it's right to exercise caution in the tone, both here and also in the footwear section, given the relative poverty overall of the best available evidence regarding the effectiveness of preventive interventions, as evaluated in this  [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21735382 2011 Cochrane review]. 
* A recent RS by Lieberman which may be of more theoretical interest is a hypothesis-type review paper, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22257937 What we can learn about running from barefoot running: an evolutionary medical perspective, Lieberman (2012)].
A final thought: I wonder whether the heading Health and medical implications is unnecessarily strong given the relative lack of reliable evidence. How about Health and medical considerations?
@Viriditas: please feel free to copy &amp; paste this elsewhere, as appropriate. —Misty(MORN) 14:20, 7 August 2012 (UTC)
It is my opinion that it is a bit biased towards barefoot running. Possible detriments of running with shoes spans two paragraphs while detriments of running barefoot gets a sentence. My two cents. ITasteLikePaint (talk) 02:34, 8 August 2012 (UTC)
Issues of  may be addressed by appropriate use of reliable secondary sources, per . The last paragraph in particular, beginning The running shoe..., seems to focus too directly on the outcomes of certain primary studies. As suggested above, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21622635 Jenkins and Cauthon (2011) &quot;Barefoot running claims and controversies: a review of the literature&quot;] definitely deserves consideration. The [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21735382 2011 Cochrane review] on preventive interventions should also help contextualize, at least, the relative strength of the evidence in the sector. I also feel that Lieberman's research could be presented in a more encyclopedic way: his recent [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22257937 hypothesis article] could help here.A related concern may be use of so-called . I've tagged a &quot;many&quot; in the opening paragraph, and &quot;much scientific and medical interest&quot; and &quot;often been blamed&quot; are other suspects. On a more down to earth level perhaps, I suppose it's common sense that going out to do some pavement jogging barefoot isn't going to be a terribly good idea in many parts of the world, though the images seem to show people doing just that.Hope that helps, —Misty(MORN) 09:16, 8 August 2012 (UTC)
Purely personal input: I've been (mostly) a barefooter for over a decade.  I generally only wear shoes in circumstances where my feet would be prone to crush injuries (dealing with horses and cattle, etc.!), in social situations where it would be considered grossly inappropriate to be barefoot (but I try to avoid those, anyway), and on surfaces likely to have broken glass, sharp metal, etc.  On the whole, barefooters tend to develop a very acute awareness of what they're about to step on / in!

Picture for platelet

The caption for the main picture of platelet was changed recently [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Platelet&amp;curid=196121&amp;diff=507533800&amp;oldid=504355064] and I don't know what's what. Biosthmors (talk) 14:16, 15 August 2012 (UTC)

The new caption seems better. Those purple blobs don't look like neutrophils at all. For one thing there is no discernable nucleus and cytoplasm. JFW | T@lk 19:01, 15 August 2012 (UTC)

 The &quot;giant platelets&quot; don't look like neutrophils; the dark blue inclusions aren't well-defined enough to be multilobed nuclei. Normal platelets do have some variability in size; younger platelets tend to be a bit larger. Those two cells do indeed look like platelets, although I haven't heard the phrase &quot;giant platelets&quot; before.

. The edited caption is the correct one. I don't know how neutrophils ended up in the caption, hopefully it wasn't me :) There are no white blood cells in the photo. Only platelets. Indeed the top-left blob is a normal platelet and the two larger corpuscles (platelets are sloughed off sections of much larger cells in the bone marrow) are correctly identified as giant platelets. These may just be &quot;squished&quot; platelets, since it's not infrequent to see giant platelets in normal blood smears. Rarely, in some syndromes, giant platelets become important features for diagnosis. Good eye, whomever picked up the error. Bobjgalindo (talk) 05:34, 17 August 2012 (UTC)

 I believe the &quot;latin&quot; word for platelet in the article's template is also incorrect. I think Thrombocytus is the correct singular and Thrombocyti the plural. Someone with better latin ought to take a look at that ... Thank you once again. Bobjgalindo (talk) 05:48, 17 August 2012 (UTC)

I think you have to be careful what parts of WP to invite a scholar to. And the scholar would also have to be willing at learn and adapt to WP's unusual requirements. Steer clear of the battleground articles and admin/RFC drama boards. There are many important subjects in my watchlist that would love the attention of an expert, who would be uninterrupted by trolls and childish editors.

Colin°Talk 18:22, 16 August 2012 (UTC)

Editor retention is an absolutely vital issue. Collaborative editing means we are often forced to &quot;collaborate&quot; with people who have vastly different perceptions of evidence, guidelines, and often even plain fact. It can be immensely disempowering to have to go through endless discussions without anyone coming to the rescue. A minor squabble over something as trivial as an infobox can be utterly destructive to one's resolve to carry on editing.
One fervent wish of mine is to make it easier for new editors to get stuff right. I'd be rightly annoyed if I made what I thought was a useful addition to an article, only for it to be copyedited beyond recognition or removed immediately for policy reasons. I have no immediate solution, only that currently the referencing is a complete pain in the behind. JFW | T@lk 21:20, 16 August 2012 (UTC)
I want to take the opportunity to put in a good word for . Over the last couple of years he has done a huge amount of work on psychology and sociology subjects. He has concentrated on beefing up stubs, challenging subjects and badly written articles. I have cooperated with him in some cases. I am not aware of him ever being subject to any significant harassment. I dont know what his academic background is but everything he does is well sourced. People like him are like gold dust - he has beefed up maybe a hundred or so badly neglected psychology articles, some of which have been neglected for years. If anybody deserves an award or grant for Wikipedia work he does. For my own work, i generally dont get harassed but was subject to some major trolling years ago. Rarely another editor muscles in and objects to an edit of mine when clearly he doesnt understand the subject, I often just give way in those instances, I cant be bothered to fight major battles.--Penbat (talk) 10:49, 18 August 2012 (UTC)
Anthonyhcole -- that's too bad.  In any case, I tend to think that hardcore scholars are not necessary what Wikipedia needs.  The objectives are different.  Scholars often are in it for themselves-- they want to get their name out there.  They want something to add to their CV  -- remember publish or perish?  The draw in WP, IMHO, is that you have an audience-- half of doctors admit to reading WP... and many, many patients do.  Above said, criticism in the scholarly world abounds... and unfounded, misguided, criticism exists there too. Looking at the larger picture, I think the profession (and to some extent scholars) have to take on the anti-intellectual buffoonery out there, as a failure to do so results is a public discourse driven by people that deny science-based medicine, and rational thought. Nephron  T| 02:06, 19 August 2012 (UTC)
Academia / journals also need to address the issues of ghost authorship and the hiding of raw data with claims that it is proprietary. Any piece of research that does not agree to open analysis of the raw data no matter what the result should not get ethics approval IMO. If these are not addressed soon many will be justified in taking an anti-intellectual position as science based medicine will further decent into little more than public relations by pharmaceutical companies. Agree academics have a lot to address and we should speak out in support as garbage in garbage out. Cochrane has struggled with the issue of hidden data when trying to determine if the medications we use for influenza actually do anything other than make us poor.

IMHO, as a scholar it's easiest to adapt to WP editing if one thinks of it in light of the anonymous peer-review process used at the best scholarly journals: because you're anonymous, you cannot convincingly Argue from authority; rather, the most convincing reviews (and WP edits) are based on what you write and how well you source it, rather than who you are.  This is what puzzles me about the pressure to use real names - it goes against that ethos, and I argue that it will be the undoing of WP. Certainly, I would never encourage a scholar to edit initially under their real name.  Once they have a year or two under their belt, they can make an informed decision.  For me, it's nice to edit when time allows, and as a peer of other editors.  -- Scray (talk) 21:00, 19 August 2012 (UTC)
I agree, optional anonymity is important. Nephron, once we have a friendly interface, better protection from ignorant and malicious revisions, and a more professional, respectful ethos, if Wikipedia still dominated Google results, we will become the natural home for scholarly debate. Colin, it goes without saying that scholars have to conform to our policies and guidelines. From this project's perspective,  needs to be recognised as a policy as important as . Thank you so much, and thank you Eubulides, WhatamIdoing, SandyGeorgia and others for that unique tool. James, Blue Rasberry sees WM:MED as an opportunity for activism. I think he's right. We may be perfectly placed to exercise maximum influence in the public debate on the topics you mention, and others. But I believe we need to get our house in order before we can do that. --Anthonyhcole (talk) 21:06, 19 August 2012 (UTC)
I've long since concluded that it's best not to advertise any sort of real-world scholarly expertise on Wikipedia (see #4 on this list, and associated footnote). In some ways, it's as Scray says - the fact that most people are pseudonymous here removes the &quot;argument from authority&quot;, since we all start on equal footing. On the other hand, it's far too easy for sane and knowledgeable people to be shouted down by those who don't know what they're talking about or who have an axe to grind. That's where Wikipedia differs from scholarly discourse (even anonymized scholarly discourse, like peer review), and I think that's why experts often get so frustrated here, as outlined in .

Despite the news coverage, I think the balance is about right. He failed to overturn the law, and died of natural causes. JFW | T@lk 17:47, 23 August 2012 (UTC)

If someone—not necessarily from this project—wanted to start a biography article dedicated to this courageous man, I guess he would certainly satisfy general notability criteria. Personally, I don't see any reason to prevent interested readers finding out more about the life of a man who became notable by fighting a legal battle that has brought a major medicolegal issue to the public attention in Britain [http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/leading-articles/leading-article-mps-must-ensure-no-one-else-is-denied-the-right-to-die-8073571.html] [http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/22/tony-nicklinson-tragic-story-editorial] [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-wiltshire-19353245]. —MistyMorn (talk) 18:07, 23 August 2012 (UTC)

Request for assistance

I improved the page Irritable bowel syndrome, my changes: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Irritable_bowel_syndrome&amp;oldid=508642811] , unfortunately, this page seems to be haunted by several unfriendly and opinionated people. They used excessive weight as an excuse to roll back these edits.
I know how to write without excessive weight, as I have had 4 papers published. These unfriendly people are just being closed minded, and I believe any reasonable person will see this in my edit, that there is no excessive weight whatsoever. 

Any interested parties maybe could read this Rome foundation review on the topic of the intestinal microbiota in functional bowel disorders:

Images and copyright query

My littlest grandchild (20 months) is currently awaiting biopsy results for a lung tumour.  CT scan suggests PPB or rhabdomyosarcoma as likely candidates.  The hospital have given my daughter the CT images on disc ...  it seems that for normal use in medical journals, it is the permission of the patient / parent which is generally sought for the use of images.  What's the situation here in Wikipedia?  The CT images, particularly, could be interesting if compiled as an animated gif which would give a good 3D-type visualisation for readers / viewers.  What do we think about what the copyright issues would be?  Pesky (talk) 07:01, 18 August 2012 (UTC)

 Firstly, damn that's unlucky. My best wishes to you and your family.

 To address your question, technically, I suspect that the radiology department that performed the scan owns the copyright to the images. Even though your daughter was given the CD, she doesn't own the copyright. On the other hand, I have never heard of a radiology department contesting a copyright issue. They are far more concerned with patient confidentiality (and, in the UK, the Data Protection Act). 

 Wikimedia Commons has many CT images, ostensibly with the uploader as the &quot;author&quot;. I find this hard to believe.

 Regarding journal images, you are right that most journals require permission from the patient/legal guardian to include the pictures. In most cases, the journal itself maintains copyright of the image. The same is true of CT images in journals.

 In summary, the copyright status of CT images is somewhat vague because medical institutions are not interested in pursuing transgressors. If your daughter gives permission to release the pictures to public domain and be uploaded to Wikimedia Commons, we are on safe ground. I recommend that you ensure that the images are anonymized before doing so.

 Regarding suitability of the images to Wikipedia, the images show evidence of disease. I don't think that a 3-D gif of this would be helpful to most readers. It would better to select just the image that best shows the anomaly. Once your family has a definitive diagnosis, you could add the picture to the appropriate article. Axl ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 09:02, 18 August 2012 (UTC)
Per here radiological imaging studies are not copyright-able. [https://open.umich.edu/wiki/Casebook#Radiograph_.28X-Ray.29] If you daughter is not identifiable in the image even permission of the subject in question is not technically required. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 12:44, 18 August 2012 (UTC)
 That website states &quot;Like other representational images, X-rays are designed to convey the underlying image with as much accuracy as possible. Since all choices are made with the intention of faithful representation, the choices aren't creative, and do not merit much protection.&quot; Yet the majority of regular photographs are also &quot;designed to convey the underlying image with as much accuracy as possible.&quot;

 The website also states &quot;However, it is important to note that radiographs can be used artistically, and when used in such a matter, merit copyright protection.&quot; Is the use of an x-ray by a medical journal &quot;artistic&quot;? Can a journal legally claim copyright on an x-ray that has been completely unchanged? I don't believe that these issues have ever been contested legally. Axl ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 16:41, 18 August 2012 (UTC)

I'm sorry to hear that you have such an anxious situation in your family.  
If you decide to upload the images, please be very careful to make sure that they are anonymized.  Some of the file formats used, like DICOM, were designed to include the patient's name and other information as meta data, even when it's not visible in the picture itself.  I assume that converting to some plain file format would eliminate that information, but you'll want to make sure. WhatamIdoing (talk) 17:08, 18 August 2012 (UTC)
Thanks for the very helpful info (and also for the good wishes).  Little chap has a lot going for him; he's strong in himself, and still running around, laughing, chatting, despite having barely more than one functional lung (the other is mostly obliterated by solid mass and fluid).  How he manages it, we just don't know.My daughter is happy for the pics to be used (but will also check with littl'un's dad).  Of course I will anonymise images, I'm thinking of cropping to the bare images, running them together in a series to produce an animated gif mainly because the shape and extent of the umour is so different from one part of the lung to the next, and it's interesting to see how it fits in, as it were.  Hard to pick any one image as being any better than any other, really.  I will be able to upload stills as well (all  being well)... all of which process will also remove any other file info on them.  I suppose, in the end, with me doing the &quot;artistic&quot; work on animating them, I would hold the copy right on the ani-gif; happy to release under CC-BY-SA, of course.  There are so few decent images available of these conditions at all, let alone free use.  As soon as I have definite permissions, and we know exactly what he has, either of those articles could certainly do with some more in the way of illustration.  Pesky (talk) 17:27, 18 August 2012 (UTC)
I use the print screen button and than paste and crop the images using &quot;paint&quot;. This also allows me to easily add arrows. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 19:33, 19 August 2012 (UTC)

There's an essay at [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Patient_images Commons:Patient images]. You might try asking the radiology department for permission / copyright release even if some website thinks it unnecessary. I can't think why they would refuse, considering there is nothing of financial gain possible for them to use the images without the parents' consent. You might even find the radiologist is willing to annotate the image (I'm just guessing here, as a lay person) which would be much better for WP than someone's grandad doing his best with MS Paint :-) Personally, I hate animated gifs because can't be paused and distract when reading the article. Plus they don't print reliably. Colin°Talk 21:44, 19 August 2012 (UTC)
We have lots of people who upload their own X rays. I do not think asking a radiologist for their consent will be very fruitful. They are not the ones who have taken the xrays just the ones who interpret them. And are usually very busy. Asking would probably freak them out as they would than be fearful about liability / not understand what you are suggesting and thus say no. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 21:51, 19 August 2012 (UTC)

It might be possible to send a letter to the radiology center saying that you want to put some images on the internet and wanted them to confirm that they have no objections from the standpoint of copyright.  I believe that as a &quot;work done for hire&quot;, the employer rather than the rad tech would hold any possible copyright.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 22:34, 19 August 2012 (UTC)
Yes so I guess the question is what is the business structure of the place that this was done (often the rads are employees or contractors themselves). And if the patient was paying would this would not make them the one doing the hiring? Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 22:39, 19 August 2012 (UTC)
In my experience, patients can request images and they are provided with no restrictive language.  If that is the case here, why would the patient be restricted in any way? -- Scray (talk) 23:07, 19 August 2012 (UTC)
Because even if your professional photographer doesn't hand you a copyright notice, he owns the copyright anyway, even though you hired him to do the work.  It's possible that the law treats a radiology tech like it treats a portrait photographer. WhatamIdoing (talk) 00:34, 20 August 2012 (UTC)
Excellent point.  We do need this clarified.  -- Scray (talk) 00:49, 20 August 2012 (UTC)
It's an NHS hospital who took the images. I thought to begin with that we'd just been given a few picked images on disc, but we actually have the whole series.  We have the DICOM software with them, so can basically do any part from any cross-section, and can screen dump showing images in three planes all in the window with or without annotations (which I could do myself within the program, but thanks for the offer - I may take you up on it, or not, depending!) This also means that I could screen dump a series of images showing the three planes, progressing down along the sagittal plane to demonstrate the general shape and mass of the tumour at different sections (this is the one which would be easy / interesting to do as an ani-gif).   I could contact the NHS Trust, if necessary, for permission to use the images; if it's just the machine doing the actual work, the program storing the images, and me choosing what / how to annotate and which to use  ...  heh!  It's an interesting one!  Pesky (talk) 02:15, 20 August 2012 (UTC)@Colin: I take your point about anigifs within the article, so probably stills there, and that notice which says Commons has media relating to [whichever it turns out to be] on the page, with the anigif just in Commons (provided that's going to be OK).  Although not medically qualified, I'm relatively savvy with regard to interpreting various kinds of images, so could annotate as appropriate. (P.S. I'm a granny, not a granddad!)  Pesky (talk) 03:27, 20 August 2012 (UTC)
I don't trust the website that says there is no copyright on these images. If that were true, there would be folk on Commons writing software to scrape scans, x-rays and the like from all online medical journals and uploading them. Also remember that what applies with US law does not apply to a UK editor in the UK. It might be fine for Commons to host them, but not for you to upload, for example. My point about the copyright permission and professional annotation addresses the re-use potential of the images. Commons does not officially take the [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Project_scope/Precautionary_principle &quot;we can get away with it, nobody will bother&quot;] approach so at some point somone on Commons make take a hardline view and delete all your careful work. But even if it remains on Commons/WP, the images would be more likely to get re-used if there was a clear statement that permission had been sought and received. Regarding animation: you could investigate creating a movie file as WP can play them with play/pause control. I'm not an expert on the options but might be worth looking into.  Colin°Talk 09:57, 20 August 2012 (UTC)
Searching the web I am unable to find a definitive answer to who owns the copyright on an X ray or even if these images are copyrightable. &quot;The types of work eligible for protection are literary, dramatic, artistic or musical works, the typographical arrangement of a published edition, a sound recording, a film or a broadcast.&quot; per here Copyright_law_of_the_United_Kingdom#Works_eligible_for_protection. X rays do not seem to fall under any of these. I have brought this up at commons and no one knew or was willing to start adding from books. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 10:57, 20 August 2012 (UTC)
Discussion is taking place here as well [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons_talk:Licensing#X_rays]. It appears that we have already had some images deleted against consensus at commons such as this one [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Deletion_requests/Image:Chest_CT_scan_with_lung_metastatis_3.jpg]. I guess the question is will someone come along and delete all images related to imaging as no one knows who owns the copyright if anyone. My position is that this would be a huge lose for our project. We seriously need some REAL legal advise. I have emailed the foundation to see if they will weight in. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 13:51, 20 August 2012 (UTC)
While just the mention of the word copyright sends me to the bathroom, everything James says here and on Commons about using images in journals fits with my own experience. As regards useful publishing analogies to the Wikipedia situation, online open-access journals like PLoS One [http://www.plosone.org/static/figureGuidelines.action#ccal] and  BMJ Open [http://www.bmj.com/about-bmj/resources-authors/forms-policies-and-checklists/copyright-open-access-and-permission-reuse] use Creative Commons licensing and leave copyright with authors. The BMJ group says [http://www.bmj.com/about-bmj/resources-authors/forms-policies-and-checklists/use-images], If an image has no copyright, please tell us the precise details of where you obtained it and who gave you permission to use it in the BMJ. Please note that many medical illustration departments expect to be acknowledged. If images come from your colleagues you will need to seek their written permission and check whether the photographs have been published previously in other books and journals. Presumably, editorial staff then assess the legal situation on a case-by-case basis. (In practice, apart from standard patient permission forms, the queries from journals we had to address tended to regard image quality/software, and complete anonymization.)  —MistyMorn (talk) 15:48, 20 August 2012 (UTC)
From an excellent paper on the topic


 

Wherever practicable, it is good practice, though not essential, to obtain the patient's consent before either taking or using an image of them.

? 

Before using an image for educational purposes, all accompanying personal data should be removed. Ideally, it should be deleted completely, so that the identity of the patient can never be re-established. Where there is a compelling reason for maintaining some method of identifying the patient, it should be done by way of a non-obvious code, key to which is stored securely in a different location from the image. Access to that key should be restricted as far as possible.

? 

If it is impossible or impracticable to obtain consent before taking an anonymous image of a patient, in circumstances where taking the image is not a necessary or incidental part of the procedure being performed, the image can only be taken if it will not harm the patient or otherwise breach the duty to exercise reasonable care and skill.

? 

If the patient's consent to use the image has not been obtained (and therefore you are relying upon its anonymity to make its disclosure lawful), you must ensure that the image is really anonymous. Can a person without prior knowledge of the image or its collection deduce the identity of the patient, through looking at the image and exploiting any other available information (such as postal-code charts, or a casually held key to a code)? If the image as you want to present it does not pass this test of anonymity, it cannot be disclosed without consent.

 Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 16:11, 20 August 2012 (UTC)

The most recent academic peer-review publication on the topic I've been able to trace on GoogleScholar/PubMed dates back to 1995 [http://www.ajronline.org/content/164/5/1083.full.pdf]. Back then, the authors remarked that &quot;few legal actions have been taken against    radiologists for copyright infringement arising from professional activities&quot;. Given the apparent dearth of more recent articles in medical journals (other than Information of Authors etc), my *guess* is that the situation may not have changed that radically since then. Otherwise, I really would have expected to find more editorial attention on the part of journals and other similar articles providing practical advice to authors.  —MistyMorn (talk) 17:43, 20 August 2012 (UTC)

I think they ought to rename those tags.  I find myself gravitating away from articles that have them. In the medical context, I'm not clueless -- but in the context of a lot of medical articles I'm not really an expert either.  The tag should say something like &quot;needs interested person to research and revise&quot; -- which might be abbreviated NIP2RAR. Nephron  T| 14:37, 26 August 2012 (UTC)
Short of emailing contacts personally and encouraging them? If any colorectal types read this: I would appreciate casting their eye over anismus, mucosal prolapse, solitary rectal ulcer syndrome, fecal leakage, rectal prolapse, and rectal discharge(unfinished). Alternatively go to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Proctology| Category:Proctology]. ty. tepi (talk) 21:40, 23 August 2012 (UTC)
I think it will be challenging to find someone like that.  The colorectal surgeons I've met, work extremely long hours... and don't tend to be that bookish -- which I think lends itself more to contributing to WP. Nephron  T| 14:45, 26 August 2012 (UTC)

Just want to reaffirm what a pleasure it's been to work on that page.  This is a great group of editors, and the page is coming along nicely!  I do think we might need to rethink the structure of this article, to improve flow.  For example, I wonder whether the conceptual portions (e.g. &quot;Why sourcing is so important&quot;) would more appropriately precede the practical (the details on how to cite); however, that would mean moving all of the citation instructions down into a separate section (i.e. I can see why it was done this way initially).  While the &quot;why&quot; could go even earlier - preceding the higher-level &quot;Steps for editing...&quot; - I think having the latter at the top of the page is appealing for newcomers.  Scray (talk) 16:04, 26 August 2012 (UTC)

We had consensus to merge this article a while ago. The user who created it has returned the article in question.

Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 09:48, 27 August 2012 (UTC)

A few low-level observations from an uninvolved editor:
*On PubMed, the wild-card term contragest* (which picks up contragestion, contragestive etc) retrieves just 6 results in the last five years, none of which has been indexed as a review.
*On GoogleScholar, the search term contragestion (which also recognizes &quot;contragestive&quot;) retrieves 123 results since 2007.
*This paper may be pertinent: [http://www.theannals.com/content/45/6/813.short Keenan (2011). Ulipristal Acetate: Contraceptive or Contragestive?]. From the abstract, it appears that it is the structural similarity between ulipristal acetate and mifepristone that provides the basis for discussion.
*An alternative redirect might be Emergency contraception. At present, usage on Wikipedia of &quot;contragestion&quot; [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=contragestion&amp;title=Special%3ASearch&amp;fulltext=1] or &quot;contragestive&quot; [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ASearch&amp;profile=default&amp;search=Contragestive&amp;fulltext=Search] does not extend to this page, which does however use the words &quot;contragestation&quot; and &quot;contragestative&quot; when discussing &quot;United States legal and ethical controversies&quot; at the end of the article. (I really don't want to get involved here!).
*A small query about the brief discussion in Mifepristone#Pharmacology: Contragestion is a term coined by Étienne-Émile Baulieu to promote the acceptance of mifepristone by blurring the differences between the mechanisms of action of contraceptives and those of mifepristone to induce abortion.[40] Is this statement fully supported by the primary source [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2781282]? —MistyMorn (talk) 12:20, 27 August 2012 (UTC)

Agree. The [http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa1111160 NEJM article] is clearly primary research, but will no doubt get considerable press attention that will include some expert analysis.

I'm actually of the opinion that we should have an article on this now. There are enough sources to write something decent, and we can make clear in the article that this is a newly described condition and thus there are a number of unanswered questions and speculative ideas about it. I really don't like the &quot;AIDS 2.0&quot; title, though - one of the things that needs to be emphasized is that this condition is quite different from AIDS. As the NEJM article makes clear, affected patients have normal CD4+ lymphocyte counts - the immunodeficiency is thought to stem from impaired interferon-gamma signaling, not from a lymphocyte-subset deficiency as in HIV/AIDS.

Ask them to investigate how the wrong credit has been given and whether this is through human error or someone deliberately passing off your work as theirs. It is possible that it is a genuine mistake (and Nisith Patel is agrieved this his photograph of an ingrowing toenail has been attributed to some bloke called Heilman). I think the most you can expect is an apology and a promise the next edition will be corrected. If the publishers got their photo from a respectable stock photo library, then that library should take the issue very seriously. BTW, on Googling i found [http://www.plagiarismtoday.com/ this blog] which might have useful information. Colin°Talk 07:46, 22 August 2012 (UTC)



I did not wave the &quot;share alike&quot; requirement. Thus this book is now under a CC BY SA license. :-) Will contact the publisher and let them know. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 13:06, 22 August 2012 (UTC)

It doesn't work like that. The book is not a derivative work of your image. It is a collective work that contains your image, among others. Your image doesn't infect the book with the CC-BY-SA licence. Commons actually only accepts images that allow commercial reuse, which includes being contained within a copyright work such as a book. Actually, the book needs to do more than just credit you. They need to explicilty restate that this image is licenced under CC-BY-SA 3.0. See [http://creativecommons.org.au/learn-more/fact-sheets/attribution How to attribute Creative Commons licensed materials].
Btw, I think it a good idea to help re-users out when knowing how to attribute your work. If you have a look at my Commons images, you'll see that I've got an explicit &quot;Attribution&quot; section in the description box. Some folk make this even more explicit. See Diliff's .

What the &quot;share alike&quot; affects, is a copy of image itself and derivative works. So someone is free to scan the photo from the book and republish that copy with the same terms. If your image was used in cover art, or they cropped or annotated the image, then those derivative works would themselves be subject to the same attribution/licence terms. Colin°Talk 15:08, 22 August 2012 (UTC)
Wonderful. Thank you Colin. That makes much more sense and I have misunderstood this for years. What about for text? If one chapter in a book is from Wikipedia does that mean the whole book is CC BY SA or just that chapter? Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 16:17, 22 August 2012 (UTC)
I believe that it would just be the parts of the book that used the (original or modified) text.  So here are some examples (and anyone should feel free to correct me if I've got this wrong):
* I copy Cancer exactly as-is, and call it &quot;Chapter 12&quot; in my book, Diseases You Don't Want:  the whole chapter, but nothing else, is CC-BY-SA.
* I copy Cancer and make some small changes to it, and call the resulting text &quot;Chapter 12&quot; in my book, Diseases You Don't Want:  the whole chapter, but nothing else, is CC-BY-SA.
* I copy one paragraph out of Cancer, and put it with ten pages of original text in &quot;Chapter 12&quot;:  just the one paragraph is CC-BY-SA.
* I copy Cancer and make extensive changes to it and substantially expand it.  80% of the text is mine, but the Wikipedia text is completely mixed up with my own original work, with no hope of ever separating them.  I call that text &quot;Chapter 12&quot; in my book:  the whole chapter, but nothing else, is CC-BY-SA.

The CC-BY-SA license isn't really viral like that. Using a CC-BY-SA work without following the license just means they're violating copyright; it doesn't mean derivatives are automatically licensed CC-BY-SA. If someone doesn't follow the terms of the license (by releasing their derivatives under the same license), then the license is simply revoked for that person.--Sage Ross (WMF) (talk) 16:41, 27 August 2012 (UTC)

If the publishers illegally using our images could be prodded to link here... it would help get traffic to the site.

Does any one know the lawyers in the Wikipedia -- could someone draft a letter for use of prodding people to comply?
I know that WP does not do enforcement... and I know that I have the copyright-- but I think it would be nice if they had a letter that (1) explains the objectives of WP, (2) says compliance is really quite easy, and (3) it is the law to comply -- we ask them to comply.

It would be nice if a lawyer or a law student (on my behalf) had fun with this-- writing Elsevier a letter. Nephron  T| 12:47, 26 August 2012 (UTC)

 Nephron, I understand your distress at seeing this. However I would urge you to try to assume good faith. It may be that the people who designed these pages didn't fully understand the significance of the CC-BY-SA licence, perhaps believing that all images on Wikimedia Commons are public domain. While it is surprising that a law firm's page would make this mistake, it may be that the page designer is a novice, without a good understanding of modern copyright law.

 Similarly, with the Elsevier publication, the designer was probably a novice. Given that the publication is &quot;Lancet Student&quot; and the page credits &quot;Creative Commons&quot;, this seems highly likely. It is probably a misunderstanding. It doesn't help that the Wikimedia Commons says that the author is &quot;Nephron&quot;, which seems to be a vague pseudonym.

 Technically, this issue is not relevant to Wikipedia, but rather to Wikimedia Commons. A &quot;cease and desist&quot; letter is over the top. A brief letter informing them to credit you should be enough. Axl ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 17:55, 27 August 2012 (UTC)

A &quot;cease and desist&quot; letter is just any old letter asking someone to quit screwing up.  Our standard spam warnings probably qualify.  In this instance, the behavior that we want stopped is the improperly uncredited use of Nephron's copyrighted material.  Any letter asking them to either stop using the copyrighted material or to start properly crediting him would be considered a &quot;cease and desist&quot; letter.  Unlike a cease and desist order (from a court of law), these letters have no particular legal standing and can be written by anyone. WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:09, 27 August 2012 (UTC)
 We have a difference of opinion regarding the definition of a &quot;cease and desist&quot; letter. In my understanding, it includes the threat of legal action if the recipient does not comply. 

 In Nephron's case, no-one is making extra money or losing out on money because of the lack of accreditation. I see no reason for the infringers to refuse. A &quot;cease and desist&quot; letter as a first response is unnecessarily confrontational. If they do refuse, the next step would be a &quot;cease and desist&quot; letter. If that doesn't work, Nephron will need to hire a lawyer. Axl ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 18:16, 27 August 2012 (UTC)
I think they do make money on misrepresenting the truth here.  If Elsevier keeps people ignorant of the fact that they can see and reuse the many CC images in many different ways at no cost... Elsevier can continue charging $$$$ for their books, journals and images.  That is why Elsevier has fought the whole &quot;open&quot; publishing thing -- it cuts into their large margins. Perhaps, I'm growing cynical with age -- I've just observed that when &quot;mistakes&quot; put money into a company's pocket... they often make that &quot;mistake&quot; again and again. Nephron  T| 01:13, 28 August 2012 (UTC)
 The author of the &quot;Lancet Student&quot; paper has clearly stated &quot;Image credit: Creative Commons&quot;. The author has attempted to tag the picture with the appropriate licence. Your implication that they are deliberately &quot;misrepresenting the truth&quot; in order to &quot;make money&quot; is ridiculous. Axl ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 07:57, 28 August 2012 (UTC)

Circumcision notice

It [http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-sci-new-circumcision-policy-20120827,0,4263437.story appears] that the AAP has revised their guidelines about circumcision, to say that the medical benefits outweigh the risks, plus [http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-sci-circumcision-health-costs-20120821,0,6944658.story someone else] says that it is cost-effective.

Already dealing with it at Circumcision and American Academy of Pediatrics, and more eyes are always welcome. Yobol (talk) 23:14, 28 August 2012 (UTC)
The AAP has not revised anything. The AAP has always held that &quot;Existing scientific evidence demonstrates potential medical benefits of newborn male circumcision&quot;. However, they have also held and do still hold that &quot;these data are not sufficient to recommend routine neonatal circumcision&quot;. What they recently added is that said potential medical benefits justify access to circumcision &quot;for families who choose it&quot;, in a purely financial sense. Indeed, the article needs to be watched for the usual POV warring, especially for such POV additions that incorrectly claim or suggest that the AAP recently changed its position in any significant way. --rtc (talk) 23:28, 28 August 2012 (UTC)

 Yes, but this does not contradict what I said. The update is adding &quot;that the procedure’s benefits justify access to this procedure for families who choose it&quot; and about referring to more recent data. Note: It's &quot;update&quot;, not &quot;replace&quot; or &quot;change&quot;. And they specifically stress, in the same way as the old statement, that &quot;health benefits are not great enough to recommend routine circumcision for all male newborns&quot; --rtc (talk) 23:55, 28 August 2012 (UTC)
That's my layman's impression too, looking at the [http://www.pediatricsdigest.mobi/content/103/3/686.abstract?ijkey=51dca058c447a94115eb2420ec006d7b397aa18e&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha 1999 policy statement]. —MistyMorn (talk) 00:01, 29 August 2012 (UTC)
Sure so if that is the case we should be able to ref it to the 2012 statement. At least we should add the more recent stuff first Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 00:09, 29 August 2012 (UTC)
The more recent stuff is that &quot;the benefits of circumcision are sufficient to justify access to this procedure for families choosing it and to warrant third-party payment for circumcision of male newborns.&quot; What you are quoting out of context has not changed significantly from the 1999 statement. Your version incorrectly suggests that the part you quote is new in or even the point of this update. My version refs the 2012 statement, too! But not in such a badly biased way. --rtc (talk) 00:24, 29 August 2012 (UTC)
Why should we mention the 1999 statement at all? We should be summarizing the new statement; either the information is the same as the 1999 statement (in which case the 1999 statement is redundant) or it is changed (in which case the 1999 statement is out of date). In either case, there is no need to mention it. Yobol (talk) 02:39, 29 August 2012 (UTC)
Not mentioning the 1999 statement would suggest that the 2012 statement is different or new. --rtc (talk) 02:47, 29 August 2012 (UTC)

It is normal to use the most recent statement exclusively.  We would do this even if the only change to the guideline was a small note that says, &quot;This guideline is word-for-word what we said more than 13 years ago, but we reviewed it and agree that it's still correct.&quot;
If you really believe your assertion that there was no material change to the source, then it should just be a matter of changing the dates in the article.  No rational person could possibly object to such minor a change in the article, so that readers know that this is the organization's current position, not an outdated one.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 05:10, 29 August 2012 (UTC)
The problem is that the new statement is presented as if it were any different from the older one in some significant way. There are only subtle differences, but the AAP has not, as the omission of the old statement would suggest, issued a significantly new statement on some issue on which it has never made a statement or a similar statement before. For such a controversial topic, NPOV has priority over MOS rules. NPOV demands that the new position be put into the context of the older one.  --rtc (talk) 06:33, 29 August 2012 (UTC)
I disagree that NPOV demands this. It may be worthy of historical mention for the group if reliable sources analyze it, but that's a separate issue from NPOV. Clinical practice guidelines are sometimes (I don't know the frequency) published with expiration dates, such as after 5 years. It appears to me to be common knowledge that older statements have no clinical value. I also disagree that by omitting it we suggest drastic changes have occurred. I don't understand why you think this is a NPOV issue, but if this is your line of thinking, please start a policy-based discussion at  if you can't work it out at  first, and please and notify us.

POV-pushing damage to  and other circumcision- and foreskin-related articles by
Related to this:  It is the opinion of myself and several other editors that  has been causing damage to  and related articles by editing with a anti-circumcision/pro-foreskin POV.

*Round 1:
* In [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=German_Medical_Association&amp;diff=503108652&amp;oldid=486184799 this edit] to German Medical Association, he selectively added an  mention of only part (the anti-circumcision part) of the organization's  statement regarding circumcision to what is basically a stub article page for the organization
* In [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prevalence_of_circumcision&amp;diff=503098538&amp;oldid=497190103 this edit] to Prevalence of circumcision he replaced a statement sourced with a link to the reputable AMA to a link to &quot;cirp.org&quot;, a decidedly anti-circumcision website and replaced a statement based on a 2006 study with one based on a 1987 study
* In [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Circumcision_scar&amp;diff=503045766&amp;oldid=494448302 this edit] to Circumcision scar he added a source link to cirp.org, and also added an unsourced medical claim
* In [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Phimosis&amp;diff=502634073&amp;oldid=502632625 this edit] to Phimosis he replaced a study done by doctors in a hospital with a study done via questionnaire, with only about 1/3 of those surveyed responding, and again linked to cirp.org
* In [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Circumcision&amp;diff=503120163&amp;oldid=502991767 this edit] to Circumcision he similarly misrepresented the German Medical Association in an anti-circumcision POV manner
I brought my concerns about his editing to his User Talk page [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sugarcube73&amp;oldid=503129826 here].  I reverted the edits without pushback, which indicated to me at least some recognition on Sugarcube73's part that his edits were improper.
*Round 2:
* In [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Circumcision_and_law&amp;diff=503767465&amp;oldid=503613682 this edit] to Circumcision and law he made an edit that appeared to counter the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia's statement with a letter by unknown lawyer Susan Bouclin.
* In the same edit he added a note about an obscure tangential court case in Canada that received next to zero coverage in the news.
I brought my new concerns to his User Talk page [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Sugarcube73&amp;direction=next&amp;oldid=503810110 here], section &quot;Please stop your continued POV edits regarding circumcision&quot;.  I pointed to relevant Wikipedia policy and guideline such as  and .  He didn't agree with my assessment that his edits were  (which is part of  policy) so I took it to the .  At , editors  (4,700 edits) and  (82,000 edits) agreed Sugarcube73's edits failed .  Sugarcube73 didn't attempt to undo my reverts.
*Round 3:
*At foreskin, Sugarcube73 removed article content indicating circumcision has a minimal sexual effect, supported by two circumcision-related sources; his edit summaries were that circumcision-related studies were &quot;irrelevant&quot; to the foreskin.  Yet, he then added article content indicating circumcision was related to sexual problems, supported by a different circumcision study.  For his edit, Sugarcube73 changed the source wording of &quot;circumcision&quot; to &quot;excision of the foreskin,&quot; a term not found in the source.
*Also at foreskin, he added a large quote directly from a study by O'Hara from perhaps one of the worst studies I've ever seen used on Wikipedia.  The study was conducted on women only, it was a non-randomized survey, and the author herself says of her own study, &quot;this study has some obvious methodological flaws.&quot;
Again I brought my concerns to his User Talk page here.  I indicated to Sugarcube73 that he needed to read and use .  In my discussion with him, he largely avoided directly addressing my points, but did admit to never having seen  and , and regarding them he promised &quot;I will read those pages that I had not seen before. They are quite long and I will study them.&quot;
I then went on vacation and have just been getting back to looking at articles.  Sadly, despite being made aware of his POV-pushing, and his promise to read , he is continuing to edit in the same manner:
*At American Academy of Pediatrics, Sugarcube73 made the same kind of POV edits he made at German Medical Association:  He created new  circumcision-related sections even though the article does not contain any similar sections for any of the other dozens of policy statements the organization may have released for any other therapy or procedure.   identified Sugarcube73's edit as POV in [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=American_Academy_of_Pediatrics&amp;diff=509698425&amp;oldid=509695328 this] revert's edit summary.
*At Circumcision Sugarcube73 added a paragraph exhibiting the same problems--cherry-picking old sources, POV wording, original research and unsourced claims.  Yobol [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=American_Academy_of_Pediatrics&amp;diff=509698425&amp;oldid=509695328 reverted] it with the edit summary &quot;non MEDRS ((too old, letter to the editor), POV wording, etc&quot;. In this case again Sugarcube73 did not challenge the POV assessment or the revert.
*The exact same POV edit that Yobol reverted at Circumcision Sugarcube73 has made at Medical analysis of circumcision, and probably other articles (I have to go through his editing history).
I am of the opinion that Sugarcube73 is unwilling or incapable of editing foreskin and circumcision-related articles in accordance with Wikipedia policy and guideline, and the net effect of his involvement at these  and related articles will be to degrade their quality.  Before taking this further, I wanted to see if other editors agree with what I am seeing, and would be willing to work with me to act to prevent further damage.  Zad68 19:21, 29 August 2012 (UTC)

Follow up
I spent some time talking to Jon Brassey of Trip database (http://www.tripdatabase.com/) following his presentation. I explained how we are always faced with the problem that we have no appeal to authority amongst editors, which sometimes leads to disputes about whether one particular source should be preferred to another. Having talked about the system used at Trip to evaluate the quality of sources, I asked if it might be possible to incorporate a sort of &quot;Wikipedia-approved&quot; sticker for the very best sources that would then be guaranteed to meet our MEDRS. He's thought about that and replied to me by email with what I think are some great ideas. I'm taking the liberty of quoting a part of that below for the members of WPMED:

quote|1=
I've given it a bit more thought and can think of a number of things we can do to help boost the evidence-based/validity of the medical articles on wikipedia:

As you suggested, we place a wikipedia button on all articles deemed high quality (all the secondary evidence and the key primary research seems a good starting point).  When a user clicks on the button it opens up a new window with at least part of the reference (if not all) pre-populated.

New research.  Every month we add about 500 new pieces of secondary evidence and probably a similar amount in the key primary research.  We could - somehow - send this to wikipedia, so the editors of the page know there is new robust research.  It might be that you have a 'new research' area on the talk page (or via a separate tab) and we have some mechanism to deposit new research there.  In the case of breast cancer it'd be 15 new secondary reviews and 15 bits of core primary research (http://www.tripdatabase.com/search?criteria=breast+cancer&amp;sort=r×pan=n) and in the case of autism it's 6 secondary evidence and 0 for key primary research (http://www.tripdatabase.com/search?criteria=autism&amp;sort=r×pan=n).  I feel this has great potential.  One of the editors could easily skim the research to decide if it adds anything. Also, as Trip is independent it's a great way of getting a balanced view of the new literature.

The final idea is based on our citation analysis (and is therefore a bit experimental).  We would scan easy of the medical wikipedia articles and grab your references.  We could then alert you/wikipedia/editors when one of these references has been cited in a systematic review or guideline.  The editor could then, possibly, upgrade the reference to a more robust one.

Let me know what you think and I'd happily have a face-to-face meeting to discuss these further.

I'd quite like to build a relationship between Trip and Wikimedia UK, as we clearly share the same aims of providing free information, but I want to include the WikiProject (and WMMED) in shaping any developments, as you all have much more knowledge than I. I'm going to encourage Jon to use this page as a &quot;clearing house&quot; for suggestions, so If anyone has any thoughts on the above, they would be much appreciated. --RexxS (talk) 19:31, 2 September 2012 (UTC)
Yes definitely ideas to explore. I was thinking we could put a button on the talk page of all our articles that our editors could click on to find high quality sources for that topic. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 20:36, 2 September 2012 (UTC)

Absolutely. Is there a bot that could place automated talk page messages whenever something appears on TRIP? JFW | T@lk 00:00, 3 September 2012 (UTC)
Not that I am aware of. Do we have any bot people amongst our midst? We could create a template to add to the talk pages which could contain trip and also a pubmed search with results limited to review articles from the last 10 years.

Anaesthesia

Not many articles on the subject!-- (talk) 14:16, 31 August 2012 (UTC)

Have you looked at all the links from our article on anesthesia, or the many, many topics in the navigation template , or the categories  and ?  While I am sure that there are gaps in Wikipedia's coverage (and if you're familiar with the topic, I encourage you to contribute!) I'd hardly say it's accurate to claim there aren't many articles.

Given the title of this section and the fact that IP 81.136.. is associated with British Telecomm, this seems to be a  issue.  Perhaps the British spelling variants should redirect to our anesthesia-related content?  -- Scray (talk) 02:46, 1 September 2012 (UTC)
Yes, the comment was made by someone I know in the UK and I agree there should be redirects from British spelling variants -- Sharkli (talk - ) 09:08, 1 September 2012 (UTC)

I don't think that redirects from categories are possible.  The category system is one of the software's weak points.  The other redirects I checked seem to be in place.  (But they're pretty weak, and, oh, what I'd give to have someone knowledgeable in that area... and a surgeon or two... and a pediatrician...)
