Quack, two months ago, in closing a different RFC that also discussed this same image, ser:Sunrise told you not to start RFCs on that page when you could just have a plain old discussion.  And today, you opened two new RFCs on that page.  Please don't do that.  Please actually try to talk to the editors watching that page before starting an RFC.  If a normal discussion can solve it, then you will waste less of everyone else's time.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 05:10, 26 May 2019 (UTC)

Missing article: ee's Linctus
Gee's Linctus is mentioned in two articles: audanum and ver-the-counter drug. Laudanum says, '&quot;Gee's Linctus&quot; is also available from most UK pharmacies, especially the Independent stores'. Over-the-counter drug says, 'Frequently, customers buying larger-than-usual doses of [P] medicines (such as DXM, promethazine, codeine or Gee's linctus) will be queried, due to the possibility of abuse'. I don't think either statement is true.

P:OR. I first remember Gee's Linctus from the mid 1950s, when I may have been 6 or 7. I lost my voice. My best friend's mother, who was a pharmacist, gave me a teaspoonful, and it came back as if by magic. I feel pretty sure that it was available OTC as a cough remedy and expectorant into the 1960s. It then became restricted: I recall in the late 1960s or early 1970s being accosted outside a chemist's shop by a bedraggled young woman who asked me to buy a bottle for her (she had the money; I declined). I'm not sure if it's available nowadays even on prescription, or even if it's still in the ritish Pharmacopoeia.

I think it contained incture of opium. You can see the problem.

I know nothing about Dr Gee or his formulation. It may have been a UK variant of aregoric. This might be an interesting research project for someone. ser:Narky Blert|Narky Blert (ser talk:Narky Blert|talk) 21:18, 24 May 2019 (UTC)
It's not in BNF, but I did find a BMJ paper from 1959 stating it contained 0.65mg anhydrous morphine.[https://www.bmj.com/content/1/5117/292] [https://www.rxlist.com/paregoric-drug.htm Rxlist.com] lists aregoric as a alternative name, although the dose and formulation looks different to that listed in the BMJ source. ser:Little pob|Little pob (ser talk:Little pob|talk) 09:35, 25 May 2019 (UTC)

Blimey, I remember as a child (in the '70s) whenever I had a cough my mother would say it was time for the Gee's Linctus and dose me good &amp; proper. And speaking to Mrs Alexbrn just now, she confirms at boarding school (also in the '70s) it would be liberally administered by Matron.

 Doctor who? 
* a|David Bull (doctor)

I'm not sure if MOS / MEDMOS, etc has anything to say about usage of  (doctor) as a dab term for a BLP. It seems to me that such usage makes an implicit claim to notability as a medical practitioner, with the potential to mislead the general public: cf alk:David Bull (doctor) (TV doctor and politician). 

pecial:Contributions/86.190.132.158|86.190.132.158 (ser talk:86.190.132.158|talk) 07:59, 27 May 2019 (UTC)

I don't think that MEDMOS addresses this at all, but ikipedia:Article titles and ikipedia:Disambiguation might have some advice.  The most important thing is that avid Bull (disambiguation)|it's different from all of the other David Bulls.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 15:37, 27 May 2019 (UTC)

*Thanks WAID. After posting I realized that P:NCPDAB is the relevant general guideline for dab terms (the page has now been renamed to avid Bull (politician)). Fwiw, the more general concern behind my original post here was that a loosely used dab term such as (doctor) may have the potential to seriously mislead readers by inappropriately framing a subject's notability (e.g. by implying that a Bachelor of Medicine graduate without any full clinical qualification is actually a notable physician). pecial:Contributions/86.190.132.158|86.190.132.158 (ser talk:86.190.132.158|talk) 22:11, 27 May 2019 (UTC)

 Proposal to reduce links to PubMed Central 

elp_talk:Citation_Style_1#RfC_on_linking_title_to_PMC proposes to make the links to PMC less visible. ser:Nemo_bis|Nemo 10:34, 27 May 2019 (UTC)

This appears to be a question about how l|cite journal should behave.  Namely, if the citation template doesn't have a URL, but it does have a PMC id (which means that it has a link to a free-as-in-beer copy of the full article at PubMed Central), should the article title be linked to the free PMC copy, or be left unlinked?
Including the link might result in more people reading the source; omitting it will likely have the opposite effect.  Editors who already know what those strings of unexplained id numbers at the end of the citation do seem to be assuming that this is general knowledge.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 22:58, 27 May 2019 (UTC)

The same chapter has codes for &quot;my dog died when I was a kid&quot; and &quot;there are no schools around here&quot;.

Over the last few years, the ikiversity:WikiJournal_User_Group|WikiJournal User Group has been building and testing a set of peer reviewed academic journals on a mediawiki platform. The main types of articles are:

* Existing Wikipedia articles submitted for external review and feedback (oi:10.15347/wjs/2018.006|example)
* From-scratch articles that, after review, are imported to Wikipedia (oi:10.15347/wjm/2018.001|example)
* Original research articles that are not imported to Wikipedia (oi:10.15347/wjm/2017.006|example)

Proposal: eta:WikiJournal|WikiJournals as a new sister project

 Request for a quick second opinion (and a rant about nutrition articles) 

Can anyone see any reason to save the trainwreck of a pseudoarticle at hermogenics? It's a genuine (albeit niche) topic, but the current mess of dictionary definitions, unsourced commentary, and a long aside about a completely unrelated use of the term in geology, is IMO worse than nothing. I'm inclined either to remove the medical aspect altogether and leave it as a geology article, or delete it altogether, unless anyone feels like improving it (I don't intend improving it myself; my interest in bodybuilders self-medicating with dubious nutritional supplements is nil); this is one of those cases where having a poor quality article is worse than having no article at all.

(At some point, someone who understands nutrition really needs to go through Category:Dietary supplements ruthlessly deleting the drivel. A lack of oversight, coupled with a steady flow of enthusiasts for various crank fads and a handful of outright spammers, have created the perfect environment for a big stack of questionably sourced fluff like ejuvelac, low Cow and ematogen to fester.)¬†‚Äë¬†ser:Iridescent|Iridescent 19:33, 3 June 2019 (UTC)

I agree with Jo-Jo Eumerus; I've never heard &quot;Thermogenics&quot;. I've heard &quot;thermogenesis&quot; used verbally to describe arth's internal heat budget and why illiam Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Kelvin's calculations of the age of the earth from temperature profiles were way off (thermogenesis by radioactive decay kept the planet warmer longer). The short ages of the Earth given by the basic physics of cooling rates were rejected out of hand by geologists, who said that there had to be a lot more time to fit eological time into. Historic discussions of an unknown possible source of heat that would resolve the disagreement may have used the term &quot;thermogenesis&quot;. There is also &quot;thermogenic&quot;, said of fossil-derived methane to distinguish it from stuff coming out of modern swamps and cow pats, [https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/1996/of96-272/ch03s07.html defined here]. If any geological dictionary has bothered to define these, it might be appropriate to redirect/disambig accordingly, but I somewhat doubt the lack of a redirect will be a serious obstacle to understanding any geological text using these terms. 
Actually, though, going through a few out-of-copyright geological dictionaries and making sure we have articles for them might be quite a useful exercise; a Wikisource text would make it largely automatable. ser:HLHJ|HLHJ (ser talk:HLHJ|talk) 02:36, 6 June 2019 (UTC)

The first source cited isn't even MEDLINE indexed. The second hardly mentions MitoQ and where it does notes concerns about toxicity, which the draft article strangely omits to mention. With your COI you are not in a position to be writing any of this stuff. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 00:31, 5 June 2019 (UTC)
ser:MitoPower|MitoPower, we usually want eview articles, not eer-reviewed original articles.  That means sources such as mid|30116495, mid|30505656, mid|30820778, etc., rather than sources like [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41419-018-0436-x this article in Nature].  There are more than a dozen MEDLINE-indexed review articles that have mentioned this particular compound during just the last few years.
In the bigger picture, it might make more sense for Wikipedia to have an article about itochondrial-targeting antioxidants, rather than separate articles for all of the possible subjects.  I suppose that it depends on whether you see the subject primarily as a matter of &quot;science&quot; or of &quot;business&quot;:  from the scientific perspective, the class is more important than the individual examples; from the business perspective, two equally effective compounds could have very different commercial outcomes.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 01:38, 5 June 2019 (UTC)

Found it &quot;itoQ is a form of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) having the same identical active component as CoQ10 (Ubiquinone).&quot;

I am not at all certain that is correct.  This is not just CoQ10 with a different adjuvant.  It's a different molecule (a different number of carbons).  We don't normally merge different chemicals just because the active end of the molecule is the same.  (If we did, then we'd have one article at -lactam antibiotic and nothing about any of the individual enicillins.)  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 03:08, 8 June 2019 (UTC)
Ref says &quot;Since then, a series of TPP‚Äìantioxidant conjugates have been synthesized: TPP‚Äìubiquinone conjugates (e.g., MitoQ), TPP‚Äìcarboxy‚Äìproxyl conjugates (e.g., MitoCP), and TPP‚Äìvitamin E analogues conjugates (e.g., MitoE).&quot;
So technically it is a &quot;riphenylphosphonium (TTP)‚Äìbiquinone conjugate&quot;.

I'm glad that we can agree that &quot;ubiquinone conjugated to something&quot; is not the same as &quot;ubiquinone all by itself&quot;.  The salient question is whether &quot;ubiquinone conjugated to something&quot; should be redirected to &quot;ubiquinone all by itself&quot;, or if it perhaps ought to be redirected to an article about the multiple types of &quot;ubiquinone conjugated to something&quot;.
One way to think about that question is what you're going to say when the redirect is put up for deletion at P:RFD on the grounds that (a) it's not mentioned in the target article (which IMO is a poor reason for deleting it, but it is one that's rather popular among certain MFD regulars), and (b) is actually a different chemical.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 14:35, 10 June 2019 (UTC)

 SFP course 

Hi WikiProject Medicine,

Starting this week, Wiki Education will be working with the Society of Family Planning (SFP) to improve articles about abortion and contraception through our Wiki Scholars &amp; Scientists program. Their members, who are medical professionals and medical educators, will go through a 12-week process of learning about Wikipedia policies and guidelines (including P:MEDRS and P:MEDMOS), evaluating articles, making minor edits, and finally drafting a contribution to an article. They will be working in sandboxes at first and will receive feedback before incorporating into mainspace. In effect, it will have a similar appearance of a course project, except the participants are not students but professionals. We will, of course, be exercising caution throughout the process given the controversial nature of the subject area and the challenges new users often encounter when starting to edit biomedical content.

Participants will receive an honorarium from SFP. Here are the steps we're taking to ensure adherence to best practices for COI/paid editing:
*We have talked with SFP extensively to ensure they understand Wikipedia's rules about paid editing and COI. They do not expect edits to particular articles or for participants to push any particular point of view. Their interest is in improving public knowledge of the field in general.
*Participants sign a contract with Wiki Education in which they agree to follow Wikipedia policies and guidelines, including COI.
*Participants will disclose their honorarium and participation in this course on their user page.
*As with any such course, we cover Wikipedia policies and guidelines in depth. In this case, we plan to spend additional time on COI, and will spend extra time in sandboxes.

The list of editors will be available once they create their account on our Dashboard page here: [https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/courses/Wiki_Scholars/SFP_Wiki_Scholars_1_(Summer_2019)/home SFP Wiki Scholars]

We are obviously keeping a close eye on their work, but if you see any problematic edits, please feel free to flag them to me or to |Elysia (Wiki Ed), who is also helping support the courses. Thanks! --ser:Ryan (Wiki Ed)|Ryan (Wiki Ed) (ser talk:Ryan (Wiki Ed)|talk) 16:24, 10 June 2019 (UTC)

 Need help Refining Our Wikipedia Page 

Hello community,

I am writing to request help from any experienced Wikipedia editors, especially those who are familiar with medicine and hospitals. I work at Cooley Dickinson Hospital in Northampton, Mass., and after much frustration was able to create our basic Wikipedia page here:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooley_Dickinson_Hospital

Wikipedia has kept its weight/relevance rather low, I fear, since I am an employee and it considers me as a bit too close to be an objective author, though I strove to keep the material completely unbiased and simply factual/historical. Some editors have gone in since I originally created it and helped out a bit, but I would like to get it closer to our affiliate Mass General Hospital's page:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_General_Hospital 

...which I sort of modeled ours on (even though we are a much smaller hospital). If anyone can help improve it; i.e. further expand the info box, add photos and our logo (which looks much like MGH's), I can provide files and would very much appreciate the experienced help.

I am a fairly tech-savvy person and happy to help however I can, but an inexperienced Wikipedia author/editor, so any help would be much appreciated!

Thank you,
Tom

Dear Tom, thank you for your contribution to Wikipedia. Wikipedia works differently than a typical website; it's all about communal effort and collaboration.  The Mass General page has evolved over 15 years, with contributions from some 313 (volunteer) editors, and &gt;400 edits. I would suggest that you create an account, and make some edits to pages that your not affiliated with to understand how pages evolve, and how the community works. In the mean time, give it a bit of time and (if the page receives pageviews) people will improve it.  Feel free to leave your username here, and we can link some &quot;how to&quot; information. ser:Ian Furst|Ian Furst (ser talk:Ian Furst|talk) 18:56, 14 June 2019 (UTC)
 I second what Ian has said, and I will add that one of the first things you will realise if you work on articles on Wikipedia is how dependent we are on sources. We rely on finding sources and basing our content on that. If there are no sources, we can't write the article. One of the things you could do to help is to find sources (articles, interviews, press stories) about the hospital that would be interesting to our general audience. There may also be more statistics that you could find sources for, and you could take photographs and upload them to Commons (see ikipedia:File Upload Wizard) so that they can be used in the article. You can link to anything you find on the article's talk page (alk:Cooley Dickinson Hospital) and other editors will help you to use those resources. If you have any problems, please feel free to ask again here. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 20:18, 14 June 2019 (UTC)

 Sustanon 

Recently, the article ustanon was turned into a dab page after being moved to estosterone propionate/testosterone phenylpropionate/testosterone isocaproate/testosterone decanoate and a separate article created at estosterone propionate/testosterone phenylpropionate/testosterone isocaproate.

 Question about Template:Abnormal_clinical_and_laboratory_findings_for_blood 

Hi there. I'm a new editor, so sorry if this is a silly question. I've been working on an article about an abnormal blood smear finding, raft:Critical green inclusions, and if the article is accepted at AfC I'd like to add it to emplate:Abnormal_clinical_and_laboratory_findings_for_blood.

And of course, any feedback on my draft would be appreciated. :) Thanks, ser:SpicyMilkBoy|SpicyMilkBoy (ser talk:SpicyMilkBoy|talk) 21:23, 12 June 2019 (UTC)

Don't worry about the lack of a specific inclusion term in the ICD. Classifications can't cover everything.

Not a hoax, but part of a bigger &quot;liquid biopsy&quot; initiative that's very early in development from Johns Hopkins (just based on ready, I have no personal knowledge of the topic).  UroSEEK, CancerSEEK, and PapSEEK.  I cannot find who is funding all of this from the article but I think it's something we should look into.  E.g. should the generic 'liquid biopsy' where genetic mutations are detected in the fluids from around a tumor, or some other term be used.  Or specific pages for each cancer that can be detected in this way? Also, is it clear to everyone in the article that this is still in trials?

 e|Ian Furst makes a good point about using a more generic name for the page title. Maybe with papSEEK as a subheading? Or maybe this should be paired down and added to ap test? (although it is not a PAP test so maybe not). Based on a pubmed search, it seems to be relevant enough that there should be something on WP that covers it, but at that same time it appears to be basically a technique of running PCR on samples.

 Medical AfC submissions 

I've been browsing the talk page archives and I've noticed that some users have expressed a desire for a roundup of medicine related AfC submissions. So here's a selection of recently submitted medical-related drafts. This list is incomplete, of course, but I hope the AfC reviewers here find it helpful. I've added a short description of the subject for articles where it's not immediately obvious from the title.

I do work primarily on AfC and New Page patrol these days. I will look at these. 
One of our problems at NPP are the specialized articles submitted that few people there are prepared to evaluate. The many promotional ones from medical device companies and health organizations and practitioners are easy to deal with on the usual ground,, but some general hards are more complicated. The question at NPP is not whether they are high quality articles, but just whether or no they would be likely to pass AfD.  I'll mention a few  here from time to time. If anyone wants  to help by leaving a comment, it is not necessary to learn all the arcane intricacies of the process; Just edit the page and put a line beginning Comment  at the  top, &amp; sign as if on a talk p. ser:DGG| DGG (ser talk:DGG| talk ) 05:48, 29 June 2019 (UTC)

 Class for medical librarians from OCLC 

ikipedia:OCLC has been engaged in Wikipedia projects since 2012. From ~2016-2018 they were organizing wiki outreach to public libraries. It seems that they are now doing outreach to medical libraries. I thought that I would share here.

They have an invitation to their online class series. Check it out -
*[https://www.webjunction.org/events/webjunction/why-wikipedia-matters-for-health-and-medical-information.html Why Wikipedia Matters for Health and Medical Information]

I am not aware of any of the presenters or anyone at OCLC ever editing Wikipedia's medical content or having conversations about Wikipedia's medical content with anyone here at WikiProject Medicine.

I learned of this event from the [https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/libraries Wikimedia Libraries mailing list].

Anyone anywhere can comment or discuss our content, or give instruction on editing wikipedia. I suppose one question is whether what they are doing is in some way authorized or sponsored, and I do not know how to figure out the intricacies of that.  But the implied general question is  whether what they are doing reflects our guidelines, but I do  not know  the details of their program. I've never had any involvement with them.  
In my first years here, I did try to get various library groups interested in WP. I gave a number of presentations, all received politely, but none with any immediate effect.  .

 GMbP 

&quot;roup malingering by proxy&quot; bothers me for several reasons, including the flagrant bias in the article on the man who first proposed the diagnosis.

I note that none of the English references actually mention GMbP - and I did check the full text of the journal articles.

Nothing relevant comes up on Pubmed when searching for MABP, GMBP or &quot;group malingering/munchausen by proxy&quot;. Overall, this seems like a P:NEOLOGISM that's mostly used by one person and is more notable as a political controversy than as a medical condition.

Discussions with the author indicate that they were under two misapprehensions: that an inline citation was sufficient attribution when using text from a CC-BY source, and that WHO was published CC0. There is discussion on exactly how to make up the previous version (retracted or major revisions) and whether a case study will be submitted to COPE for feedback.

The journals are also updating their processes to try to prevent these problems in future:

 New to Wiki editing 

Hello all,

I have a bunch of Peer-Reviewed Journal articles that I plan on using for posts. The video for this Wiki Med group section talked about specific sources, is my peer-reviewed articles sufficient? I am aware of the hierarchy of health evidence and Systematic Reviews being at the top. I also wish to inform that I have a BHSc so am knowledgeable about a few topics. Citing everything is something I agree with and do. Hope to work with everyone in a positive manner.

ing|CanadianUsr10 Welcome eh! Pages that are tagged with Wikiproject Medicine, generally, should only have Cochrane reviews, high quality reviews (e.g. systematic reviews), meta-analysis, or text book references.  For some less frequented topics, where you can only find textbook references that no one can click to, review articles are typically accepted.  The goal is at least one reference for each statement of fact.  There are exceptions (e.g. talking about societal issues related to a medical topic) but we like to ensure  that the information is &quot;generally accepted&quot;.  Peer-reviewed is not enough.  Feel free to hit us up on this page if you want a more experienced editor to take a look.   Also, if someone reverts your edit, don't sweat it!  That's part of Wikipedia.  If you want to know who are the main editors on a page, click History&gt;&gt;Page statistics and you'll find the usernames who edit the page a lot.  Enjoy.  ser:Ian Furst|Ian Furst (ser talk:Ian Furst|talk) 23:42, 2 July 2019 (UTC)

I am editing Wikipedia since 2012 and have created many articles. I have created and edited biographies, history, culture, geography and event articles. I am educated in dentistry but have never tried to create medical article. I tried once to start editing medical article but refrained because I was unsure about too many things.

 Photos on drug articles 

So this is an odd one. Trawling through the AT:ORF|orphaned files category, I found File:OClines.JPG and File:OCabuse.JPG, which depict ground-up Oxy pills prepared for recreational use. The current xycodone article doesn't have any such images. Drug articles like ocaine and DMA do, while eroin and ethamphetamine do not. Are the images I linked appropriate for the article?

The ethamphetamine article does have a picture of crystal meth. Recreational use of oxycodone is a significant topic and I think the pictures could be useful in the relevant section of the article...

I found the threads at COIN, AfD, the archived AfD and the editor's talk page. Is there an SPI too? Can I see it, or is it private between noms and defenders?

 Comprehensive open release of fully identifiable medical data and biomedical hackathons 

oved discussion from|Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Medicine/Archive 124|ser:Seppi333|Seppi333¬†(ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert¬†2¬¢) 18:15, 2 July 2019 (UTC)
ot|bg=white|collapse=no|left=yes|Unarchived thread
This link is about a collaborative biomedical research event hosted by a nonprofit called Silicon Valley Artificial Intelligence: https://sv.ai/undiagnosed-1

That webpage covers a research case involving a specific patient ‚Äì who happens to be my brother ‚Äì that signed an open data release of virtually all of his medical records (&gt;200 pages of documents), proteomic data, metabolomic data, and genomic data (i.e., his sequenced exome and hybrid second/third-generation sequencing of his entire genome) for the purpose of permitting ~200 researchers from across the globe (e.g., USA, Canada, UK, India, Japan) access to his medical data during a hackathon in which they attempted to identify the biomolecular basis of his condition using statistical and data science (AI and machine learning) methods.  

My brother isn't at all concerned about his privacy, so there was no attempt to deidentify his medical data or even hide his identity from the public (e.g., his first name, medical history, and face are all included on that webpage and all over [https://twitter.com/svairesearch?lang=en SVAI's twitter feed]); going to the event to collaborate with researchers by answering questions sort of obviates the point in doing that. One of the recommendations from that event was for his family members (e.g., me) to have their whole exomes and/or genomes sequenced and included in the analysis; so, I too am going to end up openly releasing identifiable genomic and metabolomic data and possibly a few medical records as well.

I'm bringing this up here since I have a couple questions.
* Biomedical research hackathons are relatively common events and many (including the [https://sv.ai/undiagnosed-1-people one for my brother]) are conducted in collaboration with the NIH; these seem to generate a lot of news coverage, but I can't seem to find anything more than a passing mention of these on Wikipedia.  The only tangentially relevant article about these that I found was ig Data to Knowledge (ing|BlueRasberry I saw you created that). Aren't these sufficiently notable events to merit coverage somewhere?
* This isn't the first time that identifiable medical data has been released by a patient on this scale into an open research database (e.g., [https://www.courthousenews.com/dna-hackathon-looks-for-cure-of-mans-rare-cancer/ SVAI's previous patient did this]: &quot;q|Paseman is adamant. ‚ÄúWhat I want to do is tell people who have rare, terminal, untreatable diseases is HIPAA is not really a big deal. We‚Äôre almost dead anyway, who cares? Let‚Äôs come up with a way to release all this information out there so people can use it.‚Äù). I know that a large database of fully identifiable biomedical data (e.g., pan-omics data, medical records, and images) could be used to do a lot of high-impact clinical research as well as other interesting genetics research (e.g., images of people paired with their sequenced genomes could be used to analyze how genetic variation accounts for differences in body/facial structure). Does anyone know of an initiative to create such a database? Found https://pgp.med.harvard.edu/participate - that‚Äôs exactly what I had in mind, but 400 whole genomes is a tiny database. There are [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=(human%5Borganism%5D)+AND+%22Homo+sapiens%22%5Borgn%5D+AND+(%22strategy+wgs%22%5BProperties%5D)&amp;cmd=DetailsSearch ~300000] SRA-indexed human WGS.
*I'm curious to know if anyone is aware of another hackathon or research event like this that attempted to &quot;diagnose&quot; (i.e., identify the pathophysiology of) a patient with an undiagnosed rare and presumably unclassified disease before; couldn't seem to find one from googling. Given the amount of time and resources involved, I can't imagine these would be common. This approach to diagnosis ‚Äì and any other type of patient-centered hackathon for that matter ‚Äì really takes the idea of recision medicine to another level. It blows my mind that all of that concerted effort was just the first round of work on a olecular diagnosis.

No, they operate on recommendations and [https://sv.ai/patient-apply patient applications]. The only point of contact they have with the broader undiagnosed/rare disease community is my brother, who has an extensive network and is a very outspoken advocate for them.  The way that he and SVAI met was by recommendation of the two people listed in the acknowledgements section of [https://sv.ai/undiagnosed-1-event]; John already had whole exome and short-read whole genome sequencing and was looking for a research sponsor for [https://www.pacb.com/ PacBio long-read WGS], which is very expensive. SVAI was looking for someone who had a challenging/complex case history, was connected to a patient community, wanted to help organize more research for that disease category, and was willing to open source their data. My brother agreed to open source and SVAI agreed to finance the sequencing, but they ended up getting my brother [https://sv.ai/undiagnosed-1-case 7 new or updated test instruments], including a better short-read sequence and two types of long-reads (PacBio and Oxford Nanopore), worth about $20000 in total.The UDN was a dead end when my brother approached them several years ago. ser:Seppi333|Seppi333¬†(ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert¬†2¬¢) 12:03, 13 June 2019 (UTC)
dMy brother was talking at length at that hackathon about what he thought was the best approach to molecular diagnostics for rare disease patients individually and in aggregate; apparently he stuck a chord with a lot of people. The Indian woman who led the team from MedGenome contacted my brother and offered to provide him $6000 of free short-read cRNA-Seq on samples from various tissues (i.e., multiple ranscriptome sequences). This morning, a researcher from Stanford's Undiagnosed program who participated in the hackathon offered to onboard him there, generate a few more long-read instruments and run algorithms on them, and then run the validation tests that were mentioned at the hackathon as well as validation tests on what their new algorithms implicate; apparently, all of that testing will be free as well.

I realize that the current editorial staff might not have the technical background to referee submissions involving AI, machine learning, and/or bioinformatics (hackathons involve the formation of collaborative ross-functional teams of individuals with differing omain knowledge/expertise, who then work together to create software for a particular purpose); assuming they're interested and the subject matter isn't an issue for the journal, I'm sure someone from that group would be willing to help review submissions as an associate editor. ser:Seppi333|Seppi333¬†(ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert¬†2¬¢) 06:58, 15 June 2019 (UTC)

Hi Seppi - I'm so sorry to have missed the post you made at T:WikiProject_Medicine/Archive_124#Comprehensive_open_release_of_fully_identifiable_medical_data_and_biomedical_hackathons|WT:MED/Archive_124. I wanted to just add a quick note here that I think something like what you're talking about could very well be published through WikiJMed. There are some editors at WikiJSci (especially ser:Jacknunn ([https://scholars.latrobe.edu.au/display/j2nunn link]) who could advise on considerations and format, and help out in gathering suitable peer reviewers. Depending on exactly what description and analyses are being done, it could be a series of small publications, or a single publication that goes through multiple versions as new parts are added (versioning like a textbook, or extending with addenda). Let me know if you're still interested in the idea. ser:Evolution and evolvability|T.Shafee(Evo&amp;Evo)ser talk:Evolution and evolvability|talk 07:05, 27 June 2019 (UTC)
ing|Evolution and evolvability Hey there; sorry about the late reply. I haven't been active on WP much lately due to a loss of interest in editing; subsequent to the discussions at T:MOSMED and elsewhere, I don't really feel like my work here has much of an impact. Anyway, I'm still open to the idea. I spoke to my brother about it; I'm going to speak to SVAI's founder over the phone and sell the idea to him sometime this week.  I'm fairly confident that he'll be amenable to the idea of working with WJM as a publisher of articles related to the hackathons they host for a couple of reasons, but the main ones are that WJM is an open access journal (NB: SVAI is strongly pro-open knowledge and open-data) and, by comparison to their current journal partner, has much lower publication costs (i.e., no costs with WJM vs $250‚Äì1000 per article with their current publisher, depending on the length); hence, they don't have to sponsor the publication fees for their attendees if they work with WJM as their publisher. That said, I'd like to be able to offer an objective comparison when I talk to him, so what would you say are the other benefits and drawbacks of publishing primary research articles in WJM vs [https://f1000research.com/ this journal (F1000 research)]? I wouldn't expect an influx of submissions following their events if SVAI opts to work with WJM since few (if any) research groups at biomedical hackathons actually opt to publish their research. ser:Seppi333|Seppi333¬†(ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert¬†2¬¢) 17:52, 2 July 2019 (UTC)

e|Seppi333 Thanks for the ping. That sounds reasonable. Below are what I think the most relevant aspects of WikiJMed would be for this sort of research article.
Benefits:
*No processing fees
*Flexible format
**no max/min length (can publish very short or very long publications, or ones with unusual wordcount:figure ratios)
**versioned updates (can update or expand an article with new data after being re-checked by peer review again)
**experimental formats (if it can be sensibly peer reviewed, we can publish it, e.g. single diagrams or annotated datasets)
*Intends to implement contributor recognition system that includes people outside the traditional author list (e.g. patients and other stakeholders)
Drawbacks:
*Not in pubmed (yet)
*No official impact factor (yet)
*Articles written in wikimarkup (drawback or benefit depending on your opinion of VisualEditor for newcomers)
I suspect that things like turnaround time and handling of large supplementary datasets are probably similar between WikiJMed and F1000 for original research articles. We've not had call to use it yet, though may be publishing the first minor update to an article in WikiJSci soon as a test case.

That‚Äôs very helpful, thanks. |1 I‚Äôm certain that the SVAI wouldn‚Äôt allow anyone to publish a patient‚Äôs raw omics datasets or medical records; while it‚Äôs technically open source (for the purpose of circumventing HIPAA restrictions that preclude collaborative research involving a patient‚Äôs medical data), their patients‚Äô omics data and medical records are actually siloed in their cloud and they limit data access to researchers whom they‚Äôve vetted and participants at their hackathons. Privacy isn‚Äôt actually why they do that; rather, it‚Äôs done to prevent identity theft (medical records contain a lot of sensitive non-medical data too). ser:Seppi333|Seppi333¬†(ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert¬†2¬¢) 09:19, 3 July 2019 (UTC)
