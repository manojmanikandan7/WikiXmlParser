This is a good opportunity for me to post an update on our 2023 reference campaign.  [https://outreachdashboard.wmflabs.org/courses/Wikipedia/WikiProject_Medicine_reference_campaign_2023?enroll=qyoufwds Please sign up!]  Points are retroactive, even if you sign up late.
Looking at mfdashboard:courses/Wikipedia/WikiProject_Medicine_reference_campaign_2023/students/overview|the leaderboard, it appears that our current winners are ser:JenOttawa|JenOttawa, ser:SomeoneOK|SomeoneOK, and ser:V3ganf3lix|V3ganf3lix, who have added a total (net) 331 refs to WPMED-tagged articles so far this year.  (Only inline citations using ref tags are counted, and re-use is counted the same as a separate source.)  At the other end of the leaderboard, ser:Firefangledfeathers|Firefangledfeathers, ser:Julius Senegal|Julius Senegal, and ser:Ajpolino|Ajpolino are leading the &quot;efense Against the Dark Arts|defense against the dark arts&quot; group, having removed 262 more refs than they have added to WPMED-tagged articles.  We need both the addition of good refs as well as the removal of inappropriate ones, so I offer congratulations and thanks to both of these groups.

 Tea component theanine and its putative cognitive effects 

heanine is a 1-2% constituent of dried green tea leaves, is sold as a dietary supplement (~250 mg), and may act alone or combined with caffeine in tea or supplements to improve alertness, reaction time, and other cognitive effects. 

heanine#Research_on_supplement_use|A sentence in the theanine article states that theanine and caffeine combined produce 5 cognitive effects, such as &quot;faster simple reaction time, task switching, sustained attention, and faster numeric working memory reaction time&quot;, with 7 primary sources (each with n &lt; 50 published 11-15 years ago) supporting the statement. 

Issues raised with this sentence:
* the combined effects of theanine and caffeine stated in the sentence do not allow understanding of theanine by itself - the object of the article.
* 4 of the 7 primary sources were included in a [https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/72/8/507/1919604 2014 review (&quot;Camfield&quot;)] which one editor refuses to use. The review does not synthesize clearly what the cognitive effects of theanine in isolation are.
* the Camfield review states that &quot;there were insufficient studies to conduct meta-analysis on the effects of L-theanine in isolation&quot;, while one small 2008 study found no effect of theanine alone on alertness (250 mg), and another in 2008 reported improved alertness 2 hrs after ingestion of theanine by itself (200 mg).
* [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8794723/ a 2021 review] in Cureus was proposed as the most authoritative review on theanine's cognitive effects. This review concludes that combined theanine and caffeine improve several cognitive measures, while theanine itself showed minor improvements in a cognitive test (from one 2008 primary source). Cureus remains as a red flag source on P:CITEWATCH, and is not MEDLINE-indexed.

What do medical editors think of this sentence (&quot;faster simple reaction time, task switching, sustained attention, faster numeric working memory reaction time and improved sentence verification accuracy&quot;) in the theanine article, the use of 7 primary sources to support it, and absence of conclusive evidence from two reviews on the cognitive effects of theanine in isolation? 

Should the review(s) be used to make a statement that the putative cognitive effects of theanine alone have not been established, as only a few primary studies have been conducted and not replicated or reviewed with firm conclusions since their publication more than a decade ago? - an unsatisfying, unencyclopedic statement for the general user, imho. Perhaps it's better to eliminate the existing sentence with only primary sources, and say nothing at this point of such limited research. ser:Zefr|Zefr (ser talk:Zefr|talk) 18:00, 17 May 2023 (UTC)

Indeed. Having claims sourced to a shopping list of old primary sources and dodgy journals (Cureus? seriously?) was not great. I just expunged it. From a quick look, there just isn't any decent sourcing on the effects of theanine supplements on brain power. ser:Bon courage|Bon courage (ser talk:Bon courage|talk) 05:49, 18 May 2023 (UTC)

 Medical claim at ritish Pakistanis

Thanks. ser:Cordless Larry|Cordless Larry (ser talk:Cordless Larry|talk) 17:06, 16 May 2023 (UTC)
Hmmm - the ultimate source here is a rather small primary study on a Derbyshire health authority in 2002 - I think it was 53 Pakistani heritage children with genetic defects in the group.  But there is other research - [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4567984/ this 2015 paper summarizes a lot of it].  Some form of the rather scary figures should go in the article. It is a very sensitive issue, with some in the community pushing strongly for recognition, and others very intent on ignoring or hiding it (the 2015 paper covers both views). Someone better qualified than me should work out how best to summarize the state of research. But it is clear from the 2015 paper that awareness of the issue is low among many who would potentially be affected. ser:Johnbod|Johnbod (ser talk:Johnbod|talk) 22:56, 16 May 2023 (UTC)
As is often the case, the elative risk is probably not the best way to present scary figures.

This article needs some serious attention (probably nuking large amounts of content).  There are huge numbers of citations to:
* patientcareonline.com
* dermatologyadvisor.com
* nailsmag.com
* mydrcom.au
* a dubious Indian journal

This article is a good example of why we have MEDRS, and when we need to act. ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  14:28, 29 May 2023 (UTC)

I've excoriated most of the dubious sources, flagged some that aren't egregious uses, and now the article needs to be properly cited.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Green_nail_syndrome&amp;diff=1157578131&amp;oldid=1157118876] As it turned out, I only nuked two bits of content that looked potentially harmful. ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  15:11, 29 May 2023 (UTC)
It doesn't appear useful to post to the student editor who added all that (pecial:Contributions/Sm999), but I do wonder why it stood for three years. This is another apt example, reinforcing Discussion about Healthline at RSN raised by |Zefr; with all good intentions, a student editor chunked up an article based on garbage sourcing when good sources are available, and now multiple editors have to go in and fix what could have been done correctly from the get-go if something had stopped the student editor from using those sources. ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  15:57, 29 May 2023 (UTC)
I glanced over the article, and I did a quick search for sources.  I didn't spot anything in the article that was obviously wrong.  (The bit about keeping nails dry, for example, could be cited to any number of proper sources.)  Sources are IMO a means to an end.  If the article content is correct, then fixing it seems less important (more &quot;cosmetic&quot;, perhaps?) than the ones where the article content is incorrect or outdated.  
Also, there's a P:SAYWHEREYOUGOTIT issue:  if someone got the information from a less-than-MEDRS-ideal source, then it can be useful for subsequent editors to see that.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 20:31, 29 May 2023 (UTC)
Yes, I ended up deleting very little text, as most of it can probably be cited.  But I don't think Wikipedia needs to be hosting non-reliable medical websites (which may contain dubious info) as long as we preserve the content that doesn't seem problematic. ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  21:03, 29 May 2023 (UTC)
Other editors object to hosting uncited material even when they're pretty certain that it's correct.  Consider, e.g., [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lock_(water_navigation)&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1084776730 this edit], which blanked more than half of an article, including photos and other material that we normally wouldn't cite, because citations weren't added to apparently correct information fast enough to suit the editor who tagged them.  If you remove citations, you make the content vulnerable to a P:CHALLENGE purely because it's now unsourced. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 01:20, 30 May 2023 (UTC)
I can live with that; no information is better than potentially bad information in the health realm. ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  02:17, 30 May 2023 (UTC)
While moving in better sources, I have definitely encountered some things that should not have been there.  Anyway, partially cleaned up, still waiting for the journal source mentioned below. ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  15:22, 31 May 2023 (UTC)

 Green nail syndrome or chloronychia

 Source-finding links in l|Talk header 

Hi all, currently when l|Talk header is on a talk page with our project's tag, it replaces the standard &quot;Find sources&quot; links with l|Find medical sources which looks like this:

edical sources notice|Prostate cancer

The intended purpose is to help guide newer editors to reliable sources on the given medical topic. I'm wondering if to that end, we should trim a few of the links, to focus a newer editor on the resources that are most likely to get them to the best sources most easily. Personally, I use Pubmed far more than those other links (and I'm curious to hear what you all prefer). The Cochrane link seems dispensable as Cochrane reviews show up on a Pubmed search. I don't know much about DOAJ, but testing it on &quot;Prostate cancer&quot; (use the example links above), I can't seem to filter to just reviews or books, so I'm being swamped with primary sources that wouldn't be ideal for the article. Gale also seems unhelpful for medicine topics. It searches magazines, which is neat for many topics, but probably rarely helpful for us? I never use the links to the individual publishers (ScienceDirect, Springer, Wiley) but now that I click, they actually do have some potentially useful eBooks that wouldn't come up on Pubmed. So I'd propose cutting the links to Cochrane, DOAJ, and Gale. But I'm curious if others have thoughts, and if I'm overlooking the value of these links. ser:Ajpolino|Ajpolino (ser talk:Ajpolino|talk) 01:33, 28 May 2023 (UTC)

Additionally, even the most obviously biomedical subject could have non-biomedical content as well (e.g., which company developed it, who the most famous patient is). 
The link to TWL could be hidden in CSS for new editors, since most of them won't have access to it (unless they have made 500 edits at a different wiki). ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:18, 28 May 2023 (UTC)
Hm. That is a good point. I'd support hiding TWL for certain editors, though doing so is well behind my technical capacity. Maybe cutting Cochrane (available through Pubmed) and DOAJ (there's a &quot;free full text&quot; filter prominently displayed on Pubmed, so I think Pubmed provides DOAJ functionality plus much more filtering. But again I could be not thinking through a use case well). ser:Ajpolino|Ajpolino (ser talk:Ajpolino|talk) 01:38, 1 June 2023 (UTC)
 I mostly use google scholar which isn't on the list, but perhaps I it's a new fangled-thing (one feature I really like is being able to search through the papers that cite a particular paper - which is great for checking if your material is up-to-date). On Cochrane... I sort of think of it as a statement that systematic reviews are good for peopel who don't read / don't quite get WP:MEDRS. Do we need science direct, spring etc though?

True, we don't link to ci-Hub (for those out of the loop; assuming I'm catching your meaning correctly) because we try to avoid linking to sites that violate others' copyright per P:COPYVIOEL.

 Wrt to the biographies issue, there is a solution to that, if desired: it involves adding automatic recognition of the Biography project tag to the l|Find sources template as well, and ordering the precedence of project recognition to place Biography before MED. As currently engineered, that would result in suppression of the entire set of MED links displayed above (for those articles belonging to both) in favor of the links for Biographical articles. (These links are available now, and can be seen at l|Biographical sources notice and used at will on Talk pages, but are not part of the automatic project recognition on Talk pages, as MED-related projects now are.) If there is consensus to carry out auto-recognition of Biography articles, then a request should be made at emplate talk:Find sources to implement it. Any such consensus should presumably involve interested editors at P:BIOGRAPHY as well. They were notified in ikipedia talk:WikiProject Biography/Archive 76#Two new 'find sources' templates|Archive 76 of this possibility, but there was no follow-up at that time, so auto-recognition of Biography-project was not implemented, but it's a simple fix. ser:Mathglot|Mathglot (ser talk:Mathglot|talk) 19:41, 10 June 2023 (UTC)

 Use of ChatGPT output in MED articles 
ile:Rod of asclepius.jpg|20px|right

Discussions, mentions, or uses of penAI's arge language model &quot;hatGPT&quot; are being held ikipedia talk:Using neural network language models on Wikipedia/List of uses of ChatGPT at Wikipedia|all over Wikipedia, and editors are using ChatGPT output on Talk pages, Help pages, and sometimes even directly in main space articles. This is starting to happen in MED articles as well: witness three discussions at alk:Femur, and the subsequent rewrite of the lead of emur using ChatGPT-produced output (pecial:Diff/1153770261|diff). In this particular case, the user specifically asked the bot for a less jargony version of the lead, replacing terms like proximal, distal, patella, tetrapod with imple:|Simple English-like equivalents or expansions. 

This particular case is less concerning to me than the more general issue of the direct use of bot-generated output in articles, which may be subject to inaccuracy, artifice, and fake references, much more so than the very restricted case of jargon-simplification in the Femur example which is less likely to be problematic. Nevertheless, I wanted to alert you to the issue and let you know that AI bot-generated output in main space is not theoretical, it is happening now. Even worse, imho, is the prospect of it happening stealthily, unlike in the Femur example where the editor in question was perfectly transparent about what they were doing, and indeed, invited feedback on the TP before modifying the article. (No feedback was forthcoming.) Use of AI-generated content in MED articles is only likely to increase, and to the extent that this may affect content in MEDRS-related topics, perhaps it's time to discuss how this may affect Wikipedia's overage of MED-related topics and what, if anything, we want to do to address the issue before it overwhelms us.

 iaphragmatic breathing 

As part of an ser:XOR'easter/sandbox/ReferenceExpander|ongoing cleanup operation, I came across the article iaphragmatic breathing. Some of the sources look iffy: there's a lot of &quot;complementary and alternative&quot; being thrown about. Suggestions welcome. ser:XOR'easter|XOR'easter (ser talk:XOR'easter|talk) 00:19, 16 June 2023 (UTC)

I don't think this is problematic.  Diaphragmatic breathing is something recommended by everyone from voice coaches to mental health professionals to speech therapists to altmed people and even outright quacks.   But:  It's okay for the article to admit that this article is about the same thing that the yoga teacher was talking about.  The article doesn't say that the altmed folks are correct; it merely says that they make certain claims, like breathing exercises help stressed people calm down.  In fact, most of what's labeled in the article as being altmed isn't actually about altmed at all.  Whether or not one in eight US adults have tried diaphragmatic breathing is not an altmed-specific fact.  
If you'd like to increase the impressiveness of the citations, consider replacing existing citations with mid|33076360 or mid|31436595.  The review mid|33530033 will cover the information about hypertension, and the Cochrane review mid|32212422 covers asthma (result: it helps, but they add their usual whinge about research quality).  The COPD researchers seem to have mixed feelings about it, though mid|31719191 and mid|32808571 suggest it's a net benefit.  The &quot;stomach conditions&quot; mentioned in the article likely mean GERD specifically, and mid|35123084 and mid|35842548 say that it works.
In short, I'd say that if anything needs to be done in this article, it's to stop deriding overall efficacy as merely being an altmed claim. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 15:57, 16 June 2023 (UTC)

 LI5 anatomy time 

So I was randomly cleaning up wimsuit (see, I had a fun fact to add, and a picture was too tall for the layout, and then I noticed another problem, and while I was there anyway I thought...) and now I have an anatomical problem for you:  Where, exactly, is the roin?

I kind of doubt that the claim in wimsuit#Women's swimsuits that a bikini covers the groin is accurate, but aside from calling it &quot;the diaper region&quot; in the pre-potty-training age range, I'm not sure what exactly we call that region of the body.  But perhaps a bikini bottom only covers the upper/inner half of the groin, since if they go down the thigh at all, even a centimeter, they become a pair of swim shorts?  Also, the bikini bottom goes up sometimes to or above the avel, which I think isn't groin territory at all.

Is there any chance that someone could upload an image that highlights exactly which bits count as groin, in the formal/non-euphemistic sense?

 Not sure; but your question led me to o redirect|Two-piece swimsuit, which is a redirect to ikini. The latter, marked as a P:GA|good article, has plenty of stuff I disagree with, not least an implication, or at least a confusion about whether bikini is a synonym or just an updated term for two-piece swimsuit (certainly not, in my view; the former is a specific subset of the latter).

 Pseudonymous journal article author 

How common is it for a paper published in a reliable journal to have an author whose name is identified as &quot;a pseudonym&quot;, and should we be concerned about that? [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-023-02576-9 This article] in Archives of Sexual Behavior was recently retracted, and the [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-023-02635-1 retraction note] specifies the lead author as pseudonymous. Is there any reason for us to be concerned about a pseudonymous author, if the journal itself apparently is not? 

For additional background, please see alk:Rapid-onset gender dysphoria controversy#Bailey article retraction. There is already plenty of controversy surrounding the topic itself (OGD), and over the other author (. Michael Bailey), and the retraction is generating the kind of public culture war (e.g., [https://twitter.com/profjmb/status/1661024889111715840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1661024889111715840%7Ctwgr%5E9b4a6a9d3bfa43118b474066370c0131f484ed3b%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftheohiostar.com%2Fnews%2Frapid-onset-gender-dysphoria-paper-to-be-retracted-for-bogus-informed-consent-violation-author%2Fjtnews%2F2023%2F05%2F28%2F  Twitter thread]) previously seen for the ROGD topic; don't know if that's relevant to my question. The article and retraction were first brought to the attention of the ROGD Talk page by |DanielRigal. Thanks, ser:Mathglot|Mathglot (ser talk:Mathglot|talk) 22:15, 18 June 2023 (UTC)

In my experience, it's very unusual for an author on a paper to be a pseudonym, let alone the lead author. Like a lot of people, I'm curious as to who the lead author actually is, and whether they are or are not active as a researcher in this field under their actual name. This wouldn't be the [https://juliaserano.medium.com/did-lisa-marchiano-invent-transgender-social-contagion-and-no-transition-before-age-25-c74f26e2f0f9 first time someone connected] with the ROGD theory has been less than truthful with their identity. 
That said I'm a lot more concerned about the paper's reasons for retraction (lack of consent from study participants), that it has the same serious methodological flaws that resulted in heavy criticisms of Littman's original ROGD paper (relies solely on parental reporting from a single source website and subject to heavy self-selection bias), [https://twitter.com/profjmb/status/1661024889111715840 Bailey's attempt at &quot;Streisand[ing] this thing&quot;], and [https://twitter.com/profjmb/status/1669343903265492992 Bailey's plan to republish] the paper in some [https://openinquirybehavio.wixsite.com/oibs/joibs no-name journal] that he's on the reviewer panel for, than I am about the lead author being a pseudonym. Even if this paper gets republished in this other journal, I think it falls far, far short of the standard required by MEDRS, even as a primary source for the parental self-report data.
I am also concerned about the reliability of the Archives of Sexual Behavior. Though largely a discussion P:RSN|for a different noticeboard, that this paper was published despite the glaring issues is concerning, and I think we would be remiss not to take note of the concerns that have lead to [https://asbopenletter.com/ 15 researchers in the field refusing to review] submissions to the journal, and a further 58 avoiding submitting papers to it due to concerns about the editor and bias of the publication. ser:Sideswipe9th|Sideswipe9th (ser talk:Sideswipe9th|talk) 23:56, 18 June 2023 (UTC)
 I've been doing further reading, and according to one source, the lead author is one of the parents at the website ParentsofROGDKids.com where the survey of parents was carried out, and this parent was in charge of the data collection from the parents which became the raw material for the study. I don't recall where I saw this just now—I have dozens of tabs open—but when I find it, I'll update this. ser:Mathglot|Mathglot (ser talk:Mathglot|talk) 00:57, 19 June 2023 (UTC)
Unless there's something hidden in [https://xtramagazine.com/power/detransition-terf-movement-elisa-shupe-247592 Elisa Rae Shupe's email cache], I suspect we may never know who Diaz is. But given the history of similar identity concealment in relation to this theory (see first link in my last message), I wouldn't be entirely surprised if Diaz turned out to be the owner or someone connected to the owner of the ParentsofROGDKids website. ser:Sideswipe9th|Sideswipe9th (ser talk:Sideswipe9th|talk) 01:15, 19 June 2023 (UTC)
 As a sidebar, reading further, at ASB there are some IRB consent requirements that have to be completed before a study is done, which weren't done in this case; but they apparently the requirement doesn't apply if the lead author doesn't have a professional position, so it sounds like Bailey switched to &quot;correspondent author&quot;, placed &quot;Diaz&quot; as primary, which then obviated the need for prior consent demonstration to the IRB. I'm not 100% confident of my interpretation, because a lot of these concepts are new to me. In the end, the stated reason for the retraction by ASB (according to Bailey) was the failure of the consent protocols, but ASB knew this going in, and Bailey claims that the retraction in fact had nothing to do with consent protocols ex post facto, but rather is an ideological opposition to his paper's conclusions. The non-academic media response reminds me very much of the media frenzy that occurred immediately after the PLOS reevaluation of the original Littman paper in 2018, only this time it feels more organized and &quot;on message&quot; across different outlets. But, we're getting away from the main point, and I'd like to hear more about pseudonymous authors as this is the first time I've encountered this. ser:Mathglot|Mathglot (ser talk:Mathglot|talk) 02:11, 19 June 2023 (UTC)
 Following up on primary author: per Bailey at [https://unherd.com/2023/05/why-is-my-gender-research-being-cancelled/ UnHerd], &quot;t|Suzanna Diaz is the mother of a gender dysphoric child she believes has ROGD. 'Suzanna Diaz' is a pseudonym.&quot; This is not where I originally saw mention that Diaz was a website survey parent, which perhaps relied on this article for its reporting. ser:Mathglot|Mathglot (ser talk:Mathglot|talk) 02:19, 19 June 2023 (UTC)
From what I can see, the pseudonymous author was tagged as being associated with &quot;Parents of ROGD Kids, New York, NY, USA&quot; (in the same way as Bailey is associated with &quot;Department of Psychology, Northwestern University, 2029 Sheridan Rd., Evanston, IL, 60208, USA&quot;) More information about an author is of course useful when determining sources of bias. Authors are not reliable in declaring conflicts of interest, which often are discovered by others afterwards. I think it is relevant that an author is strongly pro- or anti- a contentious subject they are writing about. Bias happens whether the potential cause of it is part of someone's identity (e.g., that they are trans or black or white) or wealth (e.g., fund manager or on disability benefits) or social or political beliefs (e.g., gender critical or liberal lefty) or funding (e.g., a think tank or employer). It matters, for example, that the review of the HS Gender Identity Development Service is being conducted by ilary Cass and not athleen Stock, say, even though both are no doubt intelligent people capable of analysing data and drawing conclusions.
Here, I don't think the pseudonym harms things because we know from the declared association that the potential for bias is immense. For both authors. And so the paper is rightly viewed with a high degree of suspicion. I can see why a pseudonym provides a degree of protection for this parent and hope nobody is trying to dox them. I wonder if any of the research on/about Wikipedia has been done with Wikipedia usernames as authors, or whether everyone has been happy to give up their anonymity to appear in print. -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 09:40, 20 June 2023 (UTC)

I think &quot;seasonality in disease&quot; makes sense. Out of the 2 suggested by @ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing, I think &quot;seasonal disease&quot; is best because it's more generic.

 Good article criteria 

The ikipedia:Good article criteria have been changed to require an ikipedia:Inline citation for basically all information, and specifically at the end of every paragraph (except the lead).  I glanced at five articles in Category:GA-Class medicine articles (out of 344) just now; none looked fully compliant, but all looked close.  If you are interested in any of these articles, please consider adding a few citations.

I suspect it's highly unlikely that most of the medicine GAs can be brought easily to the new standard, because a) many (most?) of them haven't been looked at for years, and are likely dated; and b) many of them were declared GA during a time when only the leads were being updated, so the bodies are not only out-of-sync, but may have had no attention to sourcing even at the time they were brought to GA. ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  14:53, 10 July 2023 (UTC)

 pseudogout 

Hi guys, would there be any consensus to rename alcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal deposition disease to seudogout per P:COMMON?  I don't want to do a bold move or start an RM without checking what we here as a group feel first.
For some more context, the article has never been at the &quot;pseudogout&quot; title, there are no previous RMs, and there are no previous moves in the opposite direction (the only moves were related to hondrocalcinosis being a different article, rightly so, because chondrocalcinosis can be caused by other conditions than just pseudogout). ser:DrVogel|Dr. Vogel (ser talk:DrVogel|talk) 02:26, 9 July 2023 (UTC)

Hi @ser:TompaDompa|TompaDompa, if it came to those 2, I think arthropathy would probably be more appropriate. What country do you practise in?

Also UK; I see pseudogout and occasionally crystal arthropathy when coding patients. P:MEDTITLE, however, tends to ignore P:COMMONNAME. Of note ICD11 uses [https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en#/http://id.who.int/icd/entity/845625980 calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate deposition disease].

lol - ICD11 is such a mess - seriously, they only had one job.
Yeah true people say crystal arthropathy a lot, but the problem with that term is that it's ambiguous - both gout and pseudogout are crystal arthropathies (and so is pseudopseudogout!).
MEDTITLE does allow for &quot;recognised medical name&quot;. But if it's not a term that our colleagues in other countries are happy with, then we'll have to go with some kind of mouthful.
But I am prepared to invoke IAR if anyone decides to use the name given by ICD11 :)  ser:DrVogel|Dr. Vogel (ser talk:DrVogel|talk) 15:01, 11 July 2023 (UTC)

 Terminology usage for routes of administration of drugs and other terms in article intros (seeking consensus) 

I apologize if this post is going to get rather long. I will attempt to be as concise as possible but it is not something I can adequately explain without getting somewhat lengthy. While I hope people will read this post in its entirety, I am including a brief summary at the end which you can locate by finding the bold and all-caps word &quot;SUMMARY&quot; at the bottom of this post. I ask only that you please consider what I am saying with an open mind.

I recently made [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alprazolam&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1164139648 this edit], which I believe to be consistent with P:MEDMOS which states, &quot;Good encyclopedic writing will naturally teach the reader new words and help them build confidence with harder ones. While this can be done explicitly, with definitions in parenthesis for example, the most natural way to achieve this is to use the idiomatic words, the ‘proper’ words for something, in context. Good writing will allow the reader to pick up enough of the meaning from this context.&quot; Despite having made similar edits to numerous other articles without anyone ever reverting it or raising objection, my edit was [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alprazolam&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=1164140362 reverted] with the edit summary “Lay terms are preferred.” I then started a alk:Alprazolam#Orally/by mouth|new topic on the article’s talk page and it was requested by the other editor that I instead post here to seek consensus on the issue, so that is what I am doing.

Personally, I would prefer if articles simply used the “correct” terminology for routes of administration, since as long as the term is linked to the relevant wiki article, then anyone who is unfamiliar with the term can simply click it to find out what it means,  but I thought including both the lay term and technical term, one in parentheses, was a reasonable compromise. (However, I contend that the word “orally” is so common as to not even qualify as “technical terminology.” Terms such as “intravenous” and “intramuscular” are what I would consider very basic-level “technical terminology.”)

To help explain my rationale for this, I am copying this from my user page, which I wrote some time ago:

“I'm very concerned by the way Wikipedia articles related to medicine are being umbing down|dumbed-down. People looking for simplified medical information have plenty of other online resources available. Changing things like 'ntravenous' to 'injection into a vein' or 'yocarditis' to 'inflammation of the heart' is just plain patronizing. (The latter example could even cause potentially dangerous confusions as &quot;inflammation of the heart&quot; could also conceivably refer to conditions other than myocarditis, such as ndocarditis or ericarditis.) 

Some editors have even changed a word so common as 'ral administration|orally' to 'by mouth'! People who don't know the meanings of words such as 'intravenous' and 'orally' probably aren't reading Wikipedia to begin with, but even if they are, then they can simply click the word to go to an article about it and find out what it means. Such simplified wording may be appropriate for imple English Wikipedia, but there is no good reason to do this on the regular English version of Wikipedia, and countless reasons not to.

If you treat people dumb, then they will stay dumb, and nothing good can come from keeping people ignorant. Let's please keep Wikipedia a place to expand knowledge, and not a place to limit it. No other sections of Wikipedia seem to be subjected to this phenomenon of intentionally being dumbed-down, and, if anything, medical-related articles should be the last to be butchered like this.”

Here are a couple examples of problems with specific terms:

—The term “injection into a vein” is too ambiguous. I don’t know how other people interpret the term, but personally, when I hear “injection into a vein,” I think of IV push injections, as I think of “injections” and “infusions” as different categories. But the term seems to be used in Wikipedia article introductions to refer to IV push injection, pump infusions, drip infusions, as well as central venous catheters. It is certainly relevant and useful to many readers to differentiate between the different types of intravenous administration, as there are very significant differences between those different routes of administration. (And if our readers aren’t expected to either already know or be able to quickly figure out the meaning of the word “intravenous,” then is the word “injection” really that much simpler? Should we start saying “shot given into a vein” instead?)

—The term “by mouth” is also potentially ambiguous. In addition to oral administration, are not sublingual and buccal administration also “by mouth”?

It seems to be the norm that there are a large degrees of inconsistencies within the majority of medical articles, with the simplistic terms being used at the beginning of an article’s introduction, but then terms much more technical than “intravenous” or “orally” appear in the rest of the article, sometimes even in the very next paragraph. For an example, see the article for ndansetron. The first paragraph uses the terms “by mouth,” “injection into a muscle,” and “into a vein,” yet the very next paragraph uses the terms “QT prolongation,” “serotonin 5-ht3 receptor antagonist,” and “muscarinic receptors.” Do we really expect the same reader to not be able to handle terms like “intramuscular” but to be totally comfortable with “serotonin 5-ht3 receptor antagonist”? In either case, if they aren’t familiar with any of those terms, they are all linked to their respective Wikipedia articles and can be clicked and then the reader can easily find out exactly what they mean.

For an even more extreme contrast, see the introduction in the article for atalizumab, which assumes our readers don’t even know the word “nausea,” as it says “nausea (feeling sick),” (which, by the way, would only be a proper explanation of the word for those who understand British English, and not American English), yet assumes our readers have no problem knowing (or figuring out) what “cell adhesion molecule alpha4-integrin” means? 

I understand the concerns about making medical articles accessible to those who may have virtually no familiarity with medical concepts, but that shouldn’t be at the expense of information that is useful and important to readers who do have an understanding of (marginally) technical terms. If both terms are provided, then every potential reader should both comprehend what is being said, and will not be without information that is notable to them, nor would there be risk of confusion due to ambiguity. For examples of the compromise format that I am proposing: “orally (by mouth)”, “slow drip infusion (injection into a vein)”, or “IV push (injection into a vein)” or, if preferred, the order of which is first and which is in parentheses could be reversed, such as “by mouth (orally).” I can’t fathom how such a compromise could cause any harm, but there are many ways in which it would be an improvement over using only the more basic term alone. This is the way it already is in some articles; for example see the first paragraph of the article uprenorphine, which in the first paragraph provides both the basic terms and the proper terms, thus clarifying things and avoiding misconceptions or ambiguity for those who are familiar with the terms, and helping to educate those who are not familiar with the terms. Everyone wins that way!

Done in the way I am proposing, readers who are proficient in medical terminology will have the information they are seeking and will not feel patronized (I know I certainly feel patronized every time I see “by mouth” instead of “orally”), whereas readers who have little familiarity with medical terminology will be able to learn new terms and expand their knowledge. (Isn’t the whole point of Wikipedia to expand knowledge?) Just saying “by mouth” or “injection into a vein” without also using the “real terms” can do nothing but keep people ignorant instead of expanding their knowledge. If someone doesn’t know these terms, then ask yourself “why?” It’s because they haven’t been exposed to them. Isn’t it better we give them that exposure to teach them what they mean instead of keeping them in ignorance?

I would appreciate if other editors could respectfully share their thoughts about this matter and hopefully a consensus can be reached. Even if you think the simple terms are better, then I ask what harm could there possibly be from having both terms together? And if anyone has a better idea of a compromise other than using a term with parentheses, then please share your idea. 

SUMMARY: There has been disagreement as to whether medical articles, especially articles about medications, should use terms such as “by mouth,” “injection into a vein,” “injection into a muscle,” etc. or if terms such as “orally,” “intravenous” (or more specific terms such as “slow drip infusion” or “IV push injection”, etc.), “intramuscular,” etc. should be used to describe routes of administration. Or, as a compromise, using both kinds of terms together, for example: either “orally (by mouth)” or “by mouth (orally).” 

I contend that only having the more simplistic term without the “real” terms can lead to a number of problems, the specifics of which I detailed above. I also think using the “real” terms and “basic” terms in combination is consistent with P:MEDMOS which states, &quot;Good encyclopedic writing will naturally teach the reader new words and help them build confidence with harder ones. While this can be done explicitly, with definitions in parenthesis for example, the most natural way to achieve this is to use the idiomatic words, the &quot;proper&quot; words for something, in context. Good writing will allow the reader to pick up enough of the meaning from this context.&quot; I cannot see how this compromise could cause any harm, but I can see how plenty of harm can come from just using the basic terms without the “proper” terms. For specifics of what harm I mean then please read my entire post above, but some of the issues are that the simple terms (used alone) are often too ambiguous, do not provide sufficient information for many of our readers, and ignore an opportunity to educate those who aren’t familiar with the terms. (The point of Wikipedia is to educate and expand knowledge, isn’t it?)

I understand some editors may have other views, which is why I propose the compromise solution of using both terms together, one in parentheses, but I am certainly open to hearing other ideas. I hope to get respectful input from other editors so that a consensus can be reached. ser:Vontheri|Vontheri (ser talk:Vontheri|talk) 09:24, 10 July 2023 (UTC)

There are pros and cons with using more scientific vs lay terminology. I personally believe that avoiding jargon and words that readers are less likely to know needs to be balanced with avoiding ambiguity and there isn't a one size fits all solution. Using multiple terms is also detrimental to readability, and the purpose of encyclopedia articles is to teach people new concepts not new vocabulary imo. (ser talk:Buidhe|t · pecial:Contributions/Buidhe|c) ser:buidhe|buidhe 18:48, 10 July 2023 (UTC)
I'm not convinced that most of our readers aren't already familiar with very basic-level technical terms. (Are there really very many people out there who know how to read and know how to access Wikipedia who don't know what &quot;orally&quot; means?) &quot;Injection into a vein&quot; is certainly ambiguous in that the term is applied to such varied methods of administration, from IV push injection to infusions to central venous catheters. Distinguishing between those varied administration methods isn't so much about teaching vocabulary as it is about avoiding ambiguity and teaching different concepts. I don't think of &quot;injection&quot; and &quot;infusion&quot; as exactly the same concepts. 
I'm not saying we should say &quot;cerebrovascular accident&quot; instead of &quot;stroke&quot; or &quot;renal calculus&quot; instead of &quot;kidney stone&quot; every time those concepts are mentioned, but I do think that when it comes to very basic level terms that barely even qualify as &quot;technical terminology&quot; then it's patronizing to our readers to use such basic terms as &quot;by mouth,&quot; especially when those basic terms appear so nearby to terms like “cell adhesion molecule alpha4-integrin.” ser:Vontheri|Vontheri (ser talk:Vontheri|talk) 03:25, 11 July 2023 (UTC)

In my view, yes, I feel patronized by that. My prescriptions say &quot;by mouth&quot; maybe 80% of the time and &quot;orally&quot; maybe 20% of the time. Also keep in mind that people who aren't intellectually capable of accessing the internet also need to take prescription medications. Someone intellectually capable of accessing Wikipedia is almost certainly also intellectually capable of understanding the word &quot;orally.&quot; Whether or not it's patronizing was not a primary part of my argument, however. The primary reasons are as I listed above in my original post. ser:Vontheri|Vontheri (ser talk:Vontheri|talk) 08:07, 11 July 2023 (UTC)
I think you need to give up on this &quot;intellectually capable of accessing the internet&quot; line.  Have you seen a toddler with an iPad?

I don't think that's patronising at all. We can't not have the lay terms. We should probably have both, but we musn't do away with the lay terms. ser:DrVogel|Dr. Vogel (ser talk:DrVogel|talk) 09:46, 11 July 2023 (UTC)
Whether or not something is patronizing is ultimately a matter of opinion. It was never meant to be one of my main arguments. The other points I made were about more objective issues, such as the problems with the ambiguity of &quot;injection into a vein.&quot; I think having both terms is a good compromise. ser:Vontheri|Vontheri (ser talk:Vontheri|talk) 10:01, 11 July 2023 (UTC)
Yeah but I think that @ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing's point (please correct me if I'm wrong) is that if it's not patronising, then it's therefore useful (and appropriate) for communication. ser:DrVogel|Dr. Vogel (ser talk:DrVogel|talk) 10:06, 11 July 2023 (UTC)
This discussion went into a tangent about what is patronising or not, I don't think that's relevant. I agree with the proposals, with a preference for &quot;by mouth (ral administration|orally)&quot;, exactly because there is ambiguity in 'by mouth' alone. The style of communication should be accessible, but not inaccurate. The spirit of P:MEDMOS seems to trend that way as well. ser:Sto0pinismo|Sto0pinismoser talk:Sto0pinismo|0_o 16:12, 11 July 2023 (UTC)
There is ambiguity in &quot;orally&quot; as well, since sublingual and buccal administration are also forms of &quot;oral&quot; administration.  Orally means wod:orally|&quot;by way of the mouth&quot;; the word does not exclusively mean &quot;by swallowing&quot;.
I personally dislike &quot;injection into a vein&quot;, especially since I think of injections and infusions as different things, and I wonder sometimes whether it could be adequately replaced with &quot;via a vein&quot;.   ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 21:33, 11 July 2023 (UTC)
Perhaps we should say &quot;swallowed orally&quot; instead of &quot;orally&quot; and just &quot;swallowed&quot; instead of &quot;by mouth&quot;? Although in a medical context regarding drug administration, I'm pretty sure that &quot;orally&quot; virtually always means &quot;swallowed&quot;.
In addition to injections and infusions, I've also seen the term &quot;injection into a vein&quot; used for medications administered by central venous catheters. Central venous catheters are a bit more complex than what is implied by both the terms &quot;injection into a vein&quot; and &quot;via a vein.&quot; Imagine a patient seeing a Wikipedia article say a medication they are about to be prescribed is administered &quot;via a vein&quot;, and them expecting an injection, only to find out they are going to have a tube sticking deep into their body for several days or more! And isn't buccal administration technically &quot;via a vein&quot; as well, despite not being injected? ser:Vontheri|Vontheri (ser talk:Vontheri|talk) 03:57, 12 July 2023 (UTC)
Then a simple 'oral', linked to ral administration should suffice in an encyclopaedic article, as in mphetamine. At best, this information could even be improved by adding 'oral tablets' when it applies, etc. ser:Sto0pinismo|Sto0pinismoser talk:Sto0pinismo|0_o 09:28, 12 July 2023 (UTC)
I have also felt that some Wikipedia articles are &quot;dumbed down,&quot; and I have made a few edits regarding this, only to have them reverted. I agree that complex medical terminology may not be appropriate, at least not without further explanation, but changing rather basic words like &quot;insomnia&quot; to &quot;trouble sleeping,&quot; &quot;nausea&quot; to &quot;feeling sick,&quot; and &quot;orally&quot; to &quot;by mouth&quot; seems unnecessarily simplistic and not totally accurate. &quot;Feeling sick&quot; is a broader term than &quot;nausea&quot; and can mean many things. I once changed &quot;injection into a vein&quot; to &quot;intravenous infusion&quot; because an infusion is not exactly the same as an injection, and &quot;injection into a vein&quot; was not accurate in the context of the article. It was immediately reverted. Perhaps &quot;intravenous infusion&quot; is borderline, but I think the average (and even below average) reader would know the words &quot;insomnia,&quot; &quot;nausea,&quot; and &quot;orally&quot; and really does not need to have these fairly basic words dumbed down. As far as words like &quot;intravenous&quot; and &quot;infusion,&quot; links can be provided for the few readers who do not know these words, and they can click to learn more. I think there is a balance to be found. I don't like overly technical language when unnecessary or using a &quot;big word&quot; when a simpler word is just as adequate, in an attempt to sound pompous; nor do I like unnecessarily simplistic words being used because it is assumed people don't know basic words like &quot;orally,&quot; &quot;nausea,&quot; and &quot;insomnia.&quot; ser:GeodeRose|GeodeRose (ser talk:GeodeRose|talk) 23:34, 11 July 2023 (UTC)
This reminds me of something I read a few years ago:  An elderly woman went to the doctor and said that she had been constipated for days.  The doctor recommended a laxative and gave her the usual advice, and she left.  A few days later, she went to the emergency room with the same complaint, saying the recommended laxative hadn't helped.  The doctor prescribed a strong laxative and referred her to a specialist.  A few days later, the specialist called:  &quot;Remember that woman you sent to me?  I've got her on a good treatment plan, and she's much improved now.  Also, she didn't have onstipation.  She had iarrhea.&quot;
Perhaps more relevant to the local situation, is your average reader always a native English speaker?  The English Wikipedia (also French and Arabic) get a lot of people for whom English is a second or third language.  We don't necessarily need to worry about &quot;reading&quot; per se, as people get information from Wikipedia via mart speaker, but we do need to worry about whether people actually know what the words mean.  
The &quot;word (other word)&quot; approach works well in many articles.  In other cases, perhaps when we are more confident, we can use whichever words we want (and we must ikipedia:Use our own words), but link to the relevant article (e.g., ral administration) as a &quot;just in case&quot; fallback option for anyone who needs to check that word. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 08:16, 12 July 2023 (UTC)
I know plenty people who have difficulty remembering which is left and which is right, or what way to turn a screwdriver to fasten a screw. So the constipation/diarrhea story doesn't tell much much more than people often mix up opposites words and that their doctor was negligent in even asking &quot;when did you last go, and what did it look like&quot;. So negligent, I wonder if the story is made up by wherever you read it in order to make a point.
The non-native thing keeps coming up but I think there are problems with naive approaches to helping such readers. For a start, someone with very poor English is going to be reading via Google Translate, and we are simply at their mercy as to what they make of our words. Most of the rest aren't children and so they use the grown-up &quot;proper&quot; words for &quot;oral&quot; and &quot;intravenous&quot; in their own languages. Many of them will know the grown-up words in English and so be puzzled to read &quot;inject into a vein&quot; or &quot;by mouth&quot; instead. Indeed some of my foreign friends are jealous of English having so many words for things compared to their languages and love learning new ones.
While I hope not many children need to know the word &quot;intravenous&quot;, any child in the UK knows &quot;oral&quot; as &quot;Oral B&quot; is the biggest brand of toothpaste and toothbrushes. I guess that may be so in the US too. And adults don't need a PhD or MD to know what &quot;oral&quot; is... type &quot;oral&quot; into Wikipedia's search box and you'll discover the NSFW topic I'm talking about! And it is the lay term!
Naive approaches forget that e.g. &quot;oral&quot; has identical or nearly identical equivalents in other European languages and &quot;by mouth&quot; does not. &quot;intravenous&quot; is &quot;intravenosa/intravenoso&quot; in Spanish and Portugeuse, &quot;intravenös&quot; in German, &quot;intraveineuse/intraveineux&quot; in French. If you are an adult in one of these European countries then you already know the &quot;correct&quot; word for oral/intravenous and yet when you go on English Wikipedia, you &quot;discover&quot; that the English don't have a word for it and have to write &quot;by mouth&quot; or &quot;injected into a vein&quot;. That's actually an educational negative and a gross failure of translation.
Google Translate does a great job and AI tools continue to improve. We need to stop treating non-native-English readers as simpletons. When they read our works, with the proper words for things, translated into their languages, they will see the proper words for things in their language. And if they read them untranslated, they will be pleased to note that our proper word is nearly the same as their proper word. Easy-peasy. If we try to second-guess which words they might struggle with, we'll be wrong. And when we do that but write immediately next to it, &quot;route of administration&quot;, which is jargony and bureaucratic officialese, we just look a bit silly. -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 14:11, 12 July 2023 (UTC)

The desire to avoid words perceived to be jargon is quite inconsistent. Sometimes I think that perception is wrong and in conflict with our mission to be an educational resource, an encyclopaedia, rather than an patient information leaflet or an NHS help page. The latter have an extreme desire that their readers understand just enough, but no more, in order to take their medicine or know when to see their doctor. The NHS website is not afraid to use words like &quot;poo&quot; and &quot;tummy&quot; though draws the line at using baby words for what's in your underpants. For example [https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/diazepam/how-and-when-to-take-diazepam/ diazepam] uses the term &quot;rectal&quot; even though I doubt many people use that word in every day conversation. The NHS uses second person (&quot;you'll need to take this for four weeks&quot;) which is more direct and conversational than the prose we find here. Their conversational style means that once they've said the drug is a tablet, they assume you know where to stick it. Wikipedia, with its info boxes and its tediously formulaic leads, ends up stating this information in a template way. A good writer would have mentioned the words &quot;tablets&quot; at some point in the prose and the reader would be informed without anyone having to worry about whether to say &quot;by mouth&quot; or &quot;orally&quot;.

The main place this terminology appears is in info boxes. Have you looked at a drug info box? alproate. Are we really thinking that the number one priority for making the article accessible is that after the jargon term &quot;Routes of administration:&quot;, we write &quot;by mouth&quot; rather than &quot;oral&quot;. Which is sandwiched in between &quot;Pregnancy category: Au: D&quot; and &quot;ATC code: N03AG01 (WHO)&quot;. This is a drug who's carton has a large (many cm) icon of a pregnant woman inside a red circle with a red line across. The #1 information the drug company is telling anyone picking up this drug box is that it should not be given to pregnant women. Our article infobox? &quot;Au: D&quot;.

We should stop fretting about this and teach our reader the proper words for basic medical facts. I'm all for avoiding unnecessary jargon but an encyclopedia that fills its info box with meaningless crap like q|&quot;IUPAC name 2-propylpentanoic acid CAS Number	 99-66-1 PubChem CID	 3121
IUPHAR/BPS	 7009 DrugBank	 DB00313 ChemSpider	 3009 UNII	 614OI1Z5WI KEGG	 D00399 ChEBI	 CHEBI:39867 ChEMBL	 ChEMBL109 NIAID ChemDB	 057177 CompTox Dashboard (EPA)	 DTXSID6023733 ECHA InfoCard	100.002.525&quot; and labels this attribute as &quot;Routes of administration&quot;, has other problems. -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 07:53, 12 July 2023 (UTC)

@ser:Colin|Colin this bit made me laugh out loud: &quot;This is a drug who's carton has a large (many cm) icon of a pregnant woman inside a red circle with a red line across. The #1 information the drug company is telling anyone picking up this drug box is that it should not be given to pregnant women. Our article infobox? &quot;Au: D&quot;.&quot;. Thanks for that - I'm having a tough day at work today.
I think one thing does not preclude the other, i.e. our prose and our infoboxes serve 2 very different purposes. I find our infoboxes very useful for looking up the odd technical detail when I need to, without having to read through text. But our prose is there to be read and it needs to be as accessible as possible, so that the only difficulty is the concept itself and not the language, otherwise the reader has 2 gaps instead of 1.
I feel that we need to keep our text as jargon-free as possible, and the example you give of NHS websites using words like &quot;tummy&quot; and &quot;poo&quot; is an extreme - we don't need to use informal words, just not jargon. Or just not only jargon, and least of all in the lead. ser:DrVogel|Dr. Vogel (ser talk:DrVogel|talk) 14:56, 12 July 2023 (UTC)
Neither I, nor anyone else, is proposing that we only use the less-basic words (&quot;jargon&quot;), just that we use both terms, at least when it comes to routes of administration in introductions and info boxes.ser:Vontheri|Vontheri (ser talk:Vontheri|talk) 20:54, 12 July 2023 (UTC)
I think the infobox, for drug articles, is clearly an experts-only zone. Nobody ever, on receiving their prescription from the pharmacist, said, &quot;I say, madam, would if be possible, perhaps, that you could offer me some assistance as to the route by which I am supposed to administrate this medicinal compound?&quot; So if we are going to begin with the officialese of &quot;Routes of administration&quot;, next to our ATC codes and whatnot, then we might as well use the official term. And be consistent, so someone reading several info boxes doesn't read several terms for the same thing. 
For body text, we can be more clever than thinking, as so many of our medical articles do, that we need to follow a template for how to write the text. There are only specific times we need to mention how it was taken. As a general rule, for the lead and much of the body, there isn't a reason to mention it, and I think generally we don't. Most medicines taken outside of a hospital setting are taken orally. They are tablets. It is only really notable when this is not the case. For example, we describe it as a cream that one rubs onto the affected area, or a gel one rubs into the skin to be absorbed, or eye drops. It comes naturally in the sentences. I have no problem if some body text says &quot;injected into a vein (intravenous)&quot; as long as we acknowledge that English does have a word for this, rather than pretend it doesn't or that even if it did, our reader is too stupid to know it. Mostly, when the body text needs to be specific about route of administration, it has already scared the reader with a section heading &quot;Pharmacokinetics&quot; and continues with talk of &quot;plasma concentrations&quot; and &quot;cytochrome P450 enzymes&quot;. Scattering simple language in among that just looks foolish. In these advanced sections, I don't think it is good even to use the &quot;injected into a vein (intravenous)&quot; formula. Because if your intention is that someone lacking even that word can understand the sentence, what are you going to do with cytochrome P450 enzymes&quot;? If you really wanted a Pharmacokinetics section that anyone could follow, you'd need to have section lead sentence(s) that had a very very basic overview. -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 08:00, 13 July 2023 (UTC)
I don't often get very involved in talk page discussions, so please forgive my lack of familiarity with this process, but exactly how and when do we determine that a consensus has been reached, and what happens after? It's my impression that, at least at this point, the consensus is at least leaning in the direction of using both terms together, such as &quot;term 1 (term 2)&quot;, but that there may be variability or exceptions based on the exact section or part of the article. Is that the impression others have as well? ser:Vontheri|Vontheri (ser talk:Vontheri|talk) 16:14, 13 July 2023 (UTC)

Sometimes what the consensus isn't is more important.  Nobody seems to object to using a both/and approach in principle, and nobody thinks language like &quot;orally&quot; or &quot;intravenous&quot; is the worst problem with writing articles.

 Naloxone / harm reduction 
There is currently a discussion about whether it is due to name harm reduction providers/organizations in the aloxone article at alk:Naloxone

If the organizations are involved in distribution or advocacy of naloxone then I think it is most likely notable and has at least a minor place in the article. If they are just general harm reduction organizations and distribution or advocacy of naloxone is not a major part of what they do then it is probably not notable in the naloxone article. ser:Vontheri|Vontheri (ser talk:Vontheri|talk) ser:Vontheri|Vontheri (ser talk:Vontheri|talk) 07:18, 15 July 2023 (UTC)

 Then that would be hundreds of needle exchange programs and local governments. It would be easily possible to gather sources for them quite easily. Rather than name any specific organization, I think the more reasonable approach is to say they're commonly distributed by drug users health clinics/needle exchange programs in more generic way especially for the aloxone article so it conveys the information without resulting in a coat rack like Narcan is offered to the community from organizations/agencies, such as ashington State Department of Healthite web | url=https://adai.uw.edu/get-free-naloxone-by-mail-in-wa-state/ | title=Get Free Naloxone by Mail in WA State , nPoint NYChttps://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/basas/naloxone-list-of-prevention-programs.pdf ultnomah County, Oregon,ite web | url=https://www.multco.us/health/staying-healthy/overdose-prevention | title=Overdose Prevention | date=30 January 2018 ity of San Franciscoite web | url=https://sf.gov/information/overdose-prevention-resources | title=Overdose prevention resources | San Francisco  ser:Graywalls|Graywalls (ser talk:Graywalls|talk) 08:04, 15 July 2023 (UTC) ef-talk

Prezbo - Next time I will do that. Looks like it's too late now for this thread, though.
Graywalls - Don't let me be the tie breaker, but I think generally saying something like &quot;commonly distributed by this type of organization and that type of organization etc.&quot; is better to avoid listing hundreds of organizations. I would probably find it notable to mention a couple specific organizations if there is some specific reason that makes them notable. For example, I would find it notable to mention the organization that was a pioneer and was the first to advocate for and/or distribute naloxone. Or an organization that has distributed far more naloxone than other organizations or that was the primary party involved in changing laws or things like that. Those are just examples. Simply being an advocate or distributor of naloxone is not enough to be notable in the naloxone article since there are such a large number of such organizations, but if there is something specifically significant about the organization's activities with naloxone then I would think it is probably notable. Perhaps a separate article in list format called something like &quot;list of naloxone/narcan distributors or advocacy organizations&quot; would be a good place to list all such organizations in their entirety. Those are just my thoughts. ser:Vontheri|Vontheri (ser talk:Vontheri|talk) 06:51, 16 July 2023 (UTC)

 raft:Post-finasteride syndrome 
 See Proposing undoing of mutliple edits removing majority of secondary/tertiary sources from Post-SSRI Sexual Dysfunction article
I reviewed a draft on raft:Post-finasteride syndrome by ser:Xardwen, and they and I are unsure what to do next.  There was previously an article on the syndrome, which was then cut down to a redirect to inasteride.  There are questions as to whether there is a well-defined or definable syndrome, and either creating an article or redirecting are contentious.  There were persistent attempts by unregistered editors and new editors to recreate an article.  The conclusion was to put the parent article inasteride under ECP protection, and to make the redirect from ost-finasteride syndrome to inasteride a permanently locked redirect.  When I reviewed the draft, I advised the author to discuss at alk:Finasteride and obtain a rough consensus as to whether to recreate an article on the syndrome.  There hasn't been any discussion there, and then there hasn't been any discussion at T:WikiProject Pharmacology|WikiProject Pharmacology.  So my question is both what to advise the author to do next, and what I should do next.  ser:Robert McClenon|Robert McClenon (ser talk:Robert McClenon|talk) 04:26, 15 July 2023 (UTC)
Probably the best approach would be to expand inasteride, if warranted, and then if the PFS stuff becomes too big, argue for a split. The draft contains the eyebrow-raising claim that &quot;as of 2023, there appears to be an emerging consensus among the medical community that it represents a real and serious, if rare, iatrogenic disorder&quot; sourced to the journal Annals of Medical and Health Science Research, which does not appear to be reputable and in any case says no such thing, which rings a loud warning bell. The protections currently in place are there for a reason. (Add: and, looking at the user's contributions there seems to have been a concerted effort to shift the POV across the Project on this topic, with less-than-stellar sourcing, e.g.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Long_COVID&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1133538954]). ser:Bon courage|Bon courage (ser talk:Bon courage|talk) 14:55, 15 July 2023 (UTC)

As the Finasteride article currently stands, there is already a substantial section on PFS; I personally feel that a separate article is warranted to give adequate space to discuss the reported symptoms, research, and controversy surrounding PFS.
Regarding the claim about emerging consensus on the nature of PFS, the relevant quote from the review is as follows: &quot;Based on the existing literature, the medical community believes that these patterns of symptoms constitute the basis for PFS in individuals predisposed to epigenetic susceptibility. The medical community must define and characterize the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying PFS, and more attention should be devoted to patient education and counseling as well as to developing novel management modalities. Further highquality clinical studies are needed to evaluate the potential neuropsychiatric side effects of finasteride in humans and to establish whether finasteride has any exact causal relationship with suicidal ideation and other reported side effects.&quot; This seems like an explicit acknowledgement, by the authors of this review at least, of consensus among the medical community that PFS is a legitimate disorder, and warrants further research and investigation; I acknowledge that I may have been too bold in my statement to this effect in the draft, and will re-phrase accordingly.
Regarding my &quot;concerted effort to shift the POV across the Project&quot; on the subject of PFS, guilty as charged- I personally feel that the level of skepticism surrounding PFS that has been expressed on the Wiki is disproportionate to the amount and quality of peer-reviewed research on this subject. I will make an effort to provide more high-quality sources to support this position.

Yes, those should generally be redirects. From the titles and some of your edit history, I'm guessing you're going through ikipedia:WikiProject Missing encyclopedic articles/Missing diseases? Most of those aren't missing -- it seems to be a dump from some kind of medical encyclopedia that uses a different title structure to us, and a lot of the time covering very rare or speculative concepts that may not clearly correspond to clear-cut 'things' (e.g. a syndrome defined in a much more speculative era of medical genetics that doesn't actually correspond now to a specific genotype).

By the way, we have a sort of tagging system for redirects that you might be interested in.  They're called the &quot;R from&quot; templates.  So, for example, if you are redirecting a title that might be suitable for an article (perhaps it's a borderline case), then you can add l|R with possibilities at the bottom of the redirect page.  If you a redirecting an exact synonym, you can add l|R from other name.  There are dozens of these, and they're not mandatory, but you might find them interesting.

The original uses language like &quot;remarkable progress&quot; and &quot;revolutionized the field&quot;, which is not what encyclopedia articles usually sound like.  There have been revolutions in medicine – vaccination, sterile surgical fields, antibiotics – but it's too soon to know whether this is one of them.
It's also wordy.  Consider this bit: &quot;The evolution of theranostics has been driven by collaborations between researchers, clinicians, and industry partners. By combining expertise from various disciplines, scientists and medical professionals can address the complex challenges associated with developing and implementing theranostic strategies.&quot;  The underlying fact in here is something like &quot;It is an nterdisciplinary field&quot;.  What you originally wrote sounds a lot nicer, but what we might suggest is:
* no metaphorical volution, 
* no driving forces (except when someone's actually riving),
* no commercial interests euphemized as &quot;partners&quot;,
* no implying that only the best (&quot;expertise&quot;) of each discipline is used,
* no sciencewashing (&quot;scientists and medical professionals&quot;, but the patients, managers, support staff, funders, etc. contribute nothing at all?), and
* no overegging the problem space (I'm sure they &quot;address the complex challenges&quot;, but they probably also do a lot of routine and boring work, too).
I'm sure it seems like I'm being overly picky – and I am!  A smaller amount of this kind of language is normal, natural, acceptable, and even desirable – but I wanted to give you an idea of some of the little bits that might get mentally classified as &quot;spammy&quot; or &quot;flowery&quot; instead of &quot;just the basic, boring facts&quot;. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:03, 25 July 2023 (UTC)

You don't have to resubmit anything.  The article is &quot;live&quot; already.  Just find a sentence you'd like to try re-writing, click the edit button, and make your change.  If you do one sentence and check back tomorrow, you can find out if other editors thought your change was on the right track (by checking, e.g., to see whether they reverted your change, left it alone, or changed it even more). ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 15:43, 26 July 2023 (UTC)

I had never heard of theranostics before but can see some clinical practice guidelines and statements from medical bodies are starting to refer to it. Example I found using a quick google search is [https://www.auanet.org/guidelines-and-quality/guidelines/advanced-prostate-cancer] from the american urology association. Are there any textbooks or systematic reviews vs the narrative reviews? I think that the commentaries/presentation citations should be removed but could be used to look for stronger sources. I think if much stronger sources are used and the wording like &quot;valuable insights&quot;, &quot;crucial role&quot;, &quot;pivotal role&quot; are avoided you could try to redo it and resubmit. Just my two cents... I have never created an article and have never had to decide if an article is justified/notable so others on here will likely be much more helpful than me. I hope that this helps a little bit ing|Alan Crofts 2023. ser:JenOttawa|JenOttawa (ser talk:JenOttawa|talk) 13:53, 25 July 2023 (UTC)
 I was completing the incomplete citations as you were looking them up.  Done now; some I could not find.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  14:31, 25 July 2023 (UTC)
Systematic reviews are excellent sources if you are trying to prove the efficacy of a treatment or otherwise answer a statistical question.  They are not really pointful sources for, well, almost anything else.  They are not inherently bad sources for anything else, but they're not necessarily better than other secondary sources.
A quick trip to https://books.google.com indicates that there are many books written about the subject.  The one whose title appeals to me is [https://books.google.com/books?id=FtJGEAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=theranostics&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=1&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj645iJk6qAAxUpAjQIHXimDO8Q6AF6BAheEAI Theranostics: An Old Concept in New Clothing], but it is published by ntechOpen,[https://www.intechopen.com/about-intechopen] an open-access publisher about whom we have no article (@ser:Headbomb|Headbomb), so I don't know if it's a reputable publisher.

ow-fat diet

The article low-fat diet is in a bad way and needs expansion and better clarity from someone who is experienced in medical editing. Timeshifter a user who has left a lot of bold text on the talk-page has strong views on the subject, there is a current discussion about some 2015 systematic reviews and a low-carb diet author David Ludwig [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Low-fat_diet]. 

My understanding of low-fat diets is that they were indeed recommended by health and medical organizations in the 80s and early 90s, back then there was some misunderstandings about fat and there was an outdated idea that all fats are bad. The American Heart Association for example, used to recommend a low-fat diet (reduction of total-fat) but as research progressed and new data emerged it was realised that polyunsaturated fats are beneficial in the diet and there is no reason to reduce all fats or total fat intake, instead the culprit for increasing cardiovascular and cancer risk is saturated fat which should be limited, not unsaturated fat or total fat intake. All of the health and medical organizations like the AHA currently recommend a balanced diet similar to the Mediterranean diet and Nordic diet which includes nuts, seafood, seeds and vegetable oils high in polyunsaturated fatty acids but low in saturated fats. 

The low-fat diets of the 80s and early 90s such as athan Pritikin, ean Ornish and ohn A. McDougall are very much on the fringe of nutrition. Most modern nutritional textbooks are not recommending a low-fat diet. I can definitely help improve the article with a &quot;history&quot; section making clear how the consensus has shifted over the last 30 years. 

I am requesting help from experienced medical users to remove/improve any out-dated reviews on the article in the &quot;health effects&quot; section. There are multiple discussions on the talk-page. Unfortunately there is still some confusion about this topic with the outcome being that some people are mislead by low-carb conspiracy blogs into thinking the current consensus from governmental, dietetic and medical organization guidelines are still recommending low-fat diets. There are a lot of references on this but this quick  Harvard Health Publishing article gives a good summary if users here are not aware about this, &quot;For the last half of the 20th century, most major health organizations, including the American Heart Association, recommended a low-fat diet. Yes, they did, but the message has changed dramatically. Now, the American Heart Association, the federal dietary guidelines, and other nutrition authorities have shifted away from advising people to limit the total amount of fat in their diets&quot; [https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/a-heart-healthy-diet-doesnt-need-to-be-low-in-fat] ser:Psychologist Guy|Psychologist Guy (ser talk:Psychologist Guy|talk) 20:32, 25 July 2023 (UTC)

 Proposing undoing of mutliple edits removing majority of secondary/tertiary sources from Post-SSRI Sexual Dysfunction article

Dear Wikiproject Medicine editors,   

I believe that in multiple edits, user @ser:Bon courage|Bon courage has removed tens of secondary and tertiary sources whilst claiming they are &quot;original research&quot; or &quot;primary sources&quot;. In my opinion this has brought down the quality of the article significantly. 

Here is a sample of the edits (there are many more):

It's very strange to see removal of so many compliant sources and claiming them to be &quot;original research&quot;. 

I propose an undoing of the edits made, a minority of changes that were proper should be applied after undoing in my opinion. In case the edits were due to not being familiar with wp:MEDORG or WP:MEDRS please refer to this ikipedia:Identifying reliable sources (medicine)#/media/File:MEDRS flowchart guideline.svg|MEDRS flowchart guideline.

After removing all the mentioned(and not mentioned) compliant sources, the same user has said that &quot;it should probably be re-merged to the SSRI article, as per previous consensus.&quot;(from years ago) which was related to lack of enough wp:MEDRS compliant sources. 

How is removing so many compliant sources while calling them &quot;Original research&quot; or &quot;primary sources&quot; then pushing for a merge a good idea?

In case my understanding of the policies is faulty, please correct me. ser:FallingPineapple|FallingPineapple (ser talk:FallingPineapple|talk) 22:49, 17 July 2023 (UTC)

This is being discussed in the Finasteride section above, but just to take your first example, the NHS (which is usually a good source, agreed) cannot be used to make statements about PSSD with [https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/escitalopram/side-effects-of-escitalopram/ a source] which makes zero mention of PSSD.

As has the evident falsehood that it has been somehow officially recognised by the EMA. A lot of campaigning and/or useful idiocy in other words. Wikipedia of course won't be falling for that! ser:Bon courage|Bon courage (ser talk:Bon courage|talk) 12:31, 20 July 2023 (UTC)
e|Bon courage that, unfortunately, comes directly from Peleg (2022), a secondary review which appears to misstate the facts. The 2023 review I just added (Tarchi) may be useful, but I'm out of time, and will be busy for the next two days.  Perhaps you can do something with Tarchi. ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  12:42, 20 July 2023 (UTC)
Yes, it's an apparent falsehood which has found its way into secondary sources - but that just calls into question the quality of those secondary sources. In evaluating sources, that they contain such errors is a major consideration - the idea that a medicines agency can establish a condition is P:EXCEPTIONAL and it seems the EMA themselves have explicitly disowned this misinformation, assuming the written answer in the UK parliament[https://questions-statements.parliament.uk/written-questions/detail/2019-09-26/291225] came from them. ser:Bon courage|Bon courage (ser talk:Bon courage|talk) 13:19, 20 July 2023 (UTC)
I will not be able to work on this today or tomorrow; someone who can access the full article needs to look at whether Peleg (2022) at ost-SSRI sexual dysfunction should be entirely removed.  I suggest that Tarchi 2023 is a better source all round. ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  15:10, 20 July 2023 (UTC)
PS, here's what I can see of what Peleg says.  From their own documents, I've seen NO indication that's what the EMA said at all, and Peleg even gets the name of the uropean Medicines Agency wrong: &quot;PSSD gained official recognition after the European medical agency concluded that PSSD is a medical condition that persists after discontinuation of SSRI's and SNRI's.&quot;  So, source may be dubious overall. ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  21:14, 20 July 2023 (UTC)
Well... I'm first curious whether there's a footnote (in the body of the paywalled article) that supports this.  
I also wonder whether the article could be corrected.  Getting the name wrong looks like a translation error; the fact that it's not true means the sentence probably should be removed.  The managing editor for the journal appears to be https://www.linkedin.com/in/sue-goldstein-299a6434 if anyone's already signed up with LinkedIn and wants to inquire about the possibility.  (I only spent two minutes looking, but I didn't see a simple &quot;Contact us&quot; form on the journal website, only the generic publisher one and a Twitter link for the journal.) ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 15:32, 21 July 2023 (UTC)

 Credibility bot 

I am reaching out to this project because it uses templates from ikipedia:WikiProject X|WikiProject X, including l|Load WikiProject Modules. I am working on building a new project to make it easier to set up WikiProjects with built-in bot reports. As a proof of concept, see ikipedia:Vaccine safety/Sources. For medicine in particular, it may make sense to narrowly focus on sources that are definitely unreliable, since that seems easier to pick out. If this is something you might find useful, your support and general feedback at ser:Credibility bot would be appreciated. Thank you. ser:Harej|Harej (ser talk:Harej|talk) 21:34, 31 July 2023 (UTC)

@ser:Harej|Harej, have you seen the list at ikipedia:WikiProject Academic Journals/Journals cited by Wikipedia/Questionable1?  Some of the items in the list are mixed (&quot;this journal by MDPI is good but that journal from the same publisher is bad&quot;; or even &quot;this one's good before 2003&quot;) but quite a few of them are definitely unreliable. 
@ser:Kuru|Kuru, you know something about the Wikipedia republishers/ed-tech scam; are you interested in this? ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 20:02, 1 August 2023 (UTC)
Thanks for the ping, will take a look. The one publisher I usually label as &quot;ed-tech scam&quot; is a con artist that created about 40 &quot;books&quot; which were solely unattributed Wikipedia articles on science topics; &quot;Scientific E-Resources&quot; or &quot;Ed-Tech Press&quot; are the usual brands. I fear there are still hundreds of references to them in main as people often just supply a naked Google Books URL. ser:Kuru|Sam Kuru ser_talk:Kuru|(talk) 22:52, 1 August 2023 (UTC)</segment>
