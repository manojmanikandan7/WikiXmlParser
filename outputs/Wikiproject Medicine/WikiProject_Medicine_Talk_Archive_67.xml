Hi there, we're having some difficulty seeing eye to eye on a claim about deaths-by-Kombucha. 

The source being used for the claim is from an [https://web.archive.org/web/20060312210200/http://www.cancer.org/docroot/eto/content/eto_5_3x_kombucha_tea.asp?si American Cancer Society piece], where they reference [http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00039742.htm this] 20 year old case.
&quot;No studies have been done on humans to support any of the claims made for Kombucha tea. There have, however, been reports of some serious complications associated with the tea. In April 1995, two women who had been consuming the tea daily for two months were hospitalized with severe acidosis--an abnormal increase of the acid levels in body fluids. Both had high levels of lactic acid upon hospitalization. One woman died of cardiac arrest two days after admission. The second woman’s heart also stopped, but she was stabilized and recovered. The mushrooms used by both women came from the same &quot;parent&quot; mushroom. While no direct link to Kombucha tea was proven in this case, the FDA has warned consumers to use caution when making and drinking the tea.&quot;

 has summarized it thusly:
&quot;Drinking kombucha has been linked, in rare cases, to serious side effects and deaths&quot;. 

Since the ACS specifically says &quot;no direct link&quot;, it seems &quot;has been linked&quot; is misleading. Any clarity on the application of MEDRS and how this is best summarized would be appreciated. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Kombucha#Mention_of_possibly_unrelated_deaths_do_not_belong_in_Lede Here] is the related talk page section.

This is a misrepresentation. I am not summarizing the quoted text but instead following the &quot;Overview&quot; of the ACS piece which states: &quot;Available scientific evidence does not support claims that Kombucha tea promotes good health, prevents any ailments, or works to treat cancer or any other disease. Serious side effects and occasional deaths have been linked with drinking Kombucha tea.&quot; The &quot;no direct link&quot; wording used by the ACS is in respect of one case and is not an overall summary of the state of knowledge on this topic.  () 07:19, 8 June 2015 (UTC)
What is the evidence? There is no scientific evidence to support any of the claims made for Kombucha tea. There have been reports of some serious complications associated with the tea.3 In April 1995, two women who had been consuming the tea daily for two months, were hospitalized with severe acidosis--an abnormal increase in the acidity in the body fluids. Both had high levels of lactic acid upon hospitalization. One woman died of cardiac arrest two days after admission. The second woman also suffered a heart attack but was stabilized and eventually released. The mushrooms used by both women came from the same &quot;parent&quot; mushroom.

(add) on the ability of KT to protect against a vast number of metabolic and infectious diseases, but very little scientific evidence is available that validates the beneficial effects of KT. The aim of this review is to give an overview of the recent studies in search of experimental confirmation of the numerous KT health-promoting aspects cited previously. Analysis of the literature data is carried out in correspondence to the recent concepts of health protection's requirements. Attention is given to the active compounds in KT, responsible for the particular effect, and to the mechanisms of their actions. It is shown that KT can efficiently act in health prophylaxis and recovery due to four main properties: detoxification, antioxidation, energizing potencies, and promotion of depressed immunity. The recent experimental studies on the consumption of KT suggest that it is suitable for prevention against broad-spectrum metabolic and infective disorders. This makes KT attractive as a fermented functional beverage for health prophylaxis.[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24192111] review 2014-- () 11:53, 8 June 2015 (UTC)

After researching sources to confirm , and in following MEDRS guidelines which tell us case reports regardless of whether they are in a scientific journal or popular media are below miniumum requirements as RS, there is no doubt the material should be removed.  Core policy  tells us extraordinary claims require extraordinary (multiple) sources, so inclusion of death and toxicity claims as causality fail on multiple counts. Put simply, the anecdotal material is noncompliant with PAGs. Considering the article is also subject to DS I don't think it is advisable to insist on keeping poorly sourced extraordinary claims in the article that are fundamentally noncompliant with core policy, .  Also, the journal review indicates that the case reports involved a small number of individuals, there was no scientific evidence to confirm causality.  It is believed the problems arose not from the inherent factors of kombucha but primarily through contamination or lead seepage from the ceramic containers during fermentation. If the journal review and common sense isn't convincing enough to justify removal of the anecdotal passages (extraordinary claims), then the dates should be considering the majority of the case reports date back to the 90s with only a few (rare cases) reported 6 or so years ago. Moreover, some of the books that were written citing those same case reports are not RS, two of which were cited for the death claims in the article and are factually inaccurate.  At best, we could include highlights with intext attribution citing the conclusion of the 2014 review. --[[User:Atsme|Atsme]] 17:44, 11 June 2015 (UTC)
That comment makes little sense. We should simply summarize good secondary sources, rather than misreading and inventing policy to try and swerve around them.  () 18:15, 11 June 2015 (UTC)
&quot;After researching sources...&quot;? Looks like WP:OR to me. And what's with the 'extraordinary claims'? There is nothing extraordinary in a claim that fermentation under uncontrolled conditions can produce toxic substances.  () 18:25, 11 June 2015 (UTC)
 I know WP doesn't give medical advice but I find the condescension ad nauseum.  Would you be so kind as to read my post regarding &quot;verifiable but false&quot; information as it relates to RS that do not pass MEDRS guidelines and explain how it applies to case reports?  It will be very helpful particularly with regards to editing other articles, like atrazine, and the like. Thank you in advance.  [[User:Atsme|Atsme]] 19:54, 11 June 2015 (UTC)
Reading through a couple of comments:
*I would disagree that 5 major newspapers are reliable sources when it comes to medical content. Sources / evidence are like school children. 5 first graders do not equal one 5 grade in ability.
*I like the &quot;true to presentation&quot; bit.

When we are dealing with major topics like diabetes, we never have to use less than idea sources and there are lots of ideal sources out there. When it comes to obscure topics like Kombucha there are few great sources and we must  thus be careful and try to use the best available sources. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 22:14, 11 June 2015 (UTC)
My response below isn't a response to you, Doc, just wanted to make that clear.  [[User:Petrarchan47|petrarchan47]][[User talk:Petrarchan47|คุ]][[Special:Contributions/Petrarchan47|ก]] 03:43, 12 June 2015 (UTC)


When the American Cancer Society hosted a webpage citing a link to deaths in 1997, that source was considered the top quality source, and its contents copied to the Lede almost verbatim. However, when that source disappeared, similar sources were suddenly considered not ideal, and 2 obscure sources were used instead, one of them 10 years old.

The [http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/consumer-health/expert-answers/kombucha-tea/faq-20058126 Mayo Clinic] and the [http://swedishhospital.com/hl/?/21783/Kombucha-Tea Swedish Medical Center], both on par with the ACS source, cover the adverse effects of Kombucha - neither mention death. They go into (rather encyclopedic) detail about the ways in which people have become sickened by drinking Kombucha, as well as contributing factors that may have played a role. 

The Lede now says: &quot;...and the drinking of kombucha has been linked to illness, and the death of at least one person.&quot;

The 2 blurbs that were found and used for the above say:

&quot;Kombucha tea; a general cure-all; can cause acidosis and death&quot; -- 2005

&quot;Kombucha has been associated with illnesses and death. A tea made from Kombucha is said to be a tonic, but several people have been hospitalised and at least one woman died after taking this product&quot;

Because of MEDRS, the first source is unusable. The second source is not a strong enough claim to add it, without more details, to the Lede in this fashion. IMO, the readers should know how very loose the &quot;link&quot; really is -- not because I am part of a Kombucha Cabal, but simply because the truth is what we're here for. Other sources that have covered this topic go into a bit of detail behind that various serious side effects that have been reported. When the entire story is told, the picture that emerges is very different from Wikipedia's entry.

Those supporting this single source and claims of deadly Kombucha need to reconcile why the Mayo Clinic and Swedish source don't mention death in their list of negative effects.

It is obvious that POV is playing a role in the sudden flip flop on what is considered the best source. If we can quote the ACS verbatim, we should be able to quote the Mayo clinic in exactly the same way. Suggesting a 10 year old source to counter this is not good form, not after all the haughty lectures I've received on MEDRS. The single book that cites a death is a fringe claim, and we can't give a platform to fringe claims without really going into what the majority of high quality sources say. But you all know this already.  [[User:Petrarchan47|petrarchan47]][[User talk:Petrarchan47|คุ]][[Special:Contributions/Petrarchan47|ก]] 01:38, 12 June 2015 (UTC)
 Are you aware that what you are calling &quot;Mayo clinic&quot; is in fact something in their &quot;expert answers&quot; series and is written by one individual doctor (Brent A. Bauer, M.D.)? Even then Dr Bauer writes that &quot;several cases of harm have been reported&quot; which in no way undercuts the stronger sources' listing of adverse effects associated with consuming this stuff. What you are calling &quot;Swedish medical center&quot; is 2013 syndicated content from the EBSCO CAM Review Board which appears on multiple web sites. It also does not contradict the strong sources we use. Perhaps you might like to consider the relative strength and relevance of the sources you're championing.  () 08:18, 12 June 2015 (UTC)
Doc James agreed that extraordinary claims require extraordinary sources (mulitple) per .  I'd hate to think people are going into Walmart to buy kombucha tea or derivative health drinks if there's a risk it could have toxic effects or cause death. We have the 2014 Journal review which is extraordinarily reliable because it not only meets MEDRS requirements, it also passes the acid test for WP:V.  I don't see why Mayo and a NYTimes article couldn't be used to cite kombucha products, either.  I think we're good to go in that regard. --[[User:Atsme|Atsme]] 04:04, 12 June 2015 (UTC)
Either you have not read  or you have not understood it. The principle of verifiability means that text on Wikipedia must be verifiable. To quote: &quot;all quotations and any material challenged or likely to be challenged must be attributed to a reliable, published source using an inline citation&quot;. It does not mean that you have the job of personally &quot;verifying&quot; for yourself the work in secondary sources. For the avoidance of doubt,  makes this explicit: &quot;Do not reject a high-quality type of study due to personal objections to the study's inclusion criteria, references, funding sources, or conclusions.&quot; Talking of a source itself as &quot;passing the acid test for WP:V&quot; makes no sense.  () 10:42, 12 June 2015 (UTC)
Making broad &quot;death&quot; claims inst in the source either. It mentions &quot;of at least one woman&quot;. Using just plain death can lead people to believe it is widespread. But you have decided to eliminate the quantitative facts in the source from the article in some strange sync claim. First you add your prefered claim to the body [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kombucha&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=666595579&amp;oldid=666592654] then you change the lede [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kombucha&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=666595579] when it should just have been copied from the lede. [[User:AlbinoFerret|AlbinoFerret]] 13:49, 12 June 2015 (UTC)
im going to have to concur with AlbunoFerret, (further logic dictates this line of &quot;reasoning&quot; has no objective bases , as indicated very early on the ref originally in question was quite dated, even further it does not come up on Google anymore??) -- () 14:17, 12 June 2015 (UTC)
 per comments here, that ACS source has been removed and newer ones used. 's edit that gives us &quot;linked to ... the death of at least one person&quot; is fine and supported by the sources currently used.  () 14:23, 12 June 2015 (UTC)

No, Alex, it is not fine for the reasons mentioned above which were further validated by Doc James in response to my questions.  The claims you want included are unacceptable for the following the reasons:
# outdated or involve such a small group of people (1 rare case) that inclusion of such information is not only UNDUE, it is FRINGE.  MEDRS works both ways.  
# not one of the case reports is supported by scientific evidence that confirm causality, 
# the claims involve anecdotal case studies which is a flat no-no per MEDRS, and 
# the sources you cited contradict a more recent 2014 journal review wherein the conclusion statement is based in part on the same case reports cited in all other RS.  There are no other reported cases of toxicity or death except for that same handful that is mirrored in all the sources. 
It's time to drop  the stick, Alex, and stop being condescending. Spend some time reviewing MEDRS which clearly states   and :   Contradictory to the allegations made against me, we actually are obliged to verify the sources and make sure they are verifiable but not false as further defined in far more detail by guideline essays and MEDRS.  If your intent is to get the article right then by all means join as a GF collaborator, but if your only purpose is to assault kombucha products with scientifically unsupported death claims based on inaccuracies in RS that fail MEDRS and V, then you are not being helpful.  Oh, and I highly recommend a trip over to Red Bull where your collaboration may prove beneficial. There are plenty of sources you can cite linking Red Bull to deaths including the death of a prime athlete who according to RS dropped dead shortly after drinking 4 cans of the stuff.  There is no mention of death whatsoever in the lead despite the case studies and academic papers. In fact the lead gives the drink a clean bill of health. The circumstances surrounding that &quot;energy&quot; drink are far more profound than the antecdotal case reports linking kombucha tea. You might also take a look at Gatorade.  It may turn out to be a great way to help Doc James sniff out COIs. Happy editing! [[User:Atsme|Atsme]] 15:40, 12 June 2015 (UTC)

It depends on how the paper is used. A lot of this paper has more to do with the culture of research in a field and a summary of what research is routinely conducted. I am not seeing a lot of health claims, so  would not apply to most of it anyway.
This is a statement by professionals.

Route of administration articles + template

Route of administration and  aren't harmonized; I figured I should mention it here in the event anyone wants to take a stab at making the template and article consistent/complete.  Some of the links in  are directed to an article on an anatomical region instead of an article on the route of administration associated with that region.  Some routes of administration also lack an associated article on the topic or an article exists but ambiguously refers to the route of administration (e.g., title+lead vs scope mismatch, as in the epidural example below).

As an example, for the articles involving drug administration into the spine, there's spinal anaesthesia which covers spinal administration of anesthetics (into subarachnoid spaces), &quot;intrathecal (administration)&quot; (into subarachnoid spaces; the scope of intrathecal appears to be redundant with spinal anaesthesia), and epidural administration (into epidural spaces).  I already moved the epidural article to epidural administration and copyedited it and the epidural (disambiguation) page accordingly to address this particular case. I wouldn't mind creating, moving, or redirecting the remaining articles myself; however, I'd need a comprehensive reference on medical/recreational routes of administration to do so since I've never formally studied topic. 

So... anyone interested in tackling this issue or linking/emailing me such a reference? [[User:Seppi333|Seppi333]] () 19:28, 12 June 2015 (UTC)



Well, I found a comprehensive list at [http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/FormsSubmissionRequirements/ElectronicSubmissions/DataStandardsManualmonographs/ucm071667.htm the FDA's website].  It doesn't have a lot of information about each one, but my quick count indicates 111 different routes (who knew that there were so many?), not including &quot;unknown&quot; and &quot;unassigned&quot; (which are relevant for their paperwork, but not actual routes).   () 03:11, 13 June 2015 (UTC)
That's really all I needed - I can just look up specific routes based upon that. Thanks!  [[User:Seppi333|Seppi333]] () 16:40, 14 June 2015 (UTC)
*First of all, if dosage form and route of administration are actually the same, as the links say, then merge them or otherwise make their diff clear. For example to me as a Reader.- () 20:33, 13 June 2015 (UTC)
*I'm interested from another angle. I edit the  infobox, which of course has parameter  (RoA). I'd like to introduce a code-list for this RoA, so that easy input produces a correct and well-linked infobox test. (for example:  does show: Intravenous injection). So I'd like to know if there is a set of top options, we can abbreviate into code.  counted 111 options, that's too much. But we can make a shortlist of ~20 obvious/common options, that would be nice. An example set is the [[:Template:Infobox drug/pregnancy category|pregnancy category]] options. - () 20:49, 13 June 2015 (UTC)
Routes of administration are determined by the dosage form of a drug; e.g., a tablet can't utilize nasal administration (assuming it isn't powderized and insufflated), but it could be taken via the oral route or rectal route. Some dosage forms are typically associated with specific routes of administration; e.g., a suppository typically involves a rectal/vaginal route.
Based upon all the medical papers I've read, I'd say the most common general routes of administration used in preclinical research or in humans are oral administration, intraperitoneal administration (i.p.), intravenous administration (i.v.), intramuscular administration (i.m.), subcutaneous administration (s.c.), nasal administration (this includes insufflation (medicine), which involves a specific dosage form, but insufflation is commonly used in drugboxes), inhalation (this includes recreational routes like smoking), topical administration, and rectal administration, assuming I haven't forgotten any.  In preclinical research, injections into specific brain structures or regions (e.g., intra-accumbal or intra-striatal) is a very common route of administration, but I don't know of a catch-all term for this type of administration.

Buccal administration and sublingual administration aren't utilized medically anywhere near as much as the oral route in humans, but certain drugs like nicotine polacrilex utilize these as a primary route due to oral bioavailability issues. Intrathecal and epidural administration are notable routes, but they're also comparatively less common to those listed above, as they're applied by doctors/clinicians in hospitals/clinics instead of for use by the general populous.
Assuming I haven't forgotten any notable/major drug routes, the remainder are typically associated with very particular drugs/agents or are simply uncommonly used as a medical route in humans due to the feasibility of using a more standard drug route, like oral intake.  Intravaginal administration is a notable medical route for particular drugs/devices and a somewhat less common recreational route; e.g., see History and culture of substituted amphetamines#Recreational routes of administration.
It's probably worth coding an abbreviated input for all of the above routes (excluding the preclinical one I noted). [[User:Seppi333|Seppi333]] () 16:40, 14 June 2015 (UTC)

We should be very careful here, as there are still, I expect, strong national preferences. Doctors on the old big ocean liners used to keep common drugs in 3 forms: injectable for the Americans and Germans, pills for the British, and suppositories for the French.  () 14:29, 15 June 2015 (UTC)

Please see the example drug infobox to the right. This is in the lead of Lorcaserin, and similar boxes are in most drug articles.

In my opinion drug infoboxes currently are not human readable. They present information which is useful to librarians and chemists and not for general readers. I like the information they present, but I think it should not be put at the top of the article because the top of the article is reserved for priority content. A few months ago I made the same comments at , where I said I would like those boxes to similarly become human readable.

The resolution to that discussion was that I proposed to make about 10 new infoboxes as a demo and trial them. I also said that I would look into keeping the data in Wikidata, so that short text descriptions could be developed and translated into more languages. I have been unable to find good sources for making infoboxes for diseases, but I recently found out that I have content for drug infoboxes. [http://www.consumerreports.org/health/resources/pdf/Drugs/Belviq_drug_facts.pdf See the top of this PDF].

I have some mockups here -
*[[User:OR drohowa/Template:Infobox drug information 1|Infobox drug information 1]]
*[[User:OR drohowa/Template:Infobox drug information 2|Infobox drug information 2]]
*[[User:Bluerasberry/Template:Infobox drug information 3|Infobox drug information 3]]
*[[User:Bluerasberry/Template:Infobox drug information 4| Infobox drug information 4]]

I was thinking of putting any one of these in the Lorcaserin article, and moving the current drug infobox from the lead to somewhere lower in the page. Does anyone have any comment on this information or this plan? [[User:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ]][[User talk:Bluerasberry|(talk)]] 22:22, 11 June 2015 (UTC)
 I think you make a very valid point, in terms of the drug infoboxes and the &quot;general reader&quot;...which is useful to librarians and chemists and not for general readers...my comment would be- I support such a move in regard to the Lorcaserin article-- () 22:33, 11 June 2015 (UTC)
I am not a fan. These are blocks of text that do not work well in infoboxes. This is content that belongs in the article proper
Other issues 1) you are using brand names rather than generic names 2) you refer to US data like it is global &quot;When was the drug approved? June 2012&quot; 3) it is writing in a how to format &quot;If you don't lose at least 5% of your body weight after 3 months, stop taking the drug, because it is unlikely to work&quot; 4) You have even written the brand name in all caps BELVIQ
Stuff like route of administration, key trade names, and pregnancy category work in infoboxes. I agree that the identifiers are chemist centric.
Putting massive lists of uses or side effects in infoboxes is not a good idea IMO. We could make it more general public centric by adding stuff like a) onset of action b) duration of action c) some measure of price [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 22:49, 11 June 2015 (UTC)

James' point 2 is not really exclusively related to these mock ups, the current infobox is also like this.
My concern about this is that it looks too much like a patient information leaflet. I feel the current one looks more professional and encyclopedic.  () 07:02, 12 June 2015 (UTC)
We state US for some data that is US specific. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 10:07, 12 June 2015 (UTC)

First of all, this is not the proper forum to be having this discussion.  This discussion should be happening at , not here. I also agree with Matthew that the current format looks much more professional and encyclopedic. Wikidata, especially in its current form, is not a substitute for displaying the data. This data needs to be displayed in an organized format in an infobox.  I would also strongly oppose removing the chemical structure.  Drugs are chemicals and our audience includes chemists, pharmacologists, and students who are interested in chemistry.  () 10:32, 12 June 2015 (UTC)
The chemical structure and IUPAC name is priority content and it is essential that this is displayed at the top of the article. The &quot;Clinical data&quot; section also contains essential information.  The other information is less critical and appropriately it is displayed later in the infobox and therefore by definition is no longer at the top of the article.  () 10:58, 12 June 2015 (UTC)
 FWIW, I think pharmacists are the correct people to decide how to display information about medication.  I think the information is informative and is important for the primary users of the information - who are likely to be chemists and pharmacists - and the medical and/or human readable version is likely best left in the text. Clearly not all information is applicable to a general reader, but I don't think we can assume that medics are the primary users of such information. Not that anyone should care what I think as a non-medic, non-pharmacist, of course.  () 10:41, 12 June 2015 (UTC)

Revisions

Please see [[User:Bluerasberry/Template:Infobox drug information 5|THIS REVISION]] in context with a second chemical infobox. Visit on a mobile device for maximum effect. I would appreciate more comments about splitting the current infobox into two, one for consumers and in the lead and one for chemists and further down the page. The consumer box is here, and see it in context in [[User:Bluerasberry/Template:Infobox drug information 5|THIS REVISION]]. 

In response to the comments above -
* - You said you were not a fan, then you gave a lot of constructive criticism. I retained what you said should be kept and mock-added some more. Referencing needs to be sorted for some of this. The US-centricity is not just in my proposal, but deeply built into the current system. I removed what US-centric content I had added and retained what was already there. I greatly shortened the text descriptions. I might like to shorten them more so that whenever possible they can eventually be reduced to terms which can be translated in Wikidata, but this is what I have now. I would like more feedback on the extent to which you think this could be developed further.
* What is the problem with Wikipedia articles looking like a patient information leaflet? Patients use them for information, right? I am trying to emulate Google's Knowledge Graph. They have these well developed for medical conditions (Google search hepatitis, for example) and will start doing drugs soon enough. [http://www.consumerreports.org/health/resources/pdf/Drugs/Belviq_drug_facts.pdf I copied a patient information leaflet] to make this.

*:::::I don't think that we necessarily should exclude &quot;non-general&quot; readers.

*:::::Also, what you deride as &quot;pandering to someone wanting to make a health decision&quot; sounds an awful lot like what general readers keep asking for.

I don't see anything in this list that wouldn't interest some general readers.   () 16:02, 13 June 2015 (UTC)

* If this proposal progresses then it will travel to other forums, with WP:PHARM being the next stop. Wikidata is not a substitute for displaying data but when single words and items need to be repeatedly translated into 100+ languages, like &quot;contraindication - pregnancy&quot;, I think it is nice to start looking at how Wikidata might someday get safety alerts to a lot of languages which are not presenting them. I want to serve chemists, and I want this information in an &quot;infobox&quot;, but right now &quot;infobox&quot; usually means &quot;box in the lead&quot;. Go to Lorcaserin on your phone and you will see that this chemistry information comes up first. I do not want this information there - I want consumer and patient information first. Please see [[User:Bluerasberry/Template:Infobox drug information 5|this revision]] I just presented. I preserved all the information you wanted kept, but I put it further down the page. I opted to put the chemical structure in the lower box even though you said it was priority content, and I repeated the IUPAC name. Things can be moved, but please comment for now if you think this is a disruption to chemists to have this content moved into a different box further down the page.
 OK, I do see your point concerning the mobile version. But I think the problem is not specific to the drugbox but equally applies to all articles. What really is needed is the  equivalent of a lead tailored for mobile devices (e.g., the display should start with lead sentence accompanied by a condensed graphic).  The graphic for drug articles should be the chemical structure rather than the IUPAC chemical name.  () 20:04, 12 June 2015 (UTC)
Boghog, when you say that the chemical structure should be prioritized, you're assuming small molecules, right?  And why should the chemical structure be prioritized over what the drug looks like to the average person (e.g., everyone from pharmacy techs to patients to caregivers to hospital cleaning staff)?   () 03:21, 13 June 2015 (UTC)
 WAID, yes, I was meant small molecules and not biopharmaceuticals. Concerning your second question, we previously had an extensive discussion and the consensus at that time was to [[Template_talk:Infobox_drug/Archive_8#Drugbox_image:_pill_vs_chemical_structure|generally keep using chemical structures in the drug box rather than pill images]]. I really think the problem is not with the infobox per se but how it is displayed on the desktop vs. mobile view.  IMHO, the current version of  is appropriate for the desktop.  One solution is to make all the sections except for the chemical structure collapsable and set the initial state to &quot;uncollapsed&quot; in the desktop view and &quot;collapsed&quot; in the mobile view.  However there does not currently appear to be a way to do this.  () 08:02, 13 June 2015 (UTC)
I'm not surprised that a discussion involving mostly people with advanced degrees in health and chemistry concluded that chemical structures were appropriate.  Are you?  
I don't think that our actual &quot;general readers&quot; (invoked to justify several answers) would agree with them, though.  The typical general reader can't make heads or tails of a chemical structure. 
I agree about the mobile vs desktop problem.  Infoboxes (and much of our article layout) was designed on the assumption that everyone would have a desktop computer with a fairly large screen.  (Collapsing causes  problems.)  () 16:12, 13 June 2015 (UTC)
 Even if the chemical structure cannot be understood by everyone, it still defines what the drug is, hence it is essential that a picture of it be included.  Our audience is broader than the general reader, it also includes more technically inclined readers.  If the structure is not included at the top of the article, one may lose the attention of later which would be a disaster since these types of readers are the most likely to contribute content to drug articles.  Concerning collapsing content, it should be noted that all content except the lead is collapsed in the mobile version.  My suggestion mentioned above is to collapse the more detailed parts of the drug infoboxes only when displayed in the mobile view.  The desktop view would remain unchanged.  Currently this suggestion cannot be implemented because there does not seem to be any support for detection of what view is being used and conditional collapsing based on that view.  () 08:29, 14 June 2015 (UTC) 
I read and edit using the mobile version and I wanted to clarify how things are displayed. In the mobile version, top-level sections are collapsed. Thus the mobile reader can click on and read each section independently, the display is scaled for the device, and the whole page need not be loaded. (Note that project- and user-space pages using a tabbed display, like , don't display things this way and are unreadable on mobile devices).
However, anything collapsed with a show/hide link doesn't show up at all on the mobile version. The only way a mobile reader can see those links to click them is if they load the desktop version of the page. This loads the whole page in tiny font, which kind of defeats the purpose of a mobile view. Collapsed content is better avoided until or unless it displays properly on mobile devices.
Another reason collapsed content should be avoided is that it doesn't play nice with accessibility devices.  () 18:36, 15 June 2015 (UTC)
 At least with iOS, the exact opposite is true.  Content in infoboxes that is collapsed in the desktop view is not collapsed in the mobile view. This is the main reason that I always use the desktop view, even when viewing on my smart phone. What I was suggesting above is that detailed sections of infoboxes should be treated exactly like sections in the mobile view (collapsed by default but definitely viewable if uncollapsed).  () 19:56, 15 June 2015 (UTC)
* You said, &quot;Not that anyone should care what I think as a non-medic, non-pharmacist, of course.&quot; Yes, everyone here should care. Almost every health decision is made by non-medic, non-pharmacists. Even people under intense medical guidance make many medical decisions with their friends and family, and non-medic opinions are very important here. There are other ways to cut this, like for example, everything under &quot;what is this drug for&quot; could be cut. However, the facts under that are all in different places in the article, and I would like for those questions to be answered immediately first thing in the article. Further comments are welcome, even if it is to confirm what you said before.
 Well, I prefer this version than the others, but I still think the proper place to discuss this is with the pharmacists. For me, the danger with elevating even general medical advice to the top of the page is that potential patients take this to be prescriptive advice for their own condition - having a box which is focussed on the pharma is much less likely to do that, and I believe will barely be noticed by non-pharma visitors to the page. For me, the issue here comes down to who it is that will a) use the page and b) which wikiproject will manage the template. Most of the time, I'd suggest that accuracy and precision on the chemical basis of the medication is a top priority and should be at the top of the page - in an emergency, pharmacists may turn to wikipedia for information about a medication and that, for me, trumps information supplied to potential patients. They need to know what it is, what the chemical structure is, what the brand names are and so on. In the general way, I'd say medics are the proper people to edit pages on conditions and diagnosis, I believe pharmacists are the proper people to make major decisions about the layout of pages on medication. I therefore do not support the layout suggested in the templates offered above, although I do like the way they display on mobiles.  () 11:07, 13 June 2015 (UTC)

I think that we need to accommodate the chemist / pharmacist / medic, reader and the health patient / non-medic reader in the infobox since infoboxes are so prominent in mobile and also in other new devices like Google Glass. It would also be helpful to have research to better understand who the prominent audience of health / medical articles are: health professionals or the general public? I would assume the latter, but no reader should be preferenced as far as Infobox information in my opinion. It seems to me that it would be especially nice if each of these new proposed sections like “Medical uses” were a WikiData item. Otherwise, I also support the idea of also raising this as a discussion point in . () 19:00, 15 June 2015 (UTC)

Prices
I like the addition of onset of action, duration of action, and price. Hope to be adding price info to Wikidata and than we could have a drop down menu for different countries. I am not sure if we are allowed to us IP addresses to geo locate people.
Medical uses for this new medication with a single use is easy as is the patient population. Try this for cephalexin or metoprolol and things will get way more complicated. Other options is basically asking to but the treatment of all diseases in which the medication is used in an infobox. 
I like the &quot;interactions&quot; bit and would be supportive of adding it. A few others are working on this. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 22:50, 12 June 2015 (UTC)

There's some geolocation ability in banners, but I understand that it's a bit 'expensive', so it probably isn't going to be something that can run on every page view (especially for logged-out readers, because they all see cached versions).   () 03:21, 13 June 2015 (UTC)
：Great, thanks for putting this together BlueRaspberry, here are some thoughts:
#I like the general direction you're going, especially with a preference towards patient information
#Could 'identifiers' be moved ultimately to a form of Authority Control template, like we do for biographies?
#It's a pity to see some of the pharmacokinetic data go, that's very useful from my point of view and something that is eminently 'Infobox-able'
#Am a general fan of your template except for these two fields: alternatives and price.
#Alternatives -- I think these are better covered in the parent articles for the topics. I shudder to think about the large amount of editing (and potential edit wars) for any drug related to an even moderately controversial topic -- I'm thinking weight loss, depression, pain control drugs here, in which there are simply too many and too nuanced treatments to summarize accurately on an 'alternatives' field in the infobox in every single drug article
#Price -- pregnancy data and contraindications are fairly similar everywhere, but not price. As a non-US editor and reader I'm not a big fan of things where are explictly US and not very translatable to my own country (keep in mind that this is not just an issue of exchange rates, but how health systems are structured). Also surely the price a person is charged varies greatly between venue and circumstance? 
Overall I think you're doing something very useful! -- () 07:41, 13 June 2015 (UTC)

2 and 3 - I also do not want identifiers and pharmacokinetic data removed, but instead, I just want this information out of the lead and put anywhere else. Did you see [[User:Bluerasberry/Template:Infobox_drug_information_5|the revised mockup]]? The information is still there, just split into two infoboxes. Yes, one model could be to turn part of an infobox into an authority control navbox. First I wanted to check consensus on having a split from consumer info and catalog info, then after that, if people wanted the split then each box could be designed to match its purpose.
4 - I do not feel strongly about the fields to include. My position is that the infobox should be for health care consumers and my supporting argument is that the majority audience for this content is that audience. The fields you criticize are consumer fields, and I think they are candidates for inclusion, but I recognize that because of limited space and quality concerns only the best options should be included. Right now I do not even know what all the consumer information options are. I might suggest that we identify all options then choose the best five or so.
You raise good points. I do not have thoughtful responses, but other people here do. [[User:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ]][[User talk:Bluerasberry|(talk)]] 17:23, 15 June 2015 (UTC)
With drug prices my hope would be to have them added to Wikidata and than allow people to set what country they are in to view their specific countries data. The initial displace will show the range from Wikidata of the lowest and highest prices. Still a lot of work before that is ready to role out. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 09:35, 13 June 2015 (UTC)
I struggle with &quot;price&quot; too, not just for the differences between jurisdictions but the differences even within the US.  Different insurance companies get different actual prices after discounts based on their negotiating power, and different consumers pay very differently based on their specific insurance plan. (our article on Prescription drug prices in the United States is woeful btw and something i have had on my to-do list forever)   What price would be put there?  () 11:13, 13 June 2015 (UTC)
This contains a bunch of pricing info [http://www.drugs.com/monograph/metoprolol-succinate.html] plus I have all the pricing info from Doctors Without Borders that they update yearly. But as I said this is a long way from being ready to be rolled out. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 12:35, 13 June 2015 (UTC)
I'd assumed that &quot;price&quot; would either be an average actual cost (not the out of pocket expense for an individual consumer) or a general category (think &quot;$$$$&quot; on a restaurant review).  For the average actual cost, there are several data sources available per country.   () 16:34, 13 June 2015 (UTC)
u|Doc James]] that drugs.com page says: &quot;This pricing information is subject to change at the sole discretion of DS Pharmacy. This pricing information was updated 02/2014. Actual costs to patients will vary depending on the use of specific retail or mail-order locations and health insurance copays.&quot;  Seems random to me.  I don't understand what a single number in that field would mean.  () 16:57, 13 June 2015 (UTC)
an approximation as to cost (would be its meaning)-- () 17:06, 13 June 2015 (UTC)
I know I'm not part of this project but it's on my watchlist. I strongly disagree that a price for drugs should be included in an infobox for several reasons. First, drug prices are not static and they aren't the same around the world, let alone in the US. This means that any value will be inaccurate for some - perhaps many - readers and therefore meaningless to them. An approximation that isn't accurate is not useful. Second, an infobox is supposed to summarise the article information and the cost of drug production along with how the price is determined isn't a part of these articles. Finally, broad categories (like restaurant costs) aren't much better than a specific value. Since the approximations are not accurate, comparing them isn't meaningful. Even if they could be compared, the range of drug costs is so great that there is no good, easily understandable value scale. For example, aspirin costs pennies per dose while chemotherapy drugs can cost thousands of dollars. I guess you could use a logarithmic scale but that's not easy for most people to understand.  () 20:00, 13 June 2015 (UTC)
Agree pricing info is completely unsuitable for an infox. I'm dubious about the general approach adopted in this draft, as infoboxes are only suitable for clear, uncomplicated information without caveats or conditions.  () 20:16, 13 June 2015 (UTC) 
, your statement comparing aspirin to the most expensive drugs is exactly what I believe our articles should contain.  If a drug is cheap, like aspirin, then we ought to say so.  Prices That's proper encyclopedic information.  Similarly, if it's astonishingly expensive, like Eculizumab, then we ought to say so, too.  We don't need to provide exact prices, but a range from &quot;inexpensive&quot; through &quot;pricey&quot; and to (or beyond) &quot;mortgage your house&quot; would be appropriate encyclopedic information.  
Furthermore, if information about the costs of these manufactured goods aren't present in the article, then we're violating  with our healthcare (or anti-business) bias and need to change that.  Drugs are things – things that get made by businesses and sold for money to people who use them.  An encyclopedia article about things should say what they are, how they're made, who makes them, and how they're sold, marketed, distributed, used, and disposed of.  Maybe we need to update MEDMOS#Drugs to explicitly recommend content about manufacturing and selling these things that do, in fact, get manufactured and sold.   () 01:13, 15 June 2015 (UTC)
No other kind of article in WP regularly discusses the prices at a per-purchase level.  Our article on Meat doesn't give the price/lb of chicken breasts; our article on chickens doesn't give the price slaughterhouses pay for birds; our article on milk doesn't give the price of a gallon of 2%; our article on the Chevrolet Camaro doesn't give the MSRP much less what you get at a dealer; the T-mobile article doesn't tell me how much an iphone costs me nor a cell phone plan.  This proposal is deeply awry from my perspective.   Something like annual worldwide sales of a drug (or maybe even broken down country by country but that is hard info to find) would be maybe more workable and more encyclopedic.  I am not understanding this at all.  () 02:18, 15 June 2015 (UTC) 
 I'd have thought that it would be well-nigh impossible to find sourcing for drug prices beyond &quot;recouping r&amp;d and clinical trials costs&quot;. Pharmacy companies keep their drug costing formulae secret. More important than the exact price is whether or not a drug is patented or available in generic form. Drugs under patent always cost more than generics, after all, and the difference between those prices is significant. 
Drug prices change, and they're different from country to country and even within the US, which makes the information unsuitable for a global encyclopaedia, as I've outlined above. Even if you could find a reliable source for worldwide drug pricing that could be automatically updated (because otherwise price information will be time-consuming to maintain), Wikipedia articles don't typically include the price of the widgets in the articles on those widgets. If a drug is just another kind of widget, then its price doesn't belong in the its article.  () 02:27, 15 June 2015 (UTC) (updated 04:59, 15 June 2015 (UTC))
, why would you expect an article about a telecommunications carrier to tell you what the price of a particular telephone is?  If you want to know the price of an iPhone, don't look at T-Mobile.  Look at iPhone, where you will find quite extensive information about the prices of various models over time.  You will also find that the very broad article Personal computer#Average selling price has a solid paragraph about the average cost of computers sold with Microsoft Windows installed.  Kindle Fire covers pricing in significant detail in the lead.  IPad#iPad series has the launch price for every single iPad listed in the table.  We even have extensive information on how much electricity costs around the world.  There are hundreds, if not many thousands, of similar examples in articles.  I had no trouble finding these at all.
Wikipedia clearly does list prices at the per-purchase level, and I really see no reason why we shouldn't give some indication of per-purchase costs for some drugs (when we have decent sources, and some are listed above).  I have not yet heard a single good reason for us to withhold the fact that aspirin and ibuprofen are cheaper NSAIDs than celecoxib.  It's true everywhere in the world, and it's relevant to a wide variety of users, including healthcare professionals, patients, economists, policymakers, students, and potential investors.  The exact prices change over time and may vary by country, but aspirin is never more expensive than any COX-2 inhibitor.  So why should we omit that information?   () 06:26, 15 June 2015 (UTC)
WAID makes a very good point, even further, readers would (logic dictates) be more interested in their health than other things (cars, phones, etc) with regards to pricing, in this case medication-- () 09:39, 15 June 2015 (UTC)
 Yes when it comes to pricing one needs to state the 1) year 2) company selling it 3) country in which it is sold 4) dose / amount. But this is no different than other consumer products. The price of milk in different parts of the world is exceedingly interesting and definitely deserves mention (we in Canada have some of the highest prices as we have three companies that have formed a monopoly and are protected by government tariffs of 300%). The US has much less expensive dairy.

For the iPhone we state &quot;The two initial models, a 4 GB model priced at US$499 and an 8 GB model at US$599 (both requiring a 2-year contract), went on sale in the United States on June 29, 2007&quot; When people are reading about hep C treatments the fact that costs vary from $20,000 to $100,000 depending on which option is chosen and were in the world is important. It is important for policy makers as well as people paying for it themselves. Those who have coverage / government supplied medical should know just how much money is being paid on their behalf. 

Initially we need to more consistently have a section under society and culture that discusses cost. I would like this sort of data on Wikidata. There would be a drop down menu to select the country by flag. With respect to others paying a part of the price, this does not mean that a price is not being paid in the end. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 11:01, 15 June 2015 (UTC)

Doc James and WAID first i hear you - I do - on the &quot;this is very expensive&quot; vs &quot;this is very cheap&quot; thing, as well as the importance of economics to everything.  There is a lot of important and hard-to-sort out &quot;stuff&quot;  about drug pricing - like why the generics market in the US remains so broken even though it is meant to be as raw competition-based as you can get in such a regulated field.  Why are there ever [http://www.dallasnews.com/investigations/problem-solver/20121227-fda-says-shortage-of-drug-for-attention-deficit-is-resolved.ece shortages for generic drugs with strong demand] and why would [http://blogs.wsj.com/pharmalot/2015/04/14/feds-to-probe-impact-of-price-increases-of-generic-drugs-on-medicaid/ the price of generic drugs increase faster than inflation]?  Not to mention issues that happen with proprietary drugs like the [http://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2014/09/26/david-lock-avastin-and-lucentis-its-time-for-nhs-commissioners-to-act-rationally/ the avastin vs lucentis debate] in the UK. 
 i could live with nuanced/exact content like Doc James suggests, but even with that,  there is still tons of meaningful variation -- see [http://www.nyc.gov/html/records/pdf/govpub/859prescdrugs.pdf this report] from the NYC govt on prices for common drugs at pharmacies in NYC - p iii in the printed number, p 7 of the pdf has a summary chart.  Example for those who don't want to click: &quot;The Bronx: the highest cash price obtained for a month’s supply of Celebrex was $102.00, while the lowest was $60.19 — resulting in a $41.81 difference.&quot;  The data is very heterogenous.  
 And in any case, what you are describing Doc James, is very far from slap-a-number-on-it &quot;infobox&quot; kind of content.  Actual drug prices for payors and the final price for patients in the US are very hard to sort out; I believe (but am not sure) that countries with universal health care are much, much easier and you can say more meaningful high level things.  To get that kind of data and keep it up to date we would need some kind of data feed.   I don't know where we could get that.  IMS Health is a famous source of that kind of data but I don't imagine they would donate it.  Worth asking? 
 in general our content on the nuts and bolts of providing health care is pretty weak, as we have discussed before. I recently met a young woman who just got her PhD in Medical anthropology, a discipline I didn't even know existed. I wonder how we could attract more of them and more experts in Health economics...  () 14:18, 15 June 2015 (UTC)
I completely agree that information regarding drug pricing must be included in the body of the article and that drug pricing isn't something that can be completely and accurately summarized with a single number in an infobox. If it isn't possible to find one single price for a drug within one small region (the Bronx, in the example above), how can including one single price in an infobox be anything but misleading? The same problem exists even if ranges are used: if, say, the range break is $100, would Celebrex fall into the $100+ range or the &lt;$100 range? No matter which range it was given the article, the information will be misleading. Including misleading information is worse than including no information. Instead of trying to put this information into an infobox, why not focus on adding costing and pricing information to the article body?  () 15:34, 15 June 2015 (UTC)
There's no need to provide retail prices for every neighborhood, and it wouldn't be encyclopedic even if it were easy to do.  For the US, we should use something like Medicaid's [http://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-Information/By-Topics/Benefits/Prescription-Drugs/Pharmacy-Pricing.html National Average Drug Acquisition Cost] (which is updated weekly and monthly) to find average costs on a national scale, produced by experts in the subject.  Go download the latest data set from Medicaid and look at it:  In the US, the average cost of celecoxib (generic) last week was 57¢ for 50 mg, $1.10 each for 100 mg, $1.77 each for 200 mg, and $2.69 each for 400 mg.  The brand name was more expensive than the generic.  And look again:  Standard 325 mg aspirin pills cost about 1.0 to 1.5¢ each last week, and what used to be called &quot;baby aspirin&quot; cost 2.7¢ each.  There are several ways to present that information; one is a table for each dose, showing prices for multiple countries.  Another is a statement of the range (&quot;from 57¢ to $2.69 per pill, depending on dose&quot;).  We could provide a general summary (&quot;usually about a dollar or so, depending upon dose&quot;) or a comparison (&quot;A celecoxib pill is approximately 100 times more expensive than an aspirin&quot;).  
But my point is that high-quality and very detailed information really does exist about prices for drugs, no matter what you read in magazines about it all being very hush-hush.  There are 23,000 lines in that spreadsheet, so I expect that it covers more than one thousand different drugs.  The US is not the only country on Earth that produces that information.  We should be including that information. 
(Doc James, if you want a data feed, I'd start with Medicaid's dataset.  It appears to be set up for automated processing.)  () 01:49, 16 June 2015 (UTC)
Nice find WAID; I didn't know that existed.  Much better than IMF.  () 11:39, 16 June 2015 (UTC)
If, as with some cancer drugs, the cost is exceptionally high, placing them out of reach of many patients even in the West, and that has been the subject of RS (it need not always be MEDRS-compliant) coverage, then certainly that should be added, in a section in the text. In England these matters are done in public in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence approval process, generating lots of RS coverage in some cases.  Equally that aspirin is dirt cheap can easily be referenced. But I think we should avoid saying much about the mass of mid-price drugs, for the reasons set out above, plus the need (which we may not be able to cope with) to update when they come off-patent etc.  We should just cover the extremes.  () 15:51, 15 June 2015 (UTC)
 I agree with John's earlier point that information in infoboxes needs to be clear-cut and free from nuances. From that perspective drug prices simply aren't suitable for inclusion in an infobox. It would be possible to write something about them in the body of an article, where variations between and within countries could be discussed, but I would urge caution in terms of quoting values because of the potential for such information to go out-of-date. At present we only have agreement to use Wikidata values in infoboxes on the English Wikipedia, and Wikidata does not yet allow the storage of data that has units (which obviously includes cost). At some point in the future, we may be able to have automatically updating price information in the body of an article, but I'm afraid we're still quite some way short of that ambition right now. -- () 17:31, 15 June 2015 (UTC)
The idea of having an up-to-date dataset of prices by location / currency / dose / amount as a Wikidata item that then could be loaded into a dropdown menu in an infobox is very appealing, but it doesn’t make sense to have a price header before we have that Wikidata aspect completed, as the prices would be widely off for the many reasons stated above. If people are interested in pursuing the discussion of price data on Wikidata in the context of this infobox or health, I would be interested in participating in that discussion, but it might be more useful to branch that off into WikiData Talk page or a separate section of this page or perhaps other WikiProjects (?)

An artist could produce a unique portrait using multiple references, though, without being in violation, so long as the finished piece is unique and not a copy of any of the references. To do this would probably take a considerable amount of time (especially from someone like myself who does not do portraits often). Plus, &quot;uniqueness&quot; is somewhat open to interpretation and that is where the risk comes in. Should the copywrite holder of any photograph deem the piece to be too much like his/her material, the artist is likely to have to prove in court that it is not. Regardless of the outcome, it would be costly to have to build a case and go to court. This case is a good example: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_%22Hope%22_poster Obama 'Hope' Poster].  () 00:17, 13 June 2015 (UTC)

No medical references in &quot;addiction&quot; articles listed in [[:Category:Behavioral addiction]]
 - nothing sketchy or entirely unsourced remaining. [[User:Seppi333|Seppi333]] () 10:40, 22 June 2015 (UTC)


I'm still working on addressing the ambiguity in a number of articles in which dependence and addiction are used interchangeably, so I don't really have the desire to salvage any article content which I find blatantly stupid and which lacks medical citations. 

That said, I started to sifting through [[:Category:Addiction]] and [[:Category:Behavioral addiction]] to fix any incorrect categorization of dependence/addiction topics and noticed a number of unusual addiction entries involving various behaviors in the latter category.  I've just started to work through these - the three 4 I've gone through so far had a complete lack of reliable medical references. In particular:

;Articles with addressed issues
#Virtual reality addiction (somewhat new) - I deleted all the text and redirected to video game addiction. 
#Love addiction - there's only one MEDRS-quality review on this topic on pubmed and it concluded that current evidence doesn't support this addiction model; I ended up [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Love_addiction&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=666948958&amp;oldid=665517730 deleting most of the article], as it contained a large number of medical claims without medical citations. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=%22Love+addiction%22 Pubmed reviews containing that term] 
#Sex and love addiction - I read a few sentences in this article, looked at the refs, and then deleted all the text + replaced it with a redirect to love addiction for the reasoning in [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sex_and_love_addiction&amp;diff=666948604&amp;oldid=646385956 my edit summary]. 
#Information addiction - ed for reasons listed in the prod template redirected to Internet addiction as suggestion in the discussion below
#Television addiction - minor copyedits + added medical review.  Should be ok now.
#Hypermobility (travel) - deleted every medical claim/citation to it. Removed from category. No pubmed coverage
#Compulsive talking - deleted relevant text associated with an addiction. Removed from category. Left  there. No pubmed coverage
#Workaholic - deleted statements / citations relevant to addictions/medical claims. Removed from category. Left  there.


I could probably use some help sorting through these categories since I doubt the lack of medical referencing is confined to just these articles... 

;Articles that appear ok
* Problem gambling
* Sex addiction
* Sugar addiction
* Behavioral addiction
* Pornography addiction

Other articles in the category that aren't listed above may still have problems.

Kumdang-2

This article was recently created after North Korea claimed it cures all sorts of diseases--&quot;including AIDS, SARS, Ebola, skin rashes, diabetes, impotence, liver disorders, venereal disease, drug addiction, various cancers and tuberculosis.&quot; [http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/06/19/415832033/north-korea-announces-cure-for-mers-as-if] It has been tagged as needing more medical references, but I don't think there are any peer-reviewed papers that could be used as sources here. I am posting here because I'm not sure how we should present NK's claims of effectiveness regarding this drug, or even if we should have an article on it at all. [[User:Everymorning|Everymorning]] [[User talk:Everymorning|talk]] 22:07, 20 June 2015 (UTC)
I removed the tag, there are no medical claims in the article as is. It only states that NK claims this. I'd be almost surprised if the medical community even took time to refute it.-- [[User:CFCF|CFCF]]  () 22:26, 20 June 2015 (UTC)

Historical content subject to MEDRS?

At Kombucha, it is being claimed that &quot;[Kombucha] was prized 220 BC during the Tsin Dynasty for its detoxifying and energizing properties&quot; is a biomedical claim and therefore subject to MEDRS. I was hoping to get some clarity on this. Thanks,  [[User:Petrarchan47|petrarchan47]][[User talk:Petrarchan47|คุ]][[Special:Contributions/Petrarchan47|ก]] 06:45, 21 June 2015 (UTC)
(Note: this has also been raised at ) From the opening of MEDRS: &quot;it is vital that the biomedical information in all types of articles be based on reliable, third-party, published secondary sources and accurately reflect current medical knowledge&quot; (my bold). So while of course it's fine to detail historical information according to our general s, care needs to taken to ensure anything which bears on current medical knowledge is properly sourced. Otherwise we have problems with statements of the type &quot;in the 1950s, there were many successful reports of the use of rife machines to cure cancer&quot;, which from time to time have been attempted with the justification that historical observations don't need MEDRS.  () 06:59, 21 June 2015 (UTC)
Sticking to the matter at hand, &quot;Kombucha was prized 220 BC during the Tsin Dynasty for its detoxifying and energizing properties&quot; bears on 220 BC, nothing current about it. I'd be interested to hear from others, as I am pretty sure you are either not understanding this guideline, or are misusing it.  [[User:Petrarchan47|petrarchan47]][[User talk:Petrarchan47|คุ]][[Special:Contributions/Petrarchan47|ก]] 07:07, 21 June 2015 (UTC)
It's fine so long as it's clearly stated as being knowledge relevant to that time, i.e., &quot;for its ... properties&quot; is not acceptable.  Instead, what would be is &quot;for the detoxifying and energizing properties which it was thought to possess at that time&quot; is.  The former represents currency in the medical portion of that statement.  The latter does not. [[User:Seppi333|Seppi333]] () 07:19, 21 June 2015 (UTC)

Why doesn't [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kombucha&amp;diff=667823334&amp;oldid=667812405 this] edit solve the issue?  By last count this very small wording issue is now being discussed at the article Talk page, NPOVN, and here.  Why is this still being discussed? [[User:Zad68|Zad]][[User_Talk:Zad68|68]] 15:03, 21 June 2015 (UTC)
The edit was reverted for being POV (that's why it went to the NPOV NB). It was claimed at that NB that the statement required MEDRS, so it seemed this project talk page would be the best place to get clarity on this. This thread isn't about solving the issue, it's about helping me to understand the MEDRS guideline. My question is specific:  how does a statement about the beliefs of people in 220 BC - taken straight from the review - fall under the &quot;biomedical information&quot; category when it is clearly ancient history? This has nothing to do with POV, and it's doubtful people at the NPOV NB have a better understanding of MEDRS than the folks here. Does this make sense? If there is a better way to handle these separate concerns, let me know. MEDRS is not a very well understood or accessible guideline. In fact it has been suggested that a tutorial on MEDRS would be helpful, since it is causing a lot of confusion and making it difficult for non &quot;medical editors&quot; to participate in article building the way we did a few years ago.  [[User:Petrarchan47|petrarchan47]][[User talk:Petrarchan47|คุ]][[Special:Contributions/Petrarchan47|ก]] 15:58, 21 June 2015 (UTC)
I don't think that this falls under MEDRS at all.  Alexbrn's edit (which is still in the article) makes it a little clearer (although it probably needs to lose the scare quotes), but &quot;what people believed 2200 years ago&quot; is not .  This kind of information should come from a history book.  And before anyone asks, antique claims that something &quot;rectifies the humours&quot; also do not constitute biomedical information.

Ease of use is important for simply getting it introduced, but it should promptly be replaced by substituting a more substantial citation that provides robust redundancy against error, vandalism, etc. In most cases  is the best answer for WPMED, though some editors would disagree. Even one other parameter, such as  vastly improves the robustness of the citation. [[User talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl!]] 21:01, 22 June 2015 (UTC)
this is a template for talk pages, not articles.  Cite templates aren't even relevant to the discussion. [[User:Seppi333|Seppi333]] () 01:00, 23 June 2015 (UTC)
 Exactly. This template was never intended to be used in articles.  Only on talk pages where a short link to a in-text citation is adequate to get the point across and where including a full citation might be overkill.  () 16:03, 23 June 2015 (UTC)
It is used in article space though. If there is a bot that would auto replace this template when used in mainspace I would support keeping it. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 10:50, 24 June 2015 (UTC)
 As far as I can tell, this template has only been used in a single article, Veganism compared to the dozens of uses on talk pages.  It probably is not worth the effort to write a bot script to detect a highly unlikely occurrence.  However it is straight forward to detect which  this template is included (see for example ), and if it is used in article space, it would display an error message (for example PMID3 error, this template should not be used in articles). Combined with the following caution on the  template documentation page:
 or equivalent instead.
 should be enough to deter most editors from including this  template in article space. Would this be sufficient?   () 12:09, 24 June 2015 (UTC)

Well, sure, but why bother? This template has 50ish transclusions and was used in one article with otherwise manually formatted citations. The problem being solved here is....? The odd article or two might have citations in a slightly unusual format? This discussion plus the TfD must be more words than the collective set of talk page posts using this template. Yes, I know I'm making it worse... ;)   () 00:02, 25 June 2015 (UTC)
 I think I will soon nominate this template for the   ;-)  In any case, I have now added code to generate an error message if the template is used in an article.  I have also added support for multiple PMIDs, something that the PMID magic word does not do.  These changes should address the two major arguments that have been raised against the template, overlinking and that the template is redundant.  () 05:48, 25 June 2015 (UTC)
The multi-PMID function is a great idea. In a non-lame world I'd complain about generating unnecessary errors in mainspace, but I can live with a red bike shed.  () 09:07, 25 June 2015 (UTC)
 Almost everyone who'd supported deletion has now changed to neutral or keep, and keep has a truckload of support.  I think a bold admin could close this. (•) 12:46, 25 June 2015 (UTC)
