New article that may be of interest, these are the people trying to derail the All Trials initiative by launching a judicial review of new rules mandating increased transparency in clinical trials. What's the Wiki markup for evil? Guy (Help!) 15:33, 8 July 2015 (UTC)
AllTrials calls for all past and present clinical trials to be registered and their full methods and summary results reported... The Declaration of Helsinki, which is the World Medical Association‚Äôs statement of principles for medical research involving people, states that every investigator running a clinical trial should register it and report its results [http://www.alltrials.net/find-out-more/all-trials/] ...makes you wonder what Richmond Pharmacology might have in mind??

Scope and name is 100% up to the bona fide participants in that group.  Any group of volunteers, including a group that calls themselves a &quot;WikiProject&quot;, gets to decide what articles they do or don't want to work on, without consulting any other group.

One-click archiving

 fwiw I am not a big fan of one-click archiving as it causes Watchlist clutter.  There is a bot archiving this page, shall we quicken its cycle? Jytdog (talk) 12:51, 10 July 2015 (UTC)
I concur w/ Jytdog--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 13:20, 10 July 2015 (UTC)
I've already quickened the cycle to 7 days. But unfortunately I think we'll have to live with archiving. Ozzie asked me if we should give editors more time to reply to questions, but I don't think that is going to help. We're getting few responses because we simply have too many discussions going at the same time. It's off-putting who don't know or want to look through every diff to see what discussion has been updated lately. That and it's increasingly tedious for experienced editors as well.
If I'm gone for just the few hours a night I need sleep (being in Europe my sleep coincides with some the most active hours of many American Wikipedians), I find myself falling behind and frankly ignoring too much of the discussion.
I realize there is no quick fix, but rather that we need a new forum system, but the easiest way to alleviate the situation is to archive discussions that have been resolved, that and posting fewer frivolous posts as well. With the current talk-page system I don't know what else we can be done. -- CFCF üçå () 15:44, 10 July 2015 (UTC)

InfoBox for a Syndrome?



I recently edited the article on Heyde's syndrome and I would like to add an infobox to it, the problem is that it isn't a 'disease' with links in any online databases that I can add. It is a syndrome with an established pathophysiology that occurs in about 3% of folks with aortic stenosis. Is it appropriate to co opt the disease info box and just not include any links to online sources? Michael Dacre (talk -  - ) 19:48, 6 July 2015 (UTC)

This specific edit is quite poor and there is no explanation why these foods are good. I'm not totally adverse to using Mayo clinic as a source, but not here. -- CFCF üçå () 10:38, 9 July 2015 (UTC)
I think that an explanation of why these foods are good (Vitamins A and E plus Zinc is what I'm guessing from a quick look at the list) would be better.  The source is technically reliable for the statement that is being made, but we can do better than that.  I'd probably leave it until it could be replaced with something better.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 00:36, 10 July 2015 (UTC)

Collaboration
Obviously this is a popular health practice and not science. Readers demand this sort of content. I wish that it could be included, but somehow sectioned to be labeled as folk medicine.
I met someone from Mayo Clinic's communication department at a conference. I proposed collaboration. They said write something up. I do not have any particular proposal handy - if someone has ideas then please post them.
We have discussed here previously that Google pays Mayo Clinic for their disease fact boxes, which are adapted into Knowledge Graph. If left to my own, probably what I will propose is some collaboration between May Clinic's fact boxes and Wikidata / Wikipedia, since this is a major commitment by Mayo Clinic and something relevant to Wikipedia's future in automated translation. A presumption behind this collaboration would be that information from Mayo Clinic should go into Wikipedia while being sourced to Mayo Clinic's authority.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 13:52, 9 July 2015 (UTC)
Mayo clinic information is not very good. Thus I am not very keen to work with them. There are much better sources and organizations that are interested in working with us such as Cochrane and USPSTF. If people have extra energy would recommend improving those collaborations.

Translation from other languages into English

This is a note to follow up on a previous promise:  the Content Translation tool is now available to translate from other Wikipedia into English.  To turn it on, just go to , scroll to the end, and tick the button.  It seems like en.wp already has everything, but approximately half of the pages at the German Wikipedia have no counterpart here.

I'm having a problem with it giving me a blank screen when I start.  It usually goes away if you reload the page.  There have also been a couple of reports of it refusing to save, which is highly frustrating.  I'm talking to someone on that team to see if we can sort out what's causing the blank-screen problem.  So keep in mind that it's a beta feature and will have some bugs and limitations, but feel free to try it out.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 20:29, 10 July 2015 (UTC)

New Cochrane Bot

Why? :)overleg 23:50, 6 July 2015 (UTC)
This seems really helpful, but maybe it should just place the articles in a hidden category instead of using a reader-facing inline tag. The &quot;needs update&quot; tag - and especially the fact that it links to  - makes it sound like the information in the preceding sentence is actually, definitively out of date, rather than that the reference itself has a new version (which quite likely still supports the text). Opabinia regalis (talk) 00:04, 7 July 2015 (UTC)
It needs updating in that their is a newer systematic review by the same group on the same topic. We should notify our readers that a new review is available so they can at least look at it. Updating is not that hard. And most of the time the conclusions do not change. Doc James (talk ¬∑  ¬∑ ) 03:52, 9 July 2015 (UTC)

WikiProject Medicine Collaboration of the Month

Hello all,

I just wanted to announce my plan to relaunch the . The collaboration  to the Wikiproject - and in fact tomorrow, July 27th will mark the 10th year anniversary since the collaboration started. It really is a good project idea, but it needs more people to come together and help make it work. What I would like is for people to visit the collaboration page and vote on the current nominations (or make your own) for next months project. In addition, I hope people will dedicate some of their editing time to the future selected articles. 

Any thoughts, questions, and concerns are valued. Peter.C ‚Ä¢ talk ‚Ä¢  18:51, 26 July 2015 (UTC)
great idea...I think it should 1. be an article that needs a lot of attention not an article that's fine (articles that need expert attention page [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Medicine_articles_needing_expert_attention])...2. there should be a list or award each month for the top 3 collaborations (to motivate editors)--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 18:54, 26 July 2015 (UTC)
 1. I agree as long as it is not an article &quot;too far in the weeds&quot; (ie. very technical and niche) 2. In the past this has not been done because I believe the reward was to have another GA under your belt at the end of it. How would the &quot;top three&quot; be chosen? Edit count? - Also of note, depending on the amount of people we have editing, we might need to use IRC to communicate to prevent edit conflicts. Peter.C ‚Ä¢ talk ‚Ä¢  19:22, 26 July 2015 (UTC)
If you only edit sections then edit conflicts tend to happen as much. Matthew Ferguson (talk) 19:24, 26 July 2015 (UTC)
 I think IRC could be a good idea, but not because we run risk of edit conflicts. If we make it a monthly collaboration it won't really be a problem unless everyone starts editing the first day and then doesn't do anything more. I don't really think we need motivators either, all we need is for someone to take the lead and organize  it each month. I'm more than willing to help out. -- CFCF üçå () 19:33, 26 July 2015 (UTC)
Human nutrition could be a good candidate, since that was just mentioned above as needing a lot of work. Sunrise (talk) 01:06, 27 July 2015 (UTC)
I think we should work on engaging users more throughout the month to try to motivate them to do work with the other community members. In the past few weeks Ozzie and I have started something like this where they will help me with something, in turn I help them, and this has led to a lot of great work on myasthenia gravis over the course of a week, and various smaller articles for brief periods. This whole collaboration is meant to engage the entire wikiproject to work improve an article - how can we do so if everyone works independently? Perhaps we should make a to do list for each article in the first day or two and then people can sign up for tasks and ask for assistance from others? Any thoughts, questions or concerns about this or have any other specific ideas? Peter.C ‚Ä¢ talk ‚Ä¢  01:09, 28 July 2015 (UTC)
Naturally if someone were to organize things better there would be a better result, yes . Matthew Ferguson (talk) 05:51, 28 July 2015 (UTC)

So I often use Harrison's principles of internal medicine as a reference. But I can never seem to be able to add the ISBN number and get all the info about the book when I click the little magnifying glass.

As helpful as it is to suggest VisualEditor when someone is reporting a reproducible bug in existing tools, maybe we could try to solve the actual problem?
Looks like reftoolbar isn't indexing this particular book correctly, and it's not clear why.

We tried several different formats of ISBN, to no effect.
Eventually I just wrote  which will call  for you with the appropriate data, and takes the page=, pages=, and chapter= parameters.
If this is ever fixed, we can remove the template, but for now it's a handy shortcut to work around a bug in the software. I'll carry on to attempt to find a way to fix the bug upstream in the meantime. --MarkTraceur (talk) 13:53, 28 July 2015 (UTC)

 The &quot;little magnifying glass&quot; is the icon that appears next to the ISBN field in the  cite/book graphical user interface.

mass deworming

Just a heads-up, we decided to begin a new page on mass deworming to split from Helminthiasis and to keep deworming for animals, as the existing editors there had expressed a preference for that. The whole topic is difficult as there is a lot of controversy about recent trials, data re-analysis and a Cochrane review. My view is that the page should be covered by  but it is likely to be edited by those who want to talk about particular trials (which were not included in the Cochrane review) and which give different results.

Writing simply

I've been looking into the ledes of some of our major articles, and even the lede of a much read article such as abortion has been very difficult. I managed to decrease the reading grade from 11.8 to 9.3 according to https://readability-score.com , but I think this is something we need to look at generally. All of the edits I've done might not be perfect here but I've found a number of good guides on how to write health information for the general public.
*http://www.institute.nhs.uk/quality_and_service_improvement_tools/quality_and_service_improvement_tools/patient_information.html
*http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/etr.html
*http://www.cdc.gov/healthliteracy/pdf/Simply_Put.pdf
I know this has been brought up before, but I think it's time to really try and do something about it. If anyone else has anything to add or maybe any suggestions on how to improve  feel free to add it here.

Best, -- CFCF üçå () 02:33, 26 July 2015 (UTC)

Careful though with this guidance, Wikipedia is not a patient information leaflet. Matthew Ferguson (talk) 05:33, 26 July 2015 (UTC)
Well yes, and I wouldn't go about following these slavishly, but they are good resources. Especially the third one from the CDC seems to be very useful. -- CFCF üçå ()
 Nevertheless, Wikipedia's biggest failing compared to other encyclopedias has been shown to be the relatively high level of reading comprehension needed for many articles. Any increase in the readability of our articles benefits not just younger readers but also readers whose first language is not English and who have no article available in their mother tongue. WPMED (James and CF in particular) have made great efforts in translations, but there will always exist a need for our articles to be understood by people who find reading English difficult. Perhaps the needs of that audience are even more pertinent to medical articles and MEDMOS might be updated to make that point? --RexxS (talk) 08:43, 26 July 2015 (UTC)
What do people think of this revert [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Overactive_bladder&amp;curid=8762115&amp;diff=673104207&amp;oldid=673090405]? Yes work to make our content simpler is important. Our MOS says &quot;The leads of articles, if not the entire article, should be written as simply as possible without introducing errors.&quot; Doc James (talk ¬∑  ¬∑ ) 09:25, 26 July 2015 (UTC)
In this the colloquialism might be regional and not used in some parts. It's difficult. Matthew Ferguson (talk) 09:33, 26 July 2015 (UTC)
Agree simplification is difficult. Doc James (talk ¬∑  ¬∑ ) 09:44, 26 July 2015 (UTC)
 The problem is that we say what we want, but we don't explain how to do it. I'll try and read up on the sources and see if there are any general rules that could be useful for us. ( to be written once I have time) -- CFCF üçå () 12:12, 26 July 2015 (UTC)
yet, a necessary &quot;article element&quot; to help the common reader--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 12:07, 26 July 2015 (UTC)
Regarding Doc Jame's specific reversion, there are two issues.  1) An editor had changed the wording of cited quotations, and this needs to be reverted regardless of understandability.  2)  While &quot;pee&quot;, or &quot;piss&quot; may be more commonly used than &quot;urine&quot; or &quot;urinate&quot;, &quot;urine&quot; is widely understood.  &quot;Voiding&quot; is probably not understood much outside the medical community, and &quot;void&quot; also has other meanings, so it probably should be explained at first use.--Wikimedes (talk) 17:43, 27 July 2015 (UTC)

*We should definitely encourage simplicity, but not at the cost of discouraging editors from writing at all.  Writing simply is actually harder than writing technically.  Also it frequently happens when unskilled writers try to write simply that they end up writing inaccurately -- that's worse than complexity.  Wikipedia depends on encouraging editors to do as much as they are capable of doing -- not more. Looie496 (talk) 12:43, 26 July 2015 (UTC)
A few rules of simple include: use short sentences, try to have only one idea per sentence, use simpler words. Some rules of simplification make our content too &quot;how to&quot; and thus I do not follow them. Doc James (talk ¬∑  ¬∑ ) 01:41, 27 July 2015 (UTC)
I find that using a subject-verb-object pattern, avoiding the passive voice, and using shorter, more common words makes for writing that is more pointful and powerful.  More people fully grasp the meaning of a direct statement like &quot;Most babies with Scary Genetic Disease die in less than one year&quot; than from &quot;The median patient with Scary Genetic Disease has a survival time of less than one year&quot;.  
I've been reading a lot recently about oncologists being afraid to tell people that they're going to die, and I've noticed a parallel in Wikipedia's writing.  We're not trying to be optimistic (or to postpone a long and probably tearful session until a more convenient time, because I've got another sick patient in the next room who also needs me right now), but we do mimic the detached, passive, emotion-avoiding style that these people use.  One example of this is that we talk about survival times rather than death.  We also tend to ignore questions of quality of life and practical prognosis.  Another example:  We tend not to mention the practical burden of chronic diseases or life-long treatment.  Diabetics need to plan every meal and every drug for the rest of their lives.  If dinner is served late at a party, or if your friends at work take too long to get out the door for a group lunch, then it can cause immediate problems.  People with fatigue or pain issues often need part-time jobs.  People with kidney or liver problems may not be able to take the most effective drugs for other conditions.  I find that when I try to write in simple language, that I think more clearly about a condition; when I think more clearly about a condition, then these practical realities become more obvious to me.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 15:39, 27 July 2015 (UTC)
While it can take some skill and even artistry to write for a lay audience without losing accuracy, I think this is something to strive for.  Wikipedia is, after all, an encyclopedia, not a journal for medical professionals.  I occasionally try to make medical articles more understandable while maintaining the technical rigor and jargon.  Sometimes this is as simple as including a synonym or short description for the technical terms (e.g. swelling for edema, or &quot;swelling caused by edema&quot;).  Another technique is to have a lead paragraph or sentence in layman's terms to get the general idea across, and then have following paragraphs or sentences fill in the technical details.  Sometimes the opposite order is useful, with the concept expressed succinctly in technical terms followed by a longer explanation in less technical terms.  Other times things are more complicated and artistry comes into play.

I don't think we should discourage editors from writing in either technical or layman's terms, but should continually try to improve articles by adding the missing parts.
-Wikimedes (talk) 17:26, 27 July 2015 (UTC)
Agree strongly with what is written above by several users - it's important for lay readers to be able to understand what we write, not just technically skilled ones. Some specific advice for anatomy articles which can cross over to medicine is provided in the essay . I find the main problem is that whilst we are in agreement here, there are lot of users who lurk who disagree with this, and a gradual trend by IP users passing by to slowly reintroduce removed technical language. --Tom (LT) (talk) 00:00, 28 July 2015 (UTC)

I also agree with user CFCF that the difficult and complexity of articles on many topics is somewhat excessive. Could we address this within WikiProject Medicine somehow? Perhaps a targeted effort to simplify the &quot;top-importance&quot; articles, with a view to removing medical jargon and unnecessary detail, and relegating such content to the appropriate sub-pages. Many of the contributors are researchers and medical professionals, so I don't think we can avoid having many users writing in highly technical ways, but periodically revising articles with a view to simplifying them might be a step in the right direction. Nren4237 (talk) 10:19, 30 July 2015 (UTC)
I think this is an excellent idea . I have been working on simplifying for years. Am specifically concentrating my efforts on the leads of key articles. I do occationally get push back. But the more of us who feel this is important the more success we will have. Doc James (talk ¬∑  ¬∑ ) 13:47, 30 July 2015 (UTC)

CRISPR/ systematic 

[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168165615300419] I deem this a good MEDRS compliant source which can be read (or used) thank you--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 12:51, 29 July 2015 (UTC)

  What is the context and relevance of this post to this project? Systematic analysis ‚â† systemic review.  is a primary source and therefore is clearly not MEDRS compliant.  It is also outside the scope of  therefore  does not apply. Boghog (talk) 13:09, 29 July 2015 (UTC)
CRISPR this article seems to have medical text were it could be useful specifically &quot;Applications&quot; section  (therapeutics) subsection... (it did not say review) ...I hope that answers your question , thanks--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 13:29, 29 July 2015 (UTC)
 The citation is to an experimental method, not an application and therefore not relevant to an applications section nor to this project. Boghog (talk) 13:36, 29 July 2015 (UTC)
I really wish somebody who understands the topic would improve that article on a more basic level.  This has become such an important technique that it really sucks for our article to be so unreadable.  Unfortunately I don't understand the topic well enough to make improvements -- I only realized how poor our article is by trying to read it in order to learn how the technique works. Looie496 (talk) 13:44, 29 July 2015 (UTC)
I would offer the prior answer given (if however for any reason you have a different opinion about this or any reference that's fine)...however I would point out the article in question CRISPR does contain medical information (references) in the sections mentioned above and therefore all articles with medical information are subject to MEDRS...also as Looie496 has indicated the article could also benefit from simpler language for the average reader..IMO. thanks--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 14:03, 29 July 2015 (UTC)
 MEDRS only applies if medical claims are being made. The citation that you mention makes no medical claims and is a primary source. One relatively small part of the CRISPR article (application/therapeutics section) is within the scope of MEDRS, the rest is not.  And it is not true that if one section contains medical information, then MEDRS applies to the whole article. You need to be more discriminate in how you apply MEDRS. Finally I agree with Looie that the article needs improvement. Boghog (talk) 15:15, 29 July 2015 (UTC)
And it is not true that if one section contains medical information, then MEDRS applies to the whole article. this statement was not indicated, what was to be clear is the section (in this case Applications-subsection (therapeutics),.. logic dictates MEDRS would not apply to the whole article--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 15:29, 29 July 2015 (UTC)

This post would have been more relevant on the talk page of the article jnquestion. Matthew Ferguson (talk) 15:21, 29 July 2015 (UTC)

This is a molecular biology technique and should therefore be discussed on  or the article's own talk page. JFW | T@lk 16:24, 29 July 2015 (UTC)

  Agreed that  applies to all articles and one of the things that I pointed out above is that source mentioned at the start of this thread is primary and not secondary.  Concerning CRISPR, this article is more within the scope of  where  applies. I just get a little irritated when MEDRS is indiscriminately invoked. Boghog (talk) 22:47, 29 July 2015 (UTC)

Horner's?

Last year, an IP user left [https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File%3AHorner%27s_Syndrome_and_Autonomic_innervation_of_the_eye.svg&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=115785006&amp;oldid=85711410 this message] on the page for our image of how the nervous system is affected in Horner's syndrome. I have no idea whether the complaint is correct.

Is it correct? If so, is anyone able to edit the .svg ? DS (talk) 19:59, 30 July 2015 (UTC)

*--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 23:58, 30 July 2015 (UTC)
To be clear: I don't have medical training. I can't really parse the content in either the complaint or in the cited textbook. In fact, because of the IP user's weak grammar, I'm not sure if the complaint is (X should be portrayed as Y) or (X is portrayed as Y). You might say that I should just look at the image, but when I do, I can't follow the legend. I look at the page you've linked to, and I don't understand it very much. Is the image correct, or is the complaint valid? If the complaint is valid, is there anyone participating in the Medicine wikiproject who's able to edit .svg files?  And if the complaint is not valid, is anyone here willing to remove it from the image? DS (talk) 12:52, 31 July 2015 (UTC)
