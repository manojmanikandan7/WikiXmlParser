 One-click archiving 

|CFCF fwiw I am not a big fan of one-click archiving as it causes Watchlist clutter.  There is a bot archiving this page, shall we quicken its cycle? ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 12:51, 10 July 2015 (UTC)
I concur w/ ser:Jytdog|Jytdog--ser:Ozzie10aaaa|Ozzie10aaaa (ser talk:Ozzie10aaaa|talk) 13:20, 10 July 2015 (UTC)
I've already quickened the cycle to 7 days. But unfortunately I think we'll have to live with archiving. Ozzie asked me if we should give editors more time to reply to questions, but I don't think that is going to help. We're getting few responses because we simply have too many discussions going at the same time. It's off-putting who don't know or want to look through every diff to see what discussion has been updated lately. That and it's increasingly tedious for experienced editors as well.
If I'm gone for just the few hours a night I need sleep (being in Europe my sleep coincides with some the most active hours of many American Wikipedians), I find myself falling behind and frankly ignoring too much of the discussion.
I realize there is no quick fix, but rather that we need a new forum system, but the easiest way to alleviate the situation is to archive discussions that have been resolved, that and posting fewer frivolous posts as well. With the current talk-page system I don't know what else we can be done. -- ser:CFCF|CFCF ser talk:CFCF|üçå (pecial:EmailUser/CFCF|email) 15:44, 10 July 2015 (UTC)

The source is technically reliable for the statement that is being made, but we can do better than that.

Collaboration
Obviously this is a popular health practice and not science. Readers demand this sort of content. I wish that it could be included, but somehow sectioned to be labeled as folk medicine.
I met someone from Mayo Clinic's communication department at a conference. I proposed collaboration. They said write something up. I do not have any particular proposal handy - if someone has ideas then please post them.
We have discussed here previously that Google pays Mayo Clinic for their disease fact boxes, which are adapted into nowledge Graph. If left to my own, probably what I will propose is some collaboration between May Clinic's fact boxes and Wikidata / Wikipedia, since this is a major commitment by Mayo Clinic and something relevant to Wikipedia's future in automated translation. A presumption behind this collaboration would be that information from Mayo Clinic should go into Wikipedia while being sourced to Mayo Clinic's authority. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 13:52, 9 July 2015 (UTC)

 Translation from other languages into English 

This is a note to follow up on a previous promise:  the Content Translation tool is now available to translate from other Wikipedia into English.  To turn it on, just go to pecial:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures, scroll to the end, and tick the button.  It seems like en.wp already has everything, but approximately half of the pages at the German Wikipedia have no counterpart here.

I'm having a problem with it giving me a blank screen when I start.  It usually goes away if you reload the page.  There have also been a couple of reports of it refusing to save, which is highly frustrating.  I'm talking to someone on that team to see if we can sort out what's causing the blank-screen problem.  So keep in mind that it's a beta feature and will have some bugs and limitations, but feel free to try it out.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 20:29, 10 July 2015 (UTC)

This seems really helpful, but maybe it should just place the articles in a hidden category instead of using a reader-facing inline tag. The &quot;needs update&quot; tag - and especially the fact that it links to ikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Dates_and_numbers#Chronological_items|this - makes it sound like the information in the preceding sentence is actually, definitively out of date, rather than that the reference itself has a new version (which quite likely still supports the text). ser:Opabinia regalis|Opabinia regalis (ser talk:Opabinia regalis|talk) 00:04, 7 July 2015 (UTC)
It needs updating in that their is a newer systematic review by the same group on the same topic. We should notify our readers that a new review is available so they can at least look at it.

CAD refers to angina, unstable angina, NSTEMI and STEMI. As the topic is really large having separate articles makes more sense.
NAFLD and NASH are smaller topic and dealing with them together IMO makes sense.
We had NASH redirection to steatohepatitis while steatohepatitis is of two types. alcoholic and nonalcoholic thus it was not the greatest redirect.
I guess there is not one right answer to how to best do this. The two articles had a lot of overlap ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk ¬∑ pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs ¬∑ pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 21:36, 13 July 2015 (UTC)

Blindness
Doc James indicated above that lindness redirects to isual impairment, which surprises me.  It makes sense to discuss blindness, of course, but in a summary style with a link to a main page, not to just lump it all in.  There's a big difference between someone who develops cataracts in old age and someone with no light perception from birth.   Was this discussed anywhere?  I can only find a stale old discussion about merging in information about ow vision ‚Äì but nothing about merging in &quot;no vision&quot;.

Society should talk about training and employment prospects.  There's currently no information about co-morbidities, which also matters.  It's one thing to have a student who is blind, and another thing to have a student who is blind, nearly deaf, autistic, and intellectually disabled.

 Category:Infectious causes of cancer 

Yesterday I wrote an article about a urine polyomavirus|mouse oncovirus and put it in Category:Infectious causes of cancer, which I discovered is currently hosting an odd mix of articles: some are actually about infectious causes of cancer (uman papillomavirus), some are more accurately described as &quot;cancers at least sometimes caused by infectious agents&quot; (ervical cancer), some are semi-related topics that I certainly hope are not infectious causes of cancer (ervical screening), and some are very general articles where the category only applies to some members of the group (irus, arasitism). The category page says it is intended to contain articles in which pathogens are &quot;linked to increasing the risk of cancer in humans&quot;, which is not the same as an infectious cause, and is unnecessarily confined to humans when there are plenty of animal pathogens known to fit this description.

What's the intended scope of this category? At first glance I think the causes and the effects should be separated, moving the actual cancers to something like Category:Cancers with infectious causes, but that's a problem because most of them are only sometimes caused by pathogens, and there are plausible biological mechanisms for lots of cancer types to occasionally be caused by a pathogen. ser:Opabinia regalis|Opabinia regalis (ser talk:Opabinia regalis|talk) 21:39, 8 July 2015 (UTC)

I don't really mind the cat containing information about both pathogens that (sometimes) cause cancer and cancers that are (often) caused by pathogens.  I don't even truly mind including ervical screening, because probably 99% of cervical cancers are caused by viral infections, and the point behind it is very much about identifying cancers caused by said infectious agent.  But the very general articles, e.g., irus, don't seem like a good match.  A person looking for information about infectious causes of cancer might also want information about cervical screening, but is probably not looking for general information about viruses.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 00:30, 10 July 2015 (UTC)
I removed the worst offenders from the category and made the text less anthropocentric. I still think this is terrible organization, but honestly, the software (non-)features for viewing, searching, and sorting categories are so bad that I think they're rarely worth fussing about. ser:Opabinia regalis|Opabinia regalis (ser talk:Opabinia regalis|talk) 00:16, 14 July 2015 (UTC)

If I remember, I believe I was the one who created the category in question. It was not intended to cover cancers in animals. It was meant to simply connect the various causes, effects, links, associations, infections, symptoms, screenings, treatments, risks, diseases, organisms that can be linked to the category. An analogous category might be named: Environmental causes of cancer or Genetic causes of cancer if such information were contained in the article that is part of the category.  The problem with a more accurate title of the category in question is that in some cases there is complete consensus that an infectious agent is the cause of cancer. In other articles, there is a strong link between the infectious agent and cancer.  In other articles, there is an increased risk to develop cancer, In other articles, there is an association between the article topic and cancer.  In other articles there is a synergistic association between one infectious agent and another, for example HPV and AIDS.  Coming up with a better name for the category might be warranted but to include cancer in animals is not really helpful.  That category probably needs to stand on its own.

Sounds like you're going for something more like Category:Associations between infectious agents and human cancers? I entirely disagree that a category called &quot;infectious causes of cancer&quot; should only contain information about humans, which are not the only organisms to get cancer. A huge part of the history of oncovirus research involved animal models for obvious reasons, and species specificity in many of these agents is driven by cell-surface receptors, not by substantial differences in molecular mechanism. ser:Opabinia regalis|Opabinia regalis (ser talk:Opabinia regalis|talk) 08:32, 14 July 2015 (UTC)

The category we are discussing was intended to be anthropocentric. Animal cancers would be a better category for someone looking for information on the topic of cancers of animals.  The purpose of creating this category was to tie together the very diverse articles that describe those cancers that are: 1. caused by infectious agents, 2. that are linked to infectious agents, 3. that are associated with infectious agents, 4. found consistently in cancerous growths, 5. found to have an increased risk of development when infectious agents are present.  In addition this category should be including articles about the vaccines that protect against infections that prevent/reduce cancer by infectious agents.  This category should also contain the history involved in the topic, which has been very controversial but has resulted in Nobel Prizes to at least three recipients who 'discovered' the link between certain infectious agents and cancer.  I understand why other editors balk at the name of the category: Infectious causes of cancer, and I am certainly open to changing the name of the category, but change it to what?  This is the shortest name I could come up with. Isn't Project Medicine anthropomorphic by definition?  I am open to any and all suggestions.  I am not sure what needs to be resolved, and have the tendency to only see individual trees rather than the forest. Nice discussion....Best Regards,

d
I originally noticed this category because I put an article in it and was P:ASTONISHed to find a category called &quot;infectious causes of cancer&quot; that did not contain the topics I expected from the name - e.g. vian sarcoma leukosis virus (the first oncovirus discovered), ous sarcoma virus (which earned its discoverer a Nobel), or V40 (which was suspected of causing cancer in humans and caused a huge debate when polio vaccines were found contaminated with it). I mentioned it here in part because it looks like an example of over-focus on thinking of the reader as looking for patient-oriented information rather than documentation of the relevant biology. The latter type of reader is not well served by splitting up human and animal infectious agents, since the underlying molecular mechanism of carcinogenesis is generally very similar between agents of the same family (and is often better understood in the animal case) - and in any event, species specificity may not be absolute. 

As for names, Category:Infectious agents and human cancers isn't so long and is agnostic as to the nature of the association, leaving Category:Infectious causes of cancer (or maybe Category:Infectious causes of carcinogenesis?) for the actual causative agents for all species. ser:Opabinia regalis|Opabinia regalis (ser talk:Opabinia regalis|talk) 07:58, 15 July 2015 (UTC)
I don't think that will work under the category guidelines.

Having read the comments by Opabinia, I have changed my mind about including animal topics in the category since I am familiar with the work of Rous and have found a systematic review article that has clearly demonstrated the value of animal cancers and the application of those animal studies to the study of infectious causes of cancers in humans.

I disagree with many of the changes that are proposed, especially the AfD.  I don't think that there would be any problem with categories such as Genetic causes of cancers or Environmental causes of cancer.  Please remember that the assertions that there are associations, links, increased risk between infectious agents are largely supported by systematic reviews and meta-analyses and are not vague or unproven relationships, or based upon one study.  I don't have a point of view on this topic. The assertion that there is a connection between an infectious agent and cancer are conclusions of researchers. I would be quite pleased with the renaming to &quot;Infectious agents and carcinogenesis&quot;.  As for POV-pushing by Morgellons, I have no idea what you are talking about.

I will treat this comment with seriousness and with the idea that you might mean what you wrote as a comment.  Firstly, I thought that editors were supposed to stay away from personal comments regarding the possible motivation (and mental status?) of other editors.

 nfectious medicine page move

Thanks! ser:Yobol|Yobol (ser talk:Yobol|talk) 02:53, 18 July 2015 (UTC)
Well obviously it was indicated or I wouldn't have made the move. Whether the change is supported by the community is something else entirely.

&quot;Obviously indicated&quot;?  According to whom?  In 34 years of practicing medicine I have never once heard the term &quot;infectious medicine&quot; used.

Not pedantic so much as unreasonable.  The fact that a couple of labs in Finland and Sweden use it does not make it a &quot;synonym&quot; - just a non sequitur.

No, I'm not being unreasonable, read what I said in my first post. I agree this may not be the best title, but neither do I think the old title is better. I'm glad this initiated debate, because then we can find a better title without brackets. To this can be added that the article had 0 views over the last 90 days before my edit, I think it needs a better title so that it can be more easily found through search. -- ser:CFCF|CFCF ser talk:CFCF|üçå (pecial:EmailUser/CFCF|email) 11:27, 18 July 2015 (UTC)

The problem is that the overwhleming number of major medical sources use the phrase &quot;infectious disease&quot; or &quot;infectious diseases&quot; as the name for the subspecialty. You seem to be applying your dislike for parantheses and overriding what the overwhelming number of medical sources actually call the subspecialty.

Is this article supposed to be about the medical specialty (e.g., equivalent to &quot;dermatology&quot;), or about what you've got when you've been infected (e.g., equivalent to &quot;skin disease&quot;)?  If it's the specialty, then it might be reasonable to call it &quot;infectious disease medicine&quot;, although in the US, the actual name of the subspecialty appears to be plain &quot;infectious disease&quot;.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 23:08, 18 July 2015 (UTC)

It's possible that the title &quot;Blood-borne disease&quot; is appropriate for an article, I'm just suggesting that some scope clarification is needed: does it pertain to the relatively few diseases where the pathogen's life cycle depends on host-to-host transmission through blood (e.g. a iral hemorrhagic fever), is it more general, admitting any of the pathogens which can exploit opportunites for host-to-host transmission through blood (e.g. HIV), or is it any disease which infects the blood? ser:LeadSongDog|LeadSongDog ser talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl! 15:57, 22 July 2015 (UTC)
lood-borne disease already exists, and it's about diseases transmitted through blood/body fluid contact, since that's what is expected by anyone who has been through loodborne pathogen training or knows what the point of niversal precautions is.
lood poisoning redirects to epsis; lood infection and loodstream infection both redirect to acteremia.  I'm inclined to¬†use loodstream infection as the non-bacteria-specific new article.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 01:18, 23 July 2015 (UTC)

 FA review of etogenic diet 
I believe I have followed the guidelines for requesting a FA review.  I have done this on the talk page of the article.  The major editor/contributor initially wrote that he would address my concerns regarding the references in the article.  No progress has been done to address my concerns and I, with no malice, want to proceed with the process of a review of its FA status. The major problems are: the references are quite outdated.  I have posted other references and left this information on the talk page.  I would have edited and inserted the updated references myself but I do not feel as if I have the expertise or familiarity with the topic to do so or I would have fixed it myself. Another significant problem is that the references do not meet the requirements of P:MEDRS.  The references in medical articles should be academic journal review articles, systematic review articles, governmental websites and policies and medical textbooks.  I could find none of these as sources (there might one and I might have missed it).  My review is not perfect but in good faith, I am optimistic that with the right sources, this article can retain its FA status.  Best Regards,

Your statement that you could find none of the typical preferred medical references as sources in this article made me think I was looking at the wrong tab, because it does not seem at all to be the case, and because you have already had the sourcing in this article explained to you in some detail on its talk page after you posted a similar thread there in May. What specific content are you concerned about and what newer sources have you read that led you to that concern? ser:Opabinia regalis|Opabinia regalis (ser talk:Opabinia regalis|talk) 23:58, 23 July 2015 (UTC)
I have contacted the editor who nominated the article for FA status.
¬†¬†ser:Bfpage|Bfpage¬†|ser talk:Bfpage|leave a message¬† 09:47, 24 July 2015 (UTC)
I thought the original author was the major contributor and did not know that notifying the nominator was required. I am carefully going over the references and have found that many of them really ARE reviews though it is not always apparent in the text of the reference.  I did locate more recent content and references that appear to be updates to those references that are older than five years.  I left these links on the talk page. I also realize that some of the references support historical content so of course I don't have a problem with that. I had the sourcing explained to me as you have pointed out and yet the major contributor stated that he would look into my concerns. You understand that reviewing FA is a good thing and my assessment that a lot, if not most, of the content is older than the five yeas recommended by MEDRS.  It was the dates of the references that caught my attention. Please assume good faith on my part. I thought identifying what I considered to be outdated references was a good thing and would benefit the encyclopedia. I detected some ownership, and it confused me.  I would think that the existence of more up-to-date references would be helpful to those who maintain that article. If there is consensus that the sources are fine and don't need to be updated, I will withdraw my request for review. Why wouldn't we want the article updated? And much of the historical content is available in more recent review articles. I did not realize that this would be contentious. Best Regards and appreciative of all who have commented on this topic.

 Article name change? 

Hey guys, I was wondering about the name of this article: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertrophic_pulmonary_osteoarthropathy

Should it be:
* ypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy
or
* ypertrophic osteoarthropathy

I found that more literature has the name hypertrophic osteoarthropathy.
What do you guys think?
Does the name Pulmonary add much? Pulmonary problems are only seen with this disease in some types, not all. So I am not sure if it covers the disease correctly?

If the merger is agreed upon, you can either move the material yourself, leaving the edit summaries as noted in the &quot;How to merge&quot; section, or you can ask me to do the merge and the attribution tags if you prefer.

I like the idea of reflecting the information, but given the low volume, a bot task seems a bit much. At least for starters manual edits may be more appropriate and carry less risk of community backlash. Also it's a bit US-centric to use just the FDA. The UK equivalent appears to be [https://www.gov.uk/drug-safety-update here]. We should, I think, tweak P:MEDMOS, P:PHARMMOS, and emplate:Infobox drug to clarify how to show this information. Once that's worked out we can start to think about automation.ser:LeadSongDog|LeadSongDog ser talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl! 16:45, 22 July 2015 (UTC)
Lead the bot is to notify both editors and readers (hopefully soon to be editors) to update the article in question. The problem is we have not done a good job keeping our content updated to the FDA releases per a previous study. 
I would like to do the same with the UK list. That list however is more than just updates and thus not sure how to build a bot around it. For example what would one do with &quot;Survey of medicines safety communications&quot;? Additionally not sure if their is an API while the FDA has one. Will look into the technicalities of it. I hope that eventually this bot may also work on other sources like the EMA releases.

I fear that it would be a gigantic list that would never approach completion and would be only very sporadically maintained and updated.  (I suspect it would actually be much easier and briefer to list curable diseases.)
You have to start with practically every genetic, degenerative, and chronic ailment in the book, and it gets worse from there.  (And then there will be the quibbles and quarrels over what constitutes 'incurability'.  We can cure HIV infection in some patients using a stem cell transplant from a suitable donor, but we don't really consider HIV infection 'curable' because the stem cell transplant has such a high risk of morbidity and mortality.  Are various cancers 'curable' because they have a 5% 5-year survival rate?  50%?  90%?  And so forth.) ser:TenOfAllTrades|TenOfAllTrades(ser_talk:TenOfAllTrades|talk) 19:00, 26 July 2015 (UTC)

 WikiProject Medicine Collaboration of the Month 

Hello all,

I just wanted to announce my plan to relaunch the P:MCOTM|WikiProject Medicine Collaboration of the Month. The collaboration ikipedia:WikiProject Medicine/Collaboration of the Month/History|has contributed a lot to the Wikiproject - and in fact tomorrow, July 27th will mark the 10th year anniversary since the collaboration started. It really is a good project idea, but it needs more people to come together and help make it work. What I would like is for people to visit the collaboration page and vote on the current nominations (or make your own) for next months project. In addition, I hope people will dedicate some of their editing time to the future selected articles.

So I often use Harrison's principles of internal medicine as a reference. But I can never seem to be able to add the ISBN number and get all the info about the book when I click the little magnifying glass.
I often use the 19th edition of this book.
These are the numbers, but they don't work.

As helpful as it is to suggest VisualEditor when someone is reporting a reproducible bug in existing tools, maybe we could try to solve the actual problem?
Looks like reftoolbar isn't indexing this particular book correctly, and it's not clear why.

Eventually I just wrote emplate:cite hpim|the ite hpim template which will call l|cite book for you with the appropriate data, and takes the page=, pages=, and chapter= parameters.

 ass deworming 

Just a heads-up, we decided to begin a new page on ass deworming to split from elminthiasis and to keep eworming for animals, as the existing editors there had expressed a preference for that. The whole topic is difficult as there is a lot of controversy about recent trials, data re-analysis and a Cochrane review. My view is that the page should be covered by P:MEDRS but it is likely to be edited by those who want to talk about particular trials (which were not included in the Cochrane review) and which give different results. I am not totally sure how to write the controversial parts of the page without giving weight to individual studies, which appears to be in violation of MEDRS, so would appreciate any other input from WP medics. ser:JMWt|JMWt (ser talk:JMWt|talk) 09:35, 29 July 2015 (UTC)

 Nevertheless, Wikipedia's biggest failing compared to other encyclopedias has been shown to be the relatively high level of reading comprehension needed for many articles. Any increase in the readability of our articles benefits not just younger readers but also readers whose first language is not English and who have no article available in their mother tongue. WPMED (James and CF in particular) have made great efforts in translations, but there will always exist a need for our articles to be understood by people who find reading English difficult.

Regarding Doc Jame's specific reversion, there are two issues.  1) An editor had changed the wording of cited quotations, and this needs to be reverted regardless of understandability.  2)  While &quot;pee&quot;, or &quot;piss&quot; may be more commonly used than &quot;urine&quot; or &quot;urinate&quot;, &quot;urine&quot; is widely understood.  &quot;Voiding&quot; is probably not understood much outside the medical community, and &quot;void&quot; also has other meanings, so it probably should be explained at first use.--ser:Wikimedes|Wikimedes (ser talk:Wikimedes|talk) 17:43, 27 July 2015 (UTC)

*We should definitely encourage simplicity, but not at the cost of discouraging editors from writing at all.  Writing simply is actually harder than writing technically.  Also it frequently happens when unskilled writers try to write simply that they end up writing inaccurately -- that's worse than complexity.  Wikipedia depends on encouraging editors to do as much as they are capable of doing -- not more. ser:Looie496|Looie496 (ser talk:Looie496|talk) 12:43, 26 July 2015 (UTC)
A few rules of simple include: use short sentences, try to have only one idea per sentence, use simpler words. Some rules of simplification make our content too &quot;how to&quot; and thus I do not follow them. ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk ¬∑ pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs ¬∑ pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 01:41, 27 July 2015 (UTC)
I find that using a subject-verb-object pattern, avoiding the passive voice, and using shorter, more common words makes for writing that is more pointful and powerful.  More people fully grasp the meaning of a direct statement like &quot;Most babies with Scary Genetic Disease die in less than one year&quot; than from &quot;The median patient with Scary Genetic Disease¬†has a survival time of less than one year&quot;.  
I've been reading a lot recently about oncologists being afraid to tell people that they're going to die, and I've noticed a parallel in Wikipedia's writing.  We're not trying to be optimistic (or to postpone a long and probably tearful session until a more convenient time, because I've got another sick patient in the next room who also needs me right now), but we do mimic the detached, passive, emotion-avoiding style that these people use.  One example of this is that we talk about survival times rather than death.  We also tend to ignore questions of quality of life and practical prognosis.  Another example:  We tend not to mention the practical burden of chronic diseases or life-long treatment.  Diabetics need to plan every meal and every drug for the rest of their lives.  If dinner is served late at a party, or if your friends at work take too long to get out the door for a group lunch, then it can cause immediate problems.  People with fatigue or pain issues often need part-time jobs.  People with kidney or liver problems may not be able to take the most effective drugs for other conditions.  I find that when I try to write in simple language, that I think more clearly about a condition; when I think more clearly about a condition, then these practical realities become more obvious to me.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 15:39, 27 July 2015 (UTC)
While it can take some skill and even artistry to write for a lay audience without losing accuracy, I think this is something to strive for.  Wikipedia is, after all, an encyclopedia, not a journal for medical professionals.  I occasionally try to make medical articles more understandable while maintaining the technical rigor and jargon.  Sometimes this is as simple as including a synonym or short description for the technical terms (e.g. swelling for edema, or &quot;swelling caused by edema&quot;).  Another technique is to have a lead paragraph or sentence in layman's terms to get the general idea across, and then have following paragraphs or sentences fill in the technical details.  Sometimes the opposite order is useful, with the concept expressed succinctly in technical terms followed by a longer explanation in less technical terms.  Other times things are more complicated and artistry comes into play.

I don't think we should discourage editors from writing in either technical or layman's terms, but should continually try to improve articles by adding the missing parts.
-ser:Wikimedes|Wikimedes (ser talk:Wikimedes|talk) 17:26, 27 July 2015 (UTC)
Agree strongly with what is written above by several users - it's important for lay readers to be able to understand what we write, not just technically skilled ones. Some specific advice for anatomy articles which can cross over to medicine is provided in the essay P:ANATSIMPLIFY. I find the main problem is that whilst we are in agreement here, there are lot of users who lurk who disagree with this, and a gradual trend by IP users passing by to slowly reintroduce removed technical language. --ser:LT910001|Tom (LT) (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 00:00, 28 July 2015 (UTC)

I also agree with user CFCF that the difficult and complexity of articles on many topics is somewhat excessive. Could we address this within WikiProject Medicine somehow? Perhaps a targeted effort to simplify the &quot;top-importance&quot; articles, with a view to removing medical jargon and unnecessary detail, and relegating such content to the appropriate sub-pages. Many of the contributors are researchers and medical professionals, so I don't think we can avoid having many users writing in highly technical ways, but periodically revising articles with a view to simplifying them might be a step in the right direction. ser:Nren4237|Nren4237 (ser talk:Nren4237|talk) 10:19, 30 July 2015 (UTC)

 Horner's? 

Last year, an IP user left [https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File%3AHorner%27s_Syndrome_and_Autonomic_innervation_of_the_eye.svg&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=115785006&amp;oldid=85711410 this message] on the page for our image of how the nervous system is affected in orner's syndrome. I have no idea whether the complaint is correct.

Is it correct? If so, is anyone able to edit the .svg ? ser:DragonflySixtyseven|DS (ser talk:DragonflySixtyseven|talk) 19:59, 30 July 2015 (UTC)

To be clear: I don't have medical training. I can't really parse the content in either the complaint or in the cited textbook. In fact, because of the IP user's weak grammar, I'm not sure if the complaint is (X should be portrayed as Y) or (X is portrayed as Y). You might say that I should just look at the image, but when I do, I can't follow the legend. I look at the page you've linked to, and I don't understand it very much. Is the image correct, or is the complaint valid? If the complaint is valid, is there anyone participating in the Medicine wikiproject who's able to edit .svg files?  And if the complaint is not valid, is anyone here willing to remove it from the image? ser:DragonflySixtyseven|DS (ser talk:DragonflySixtyseven|talk) 12:52, 31 July 2015 (UTC)

 The reference provided by Ozzie shows that the initial complaint is valid. The image in &quot;iliospinal center&quot; shows the locations of both synapses. ser:Axl|Axl ¬§ ser talk:Axl|[Talk] 16:20, 31 July 2015 (UTC)
