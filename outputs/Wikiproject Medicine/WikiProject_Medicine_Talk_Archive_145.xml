Is it acceptable to copy &quot;Vorlage:Navigationsleiste Tumore des Nervensystems&quot; (German) to the (English) &quot;&quot;? It means that the English version will be removed and the German side will be used in English. The German side has more informations about Nervous system tumors.

Before here on the Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Medicine I was on the Teahouse:
Welcome to the Teahouse, . I think that would be a very bad and confusing idea, but expanding the English template to include more links to a wider range of articles in English seems a more logical approach. I note you also asked the same question at , so one hopes you might receive a reply there. However, that page has very few watchers, so I suggest you ask a question at , linking to the template talk page discussion so that you don't get answers spread around different discussion pages. Hope this helps,  () 19:27, 28 November 2020 (UTC).  () 21:43, 28 November 2020 (UTC)

 [[de:Vorlage:Navigationsleiste Tumore des Nervensystems]] is in German (obviously) so it would not be appropriate to replace  with it.
 On the English Wikipedia, these sort of navigation templates contain lists of English article titles that are related to the topic. It would not be appropriate to direct English readers to articles on the German Wikipedia, even if you translated the German titles to English.
 If your point is that there are more potential articles on the topic of &quot;nervous system tumours&quot; than exist on the English Wikipedia, and that the German Wikipedia template displays them, then you may well be right. However, unlike the German Wikipedia, navigation templates on the English Wikipedia are designed for navigation for readers (not for editors), so only contain the titles of articles that exist. it would not be appropriate the add titles of articles that don't exist on the English Wikipedia to the template.
 You might want to make a list of nervous system tumour articles missing from enwiki in your , and then perhaps enlist help here in creating and developing them. -- () 00:43, 29 November 2020 (UTC)

@ was looking at that navbox a few months ago, and might be interested in the idea of expanding it.  () 01:50, 29 November 2020 (UTC)
Thanks for the ping. I completely agree with what RexxS states. Our navboxes have evolved over the last 15 years or so to reflect the contents of articles, what is useful for readers, and have been divided according to navboxes in our namespace. We definitely have an appropriate template. Unfortunately a wholesale replacement would be inappropriate; the nom can consider individually going through articles to add them if they are missing when appropriate. -- () 04:08, 29 November 2020 (UTC)

Wikipedia, The Free Online Medical Encyclopedia Anyone Can Plagiarize

I checked the archives, and I couldn't find a notice about this, so I apologize if it's a duplicate. The September issue of Publishing Research Quarterly contains the article, Wikipedia, The Free Online Medical Encyclopedia Anyone Can Plagiarize: Time to Address Wiki-Plagiarism. It is about plagiarism from Wikipedia to medical journals. I was able to locate the abstract and citation online via my local public library's access to EBSCOHost, and the notice there said that full text &quot;may be held at another location, check with your librarian&quot;, and &quot;Full text delay due to publisher restrictions ('embargo')&quot; and mentioned a 12-month delay.

I suppose it is less than surprising. The publisher is on [https://predatoryjournals.com/publishers/#S Beall's List of Predatory Publishers]. They are located in a residential apartment park. Their journals are not PubMed indexed. The article is &quot;authored&quot; by the Fymat AL, who is also listed as Editor-in-Chief of the journal. Fymat's PubMed-indexed articles were in the range 1970-1998. To be fair, most of his articles were in Applied Optics, so perhaps some later publications were in legitimate journals that are outside of PubMed's scope.

December Collaboration of the Month - Dexamethasone

Thanks to all who participated in the November collaboration of the month: tonsillitis. It attracted around 200 edits from 11 medicine editors (though if anyone is interested, it still could use further work and there's now some collected resources at the talk page to help guide improvements).

Transmission of COVID-19

Hello this article and its content is quite controversial in Australia, as it affects the masks we wear, see [https://ama.com.au/sites/default/files/2020-11/Letter_to_Professor_Gilbert.pdf here]. We spent a fair bit of time making sure this neutrally presents the varying opinion of the agencies and the controversy. It appears this has been controversial many times before (I haven't been through all the talk but there is a CDC paid editor and people have been blocked). The current page as we edited it seems neutral to me, but please keep an eye on it because of the conflicts of interest. With thanks -- () 01:37, 2 December 2020 (UTC)

That letter is not a reliable source. The CDC generally is. And who is &quot;we&quot;?  () 04:28, 2 December 2020 (UTC)
 It's a reliable source of the fact that one professor wrote a letter to another professor about the contents of an article. It might be evidence for the fact that there is controversy over PPE advice in Australia. The CDC may or may not be reliable, but they don't comment on Australian politics. I imagine &quot;we&quot; means &quot;wikipedia editors&quot;. While the CDCs publications may be reliable, due to the scrutiny they undergo and the incentives that exist, a paid CDC editors work on wikipedia is not.  () 08:45, 2 December 2020 (UTC)

Yes nurses and doctors and support staff over here don't get proper protection when on the front line, due to a few peoples opinions, which the unions disagree with. But Australian politics aside, that's right on the point that there are incentives that exist to motivate paid editors from any agency to reflect their agency's point of view. Theres been more than one australian that started editing because they were upset about its content as far as I can see. In America they get the masks, here we don't that seems to be why. -- () 14:26, 2 December 2020 (UTC)

I've got an Alberts 6th ed.  On it... (•) 07:36, 2 December 2020 (UTC)
Hmmm... I guess the reason 4th ed. is cited is that it's freely searchable (though not browsable) online [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21054/?depth=2].  I could change the citations to 6th ed., but that would make it harder for readers to verify content.  All the citations seem to be for basic facts that haven't changed since 2002, so I think we should stick with 4th ed.  It doesn't seem to be possible to recover page numbers from the online version of 4th ed., but I could use the |loc= parameter of  to add section links like this: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26833/#A4639 Pathogens Cross Protective Barriers to Colonize the Host].

Cardiovascular disease in women

Hello, just came across this as an orphan. I linked it at Cardiovascular disease from the Sex sub-heading, but wanted to make sure you guys had a look at it since it looks to me like it's a WikiEd creation. ♠♠  01:45, 4 December 2020 (UTC)

Thanks for this note.  Isn't it amazing to find one of these unexpected holes in content?  We should have had an article on heart disease in women years and years ago.  () 02:28, 4 December 2020 (UTC)
I think it's the because broader overview articles are harder to write. It's easy enough to track down every source about some obscure disorder of the lower spleen or whatever, because there may only be enough to write two paragraphs total, but figuring out the best sources and structure for a comprehensive article a broad topic can be daunting. ♠♠  02:55, 4 December 2020 (UTC)
Having written Oculodentodigital dysplasia (an incredibly rare disease) some years ago, I have to agree.  Identifying a &quot;high-quality source&quot; could be simplified down &quot;Look, this one is peer-reviewed and was published during the current century!&quot;, and it was physically possible for one person to read everything published on the subject.  Broad topics are much harder (also more likely to have some disputes).  () 07:38, 4 December 2020 (UTC)

The main problem with that article was the tone – it was written more like a PR press release or internal memo than an encyclopaedic article (). I've taken a stab at improving it (). I don't think there is a whole lot more we can or should write about it until it is approved. The results of phase II trials are not appropriate to include in an encyclopaedic article about an as-yet unapproved drug.  () 08:13, 8 December 2020 (UTC)

Looking for people who've done a physical exam

 is about whether to prefer sources that place Trump's height just high enough that he's very overweight, or just short enough that he's slightly obese.  There seems to be a disagreement about whether authorized public statements from a politician's personal physicians should be treated as infallible.   () 02:08, 30 November 2020 (UTC)
I've commented. Ultimately, this looks more like a WP policy than medical question, but I agree some input from medical experts can help shed light on the data. —  () 03:43, 30 November 2020 (UTC)
 After the tree fell on me, and I allegedly lost height with the compression fracture, I have had height measurements by different physicians varying up to an inch, even as I now insist they take care to get it right, as I want to know if I've actually lost height.  Last physical exam, I gained 3/4 of an inch, even with making sure they were taking care in the measurement.  But I don't know how to weigh in on that discussion, because ... verifiability over truth. I just don't trust height measurements from doctors, as they haven't been reliable in my case.

Augmentation


Augmentation is an interesting word. Paraphrasing from the Oxford English Dictionary:
augment, verb - To make greater in number, size, or degree; to add to, to supplement; to increase, enlarge, extend; to increase, grow, intensify. 
augmentation, noun - The action or process of becoming greater in number, size, or degree; growth, increase, intensification; extension, enlargement; an addition, an increase; an intensified state or condition; the action or process of increasing the size of a part of the body by plastic surgery. 
We have an (stub-class) article titled Augmentation (pharmacology), which is about enhancing psychopharmacological treatment effects by adding a second drug. 

But we also need an article (or a section in another article?) about drug augmentation, meaning a gradual worsening of symptoms, usually after taking a medication for an extended period of time. Drug augmentation and drug tolerance often coexist, i.e., a person needs to take more of the medication to achieve the desired effect and the medication induces a worsening of target symptoms instead of ameliorating symptom severity. (See the pramipexole article for an example.)

Questions: (1) Do you think an article about drug augmentation is a good idea, or would it be better to include information about the phenomenon in another article? 

(2) If drug augmentation merits its own article, what title would you suggest for it? 

Thanks! -   [he/his/him] 07:57, 11 December 2020 (UTC)

How does Augmentation (pharmacology) differ from Synergy#Drug synergy or Adjuvant?  () 17:48, 11 December 2020 (UTC)

Hmm. Good questions. I'll take a stab at the first one: Augmentation is a treatment strategy, whereas drug synergy is the biological (chemical) process that makes the treatment strategy possible.   [he/his/him] 18:40, 13 December 2020 (UTC)
Re: Your second question, see Adjuvant therapy, Immunologic adjuvant, Pharmaceutic adjuvant, and the  Adjuvant into Immunologic adjuvant. Also, if you have access to [https://www.oed.com/ Oxford English Dictionary] or [https://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/ Merriam-Webster Unabridged], they both have very helpful info from a lexical perspective at least.

Bell's palsy

*

From poking around in some of the more sordid areas of the web, it seems there's an idea at large (based on some cases during the trials[https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03542-4]) that the COVID vaccines cause Bell's palsy. This likely why our article has seen a spike[https://pageviews.toolforge.org/?project=en.wikipedia.org&amp;platform=all-access&amp;agent=user&amp;redirects=0&amp;range=latest-90&amp;pages=Bell%27s_palsy] of interest recently. Given the lack of sources I don't think anything can be said on this, but it may be good to have some extra eyes on the article for a while.  () 14:15, 14 December 2020 (UTC)

Is the internet actually saying that Bell's palsy, which was first described by physicians over a thousand years ago, is caused by a vaccine that was distributed for the first time this month?  Or is this just a claim that Bell's palsy is a possible side effect?   () 16:44, 14 December 2020 (UTC)

VEXAS or VEXAS syndrome: Wikidata has both

I am not a regular medical editor but with some trepidation and great caution created a stub for the new autoinflammatory disorder VEXAS on 17 November after one of the 52 authors of the key paper mentioned its discovery during a consultation on a different ailment of mine. (Hmm, is that a Conflict of Interest? I hope not.)

I wasn't sure then whether its article title should be VEXAS or VEXAS syndrome (I made a redirect from the latter). Some sources use one, some the other. The [https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/scientists-use-clues-human-genome-discover-new-inflammatory-syndrome NIH News release] uses &quot;VEXAS&quot;. I've just found it in [https://omim.org/entry/301054 OMIM], where both names are given. But I now find that Wikidata has two separate entries, one at [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q102146890 VEXAS] (created 20 Nov by an editor who apparently first edited Wikidata on 19 Nov)) linking to the en.wiki article, and one at [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q102294972 VEXAS syndrome] (created on 24 Nov by a bot), linking to the [https://disease-ontology.org/?id=DOID:0080828 DOID record]. I am not a Wikidata expert. But I'm confident they both refer to the same entity so presumably there should only be one Wikidata record.

So I have two questions for expert medical editors, especially those well versed in Wikidata:

# Is the article at the right title?
# Could someone please do what's needed in Wikidata so that there is just the one entry, with the alternative name included?

And of course there may be many other improvements which could be made to this article: I look forward to seeing it develop. I tried to make sure that I was not editing beyond my level of knowledge ... which is why most of this stub is a couple of quotes. There may be further useful categories which could be added. I've added an entry to the list at List of OMIM disorder codes, though if it ought to be called &quot;VEXAS syndrome&quot; that will need to be changed. 

Thanks in advance for any help on this article and its Wikidata. [[User:PamD|Pam]][[User talk:PamD|D]] 21:53, 13 December 2020 (UTC)
 You should be bringing this up at [[wikidata:Wikidata talk:WikiProject Medicine]].--  22:36, 13 December 2020 (UTC)
 Thanks, have now done so. My ignorance of Wikidata extends to not having known that it had such a thing as Wikiprojects. 
But the question as to which title the en.wiki article should have is one for here, still. Any thoughts? [[User:PamD|Pam]][[User talk:PamD|D]] 22:53, 13 December 2020 (UTC)
Since VEXAS stands for &quot;Vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, Autoinflammatory, Somatic&quot; (and not V.E.X.A. Syndrome), the page should probably end up at VEXAS syndrome.  Since you have the redirect in place, moving the page to the probably-technically-correct title is not urgent.  Fixing the page title here is much easier than merging the Wikidata records (independent of the Wikidata process).  () 00:17, 14 December 2020 (UTC)
 thanks for creating the article and linking to the podcast, which was fascinating. There does seem to be a small amount of confusion with two reports saying &quot;The team called the new disease VEXAS (vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory and somatic syndrome)&quot;, though surely that's VEXASS. But in the [https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2026834 published paper], the authors say &quot;We named this disorder the VEXAS (vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, somatic) syndrome&quot; and write &quot;VEXAS syndrome&quot; repeatedly throughout the paper. As I have previously noted at &quot;Down syndrome&quot; discussions on possessive-form variant spelling, I suspect that the shift away from &quot;Down's syndrome&quot; as more to do with the difficulty in pronouncing a clearly audible &quot;'s&quot; when followed by &quot;syndrome&quot; rather than &quot;disease&quot; (the possessive is more often retained on Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease). So I wonder if the syndrome part of this name gets dropped over time, with just VEXAS used, or whether we might even see the typo &quot;VEXA syndrome&quot; appear. Maybe we will even see &quot;Vexa's syndrome&quot; appear through some dictated typo, and someone wonder who the heck Dr Vexa was :-) -- ° 17:21, 14 December 2020 (UTC)
 Thanks, glad you enjoyed the podcast. I google VEXAS from time to time and I think there will be more to say about it and more interesting links as time goes on. (I also think Dan Kastner is probably due for an article). I'm pretty sure that the author of the paper who mentioned it to me called it plain &quot;VEXAS&quot; - but then she talks about &quot;Schnitzler's&quot; rather than Schnitzler syndrome (or &quot;Schnitzler's syndrome&quot;, in the UK). On consideration I think perhaps I got the article title wrong, and will now move it to VEXAS syndrome ... done, and tidied the bolding in the lead for consistency.

In general I think splitting the effort around COVID-19 (which is what this will be, effectively, at least in the short to medium term) is a bad idea.

Antibody-dependent enhancement needs better sourcing to put it mildly-- () 18:04, 15 December 2020 (UTC)

Issues with our Antibody-dependent enhancement article
This year, the article has been expanded in large part by , but there are issues.

First, the sourcing is largely (entirely?) not . 

Secondly, the whole thing smells of  and indeed spot-checking a couple of portions shows heavy , mostly with slight wording changes which make the text weird:





I am pinging , who has seen to copyright issues with this article previously.

Given the situation, I think it may be prudent to apply some  and roll (revdel?) the article back to the time of those last copyright fixes (22 August), to give us a cleaner basis for working on.  () 03:56, 16 December 2020 (UTC)
The article has doubled in size since I visited it in August. There's definitely some copyright issues with the current version.—  () 04:33, 16 December 2020 (UTC)

There may have been some gems in the stuff I mucked-out (though I didn't find any from spot checking), but overall I think this is an improvement that gives our readers a better sense of the current state of knowledge on ADE and coronaviruses.

Does an article stating there is evidence SARS-CoV-2 was in the US in December fall under MEDRS or just RS?

I figured this was a good place to ask this question.  NPR recently discussed CDC sponsored study that found, &quot;...that SARS-CoV-2 may have been introduced into the United States prior to January 19, 2020&quot; .  In what contexts/usage would the discussion of this study be subject to strict MEDRS vs normal RS.  I would assume if we had an article listing/discussing CDC research articles this would be just standard RS since the objective is to verify the study actually exists.  What about to claim &quot;a study showed evidence of the virus in the US in the 13 Dec to 17 Jan time frame&quot;?  That is again verifiable as the claim is that a study that makes that claim exists.  What about, &quot;evidence of the virus in the US in the 13 Dec to 17 Jan time frame&quot;?   has removed this source from several articles as failing MEDRS but after our discussions regarding MEDRS and  I don't see that as clear cut.  I've pinged Alexbrn as a courtesy but I'm hoping for other opinions (either to say I'm very wrong or not).  () 15:13, 15 December 2020 (UTC)
*Epidemiology is , and your argument[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard&amp;diff=993930874&amp;oldid=993929947] we can use primary sources and news reports because epidemiology always reports on something in the past and so is somehow not medicine but &quot;history&quot; is, I think, specious . What intensifies the matter here is that the claim you want Wikipedia to relay, that COVID-19 was spreading in the USA in 2019, is an  one and so requires exceptionally strong sources, not exceptionally weak ones.  () 15:30, 15 December 2020 (UTC)
**Again, I think this is a gray area.  We are talking about a CDC study that says they found the marker antibodies in blood samples from the mid-Dec to mid-Jan time period taken from blood samples from the western US.  I don't think it is clear that saying it was first in the US in January vs December is Biomedical Information per your link.  Again, this is why I asked for the opinions of others.  Do we have a MEDRS that says mid January is when the virus came to the US?  What I've seen is mid January is the earliest diagnosed case in the US but I'm also generally not searching this topic.    () 15:39, 15 December 2020 (UTC)
***Your continued assertion that this is a &quot;gray area&quot; does not mean that's true. The &quot;CDC&quot; study you  to &quot;lend credibility&quot;[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Misinformation_related_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic&amp;diff=993805531&amp;oldid=993679480] to the idea that COVID-19 has been around for a while so isn't as serious as is generally thought, is PMID 33252659, which (even if it were a reliable source) couches its findings in an ultra-cautious manner.  () 15:52, 15 December 2020 (UTC)
****Your continued assertion that this isn't a gray area does not mean that's true.  Your claim about how I want to use the study is false as I have never added it to any article.  The same is true of your claim that I think this isn't a serious illness (for ref, several family members are suffering from it and one of one of my siblings had a patient die from it).

***  Because it's a single primary source being used to support an extraordinary claim. The particular part of MEDRS that applies to it is the second paragraph  More importantly, the policy at  states  high-quality sources&quot;.

**** Why is this a redflag claim?  At the same time would two independent studies that suggest the virus was in the US in the December time frame count?  I understand that second paragraph you quoted but I don't agree it must apply to a claim of when this virus was in the US.  This goes back to why do we have MEDRS, specifically because we don't want to do harm with bad information here.  I also don't see how politely asking others to explain their view is any violation of the COVID-19 DS.   () 17:40, 15 December 2020 (UTC)
****:Thanks for posting this question here, .  As you can see, it's a good place to get answers.
****:This is an exceptional claim because it's not the general, settled, mainstream view.  It is also an exceptional claim because the study is weak.  There was an Italian study that did the same thing a couple of weeks ago.  The problem with the study is that they have no idea whether they are finding antibodies that were triggered by SARS-CoV-2, or merely antibodies that happen to bind to SARS-CoV-2.  &quot;Hey, we found antibodies!&quot; is not exciting to anyone who knows how those tests work.  
****:Some months ago, there were reports about finding antibodies in five-year-old stored blood samples.  Everyone looked at those results and concluded that the test must be bad, and the antibodies are merely a case of coincidental cross-reactiviity.  But when they run the same test on blood samples from a few months ago, the internet believes that the same test magically started working and proved something.
****:What would be an impressive piece of research is a lab running their test on blood samples from December 2018 and *not* finding antibodies, and then running the same test on blood samples from December 2019 and finding antibodies.  But none of them have done that; every single time they've run these tests, they have found antibodies.  It would also be impressive if the research did DNA testing to find the virus itself, rather than just doing one test – a test notorious in the industry for its error rate – and announcing that you should be considered a famous scientist now.  None of these retrospective antibody tests have been confirmed in any way (not even by running a different lab's antibody test on it).  () 17:59, 15 December 2020 (UTC)

* I came across this discussion via Timeline of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019.

*:::Hi , dial it back a bit, please. I'd not read the article before yesterday: I corrected some typos and grammatical errors, and after that the first thing I did was to look at the talk page (ownership issues, no discussion since July, no mention of MEDRS) and the history (lots of reverts) and then I commented here to better understand where we draw the line and so others might edit as an example of the issues you've discussed. Studies looking for SARS-CoV-2 in stored clinical or environmental samples from 2019 aren't &quot;pseudoscience&quot;: while I'm skeptical of many such claims (because they contradict other evidence), my opinion is OR, we know the virus was present at least somewhere in late 2019, and this is a legitimate area of research. If the findings are discussed and critiqued in reliable scholarly sources (not only preprints or primary articles) then we should provide that information to our readers. If we don't discuss the evidence, its reception, and its limitations, readers will find other information sources that may be less balanced than we are.

*::::  there's nothing to dial back. I'm sick to the eye-teeth of editors wanting to cram every piece of breaking news and misinformation into our COVID-19 articles. If a few more folks actually took responsibility for cleaning up articles when they see these issues, instead of enabling the conspiracy theorists and woo-pushers, Wikipedia would benefit dramatically. There's a world of difference between keeping track of research that comes to conclusions far different from the mainstream, and taking them at face value to insert tenuous content into our articles as if it carried the same weight as the mainstream view.  really does apply. When we have good quality secondary sources that are competent to assess the evidence, we'll be in a position to write about where the virus was present in late 2019. Until then, we should be silent on the matter. Your &quot;reliable scholarly sources&quot; are well short of that as  makes clear. If you disagree with that approach, then in my opinion, you ought not to be editing in the medical field. Now tell me to dial that back, I dare you. -- () 18:20, 16 December 2020 (UTC)

* The article is old, largely unsourced, and seems to be mostly a copy of a previous version of [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/B/excipient-table-2.pdf this]
* It seems to be completely out-of-sync with the current CDC document, omitting e.g. any dengue vaccines, and having wrong lists of excipients (for e.g. Adenovirus vaccine)
* &quot;Ingredients&quot; is a odd term, used here to cover both the excipients used and the &quot;culture medium&quot;.

That's actually an impressive feature of the Visual Editor (which I have so far shunned). Good tip!  () 17:02, 17 December 2020 (UTC)
The CDC does not say &quot;the culture media are not contained in the final product&quot;, they say their table only includes things &quot;listed as contained in the final product&quot; and quite a few of them are a result of the culture media (e.g. egg protein). The process of manufacture does have a potential effect on what is in the product even if not an intentional ingredient. We see &quot;Made in a factory that processes nuts&quot; on the wrapper of a chocolate biscuit that doesn't list nuts in the ingredients. I wouldn't get too hung up on whether the name is misleading or whether culture media should be separated from excipient. I'm more concerned that it is essentially an unmaintainable raw data dump that isn't encyclopaedic: there's no explanation of what the excipient is for, how it ended up in there, what amount is typically present and whether you should care. The Vaccine article does briefly mention some of this stuff but not in any depth. I think there is merit in a Vaccine excipients prose article, which would explain to the reader and could be suitably vague &quot;Egg proteins are found in some flu vaccines&quot; rather than misleading the reader with a false impression of accuracy about exactly which branded vaccine has which precise allergens or ethically problematic origins. -- ° 16:47, 17 December 2020 (UTC)

New NICE clinical guidance for Long Covid
As of today, Britain's first guidance on how to diagnose and clinically manage long covid is published (https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng188). As a result, the page  needs overhauling, as do various other articles. The document refers to other materials &quot;for healthcare professionals&quot; available here: [https://www.acnr.co.uk/2020/06/c19-yrs/ here, issued in June] and [https://www.england.nhs.uk/coronavirus/publication/national-guidance-for-post-covid-syndrome-assessment-clinics/ here, issued in November, updated yesterday]. I have added some definitions from the new NICE guidance to the lead, but now the details of the guidance should be looked over with an eye to incorporating the information in a way compliant with Wikipedia medical policies with which I am not familiar, so it'd be good to have some experienced help now that authoritative sources are becoming available. 

The NICE:
Tqb|have used the following clinical definitions for the initial illness and long COVID at different times:
*Acute COVID-19: signs and symptoms of COVID-19 for up to 4 weeks.
*Ongoing symptomatic COVID-19: signs and symptoms of COVID-19 from 4 to 12 weeks.
*Post-COVID-19 syndrome: signs and symptoms that develop during or after an infection consistent with COVID-19, continue for more than 12 weeks and are not explained by an alternative diagnosis.
The bottom two bullet points (4 weeks +) are what they define as &quot;long COVID&quot;, though they also state that:

This seems like a discussion best located on , but I will comment here in reply that you may be conflating &quot;long&quot; and &quot;post&quot; COVID-19 (&quot;...though they also state that...&quot;). The durations as described in the NICE guidance 4-12 weeks (for &quot;long COVID-19&quot;) and the latter 12+ weeks (for &quot;post COVID). —  () 11:53, 18 December 2020 (UTC)
, yes I'm just advertising here for volunteers. But also no, they way they have it is that &quot;long&quot; is both the 4+ and the 12+ weeks arbitrary deadlines. There has already been criticism of the randomness of that and the potential prejudicial implications of the &quot;post-Covid&quot; moniker.  () 19:31, 18 December 2020 (UTC)
I assume that they have titled it to be similar to Post-polio syndrome, and people who don't know anything are thinking that they're saying &quot;Get over it already!&quot;  Actually, there seem to be quite a large number of conditions named &quot;post-(medical condition)&quot;:
* Post-Ebola virus syndrome
* Post-LASIK ectasia
* Post-chemotherapy cognitive impairment
* Post-concussion syndrome
* Post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis
* Post-kala-azar dermatosis
* Post-polio syndrome
* Post-schizophrenic depression
* Post-steroid panniculitis
* Post-stroke depression
* Post-thrombotic syndrome
* Post-transfusion purpura
* Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder
* Post-viral cough
* Post-viral fatigue syndrome
* Post herniorraphy pain syndrome
* Post viral cerebellar ataxia
* Postarthroscopic glenohumeral chondrolysis
* Postcardiotomy syndrome
* Postcholecystectomy syndrome
* Postencephalitic parkinsonism
* Postencephalitic trophic ulcer
* Postherpetic neuralgia
* Postinflammatory hypermelanosis
* Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation
* Postinflammatory hypopigmentation
* Postinflammatory lymphedema
* Postlaminectomy syndrome
* Postmastectomy lymphangiosarcoma
* Postmiliarial hypohidrosis

Help needed

Hi members, I am finding difficulty in improving things (as they are now outside of my specialization) that are mentioned in the DYK nomination of modRNA at . Anyone willing to rescue things to pass the DYK are welcome. Thank you —   05:04, 20 December 2020 (UTC)
I looked at the &quot;Risks&quot; section (this being a hot button topic for misinformation &quot;out there&quot; on the web), and it is very poor. This article should be nowhere near the front page until that at least is fixed. And yes, it may need a specialist editor.  () 05:34, 20 December 2020 (UTC)
 That has to be stated at the DYK nom page ... they operate in a vacuum over there. [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] ()  08:37, 20 December 2020 (UTC)
 The &quot;Risks&quot; section removed. There should not be things that are difficult to interpret and un-verifiable using available . Thanks everyone for the suggestions —   11:08, 20 December 2020 (UTC)

Scary vaccines

*
As I sometimes do, I checked social media to see what people are saying about Wikipedia and the pandemic. Our article on RNA vaccines seem to be linked quite a lot as giving convincing reasons why RNA vaccines should be avoided (typically[https://twitter.com/Ann12Everett/status/1336445253574864896]). Looking at our article, there was a big emphasis on risk from less-than-solid sources. I've pecked at it a bit, but this could really do with some more in-depth attention, ideally from somebody with subject-matter expertise, as I think it is still unduly skewed. The page is currently being viewed &gt; 20,000 times per day.  () 10:21, 9 December 2020 (UTC)
(Add) And my attempted cleanup has now been reverted[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=RNA_vaccine&amp;curid=63136688&amp;diff=993241905&amp;oldid=993238510] so we're back to scary article from weak sources.  () 15:35, 9 December 2020 (UTC)
I had a go, let's see. -  16:14, 9 December 2020 (UTC)
Great work on the article, . The Side effects and risks » General subsection would benefit from additional information from reliable sources (if available) because the current content suggests that the Pfizer/BioNtech and Moderna mRNA vaccines are being rushed to market. If that suggestion (implication) is true, fine. But if it's not true, i.e., if there is more evidence of safety and efficacy than the current subsection content, that should be added.   [he/his/him] 17:09, 10 December 2020 (UTC)
Thanks. I think it's a lot less unduly scary than it was. I have some difficulty with this topic because the safety/efficacy information about mRNA vaccines isn't readily available to the non-expert (you can't just get the latest Cochrane SR, for example). I suspect there is knowledge buried in more specialist sources, and this is why it would be good to have a subject-matter expert who could help here. As to &quot;rushed to market&quot; (or in the UK's case, to state provision) it seems the various regulatory agencies are insisting that they aren't cutting corners - and they are  after all, which we can but reflect.  () 17:15, 10 December 2020 (UTC)
 The BBC told me in the last few days that my anaphylactic reactions to aspirin  mean I am ineligible for the Pfizer vaccine; hope that info lands somewhere if it can be reliably sourced, as I Could Die, and don't know what's next for me wrt eventual COVID vaccine.  Hope the other vaccines don't have that issue.  [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] ()  17:28, 10 December 2020 (UTC)
 To vent a little: one of the things that is infuriating about the current situation is that while the anti-vaxxers have their material ready and are propagating it round the web, there seems to be no neat, authoritative, readable, public-facing information on this vaccine available on a page from the NHS, or similar. A lie can travel halfway around the world before the truth can get its boots on as they say.  () 17:37, 10 December 2020 (UTC)

 I've now begun the process of donating plasma for my COVID-19 antibodies. According to the consent I had to sign, there is considerable research in progress on ways of making antibodies available for those unable to have vaccine, or whose immune system is too compromised for vaccines to stimulate. It's not a perfect solution, but it's one more hope for the means by which we'll beat this virus. Cheers -- () 00:08, 11 December 2020 (UTC)

  I gave my first batch of plasma today. It took about 50 minutes and they took 560 ml of plasma in six cycles.

I'm fine and they want me to donate again in a week's time. -- () 19:18, 17 December 2020 (UTC)

I was reading this earlier today:

It has made me think that these articles need very simple, very basic explanations, like &quot;When a virus infects a cell, it permanently changes the cell's DNA.  &quot;Vaccines that use mRNA do not make permanent changes&quot; or &quot;When a cell builds components, it uses its DNA to make mRNA.  The mRNA is used to make protein components.  The mRNA is temporary and gets used up during the building process.&quot;  () 18:38, 10 December 2020 (UTC)
I think that's right. The opening sentences of RNA vaccine are bamboozling. And as for the diagram ...  () 18:45, 10 December 2020 (UTC)
Excellent point, . In the U.S., despite a federal law (the Plain Writing Act of 2010), many government agencies continue to write regulations, guidance, and documents designed to educate the public in bureaucratese instead of using [https://www.plainlanguage.gov/media/FederalPLGuidelines.pdf plain language] (PDF).

 We are still on track to run Immune system on the main page on 30 December ... with the Pfizer vaccine launch announced in the US today, it's too bad we didn't get it sooner, but who knew.

Eyes needed on Broad-spectrum therapeutic

I just came across Broad-spectrum therapeutic, a new article. Here's my potential concern: while I think it might be possible to have an article on the general concept of a broad-spectrum therapeutic, this article doesn't do that fairly. It seemingly uses two conflicting definitions of broad-spectrum therapeutic: (1) in the first sentence, the NIH source defines it essentially as any broad-spectrum antibiotic, antiviral, or antitoxin (of which there are many). (2) In the third sentence, the source defines it implicitly as a single therapeutic that is effective against more than one of [bacteria, virus, toxin, other pathogen]; simply being a broad-spectrum antibiotic is not sufficient. These two definitions conflict and it is difficult to tell which the article is about.

I'm also worried that this is  and poorly sourced relative to MEDRS standards. It's telling that the article on the &quot;only identified broad-spectrum therapeutic&quot;, Azithromycin, doesn't even have the claim that it's a &quot;broad-spectrum therapeutic&quot;. I'm not competent on MED issues, though; can someone else take a look?  (aka  ·  · ) 06:00, 19 December 2020 (UTC)

, thanks for posting this message.  I've cleaned it up a bit.  I encourage other editors to pull out their favorite textbooks and have a go at expanding it (it's only four sentences long).  () 22:43, 19 December 2020 (UTC)
Honestly, I would redirect this to Broad-spectrum antibiotic without a second's thought. It is pure recentism by the authors of the cited paper—this is not an accepted or widely used term in the pharmacology literature, and it is so vague as to be practically useless.
One could argue that nitazoxanide is an even better example of a &quot;broad-spectrum therapeutic&quot;, as it has widely proven antiprotozoal, antiviral, and antibacterial effects in vitro; however, those have not translated to clinical use, which is an essential condition for the therapeutic part. I suspect this is purely the work of champions of COVID-repurposed drugs (azithro, ivermectin, etc.) to advance their opinion.  (·) 17:22, 20 December 2020 (UTC)
In fact, we already have Broad-spectrum antibiotic and Broad-spectrum antiviral drug (which should probably be moved to Broad-spectrum antiviral). Broad-spectrum therapeutic could be a set index article.  (·) 17:27, 20 December 2020 (UTC)

Safety syringe

Apparently there's a new rumor that Safety syringes are fake.  Very few pages link to this article.  Does anyone feel inspired to  to that article?

() 00:41, 21 December 2020 (UTC)
, wait, what? The syringes themselves are allegedly fake?  () 00:53, 21 December 2020 (UTC)
, I think the story is that no injection/vaccination happens, and that they're using the equivalent of the knives used in theater performances, with retractable needles, to make it look like they're vaccinating people (at all, if you think this is a coverup and we're all going to die; or to make it look like that they're vaccinating important-seeming people, if you think the purpose of vaccines is to microchip the world, or to conveniently dispose of a couple dozen micrograms of mercury, etc.).  Because everyone knows that the needle needs to still be sticking out and able to stab you afterwards for it to be &quot;real&quot;, right?  () 02:36, 21 December 2020 (UTC)
 See [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/55364865 BBC News]. there's probably enough background there to do some work on the article. -- () 04:03, 21 December 2020 (UTC)

Help needed with Eluru outbreak

Topiramate carbonation grimace

Hello, I have  to the page Topiramate depicting myself experiencing the &quot;carbonation grimace&quot; reaction that is popularly known to occur as a side-effect of Topiramate. I am a novice editor and hope that anyone would double-check my addition to see if it meets guidelines.  () 16:55, 18 December 2020 (UTC)
Hi,  and thanks for helping to improve Wikipedia. Short clips are particularly useful on the encyclopaedia, for example, demonstrating the tics of Tourette syndrome. I'm aware of the possible side-effect on appetite of topiramate but this is the first I've heard of a &quot;carbonation grimace&quot;. I did some Googling to see if we can get a better source than &quot;Geek Mamas Magazine&quot;, per the medical sourcing guideline . I managed to find [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32462174/ one very recent case report] and a mention by the [https://americanmigrainefoundation.org/resource-library/topiramate-topamax-migraine-prevention/ American Migraine Foundation], both suggesting it may make carbonated drinks taste &quot;flat&quot;. Your Commons file description of your personal experience seems stronger than just &quot;flat&quot; and such a strong reaction you involuntarily grimace and can't bear to finish the drink. Google also turns up similar personal-experience tales.
In terms of sourcing requirements, a single case report and some forum comments don't cut the grade, nor does your personal experience I'm afraid. The AMF comment is a better source, but is just a single source, and  makes us consider whether the body of secondary literature considers this important enough to note. The major website sources on drugs (e.g. BNF, drugs.com) do mention &quot;altered taste&quot;. The topiramate article already mentions the &quot;uncommon&quot; side-effect: dysgeusia -- which is just the medical term for that. I checked the sources we use for the &quot;Adverse effects&quot; list, and they confirm it affects fewer than 10% of patients in trials. How much of that altered-taste was to carbonated drinks and how much was other tastes, we don't know.
While your description of the effect on you is real, and valid for Commons, I think if the video clip is to be retained on the Wikipedia article, we'd have to have a caption that sticks to what the reliable sources widely document: that altered taste is one of the possible side effects. And we'd need to pick one of the high quality sources that backs that up. Perhaps in future, more reliable sources will specifically document the carbonated-drink effect. -- ° 17:49, 18 December 2020 (UTC)
If we could use our own personal experiences, I'd be tempted to put &quot;tastes like malted battery acid&quot; in the articles about carbonated drinks.  ;-)  () 22:45, 19 December 2020 (UTC)

An Important Article is getting removed

I expanded the article MedPage Today, few days back from its status of redirection. It was tagged with speedy deleted and now listed for deletion discussion - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/MedPage_Today_(3rd_nomination). I have devoted too much time and improved the article great length. Please help so that a quality article can stay.  () 04:47, 28 December 2020 (UTC)

Fringe?

Would an article about a physician who promotes fringe medical theories fall within the scope of ? And also, would a separate section concerning such theories be necessary on that page. I'm specifically looking at Steven Hotze. [[User:Bait30| Bait30 ]] [[User Talk:Bait30|Talk 2 me pls?]] 02:59, 31 December 2020 (UTC)
In general, people here are interested in any  that appears on Wikipedia, but some fringe stuff can be dealt with entirely at  - and if possible, should be, since editors here are bursting at the seams dealing with COVID-19 content, so it would be bad to have unnecessary distractions here about energy healing, coffee enemas, etc. For the article you mention, I don't think there are any medical claims which require specialist input -- you don't need medical expertise to tell you that no, COVID-19 is not an invention of the &quot;deep state&quot;.

Alzheimer's disease
Alzheimer's disease is a top-rated medicine article, and consistently among our most viewed articles.  It has been six months since I gave notice on the talk page of a  needed (the article is seriously outdated), yet there has been no interest.  Unless someone indicates they have plans to update this important article, I will be submitting it to FAR next week.  [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] ()  17:12, 29 December 2020 (UTC)
On a quick glance, possibly finding a second and perhaps even third reference for the life expectancy listed in the sidebar; it's one of those very central pieces of information on which we don't want to highlight a number lower/higher than other estimates. Should be easy.  () 05:08, 30 December 2020 (UTC)
 has agreed to take a look at updating the article. She's very well acquainted with Alzheimer's disease from her day job, but is new to Wikipedia. If anyone else is interested in helping out, feel free to organize at . Otherwise, if you see Celmck around, say hello and welcome.  () 23:00, 30 December 2020 (UTC)
 Awesome!  There is a list on article talk; I'll be there.  (Should we make it Jan MCOTW?  I see there are no new nominations, on my part at least because of holiday business ... and I see we did nothing on dexamethasone, in my case, because I don't even know where to start on drug articles ... )  [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] ()  23:12, 30 December 2020 (UTC)
 Wow.  First stumbling block.  I navigated my way to our list of templates for welcoming new editors, and find not a single one that is appropriate to this instance :(  Going to look for a general (non-medical) welcome template next.  [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] ()  23:22, 30 December 2020 (UTC)
 Yes speaking of stumbling blocks, she tried the  but apparently it kept leaving her at dead ends or the little help box would cover the &quot;submit&quot; button. So we're off to a great start... Anyway, if you don't mind I was hoping we could give the article a couple of weeks while Celmck gets her sea legs and takes a look. If she decides it's not for her, or is ready for some more hands, we can make it a collaboration of the month or proceed with the FAR accordingly?  () 17:58, 31 December 2020 (UTC)
 Well, I wrote my own welcome, and then was dismayed to see her embark on that &quot;adventure&quot;, which is not likely to be extremely helpful to someone like her.  At some point, we will have to teach her about Diberri and correct citation.  I am fine with allowing ALL the time needed; I doubt that anyone else will launch a FAR in the meantime (but I will make sure there is a note on talk to that effect).

Edit warring at COVID-19 vaccine

An editor, , is edit-warring to insert content about a vaccine's efficacy into COVID-19 vaccine, based only on press releases and newspaper reports. I'd be very grateful for more eyes on the article, which is not in good shape. Thanks in advance. -- () 18:56, 27 December 2020 (UTC)
RexxS, thanks for post-- () 23:05, 28 December 2020 (UTC)

Just to let you all know; I am unwatching all vaccine and COVID articles.  Again.  Ping me if needed.  I have had severe anaphylactic reactions to both aspirin and penicillin, lucky to be a block from a hospital both times, and have been made severely ill by two different vaccines recently. I just don't need to be reading the kind of crap people are plopping in to those articles, as I am scared enough without reading laypress garbage. I hope &quot;they&quot; will eventually sort out what to do with people like me so that I can get the vaccine under the most safe scenario, but I'll be shaking in fright when I do. Just can't read those pages right now.  [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] ()  18:10, 31 December 2020 (UTC)

Psychopathy confusion
Hello, I have recently taken up writing Haltlose personality disorder - and one of the terms that keeps coming up in any discussion on Kraepelin's psychopathies is &quot;Gemütlose&quot;, the subtype with the most in similar to Haltlose (which is considered its mirror in that they are the only two of the seven psychopathies to share multiple exclusive traits). Like Haltlose, it is virtually impossible it seems to find it referenced in English-language sources...and as I try to track down its modern definition I'm left blindly fumbling. I'm seeing suggestions online that Reactive attachment disorder is what Bowlby called 'Affectionless Psychopathy', which itself was described by Emil Kraepelin, Kurt Schneider and other as one of the seven forms of psychopathy, &quot;Gemütlos/e/n&quot;, but it's not clear that these are the same disorder and not just reusing common German words perhaps in a different context. Anybody able to tell me whether Kraepelin/Schneider/other's findings on the Gemütlosen Psychopathen would belong in the RAD article or elsewhere? I'd rather not start a whole new &quot;Gemütlose psychopathy&quot; article if it is commonly considered by another name these days.  () 08:00, 28 December 2020 (UTC)

 sources are acceptable, if they are otherwise good sources.  The main problem with that subject is that basically only German psychologists believe that it's 'a thing'.  () 18:48, 28 December 2020 (UTC)
Bingo, Haltlose I can create an article on it because it is listed in the ICD-10 so it is different from Dependent PD, Borderline PD, Antisocial PD, etc which it closely resembles...but Gemütlose is not in the DSM or ICD, so I doubt I'll ever be able to make an article on it...but it seemed like possible RAD was the new name for it (I know nothing about RAD) and yet I couldn't find a source explicitly stating &quot;Gemütlose is now called...&quot; or even &quot;The diagnosis of Gemütlose was abandoned when...&quot;. Ideally even if not in its own article, I'd like to clarify that Gemütlose &quot;is now considered a combination of X and Y&quot; or &quot;Z when X is not present&quot; or something...I mean Schneider and Kraepelin are major figures in Psychopathy worldwide (though yes, Haltlose remains largely a European diagnosis limited to Germany, France, Switzerland and some Eastern European universities, and then less-academic acknowledgement of it outside those countries) - it just seems bizarre that Gemütlose alone has simply vanished without an explanation of why.  () 21:09, 28 December 2020 (UTC)

Is there an article about Haltlose personality disorder on the German Wikipedia? Just curious.   [he/his/him] 19:41, 28 December 2020 (UTC)
No.  There are articles at the Dutch, Portuguese, Romanian, and Simple English Wikipedias, but not at the German Wikipedia.  () 21:40, 28 December 2020 (UTC)

Here is a  on the article. Most editors agreed then that the article needed to be merged (somewhere).  [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] ()  21:56, 28 December 2020 (UTC)
a) No, we discussed at the time, you and one anonymous IP editor felt that way and suggested reducing a heavily sourced, heavily relevant and heavily-linked-to article about a diagnosis that exists in the ICD-10 should be reduced to a passing mention in &quot;some other article somewhere&quot; ignoring the fact it's larger than just about any article into which it could be merged. It has 154 different sources almost entirely drawn from peer-reviewed medical journals, textbooks and other reliable sources. Also, this question is not about Haltlose, I am asking about Gemütlose Psychopathy which is one of Kraepelin's seven types. Please do not misrepresent past discussions, nor drag this one off-course. In case I am at fault for not conveying it clearly, let's talk about Gemütlose - specifically, my question of whether anyone has any ability to find out if it has a modern name, or is strictly historical and abandoned. If coming to this page to ask medical questions just results in &quot;people&quot; calling for my pages to be deleted (without success) I'm liable to stop reaching out for help. That wouldn't be good for anyone.  () 01:55, 29 December 2020 (UTC)
It only &quot;exists&quot; in the ICD under the label &quot;Other specific personality disorders&quot;, along with examples such as Passive–aggressive personality disorder.   () 17:46, 29 December 2020 (UTC)

To put it in perspective, in 1940 The Lancet itself suggested that Adolf Hitler might be a prime example, since &quot;it may seem that to include Hitler among the Gemutlose psychopaths is to question a diagnosis which puts him in another group, the hysterical psychopaths. But all, Koch, Kraepelin, Schneider, Kahn, Henderson and the rest who have written about psycohapthic states have insisted...&quot;, etc[https://coek.info/pdf-the-mind-of-hitler-da26beeaf104972b0a8638616766173691462.html]. So it has notability, but it's just...disappeared? I assume it's just renamed...I need somebody with more familiarity with the subject of psychopathy specifically :\  () 03:30, 29 December 2020 (UTC)
Did the Lancet say that in 1940, or did a letter-writer say that in the Lancet? —  () 17:59, 29 December 2020 (UTC)
Fair question, but looks like [https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(00)60895-4/fulltext an article first], and then five issues later [https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(00)70598-8/fulltext a letter with the same title]. Regardless, not trying to use it as an RS or anything right now, just asking for help hunting down whatever happened to the idea of Gemutlose Psychopathy, and specifically since its &quot;alt name&quot; is Affectionless Psychopathy, and the &quot;alt name&quot; for RAD these days is Affectionless Psychopathy...are they the same? Or did it get coined as an alt for X, then X was abandoned, then somebody recycled the alt name for Y? Is X Y? Just looking for research help to find the answer, not WP policy on what to do when not knowing such an answer.  () 00:35, 30 December 2020 (UTC)
Have you tried e-mailing any of the authors on recent papers?  I've found some authors to be very willing to answer a question if you tell them you're a volunteer working on a Wikipedia article and want to make sure that you're getting it right.  (Other times, I get no response.)  () 17:10, 30 December 2020 (UTC)
I hadn't, even though I did find a professor currently at University of Cologne who seemed to perhaps have a grasp of it - so that's a great idea, thanks. It'll at least tell me I'm headed in the right direction - I think I've found a source today saying that it was merged into the modern definition of Antisocial personality disorder but I want to make sure about that. It's a fascinating historical subject, similar to Haltlose (still recognized today) or Hysteria, etc.  () 19:01, 31 December 2020 (UTC)

Chinese research on COVID in China

Interesting article from AP
*
which says that all COVID-related Chinese research benefits from the &quot;guidance&quot; of a govt. committee through which it must be cleared prior to publication. Not sure how this might affect our content. I note in Timeline of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019 we cite PMID 32973152, with 2 (of 3) Chinese academic authors, for saying that it seems the virus did not originate in China after all ...  () 15:59, 31 December 2020 (UTC)
As reliable as Chinese sources about woo then, and we should treat them as such. -  16:19, 31 December 2020 (UTC)
I think that might be an overreaction, Roxy.  It would be appropriate to use  attribution in such a situation.  () 19:06, 31 December 2020 (UTC)</segment>
