 General Visceral Efferent Fibers 

The page on this ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GVE ) is a little confusing. My understanding of GVEs is that they only contain parasympathetic outputs from the brainstem; however, 90% of this article, as well as the image, is devoted to explaining sympathetic output from the thoracic cord. 

At the very least, the way the article is currently written seems to imply that CN 3,7,9,10 contain SNS, as opposed to PNS. ser:Corvus.ag|corvus.ag (ser talk:Corvus.ag|talk) 20:06, 2 May 2009 (UTC)

 Society for Neuroscience 

If you can take a break from the swine flu, I noticed [http://www.sfn.org/index.aspx?pagename=wikipedia_main this page] about the Society for Neuroscience undertaking to improve neuroscience-related articles on Wikipedia.

 Request for obstetrical input on disputed ome birth article 

The WP article on ome birth could use some input from medical professionals. There have been safety and other claims put forward which are PoV and probably should not be part of this article. I've only been there because of a request on the NPoV board, not as an expert. But it is fairly obvious that the article's slant, and perhaps the facts being put forth, may contain serious error. The partisanship to date may require more serious intervention than I can offer. ser:Astynax|Astynax (ser talk:Astynax|talk) 06:16, 3 May 2009 (UTC)

 Offwiki RfC 

This isn't exactly about Wikipedia, but it may interest some editors:  The U.S. ational Institutes of Health is [http://prsinfo.clinicaltrials.gov/Clinical_Trials_FRN31609_POST.pdf requesting comments] about the possibility of expanding the results section of the clinicaltrials.gov website.  Currently, researchers are required to report, in tabular form, the &quot;basic results information&quot; from each listed trial, such as the demographics and measurements for each major outcome, on a schedule tied to FDA approval work.  Narrative text has been prohibited primarily because of concerns about what Wikipedia would call P:NPOV issues.

There are ten specific questions open in this RfC, and several of them, such as how to present technical information so that non-experts can understand it, and how to make the information be accurate and unbiased, seem like areas that experienced Wikipedia editors understand extremely well.  If you have an interest in this area, or some suggestions for them, or if you have an idea about how their reports could be made more useful to our work here at Wikipedia, then please consider submitting your comments or suggestions to Docket No. NIH–2009–0002 at http://www.regulations.gov/ before Monday, June 22, 2009.  (This process is open to &quot;all interested parties&quot;, not merely U.S. citizens.

 Pageview stats 

After a recent request on my talk page, I added the Medicine project to the list of projects to compile monthly pageview stats for. The data is the same used by http://stats.grok.se/en/ but the program is different, and includes the aggregate views from all redirects to each page. The stats are at ikipedia:WikiProject Medicine/Popular pages.

The page will be updated monthly with new data. The edits aren't marked as bot edits, so they will show up in watchlists. I can also provide the full data for any project covered by the bot if requested, though I normally don't keep it for much longer than a week after the list is generated. If you have any comments or suggestions, please let me know. Thanks!

 Is MDMA/Ecstasy article within the scope of this project? 

Is ,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine article within the scope of this project? I tried to apply P:MEDMOS conventions arguing in favor of renaming the article back to MDMA (see here [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:3,4-Methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine#Article_Name_Change-Serious_Issue]) and was told that MEDMOS does not apply. I would appreciate you input. ser:The Sceptical Chymist|The Sceptical Chymist (ser talk:The Sceptical Chymist|talk) 10:41, 6 May 2009 (UTC)
That article is not currently tagged by this project, so probably not.  It's possible that it would still be sufficiently &quot;medicine-related&quot; for parts of MEDMOS to be helpful.  However, please remember that the existence of MEDMOS (a guideline) does not give you a free pass to ignore the P:NC|main naming conventions policy.  
In the specific case, there are half a dozen 'official' names for this compound.  I think that the editors at the page are going to have to do the hard work of having a full discussion and using good judgment to make a decision.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:03, 6 May 2009 (UTC)

 Position of History section 

Arising from the P:Peer review/Oxygen toxicity/archive1#Oxygen toxicity|Peer Review of Oxygen toxicity, it was suggested that the article would benefit from the History section being moved nearer the top (after Signs and symptoms). I've read through P:MOSMED#Diseases/disorders/syndromes several times and checked the talk page there, but remain unsure how prescriptive the order of sections really is. My instinct is to follow the order given (for consistency between articles), but do not wish to disregard a peer-reviewer's suggestions unless necessary. Can anybody help me out in deciding the best position of the History section? Thanks in advance. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 20:44, 7 May 2009 (UTC)
Hey RexxS, notice that MEDMOS is a guideline, not a policy, and is therefore descriptive not prescriptive. The MEDMOS headings are suggested, but not always required. Unfortunately I haven't got enough time to look at the article tonight, I'll leave that to someone else, but I thought I'd let you know that MEDMOS isn't always followed. That said, the order given is also often the best course of action. Regards, --—ser:Cyclonenim|Cyclonenim |ser_talk:Cyclonenim| Chat  21:27, 7 May 2009 (UTC)

I just created Category:Medical procedures as a subcategory of Category:Medical treatments.  Many articles currently in Category:Medical treatments could be moved to Category:Medical procedures.

Any surgical procedures should be placed only in Category:Surgical procedures, which is a subcategory of Category:Medical procedures.  --ser:Scottalter|Scott Alter 00:08, 9 May 2009 (UTC)

 Review move 

What do you think of the following move: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Henoch-Sch%C3%B6nlein_purpura&amp;action=history].  Could we just make an &quot;HSP&quot; redirect? ---ser:Kilbad|kilbad (ser talk:Kilbad|talk) 18:55, 8 May 2009 (UTC)

That might reduce its attractiveness to spammers.  Another reasonable option might be to pick an arbitrary year -- say, 1950, or 50 years ago, or something like that -- and admit individuals to the list only if they began practicing before that date, or only if they had quit seeing patients at least ten years ago, or something like that.  That might let you include some retired or elderly people, while reducing the risk that the vast majority of people currently in practice could use it as an advertising opportunity.  I'm sure you could come up with several acceptable schemes (&quot;dead&quot; certainly has the advantage of being easily sourced and easily understood).
If you're determined to organize it in a table, then I might combine the four columns you suggest into two (name/dates in one column; contribution/refs in another), and add location (continent/country/local, so &quot;Europe, United Kingdom, London&quot; or &quot;North America, USA, Texas&quot;) for the third.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 20:01, 2 May 2009 (UTC)

 uddha Jumps Over the Wall 

uddha Jumps Over the Wall, a variety of hark fin soup, is currently on the main page as a DYK.  Unfortunately, the lead section makes two extraordinary health claims: 1) It is an aid in digestion, and ;2) It claims to be a good health supplement in the summer.  Both claims are sourced to a popular Korean newspaper oongAng Ilbo.  Now, while it may or may not be possible to attribute such health claims in the body of the article, their placement in the lead is deceptive, and it insists the dish is both a digestive aid and health supplement.  When one looks closer at this, it appears to be rooted in belief that shark fin cartilage has anti-cancer properties.  It might be a good idea to discuss based on the evidence, rather than asserting outright health benefits that have not been proved.  I don't think the health claims that are sourced to a popular newspaper should appear in the lead section, per P:MEDRS.  How do I proceed?  I have opened a discussion on the talk page, alk:Buddha_Jumps_Over_the_Wall#Aids in digestion|here.

There should be a comma, because hand is not modifying foot.

The hyphen is grammatically correct, but it is rarely used (in journal articles; it is never used outside them).

One more question:  Is HCL really a &quot;lymphoid-related skin condition&quot;?  Is that category going to be materially different from lymphoid-related conditions in general?  I don't usually think of leukemias as skin conditions, or as liver conditions, or brain conditions -- although leukemic cells can and do infiltrate all of those body parts.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 00:51, 12 May 2009 (UTC)

Thank you for your reply.  In response to your comments, most of my work right now is on the ist of skin-related conditions, and in the process crawling that list, I periodically come across articles for which I am uncertain (1) what the article versus redirect titles should be, or (2) how the article title punctuation should be treated.  If, then, I am uncertain about something, or if the existing article title is not the same as the ICD codes, then I try to post a question here to see how the community feels about the issue. ---ser:Kilbad|kilbad (ser talk:Kilbad|talk) 15:32, 12 May 2009 (UTC)

With regard to lymphoid-related skin conditions, the conditions I am planning on placing in that category are listed at ist_of_skin-related_conditions#Lymphoid-related, which was developed from several unabridged dermatology texts (namely Andrews and Fitzpatrick's (see P:DERM:REF for full citations)).  I hope this helps? ---ser:Kilbad|kilbad (ser talk:Kilbad|talk) 15:31, 12 May 2009 (UTC)

So, with regard to airy cell leukemia, should the actual article be moved to airy-cell leukemia? ---ser:Kilbad|kilbad (ser talk:Kilbad|talk) 15:33, 12 May 2009 (UTC)

About the specific article, I'd P:RETAIN the original title.
So &quot;skin-related conditions&quot; means &quot;any condition that has any possible manifestation in the skin, even if it is not derived from the skin&quot;?  Put another way, can you think of a single hematological malignancy that has never been seen to infiltrate other organs, such as the skin?  If we add a cat for skin, then we really need to add a cat for every organ that could be affected, and it just seems P:DUE|so unimportant.  Leukemias and lymphomas are not fundamentally dermatological conditions even when they are visible in the skin.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:50, 12 May 2009 (UTC)

The ist_of_skin-related_conditions|article is a &quot;list of skin-related conditions of or affecting the human integumentary system,&quot; so I think it is important to include hematologic malignancies that have been known to affect the skin. ---ser:Kilbad|kilbad (ser talk:Kilbad|talk) 18:00, 12 May 2009 (UTC)
HCL (as an example) is also known to do exactly what it does to the skin to other organs, including (offhand) the brain, the spine, the gut, the liver, the spleen, the lungs, the pelvis, the femur, the blood vessels, and probably more.  The list is highly similar for every form of leukemia and lymphoma.  So leaving aside the list, do you think that the HCL article needs to be tagged with:
* Category:Lymphoid-related central nervous system conditions
* Category:Lymphoid-related digestive conditions
* Category:Lymphoid-related liver conditions
* Category:Lymphoid-related spleen conditions
* Category:Lymphoid-related lung conditions
* Category:Lymphoid-related pelvis conditions
* Category:Lymphoid-related femur conditions
* Category:Lymphoid-related vascular conditions
and so forth?  Or does it seem a little silly to you to add a cat for each and every location in the body that might be infiltrated by leukemic cells?  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:16, 12 May 2009 (UTC)

Thank you for your reply.  To begin, there are several primary cutaneous T-cell lymphomas that arise from the skin, and which, at times, may spread internally.  I think the most notable example would be ycosis fungoides, but, again, there are others.  Therefore, there are lymphoid-related conditions of, and not just affecting, the skin.  With that being stated, I think both are appropriate for inclusion within the ist_of_skin-related_conditions; however, I understand the point you are making, and would not object if we were only to include primary (i.e. arising from the skin) lymphoid-related conditions in the Category:Lymphoid-related skin conditions. ---ser:Kilbad|kilbad (ser talk:Kilbad|talk) 18:28, 12 May 2009 (UTC)
With the caveat that even cutaneous leukemias technically arise from lymphocytes (that happen to be located in the skin) instead of from the skin itself, that sounds fine to me.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 04:19, 13 May 2009 (UTC)

 ron overload disorder - page move 

ron overload disorder should be moved to ron overload, which is the condition of having too much iron stored in the body. There are no pages called &quot;Iron deficiency disorder&quot;, &quot;Anemia disorder&quot; or &quot;Hypertension disorder&quot;. ser:Tocant|Tocant (ser talk:Tocant|talk) 14:51, 12 May 2009 (UTC)

Actually, I think it should move to either ron overload disorders or to ist of iron overload disorders:  it's a glorified P:DAB|disambiguation page instead of a proper article about iron overload.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:49, 13 May 2009 (UTC)
I agree - I think a move to ron overload disorders would be good. The page could then briefly summarize iron overload disorders as a group, including the common pathophysiological and clinical elements, and then provide links to various specific iron overload disorders (hemochromatosis, transfusional iron overload, PCT, etc). ser:MastCell|MastCell ser Talk:MastCell|Talk 18:55, 13 May 2009 (UTC)
Yes, but the article should be expanded with symptoms, complications and treatment. The current content would become &quot;causes/classfication&quot;. This would duplicate some content from aemochromatosis, but is similar to the structure of the article about nemia which has a classification section and also lists the different causes (hemolytic, megaloblastic, iron deficiency...), which all have their own articles. I think ron overload is more correct in this context, since it is the medical condition. &quot;Iron overload disorder&quot; just means &quot;disorder that causes iron overload&quot; and there are in general no lists of this kind on Wikipedia for every medical condition (&quot;Iron deficiency disorders&quot;, &quot;Obesity disorders&quot;, ...). Also, multiple blood transfusions may cause iron overload, but that is not really a &quot;disorder&quot;? ser:Tocant|Tocant (ser talk:Tocant|talk) 19:21, 13 May 2009 (UTC)
There is some ambiguity about when aemochromatosis is referring to FE (gene)|HFE-linked conditions, and when it is used in a more general sense. If the content is going to be be rearranged, this might be a good time to address that ambiguity. --ser:Arcadian|Arcadian (ser talk:Arcadian|talk) 20:13, 13 May 2009 (UTC)
Agreed, it has to be structured in a good way. Iron overload is a somewhat confusing subject since the mutations responsible for the hereditary forms were not discovered until recently. &quot;Hemochromatosis&quot; has sometimes been used as an equivalent to iron overload in general, but I think that is changing. There are also articles on Hemochromatosis type 3, neonatal hemochromatosis and juvenile hemochromatosis that could be seen as separate diseases or variants of hemochromatosis. Then there is the term &quot;Hemosiderosis&quot; that could refer to &quot;iron overload in general&quot;, &quot;hemochromatosis&quot;, &quot;the process of accumulation of hemosiderin&quot; or just be used as a word in the terms &quot;transfusion hemosiderosis&quot; or &quot;idiopathic pulmonary haemosiderosis&quot;. I think the most logical structure would be to have Iron overload (the opposite of Iron deficiency) as the main article (in a similar way that the article about Anemia defines &quot;low hemoglobin&quot; and discusses causes/classifications, diagnosis and complications among other things) since this is the end result of all conditions. The problem might be that hemochromatosis (type 1, HFE mutation) is responsible for most cases of iron overload and that there would be a lot of duplicated content, however as it is now the other forms of iron overload have almost no information about the effects of iron overload. This is just my opinion however and there might be a better solution. ser:Tocant|Tocant (ser talk:Tocant|talk) 20:56, 13 May 2009 (UTC)

While Wikipedia does not have the exact articles you name, it does have some highly similar ones, such as nborn error of lipid metabolism, ovement disorder, and utrition disorder.
What you describe here might be best as a completely new article, instead of a change to this one.  Wikipedia ultimately needs both a description of the &quot;too much iron here&quot; aspect and a list of &quot;all the specific diseases you might be looking for&quot;. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 21:11, 13 May 2009 (UTC)
You might be right, although I'm not too sure about the name &quot;Iron overload disorders&quot;, maybe &quot;Causes of iron overload&quot; or &quot;Forms of iron overload&quot; in that case? Nevertheless, it probably could be just a subsection of &quot;Iron overload&quot; in that case, i don't know. There is still however, as Arcadian pointed out, the issue of correctly defining &quot;iron overload&quot;/&quot;hemochromatosis&quot;/&quot;hemosiderosis&quot;. Theoretically aemochromatosis could be moved to &quot;Hemochromatosis, type 1&quot; but that might not be a very good idea since it is almost always called only &quot;hemochromatosis&quot;. The term &quot;hereditary haemochromatosis&quot; (only HFE-linked???) is also confusing since it implies that hemochromatosis could mean just &quot;iron overload&quot;. And then there is iderosis. Primary and secondary iron overload is at least easy to define (genetic vs. not genetic), although there could be an interaction of the two causes... ser:Tocant|Tocant (ser talk:Tocant|talk) 22:09, 13 May 2009 (UTC)
I'd support moving aemochromatosis to &quot;Hemochromatosis, type 1&quot;, moving the non-HFE content in that article into ron overload disorder, and adding hatnotes to the top of both articles to help orient people who were used the idea that HFE=Hemochromatosis. --ser:Arcadian|Arcadian (ser talk:Arcadian|talk) 23:22, 13 May 2009 (UTC)

I came here to start a discussion but see that it has already been started.

Surely we may need a more proper definition of extraordinary. Basically, I started the article as a medical/psychological version of ist of unusual deaths. It defines its inclusions as unique, or extremely rare circumstances – recorded throughout history. Perhaps we'll phrase this one similarly. Frankly, it's rather ist of unusual deaths that should be rephrased to list of extraordinary deaths, since it doesn't include deaths from very unusual diseases or every less rare death of prominent people. Rather, it seems it has found some implicit equilibrium among its editors of what is included and not. Furthermore, this article is not meant to stigmatize any people with any of the conditions, e.g. making people believe that all people with Tourette syndrome exhibit coprolalia. Preferably, it merely states the definitions of the terms where possible. ser:Mikael Häggström|Mikael Häggström (ser talk:Mikael Häggström|talk) 13:41, 17 May 2009 (UTC)

Perhaps changing it to diseases and conditions with unusual or rare presentations/symptoms or causes will make it more neutral? After all, that's what separates this list from a mere ist of rare diseases. The only major change is that the conditions themselves don't have to be rare or unusual, as long as the presentations/symptoms are, and I'm ok with that. ser:Mikael Häggström|Mikael Häggström (ser talk:Mikael Häggström|talk) 14:12, 17 May 2009 (UTC)

So, similar to Category:Rare diseases, you want Category:Rare signs and symptoms?  --ser:Una Smith|Una Smith (ser talk:Una Smith|talk) 14:32, 17 May 2009 (UTC)

Having such a category or not doesn't matter - I prefer an overview with short explanations. But yes, that would be among the basic criteria for inclusion. ser:Mikael Häggström|Mikael Häggström (ser talk:Mikael Häggström|talk) 14:49, 17 May 2009 (UTC)
However, there would often only be one condition for each sign (e.g. fused legs in sirenomelia), and there is no need for a separate article on fused legs. If we are going to introduce an additional category as well, it would rather go something like Category:Diseases and conditions with rare signs and symptoms. ser:Mikael Häggström|Mikael Häggström (ser talk:Mikael Häggström|talk) 15:16, 17 May 2009 (UTC)

Inclusion of what?  The scope still is unclear.  A common disease can have a rare presentation, which may have no diagnostic value or high diagnostic value, depending on what other causes of the presentation exist.  Also, rare and common are relative.  For example, the recurrent fever that is typical of malaria is uncommon in the United States but common where malaria is common.  Yet, where malaria is common, a recurrent fever has low diagnostic value (see alaria). --ser:Una Smith|Una Smith (ser talk:Una Smith|talk) 15:22, 17 May 2009 (UTC)

All right, symptoms may need to be specified with pathognomonic symptoms or symptoms of high diagnostic value. And unusual/rare may need to be specified that it is mainly relative to other diseases and conditions. Recurrent or periodic fever may be typical in malaria, but also appears in many other diseases (e.g. all the ones listed in eriodic fever syndrome), motivating against inclusion. ser:Mikael Häggström|Mikael Häggström (ser talk:Mikael Häggström|talk) 15:47, 17 May 2009 (UTC)

There are an awful lot of [http://www.rarediseases.org/search/rdblist.html rare diseases] (the NORD database documents 1,150), each fascinating in their own way but perhaps such a list would test the patience of any reader.

I admit it mainly is a synthesis from contents from the main articles, but I didn't exaggerate it to make it seem more fantastic. For instance, the main article on ecrotizing fasciitis said that debridement is the only treatment available, when in fact it may rather be the only first-line treatment, and uinea worm disease still says that the stick method is the only treatment, while there actually are antiparasitic drugs nowadays. But surely, the article would improve by ongoing review and addition of sources. ser:Mikael Häggström|Mikael Häggström (ser talk:Mikael Häggström|talk) 16:41, 17 May 2009 (UTC)

I also think that verifying the rareness of a presenting symptom is really difficult: are there any sources for example for how many patients present with &quot;accelerated ageing&quot; as a symptom, that might indicate progeria?

I agree that the list may tend to promote facts that are of interest to the human reader, making the inclusions deviate slightly from what would have been included by a review and selection among all known diseases based strictly upon the criteria.

verifiability
I think we need to focus on the single issue of P:V (that is, how to prevent the decision to include an item, or not include an item, from being P:OR violation).  Are we likely to find P:RS|reliable sources that say &quot;this disease is bizarre&quot; or &quot;this is a bit strange, or uncommon, but really not really sufficiently odd&quot;?  Otherwise, it's just going to be &quot;well, I think this should be included, because I personally think it's weird-looking&quot;, and we can't have that.  We must have actual independent reliable sources that are making the ordinary/extraordinary decision for us.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 02:39, 18 May 2009 (UTC)

I agree it is an issue, but I don't think that sources that specifically state &quot;this is bizarre&quot; etc is a solution. Rather, I think we shouldn't do anything - for now. Currently, the included conditions basically fulfill what is said in the introduction, and the main problem is what might be added from now on. So I think we should wait and see what kind of additional entries may show up - &quot;know our enemies&quot; as Sun Tzu would have put it - and from there on develop specific inclusion (or exclusion) criteria (like antibodies) to make our article what we want it to be with minimal OR. As long as the list hasn't become inconveniently long, I'd actually accept some relatively less fantastic or grotesque diseases and conditions as well.  ser:Mikael Häggström|Mikael Häggström (ser talk:Mikael Häggström|talk) 12:38, 18 May 2009 (UTC)

An AfD tag to discuss it in this article specifically would be the wrong way to go - I'd rather bring it to an even more centralized place, because the main issue (that is, defining &quot;unusual&quot; without the risk of committing original research) is not specific for this case. Indeed, there is a whole Category:Lists of things considered unusual, and if we would open up an AfD, then it would be most fair to do it in all of those articles at the same time, or at least some of them, if we want more attention to the subject. ser:Mikael Häggström|Mikael Häggström (ser talk:Mikael Häggström|talk) 15:03, 18 May 2009 (UTC)
See P:OTHERCRAPEXISTS. I'm no AfD expert, but unless a set of articles are highly regular in both name and content, a class-action AfD is not productive.  While &quot;unusual&quot; or &quot;extraordinary&quot; are probably hard to quantify objectively for any subject, the similar term &quot;rare&quot; is not. It is possible to set a population threshold below which a disease is considered rare. As long as that arbitrary threshold has some authority behind it, then it could be a useful WP list or category entry criterion.
I didn't intend a P:ALLORNOTHING or anything like that - it was merely a suggestion of how to get more advice from contributors from similar pages.

So I took a look at some of the other articles in the cat named above, just to get some perspective.  Here's what I find:
* lace names considered unusual is filled with refs like &quot;Odd or Interesting Irish Place Names&quot;, &quot;Alberta has its share of striking and unusual place names&quot;, Newfoundland Placenames: &quot;Newfoundland has the most unusual collection of place names of any country in the world&quot;,  and&quot;Arkansas's Colorful Names Amuse Some, Intrigue Others&quot;.
* At ist of unusual personal names, I find refs like &quot;The most unusual footballer names ever&quot; from Guardian Unlimited and &quot;NZ judge orders 'odd' name change&quot; from the BBC News, and others that are indicative of unusual issues, like &quot;Couple Fights To Name Baby 'Metallica', Swedish Couple Locked In Court Battle With Authorities&quot; from CBS News. 
* At ist of chemical compounds with unusual names, I find refs like a book entitled Molecules with Silly or Unusual Names (SBN|9781848162075).
* At ist of unusual deaths, I find refs filled with words like &quot;unusual&quot;, &quot;mysterious&quot;, &quot;curious&quot;, &quot;strange&quot; and &quot;odd&quot;.  

By contrast, at this one, I find -- nothing.  There's not a single source that says that these conditions are &quot;unusual&quot; in any sense other than &quot;not very common&quot;.  Therefore, I have to assume that the decision to include an item, or to not include an item, is based solely on the personal opinion of the editor adding the item, instead of being P:V|verifiably based on P:RS|reliable sources.  

If Wikipedia is going to have a list of medical conditions that make people stare, then every item in it needs to be supported by a ref that specifically identifies the condition as the sort of thing that makes people stare.  Similar articles have managed to do this, and this one must, or it must be sent to AfD.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:23, 18 May 2009 (UTC)

Actually, the list itself in lace names considered unusual doesn't contain a single reference, and others have the same issue. But I get the point that there need to be external references stating that the conditions are extraordinary or of unusual character, and I'll look into it. ser:Mikael Häggström|Mikael Häggström (ser talk:Mikael Häggström|talk) 18:00, 18 May 2009 (UTC)
Um, what do you think is in lace names considered unusual#References, if it's not the refs I named?  If you, for example, go to the Newfoundland ref, you'll see that ildo, Newfoundland is named in the ref.  The editor simply didn't repeat the lead's ref in the list.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:15, 18 May 2009 (UTC)
Ok, sorry, I didn't catch that structure. Anyhow, I'm very optimistic that this article can be be referenced at least as acceptably. ser:Mikael Häggström|Mikael Häggström (ser talk:Mikael Häggström|talk) 19:14, 18 May 2009 (UTC)

I don't think it will be swiftly deleted: List of unusual deaths survived 5 AfDs. It will hopefully attract more opinions.

 GA Sweeps invitation 

This message is being sent to WikiProjects with P:GA|GAs under their scope. Since August 2007, ikipedia:WikiProject Good articles|WikiProject Good Articles has been participating in ikipedia:WikiProject Good articles/Project quality task force/Sweeps|GA sweeps. The process helps to ensure that articles that have passed a nomination before that date meet the P:WIAGA|GA criteria. After nearly two years, the ikipedia:WikiProject Good articles/Project quality task force/Sweeps/Running total|running total has just passed the 50% mark. In order to expediate the reviewing, several changes have been made to the process. A ikipedia:WikiProject Good articles/Project quality task force/Sweeps worklist|new worklist has been created, detailing which articles are left to review. Instead of reviewing by topic, editors can consider picking and choosing whichever articles they are interested in.

We are always looking for new members to assist with reviewing the remaining articles, and since this project has GAs under its scope, it would be beneficial if any of its members could review a few articles (perhaps your project's articles). Your project's members are likely to be more knowledgeable about your topic GAs then an outside reviewer. As a result, reviewing your project's articles would improve the quality of the review in ensuring that the article meets your project's concerns on sourcing, content, and guidelines. However, members can also review any other article in the worklist to ensure it meets the GA criteria.

If any members are interested, please visit the ikipedia:WikiProject Good articles/Project quality task force/Sweeps|GA sweeps page for further details and instructions in initiating a review. If you'd like to join the process, please add your name to the ikipedia:WikiProject Good articles/Project quality task force/Sweeps/Running total|running total page. In addition, for every member that reviews 100 articles from the ikipedia:WikiProject Good articles/Project quality task force/Sweeps worklist|worklist or has a significant impact on the process, s/he will get an award when they reach that threshold. With ~1,300 articles left to review, we would appreciate any editors that could contribute in helping to uphold the quality of GAs. If you have any questions about the process, reviewing, or need help with a particular article, please contact me or ser:OhanaUnited|OhanaUnited and we'll be happy to help. --Happy editing! ser:Nehrams2020|Nehrams2020 (ser talk:Nehrams2020|talk • pecial:Contributions/Nehrams2020|contrib) 05:09, 20 May 2009 (UTC)

 Re Category:Viral skin conditions 

I have been try to populate and refine this category, and in doing so, I have come to feel that a rename is probably warranted.  Currently, there are conditions in the category that may affect both the skin and mucous membranes, therefore, I was thinking about renaming it to something like Category:Virus-related cutaneous conditions.

 Capitalization 

eishmaniasis americana is synonymous with ucocutaneous leishmaniasis, and my question is this, should &quot;americana&quot; be capitalized? ---ser:Kilbad|kilbad (ser talk:Kilbad|talk) 18:02, 8 May 2009 (UTC)

My husband, who knows much more about Latin than I, says that it is &quot;not necessary&quot; to capitalize it.  I can add that if this were a species name, instead of a disease name, then it would certainly not be capitalized.  So perhaps in the absence of a good reason to capitalize, it would be left lowercase. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 21:07, 10 May 2009 (UTC)
Sounds good. ---ser:Kilbad|kilbad (ser talk:Kilbad|talk) 15:05, 11 May 2009 (UTC)

In general, genus species should either be italicized or underlined when handwriting because handwriting italics is difficult.  Genus is capitalized, species is not.  This leads to the follow up question:  On Wikipedia, when the article title is also a genus species classification, should they be italicized?  It also seems that throughout Wikipedia there is a lot of inconsistency on this.  Often genus species classifications are left uninitialized. I bring this up because I have had some biology professors who were maniacal about this point.  They would take points off of tests for not underlining genus species.  (They would also take off points for underlining the space between genus| |species.  Apparently that space is sacred and should not be underlined! (or italicized, for that matter...)

So, what is the Wikipedia style policy on genus species?  Always italicize, genus capitalized, species lowercase?  If that is the case, I can try to make a point to change them when I run into them. ser:Mba123|Mba123 (ser talk:Mba123|talk) 13:30, 21 May 2009 (UTC)

I do not believe that the number of redlinks is a valid metric for the level of maintenance that these lists receive.
The point behind the lists is that they are (1) relatively complete and (2) alphabetical, so that if someone knows the beginning of the name for a disease, s/he has a chance of finding it.  It really is not appropriate to create navboxes with thousands of items in them, and splitting up the list by subject area (which is what the navboxes do) defeats the purpose.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:34, 21 May 2009 (UTC)

*FLU SYMPTOMS — Symptoms of the flu can vary from person to person, but usually include a fever, headache, muscle aches, and fatigue; cough and sore throat may also be present. People with the flu usually have fevers for two to five days, in contrast to fevers in other upper respiratory viruses that usually resolve after 24 to 48 hours.

Some people experience cold-like symptoms while others have fever and muscle aches. Symptoms usually improve over two to five days, although the illness may last for a week or more.

And the CDC says at [http://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/sick.htm What to Do If You Get Flu-Like Symptoms]: &quot;The symptoms of this new H1N1 flu virus in people are similar to the symptoms of seasonal flu and include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headache, chills and fatigue.

 Reactive arthritis 

Hey folks. I've recently been making a number of changes/additions to the eactive arthritis article. However, I Am Not A Doctor (although, at the risk of getting mugged, I'll own up to an MPH and a law degree focusing on medlaw - yes, I'm one of those, please don't hurt me), and I'm especially not a rheumatologist, so can I recruit an expert witness?

 Cardiomyopthrapy and possible infection causes 

By accident, my doctor found that I do have this disease to the heart.  After wearing the defibulator vest, taking heart medicine for three months, there was no significant change, so later that month I was operated on and received a defibulator/pacemaker implant.  

My question is&quot; my doctor can not understand why my heart rate is high when I work out at the gym; as high as 165 and higher.  The medicine should control the heart rate but in my case it doesn't .  He requested another opinion by a specialist, and to consult with my doctor at his findings.

I had polio as a child in the mid 40's and couldn't walk for a few years.  I had the Sister Kenney method at Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago, and I did have parolitic polio.  My question is : would this virus have caused any heart problems later in my life?  I have always been very healthy, and until this problem, I never ever had any chest pain or fatigue at all. Could polio have caused my heart problem???

 rigger point 

This article is, on the surface, a pseudoscientific disaster zone. The discussion rests largely on one rather old key text, and two apparently substantive 2008 studies (Chen et al., Shah et al.) The latter two receive duplicate mentions, in language that is euphoric and lifted directly from an abstract of a medical editorial.  Neither the methodology, the findings, nor the technical terminology (nociceptors, etc.) is explained in any specific, lay terms. It is graded &quot;B&quot; in quality, but strikes me as much poorer than that.

This topic is fascinating, but it could benefit greatly from some calm, knowledgable vetting by interested specialists in physiology or physical therapy.  I am not calling for censorship, but I am calling for help in restoring balance either to the treatment context or to the evidentiary weight behind it.

Thank you very much for all of your good work on the Medical articles. -a.k.a. [just not logged in]pecial:Contributions/71.178.65.59|71.178.65.59 (ser talk:71.178.65.59|talk) 21:28, 29 May 2009 (UTC)

* Since I edit autism-related articles a lot, I couldn't resist reading [http://wiki.medpedia.com/Autism Medpedia's page on autism]. At first I was not at all impressed, as the article starts off on the wrong foot by making a completely incorrect claim (its lead sentence says that classic autism is the most common of the autism spectrum disorders, which is incorrect: PDD-NOS is). However, in reading the rest of the article I found that while the article is overall inferior to Wikipedia's utism in many ways, its heart is clearly in the right place with respect to fairly describing mainstream opinion, and in some areas (e.g., its list of therapies) the article can be the source of ideas to improve utism.
* Perhaps it's not fair to compare Medpedia to a featured article, so I went further and looked at [http://wiki.medpedia.com/Tay-Sachs_Disease its article on Tay-Sachs disease]. This article is, I think, better than what's in Wikipedia's ay-Sachs disease, in that it covers the overall topic better (even though it's much worse in covering the history of our understanding of the disorder).
That's just two examples, but it does look like Medpedia would be a useful source to check for the coverage and weight of Wikipedia articles, and perhaps in some cases to copy some content (with appropriate attribution). Any copying would have to be made from Medpedia's content pages only; we can't copy from Medpedia's talk pages, or from its &quot;accredited&quot; pages, as they are not distributed under the GFDL terms.[http://www.medpedia.com/terms] ser:Eubulides|Eubulides (ser talk:Eubulides|talk) 21:51, 1 June 2009 (UTC)

 Hereditary spastic paraplegia

#It was vandalized (lot of useful stuff removed) a while back and I had to manually put a few things back since there were normal edits in the mean time. Anyone please feel free to check I didn't miss anything.
#I was going through the process of adding all the subtypes in a neat table from the OMIM search result I got (Go here [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez] and type in &quot;Spastic paraplegia&quot; with OMIM search database selected). I was happy to add them all before I realized there were 162 results! I just thought it was the one page. Anyone care to help me out on this/advise me on whether I should continue doing so? I did the first page, with the remaining pages 2-9 needing to be added/updated on the wiki article.
#Following on from 3, I want you all to consider the length of the table and its place on the article? I am predicting that it is going to be longer than the article itself after all of the above eventually get added! Should they be divided up into boxes (Autosomal dominant,recessive, xlinked recessive, dominant for example?) and made to automatically hide just to shorten the whole thing out and only list the most common on the main box bellow (kind off like how there are two tables in the harcot-Marie-Tooth disease article.

 uman Anatomy 

Hey guys,

Just to let you know I've removed P:MED's template on Human Anatomy. Upon reading the WPMED [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Medicine/Assessment#Is_WPMED_the_correct_WikiProject_to_support_this_article.3F reading WPMED's assessment scope], I've found that the article does not meet the scope in any way. WPMED is meant for diseases, treatments, and conditions. Human Anatomy is none of those. I plan to do a little sweep for our articles, to make sure they all meet our scope, alright? Thanks. ser:Renaissancee|Renaissancee ser_talk:Renaissancee|(talk) 04:49, 3 June 2009 (UTC)

I believe that there are (at least) hundreds of articles that should probably be tagged l|WikiProject Anatomy instead of WPMED; the trend over the last year has been to reduce needless overlap there.  So long as you look at the articles themselves instead of relying on the name (because if there's any significant clinical/disease/medical information, instead of pure anatomical details, then including/retaining WPMED is appropriate), then I would welcome a sweep. 
I don't believe that we have a consensus about what to do with molecular/signaling articles; perhaps next year we'll have better developed views there. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 05:03, 3 June 2009 (UTC)

 Cholesterol, statins, etc 

For a little while I've been having a slow edit war with ser|Eddievos, mainly on alk:Atorvastatin, about the way cholesterol and statins are represented on Wikipedia. There is a small but rather noisy movement, mainly on the internet, that seems to oppose either the ipid hypothesis or at least the benefits of pharmacological cholesterol lowering. They certainly got the ear of usiness Week in 2008 when they did a large article that dropped a large number of names but didn't actually name the studies that they disputed;[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/08_04/b4068052092994.htm] it mainly seems to target the ASCOT study.

Now a small series of articles has cropped up (evalonate inhibition and holesterol Depletion), seemingly being forks of the cholesterol/statin articles and using case reports and laboratory studies to discredit widespread cholesterol lowering. I've send both articles to AFD currently, but I was wondering if the audience could review both articles and determine if any of the content is worth salvaging. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 06:50, 31 May 2009 (UTC)

 An RFC to comment on 

On alk:Multiple myeloma I'm having a somewhat circular argument with the webmaster of myelomaforums.com. The argument (as usual) revolves around the suitability of support forums in the P:EL|external links section. I'm frankly quite tired of having to conduct these discussions all the time, but I continue to believe that forums, however well moderated, are not great resources from a Wikipedia perspective exactly because their moderation may not be optimal and the sites turn into hype-promoting, named-physician-bashing, alt-med-touting mostrosities. If we could have a clear line on this, perhaps we could simply stop having these discussions time and time again. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 22:35, 3 June 2009 (UTC)

 Few Administrative things  

Hi Again.

I was scowering through some other WikiProjects to see if I wanted to join and I see they all had coordinators and leaders and ect. WPMED doesn't have any, and we really have no back bone organization. I'd sort of suggest that we make some sort of ranking system so our newcomers can ask appropriate people, instead of the user that hasn't editted since 1997. With that, I was thinking something along the lines of this...
(low to high)
Anoymous IP users&gt; Wikipedia Users &gt; WPMED Members &gt; Task Force Coordinator(s) &gt; WPMED Coordinator(s)
Bad? Good? Not going to work? What do you think? I'd kind of like to see a little more backbone here. ser:Renaissancee|Renaissancee ser_talk:Renaissancee|(talk) 05:12, 4 June 2009 (UTC)

Why not just ask questions right here?  It makes more sense for project-related questions to be in the project space instead of being directed to specific users' talk pages.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 05:29, 4 June 2009 (UTC)

True, you don't like copying 50 of the same messages either:P ? Still, your actions at the Task Force talk sort of concern me. After getting enough supports, a task force(can't remember which) just sat there till somebody came along (you) and decided that it can be a task force now. I'd like (mind you, this is me) for WPMED to have more organization so we can get our articles and intentions out even better. More administration = more success. For newcomers, I'm not really sure if all of them are just going to come out of the shadows and start asking questions. When you just start at Wikipedia, it's kind of a scary place in all with all the ivory towers and rules and structures. I was scared that if I put out an idea it would be immediately shunned upon by the community because it broke some important rule that I didn't know about at the time. Do you get my drift?  ser:Renaissancee|Renaissancee ser_talk:Renaissancee|(talk) 05:37, 4 June 2009 (UTC)
I do not agree on more organization better functioning. I believe the project works well right now.--ser:Garrondo|Garrondo (ser talk:Garrondo|talk) 07:29, 4 June 2009 (UTC)
Fully opposed to any sort of structuring of rank here, it goes against the Wikipedia spirit. Even administrators aren't ranked higher than average users here, or even IP users for that matter, so it doesn't make much sense to assign coordinators. Also, the project works just fine at the moment, we all have equal responsibilities and no one is forced into looking after a certain area. If it ain't broke, don't fix it :) Regards, --—ser:Cyclonenim|Cyclonenim |ser_talk:Cyclonenim| Chat  09:49, 4 June 2009 (UTC)
Opposed.  Appointing coordinators equals more &quot;ivory towers and rules and structures&quot;, not less.  Also, administration has a cost in time and effort.  So, no, let's not have &quot;coordinators&quot; here.  Anyway, what it seems Renaissancee really wants is to help newbies over the hump from reading to contributing.  The best way I know to do that is to be responsive in a positive way.  I would like to see fewer replies that direct the newbie to the reference desk, and more that respond to the content issues in newbie's questions.  So someone asks &quot;I have these symptoms;  do I have this disease?&quot;  Let's not shoot them down for seeking medical advice here;  instead, treat it as an encyclopedia question, and make clearer or expand the articles about the symptoms and the disease.  --ser:Una Smith|Una Smith (ser talk:Una Smith|talk) 13:09, 4 June 2009 (UTC)

 Lupus anticoagulant --- Antiphospholipid syndrome, different or the same? 

I came across upus anticoagulant and after a bit of looking around I noticed that it had the same ICD9, DiseasesDB and most importantly OMIM with ntiphospholipid syndrome. Can anyone with more knowledge take a look at the two articles, their external links and make a judgment on whether they are completelly differet, one is a subset of another, or the exact same? I am guessing they might be different but the OMIM indicates that they are the same confused me. If they are the exact same, then I would recomend a merger. Thank you.ser:Calaka|Calaka (ser talk:Calaka|talk) 08:51, 6 June 2009 (UTC)
Note that I have also read the OMIM describing the difference between the two, but I repeat that I am no expert and have trouble actually understanding the difference between the two from that description. ser:Calaka|Calaka (ser talk:Calaka|talk) 08:53, 6 June 2009 (UTC)

The antiphospholipid syndrome requires medical complications (miscarriage, arterial/venous thrombosis, etc) plus detection of antiphospholipid antibodies (which include lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies).  Lupus anticoagulant is inferred from laboratory tests, but is not a syndrome and hence can be detected in the absence of any disease.  Thus, they overlap incompletely.  --ser:Scray|Scray (ser talk:Scray|talk) 20:02, 6 June 2009 (UTC)

Lupus anticoagulant is a laboratory finding, which may or may not be associated with the APS but may nonetheless be relevant in its own right. It would be better to keep the laboratory determination in the LAC article. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 07:05, 7 June 2009 (UTC)

 Nonne-Milroy-Meige syndrome = Milroy disease... Another potential merger?

Kilbad, if we were able to determine the right paperwork and processes, would you be willing to ask certain patients if they would be willing to donate non-identifiable images of their skin to the Foundation through you, and would you be willing to caption the image in cases where the condition was unambiguous? I think that with sufficient support from the WPMED community, we might be able to get ike Godwin's assistance on this issue. --ser:Arcadian|Arcadian (ser talk:Arcadian|talk) 22:17, 6 June 2009 (UTC)

That would be fine with me, particularly as I am about to by a new Nikon with lighting rig.  However, if I take a non-identifiable photo of a patient's skin condition, can't I upload it without getting consent? ---ser:Kilbad|kilbad (ser talk:Kilbad|talk) 00:35, 7 June 2009 (UTC)
This may depend on local laws and policies.  At my institution, policy forbids taking any photograph without consent, and the consent must specify &quot;publication and presentation&quot; to use it in this way.  Realize also that rules may change (and apply retroactively) so it's best to just get the consent (and of course, &quot;non-identifiable&quot; is a pretty subjective thing anyway).  Patients have a right to know what you're doing, IMHO.  --ser:Scray|Scray (ser talk:Scray|talk) 01:05, 7 June 2009 (UTC)
Scray, could you put together a paragraph that captures the spirit (but not the language) of the policies of your institution?

 June 2009 WPMED Member Sweep 

Hey guys, I just finished a member sweep, and I'd like to tell you some interesting facts. 
For borderline any members that have not edited Wikipedia since 1 January 2009 were removed from the active members list and put into the inactive. At the begging of the sweep, we had a total of 254 members listed. After reviewing all of members contributions, 72 of those 254 were illegible for the inactive members' list. Roughly 28.3% of our members where inactive. A fifth.
I'd like to suggest that we do yearly regular member sweeps, as this one I did was very brief and quick.

I'm not sure how on-topic this is...there are lots of interesting articles out there. For comparison, while the NCCAM spent $2.5 billion in ten years, as of $2004 the NIH spent about $27 billion per year. Working on the generous foundation of NIH basic research, I read in Investor's Business Daily the other day that the harmaceutical industry manages to get 8% of cancer drugs to market, and 20% of regular drugs to market. I'm not sure what sort of relationship that figure has with the fact that somewhere around [http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.0020052 75% of drugs are me-too drugs], which nevertheless are marketed heavily enough to bring in plenty of cash. The pharma industry spends a ton on R&amp;D, although it's hard to know for sure how much is really R&amp;D vrs marketing and legal expenses, since at least as of 2001 Public Citizen said the books weren't really open [http://www.citizen.org/publications/release.cfm?ID=7065]. Anyway, I agree that the NCCAM is misguided in many ways, but it's certainly too soon for an end. The neverending homeopathy trials certainly need to end, although considering how many of them there are and where they are published, I suspect many of those were funded by the NIH. ser:ImperfectlyInformed|II | (ser_talk:ImperfectlyInformed|t - pecial:Contributions/ImperfectlyInformed|c) 08:02, 11 June 2009 (UTC)

True, I noticed that I'd worded that badly at the end - homeopathy is one of those misguided pursuits. However, in 2005 there were at least 110 trials on homeopathy (MID|16125589).

ser:Renaissancee says that the H1N1 flu articles don't come under WPMED, they fall under WPVIRUS... but WPVIRUS seems to not be focused on disease, just the virus particles. So, the H1N1 flu outbreak articles, documenting disease cases have been removed from WPMED and placed under WPVIRUS by Renaissancee. Further s/he left a scope explanation about this project at ser_talk:70.29.208.129#WPMED_Scope saying that WPMED does not cover viruses or bacteria (in relation to the flu disease articles).

We've recently been refining the rules here, so here's a summary of the current state:
* YES:  disease, transmission, public health actions, outbreaks.  Note that in the grand scheme of medicine, an outbreak or other historical event is always |importance=Low -- even if it's big news at the time of the outbreak -- unless, like lack Death#Causes_of_the_bubonic_infection, it contains substantial information about the disease, or it permanently changed the field of medicine.
* NO: articles solely about the virus itself, articles solely about non-medical events (e.g., government actions or media coverage) that happen in the context of a medical situation.
The standards are in bit of a state of flux, so I suggest waiting a day or two and seeing whether anyone has any other opinions before making any changes.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 20:28, 11 June 2009 (UTC)

 Psychiatry task force

 Calf page moves 

Recently I discovered alf is mostly about baby cattle, and there was no Wikipedia article about the human calf.  I wrote alf (of leg) and began disambiguating links to alf.  I also proposed to move the article about baby cattle to alf (cattle) and to move alf (disambiguation) to alf, so that future links to alf will continue to be disambiguated.

Some of the arguments against moving these pages are absurd.  For example, the leg part isn't really a &quot;calf&quot; and for god's sake, it's utterly ridiculous to create separate articles on the leg part and the muscle.  Argh.  Please help.  --ser:Una Smith|Una Smith (ser talk:Una Smith|talk) 19:07, 12 June 2009 (UTC)

The discussion seems to be at alk:Calf.  In a related matter about medical-related calf articles, we currently have alf (of leg), alf muscle, and riceps surae.  I recommend that we merge &quot;calf muscle&quot; in to &quot;triceps surae&quot; and move &quot;calf (of leg)&quot; to &quot;calf (anatomy).&quot;  &quot;Calf (anatomy)&quot; would contain a link to &quot;triceps surae.&quot;  --ser:Scottalter|Scott Alter 23:38, 12 June 2009 (UTC)

Primarily alk:Calf#Requested move.  I have no objection to moving alf (of leg) to alf (anatomy).

Examining other anatomy articles, I see the convention favors alf (anatomy).  As that page name is already occupied (by a redirect), an admin will have to move it.  I will hold off on disambiguating the rest of the links to alf and oredirect|Calf muscle until the move proposals are resolved.  Links to oredirect|Calf muscle need to be disambiguated because many of them actually intend the calf, not the calf muscle.  This is a big mess resulting from the absence of a page on a minor but basic topic of human anatomy.  A stub would have been better.  --ser:Una Smith|Una Smith (ser talk:Una Smith|talk) 23:56, 12 June 2009 (UTC)

Do you think it is okay to merge alf muscle to riceps surae?  Both articles are on the same topic.  &quot;Calf muscle&quot; is somewhat ambiguous, as it actually relates to several muscles.  We seem to favor titles using the full scientific name of muscles (eg uadriceps femoris muscle, iceps brachii muscle, riceps brachii muscle), so I think this merge is appropriate.  --ser:Scottalter|Scott Alter 01:37, 14 June 2009 (UTC)

 Expert med attention needed! Cowchock syndrome, Cystic hygroma &amp;  Cowchock Wapner Kurtz syndrome 

After going through the mess of trying to work out what is what, I managed to work out that owchock Syndrome AND owchock Wapner Kurtz syndrome (also known as ystic hygroma) are NOT the same thing. Can someone please take a look at these and merge Cowchock Wapner Kutz into Cystic hygroma (since the former has a number of incorrect statements in my opinion due to the mistaken belief that Cowchock syndrome = Cowchock Wapner Kurtz syndrome). There is no indication of the OMIM of Cowchock syndrome to have a Wapner or Kurtz anywhere [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=310490]. Furthermore these two links (they are government pages so I assume they can be trusted) show clearly the distinction between the above: [http://www.orpha.net/consor/www/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?lng=EN&amp;Expert=2193] and [http://www.orpha.net/consor/www/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?lng=EN&amp;Expert=101078].

I see that today Arcadian has added a second species.  For small genera with little published about each species, it is not unusual to put the species in sections within the genus article.

The antihypertensives are an internationally recognized class (per TC code C02). It should be self-evident to future editors what belongs on that page and what doesn't.

In fact, the McGraw-Hill Manual of Colorectal Surgery has this to say:
uote|1=Coined in the pre-HIV era, the term &quot;gay bowel syndrome&quot; comprised a rather unselective potpourri of unusual anorectal and GI symptoms experienced by homosexual males... with better understanding of the underlying causes, this term is outdated: the derogatory terminology should be abandoned and more specific entities and terms recognized and used.

(elp:Edit conflict|edit conflict) It does not go against Wikipedia policy to bring an article in line with respected, expert thought on a topic - in fact, P:NPOV|Wikipedia policy requires that we do so. It is utter sophistry to claim that the term is current because &quot;sources were published in the 1990s and 2000s&quot; - I'm sure you realize that those modern sources are, for the most part, explicitly calling out the term as obsolete, right? ser:MastCell|MastCell ser Talk:MastCell|Talk 21:16, 23 June 2009 (UTC)
(edit conflict) I misread the original point and am revising what I said a moment ago (struckout):  In the first page of the link you provided, only one reference is dated after the 80's.

 Where is the wikipedia policy that says you can 'stub' an article by deleting sourced text? http://books.google.com/books?id=k_9sjs-n0nIC&amp;pg=PA296 was published in 1997 and includes an entire chapter on the syndrome, that doesn't mean the term is not outdated according to many, but it does not give you the right to delete text just because you dislike the topic, I don't have a problem with the fact you want to criticise the use of the term, but I don't have a valid reason for deleting the list of pathogens or methods of transmission which describe the syndrome in detail, that is bordering on vandalism, also for the record I agree that the term is offensive but I believe it is better to describe it in detail rather than 'stub' it ser:Thisglad|Thisglad (ser talk:Thisglad|talk) 21:28, 23 June 2009 (UTC)
Where is the Wikipedia policy that says you can P:EW|repeatedly revert without discussing things at alk:Gay Bowel Syndrome?

 hronic fatigue syndrome 

It would be appreciated if a few people who have knowledge of CFS-related fields would have a look at the various articles that relate to chronic fatigue syndrome.  The biggest article of concern is hronic fatigue syndrome|the main article itself, however, many related articles could also use some review, such as: linical descriptions of chronic fatigue syndrome, ontroversies related to chronic fatigue syndrome, aniel Peterson (physician), avid Sheffield Bell, eonard A. Jason, alcolm Hooper, edically unexplained physical symptoms, and athophysiology of chronic fatigue syndrome.

In particular, P:NPOV|neutral point of view presentation is a concern.  There have been accusations of the articles taking pro-biological viewpoints, and reversions against consensus to counteract the perceived bias. I think someone (or probably several someones) with a more hands-off approach would be appreciated at this point.

Thanks everyone! --ser:RobinHood70|Rob (ser talk:RobinHood70|talk) 04:47, 21 June 2009 (UTC)

I haven't looked in depth yet, but why does CFS need its own main page, and a seperate description and pathophysiology pages?  Much more complex medical pages manage to contain everything in one article. ser:Fuzbaby|Fuzbaby (ser talk:Fuzbaby|talk) 05:09, 21 June 2009 (UTC)
Most complex medical conditions don't have five or six major definitions, either.  I can't say I'm surprised by the POV concerns at these articles; it would be more surprising if someone said that there wasn't a dispute there!  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 05:45, 21 June 2009 (UTC)
As to why there are so many pages, I can only speculate, as I've only really gotten involved in those articles fairly recently.  But my speculation is that it's due to the number of disputes that have arisen over the years since the article was created, as well as the fact that a lot of the medical information is speculative at this point.  By creating separate pages, it tends to confine disputes to smaller areas which can be focussed on appropriately.  But like I say, I'm just guessing that that was the motive for their creation...you'd have to trace back in their history and look at appropriate discussion around the time to be certain (a project in and of itself).  —Preceding ikipedia:Signatures|unsigned comment added by ser:RobinHood70|RobinHood70 (ser talk:RobinHood70|talk • pecial:Contributions/RobinHood70|contribs) 06:03, 21 June 2009 (UTC) 

It's really simple. Those who know anything about CFS are already editing these articles, and everyone else has been thoroughly put off by the attitude of a few contributors (the most difficult one of which has now been banned). This is POV tiger country.
I agree with Fuzbaby that the article probably shouldn't have been forked, and I disagree with Robinhood70 that forking can be helpful in containing POV disputes; instead, the dispute just spreads to more articles.
With regards to the little biographies of Jason, Bell, Peterson and Hooper, I don't actually see a problem there. In fact, they are pretty mild in the sense that I know several of these men to be highly opinionated with regards to the &quot;psychiatric school&quot; and deny them legitimacy. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 09:50, 21 June 2009 (UTC)

While I'll agree it may have been read that way, I wasn't saying that the forking was necessarily helpful, just that that might have been the thought at their creation.  Personally, I think the amount of related pages for CFS is getting ridiculous as well, but given the ongoing issues on the main page, as well as its already fairly large size (currently 62k, IIRC), I'm extremely hesitant to try to re-integrate anything.

And apart from a few minor issues that are being worked on, I don't see major issues with the bios either, but I do believe they would be well-served by third-party editors to judge whether the content is unbiased, if it's notable, etc.

I most certainly agree that this is POV tiger country, but if you really look at the talk page, I think it's obvious that most of us can work together.  There are more NPOV editors on this article than it may appear, however those who are strongly in support of a particular POV often make those who oppose the more problematic additions look like they're supporting the other POV.  In fact, a look at recent contributions will show that several of those who have been accused of POV bias have been adding/editing information both for and against a psychological basis. --ser:RobinHood70|Rob (ser talk:RobinHood70|talk) 16:44, 21 June 2009 (UTC)

I would support a merger of linical descriptions of chronic fatigue syndrome, ontroversies related to chronic fatigue syndrome, and athophysiology of chronic fatigue syndrome into hronic fatigue syndrome.  Would anyone else support this? ---ser:Kilbad|kilbad (ser talk:Kilbad|talk) 17:29, 21 June 2009 (UTC)

Seconded, though due to my recent involvement on the article and perception of bias, I don't think it would be appropriate for me to contribute significantly (beyond smoothing out minor editing glitches and the like). --ser:RobinHood70|Rob (ser talk:RobinHood70|talk) 17:32, 21 June 2009 (UTC)

I believe combining is not a good idea. Last year the article was very long and was spilt accordingly (see the articles about midyear 2008). There are many conflicting study results due to the different ME/CFS definitions used. Also there are many avenues of research due to the lack of understanding of the systemic nature of the illness. Much verifiable material in the article has been removed in the last year and the  result has been fighting over various POVs instead of proper documentation of the incredible complex and divergent viewpoints within the patient and medical community concerning the illness. Presently there is a lot of bald assertion of opinion in opposition to P:ASF|policy. It takes more wording to properly attribute opinions subject to dispute. If the material in the hronic fatigue syndrome article was properly documented and attributed, it would be much larger and IMO there would be less POV issues. ser:Ward20|Ward20 (ser talk:Ward20|talk) 21:34, 21 June 2009 (UTC)

With regards to merging, I think most of the content could be removed from the subarticles if editors agreed to adhere to P:MEDRS, which sets specific limits on the type of articles we use as references. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 04:23, 22 June 2009 (UTC)

Maybe as a start, it would be useful for someone to go through and flag all the non-MEDRS references so that they can be improved or removed?  I know I've seen a lot of citations from older sources (early 1990's) and citations from newspapers, which by MEDRS, are generally undesirable.  Of course at the same time, we also need to present significant-minority viewpoints as well, which may necessitate referencing non-MEDRS (or &quot;weak MEDRS&quot;) sources in some cases. --ser:RobinHood70|Rob (ser talk:RobinHood70|talk) 16:30, 22 June 2009 (UTC)
They are certainly problematic pages; the medical stuff should certainly adhere to MEDRS and good 'uns too, but there is a lot of non-medical stuff attached.  Patient reactions, hatred of the name, approach, descriptions and popular appreciation of the disorder, etc.  I would worry about the article becoming a single monster page.  The whole set needs dedicated contributors with a lot of patients - I finally got tired and pretty much left, they're high-maintenance pages in both senses of the word.  ser:WLU|WLU ser talk:WLU|(t) pecial:Contributions/WLU|(c) Wikipedia's rules:P:SIMPLE|simple/P:POL|complex 14:18, 24 June 2009 (UTC)

 Short catheter 

Last year, when my duodenum became perforated, a short catheter was inserted into my urethra while I was in the emergency room.  It was unlike any in the Wikipedia article on catheters.  It had a cylindrically-shaped bulb on the end which was lubricated and inserted only about ten centimeters into the urethra.  It was referred to as a Foley catheter, but evidently was something else.

 umination Syndrome 

Hello to all (But not to the world). For the past couple weeks I've been working extensively on umination Syndrome, an eating disorder characterised by the involuntary and effortless regurgitation of meals immediately following their ingestion. It is severly underdiagnosed and its prevalence in the general population is unknown, though predictably large. It affects up to 10% of cognitively disabled children and adults in their lifetime.

Anyways, descriptions aside, I'm looking for a fellow editor - Preferably one who is better with the technicalities of english than myself - to help me polish the article off and get more citations in place. Since I started working on it, the article has been significantly filled out from its [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rumination_Syndrome&amp;oldid=288903096 former self]. There is still plenty of information to be added (Especially the technical stuff... Goodie goodie!), and another section at the least (Causes). I think this could potentially reach Good Article status with enough effort.

note to deletionists: This is still a work in progress, and some information has yet to be cited. I will revert any negative changes to the article! -- ser:Floydian|ʄɭoyd̪iaɲ ser_talk:Floydian|τ pecial:Contributions/Floydian|ç 04:04, 24 June 2009 (UTC)

I think it's reasonable to describe this as a controversial or emerging area. There aren't many treatments for macular degeneration, and supplements are perceived as ostly harmless, so I think there's a tendency to err on the side of using them where the evidence is a bit gray. MID|17435429, a review by authors from the National Eye Institute, might be useful; we should certainly incorporate Cochrane as well. Basically, I think we can use the available sources to give a useful overview which is neither too negative nor too infomerically. Just outline that there have been several positive results reported in the literature, leading some experts (cite NEI review) to recommend supplementation, but that Cochrane's review was more skeptical, noted that all of the positive results came from a single study, and that replication/more data were needed before making a definitive statement or recommendation on the utility of supplements. ser:MastCell|MastCell ser Talk:MastCell|Talk 19:34, 25 June 2009 (UTC)

It looks like his sources are accurate; as for their location or deserving their own section I'm not sure how it affects the balance  and npov of the article.  The part from the AMA about parents changing vaccine habbits, in particular is worth inclusion (somewhere in the article) as it is a growing public health concern both in the US and the UK. ser:Fuzbaby|Fuzbaby (ser talk:Fuzbaby|talk) 17:20, 19 June 2009 (UTC)

 The AMA poll isn't directly relevant to MR vaccine controversy, as it doesn't mention MMR vaccine. It is a US poll, and the main US concerns about vaccines are not about MMR.

All of the following are within the scope of P:PHARM.  Are they also within WPMED's scope?

# Medications
# Pharmaceutical companies

Options include everything from &quot;Yes&quot; to &quot;No&quot;, with considerable room for complexity as needed.  For example, someone might want WPMED to support major classes of medications (SAIDs) but not individual medications (spirin); to support over-the-counter drugs (spirin) but not prescription-only medications (isplatin); to support common medications (aroxetine) but not uncommon ones (lpha-galactosidase); to support legally regulated drugs but not &quot;dietary supplements&quot; — or any other system you think appropriate.

 lcohol and cancer 

The lcohol and cancer page is a mess. A bit of quick background, as some of you may remember I raised problems (which are now resolved) a while back with the ong-term effects of alcohol article regarding it being severely abused by a sociologist from the drinks industry who had a wealth of references to give massive undue weight to the benefits of moderate alcohol, misusing references and using old sources which were disproven with later research etc etc. The same thing happened with the alcohol and cancer page. Anyway one of the main problems is editors copying and pasting sentences from references and doing direct quotes. This editing style was used by the sociologist (who is banned now after resorting to sockpuppeteering), the response of some of the community was then to copy the editing style of the sociologist by doing direct copy and paste tactics, wrongly thinking that this would mean that the &quot;alcohol industry&quot; wouldn't be able to &quot;touch their edits&quot;. It has resulted in a comprehensive article but is borderline violating copyright issues throughout it. It would be a shame to just delete all of the hard work.

Just a slight correction to the above: One of the sociologist / lobbyist's many tricks was to give his own highly tendentious 'interpretations' of some research papers. A good example is here [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alcohol_and_cancer&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=57017663] where one of his sock puppets presents a study on mice as being a study on rats (God knows what was going through his mind at the time). By directly quoting what the researchers actually said, I and a few others limited his room for manoeuvre. However the article has consequently become a mass of quotes, though quoting typically one sentence from a paper's conclusion isn't a copyright violation as Literaturegeek seems to fear. I second  Literaturegeek's plea; the article does need expert attention from someone with medical knowledge. ser:Nunquam Dormio|Nunquam Dormio (ser talk:Nunquam Dormio|talk) 08:12, 2 July 2009 (UTC)

 Skin Grafting 

This message is in reference to the existing kin grafting article, and the final image that is displayed (a skin graft applied to a lower leg trauma injury, benefiting from VAC). The photograph is of my own leg, and was taken in December 2007 following a motorcycle accident. Would the article benefit from having a photograph of the graft now it is completely healed, with no moist areas? And how about any intermediate images? I can try to crop and rotate to the same orientation so the images are consistent. Furthermore, would the article benefit from any reference to long-term implications of full thickness grafts and their potential impact on the lymphatic system? For example, where mine is sited means that I suffer from significant swelling without several hours of daily elevation. Clearly this is not going to affect every patient but is a potential long-term complication as a result of having a skin graft. This can also be accommodated in an image time-line if I do contribute one in the manner I have suggested - I can intentionally lay up to make the surrounding tissue sit flush with the graft on the edge where the tissue loss is at its thinnest, and likewise I can intentionally keep the leg down for a day or two to swell up somewhat grotesquely, and make the surrounding tissue taught and angry. Would this be of any use whatsoever, or would it over-complicate the article? To make this clear, I'm not doing this for some sort of personal kick of sharing photos of my injuries - I personally feel that it would be of some use to patients to see how things might possibly look during the healing process as well as possibly illustrating possible long-term side effects, but of course if it would detract from the factual nature of &quot;what is a skin graft&quot; then I will bow to your collective greater knowledge and not embark on this little project. If anyone from the profession wants to see the intermediate-stage images I intend to use (not yet rotated etc) then I've put them on photobucket - you can view them through the following links: [http://i210.photobucket.com/albums/bb112/elgordo78/graft/graft1.jpg] [http://i210.photobucket.com/albums/bb112/elgordo78/graft/graft2.jpg] [http://i210.photobucket.com/albums/bb112/elgordo78/graft/graft3.jpg].

In the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo#Symptoms_and_conditions Symptoms and conditions] section of the article there is a list of conditions with references to placebo controlled studies and metastudies.

Three reasons exist for this section. 
#The list follows individual discussions of three conditions in which the placebo effect is found: pain, depression and  gastric and duodenal ulcers. Without the list after these three separate discussions, readers of the article might mistakenly feel that research has only been published upon them and the placebo effect, whereas in fact, the three are detailed largely as illustrations. One possibility is that the list is expanded into similar discussions on each of the listed conditions. But that would greatly extend the length of the article: to list the existence of such work rather than fully detail them individually is a compromise. 
#A key aspect of the placebo effect is the diversity of symptoms and conditions that it effects. This is implied elsewhere in the article by the use of abstract words such as “condition” but the collecting together of differing conditions in the list directly shows this. 
#It has a ikipedia:Further_reading#Further_reading|further reading role. It provides in a bulleted alphabetized list additional reading for those wanting to read about the placebo effect where  in various conditions it has been researched and reviewed. If an individual reader has an interest in a particular condition they might want to read more about the placebo effect and that condition. The list provides the  opportunity for doing this. Again it could be done differently with each condition directly linked to further relevant reading rather than a numbered citation. But in any article there is a compromise between space and providing information a reader might reasonably appreciate. --ser:LittleHow|LittleHow (ser talk:LittleHow|talk) 12:29, 2 July 2009 (UTC)

 Snakebite article 

Hi everyone, 

I've been editing the nakebite article recently (I'm ser|98.232.98.144 when too lazy to log in) and I noticed it is rated as mid-importance for this Wikiproject group. The article is also a former good article, but was demoted for a variety of reasons. I've tried to address some of the problems on the to-do list, but I don't have enough free time in my day to do everything I'd like to. The article as it is now has the potential to regain good article status with a little more work, but I would like help from this group if anyone's willing. It would be nice to have some fresh eyes look over it and note potential problems and improvements, and add citation tags where they're needed. Thanks!--ser:Eightofnine|Eightofnine (ser talk:Eightofnine|talk) 06:33, 3 July 2009 (UTC)
 Private practice &quot;Before &amp; After&quot; shots 

What is going on?  Why are private practices posting before and after shots to encyclopedia articles?  What are the terms and conditions regarding this type of &quot;contribution&quot;?  The pages that I have come across have become significantly less reputable due to these types of images being posted (and a *lot* less aesthetically pleasing).  A list of the articles that I have found include: bdominoplasty, iposuction, hinoplasty, and hytidectomy, but the list is realistically longer than that.  I am an avid medical photographer and have been given a great opportunity to take photos during actual surgeries, also having been given full legal rights from both the patients and surgeon to my images, and the rights to contribute my work to the Wikimedia projects and global community in general.

After adding some images to the bdominoplasty article, I was contacted by a Dr. Otto J. Placik from Arlington Heights, IL, USA regarding the article and that he was &quot;there first&quot; and would appreciate it if I would leave his work alone (I had edited one of his photo captions in the iposuction article to remove the phrase &quot;PLEASE CLICK ON PHOTO FOR MORE INFORMATION&quot;)--with the subtle hint that my contributions are not welcome.  He then proceeded to remove an [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Abdominoplasty_skin_and_fat_removal.jpg extremely valuable and descriptive image] of this surgery (which I re-added late last night after deciding to disregard his requests).  How do I contact an administrator, or what is the Wikimedia/Wikipedia policy on this type of behavior?  Dr. Otto Placik has also been &quot;contributing&quot; using multiple accounts, including Emilymiller123, Sarahjjohnson123, and the &quot;anonymous&quot; 75.63.221.230 IP address in an eff
ort to ghost his marketing and self-promotion.

I'm not at all opposed to anyone from the medical community being involved in contributing to this great work.  But seriously, what defines &quot;crossing the line&quot;, and what can be done to keep people like Dr. Otto J. Placik from controlling and degrading the quality of this collaborative project?  I'm new here, so I really don't know where to turn for help or advice on this matter.

About a year ago, there was a great deal of spam centered around a couple of now blacklisted physician directories -- cosmeticsurgery.com and plasticsurgery.com, along with a number fake blogs and websites, such as ienhance.com. I believe plasticsurgery.org was also blacklisted due to editing abuse (ignoring other editors, sockpuppeting, overzealous adding/readding of links), which I didn't agree with since it's the association website and probably useful as an external link when identified. I'm less clear about cosmeticsurgery.org, which is another association. ser:Flowanda|Flowanda | ser talk:Flowanda|Talk 21:43, 20 June 2009 (UTC)

Isn't serSummary|Paravis  adding before and after images for a Dr. Michael S. Schwartz with direct links to his promotional website. Is that allowed? The source field on the image summary has a direct hyperlink to the physician's website and has terms of use that seem to give direct credit to this physician.

Dr. Oliver I am a little confused you state emphatically above: &quot;As a plastic surgeon and wiki contributor, it gets under my skin when people try to use wikipedia as part of a marketing campaign.&quot; Yet you post links to your personal blog on your user page and ask Wikipedia visitors to go there and you also post &quot;before and after pictures of breat augmentation&quot; here: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Breasts.jpg] and list yourself as author. Can you explain why this only applies to you and not to me. I would gladly post my pictures in the exact manner in which you posted yours. Would this meet with your satisfaction? ser:Otto Placik|Otto Placik (ser talk:Otto Placik|talk) 15:17, 29 June 2009 (UTC)

Here are the standard rules of thumb:
* Links to your own website in userspace are generally acceptable.  Links to your own website in articles are not. 
* Identification of photographers on the image page itself (begins with File:) is acceptable and generally preferred.  Naming the photographer in the article (e.g., in the caption underneath the picture) is strongly discouraged.
* Links to your own website on the image page (File:Whatever.jpg) is generally accepted. 
I hope this helps.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:34, 30 June 2009 (UTC)

Thank you WhatamIdoing. I believe my images are therefore in compliance. However, I have recieved numerous criticisms for links to my website on the image page itself as you state.

 Plastic surgery photos 

We need to add:

serSummary|Paravis 

since the photos lead to [http://www.drmichaelschwartz.com/ Michael Schartz], a plastic surgeon's website. ser:Flowanda|Flowanda | ser talk:Flowanda|Talk 06:08, 27 June 2009 (UTC)

I would agree that this needs review. Multiple photos contributed by User:Paravis for example ttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/Abdominoplasty_umbilicus_%28belly_button%29_reconstruction.jpg have direct links to a Dr. Michael S. Schwartz's website. He claims that he is giving credit and I agree that this is reasonable. However, it was my impression that direct links to a personal website for promotional purposes is strongly discouraged. I believe that Paravis should not be allowed to upload these images (I counted 17 photos) without removing the links. Changing the links to the Physician's name only would diminish the obvious nature of this blatant promotional use of Wikipedia and at least give the impression that his efforts were sincere in intent.--ser:Otto Placik|Otto Placik (ser talk:Otto Placik|talk) 05:46, 5 July 2009 (UTC)

 Image spam discussions 

There are a number of images on various article pages that show uploaded photos to Wikimedia Commons that contain links to physicians' websites, including the editor above who complained about harassment. I think the notice I placed on this user's talk page provides the links to current and past discussions :[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Otto_Placik#Notification_of_discussions_and_a_sockpuppet_investigation]. I think the best way to keep the discussion together would be to make any replies to the P:RSPAM noticeboard [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RSPAM#More_plastic_surgery_spam]. Thanks, ser:Flowanda|Flowanda | ser talk:Flowanda|Talk 00:22, 28 June 2009 (UTC)
There's a huge difference between marketing spam and legitimate photographic documentation of medical procedures.  This is an encyclopedia, not a place to show off before/after images (or to enlarge these images, or place them in awkward parts of an article that are not subjectively related to the image).  I have been given a great opportunity to take videos and photos by a surgeon.  And even though I took the photos/videos, I am only documenting the artistic talent and work of the surgeon.  How else would I give credit to my source?

You csn give credit by writing his name and eliminating the link--ser:Otto Placik|Otto Placik (ser talk:Otto Placik|talk) 05:50, 5 July 2009 (UTC)

And, in contrast with some images that are disrupting the aesthetics and functionality of certain articles, the work I am contributing is extremely informative and descriptive simply within the image itself.  I have been studying Wikipedia's medical articles for over a year now; and there are definite &quot;information gaps&quot;.  It is in everyone's best interest for these gaps to be filled in appropriately.  I feel as if that is exactly what I have been attempting to do, with trouble coming from an individual who felt as if his &quot;territory&quot; was being encroached upon.
I was actually almost denied the privilege of documenting any more surgeries after Otto Placik made phone calls to Michael Schwartz's office.  It took me a day and a half to prove to Michael Schwartz that I had not been doing anything out of line, nor abusing Wikipedia's policies, nor making a bad name for him or his practice.  And the phone call that started all this trouble for me was totally uncalled for, and quite unnecessary.  I would have been really disappointed had I not been able to continue this work, since the media I capture gets better and better every time!  Anyways, thanks for your concern. ser:Paravis|Paravis (ser talk:Paravis|talk) 01:49, 29 June 2009 (UTC)


The photos may provide some illustration but the direct link to his personal website is completely unnecessary and gives one the impression that you are promoting his services rather than achieving an educational intent.

 The diabetes quagmire 

For a long time I have been disappointed with the quality of the diabetes content on Wikipedia. Given the large amount of articles involved I thought this might be right forum to raise these issues. To be honest, I think one of the main problems is the lack of agreement whether all content should remain on iabetes mellitus (lumpers) or whether this should be a placeholder article that primarily links to numerous subarticles (splitters).

Could I make the following proposals:
* The &quot;main&quot; diabetes article discusses only the presenting symptoms, diagnosis (especially how to distinguish the subtypes) and the complications. It splits off all relevant subcontent at a high level (e.g. not spending too much time on the various oral hypoglycaemics in DM2 or attempts to cure DM1).
* The &quot;main&quot; article is sourced only sparsely with the very highest quality P:MEDRS sources (reviews in high-impact journals).
* The subarticles are allowed to refer back to the main article with regards to the unified content (e.g. complications) without duplicating all that is already in the main article.

It would be lovely to have a task force set up for diabetes and endocrinology, but I suspect there is not currently enough manpower to do this. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 10:06, 5 July 2009 (UTC)

I concur with ser:Jfdwolff. As a relative newcomer to the diabetes articles, I found it very frustrating to find so many articles on the subject spread throughout Wikipedia. There is tremendous duplication. Having it all in one article would be best (one-stop shopping). However, the main article already has a size advisory. 

*Between JFW's alternatives, &quot;DM&quot; should become a placeholder article that primarily links to numerous subarticles (splitters).

*The &quot;main&quot; iabetes Mellitus (DM) article should keep its redirect from iabetes. 

I will be glad to assist. Thanks. ser:Afaprof01|Afaprof01 (ser talk:Afaprof01|talk) 03:03, 6 July 2009 (UTC)
