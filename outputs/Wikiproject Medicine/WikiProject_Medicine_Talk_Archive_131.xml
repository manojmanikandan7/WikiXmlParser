 how to remove Feldenkrais from pseudo medicine? 

Hello, the eldenkrais method is not a medicine, let alone pseudo. What are the steps to have it removed from this section?
ser:ThatWildCard|ThatWildCard (ser talk:ThatWildCard|talk) 04:19, 17 December 2019 (UTC)
it would be articles for deletion... might want to take a look at ite journal |last1=Mattes |first1=Josef |title=Attentional Focus in Motor Learning, the Feldenkrais Method, and Mindful Movement |journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills |date=August 2016 |volume=123 |issue=1 |pages=258–276 |doi=10.1177/0031512516661275 |pmid=27502242 |s2cid=206426574 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27502242 |accessdate=17 December 2019 |issn=1558-688X--ser:Ozzie10aaaa|Ozzie10aaaa (ser talk:Ozzie10aaaa|talk) 05:49, 17 December 2019 (UTC)
The template is applied to &quot;alternative&quot; and fringe topics broadly within medicine. Since the Feldenkrais Method® is typically referred to as an alternative therapy within reliable sources (e.g. [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S123080131500034X]) I suspect it would be hard to get consensus to remove the template unless reality changes. Any further discussion of this topic would be better at alk:Feldenkrais method. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 08:40, 17 December 2019 (UTC)

e|Ozzie10aaaa does AfD also sort disputes on article content? (As I tend to not to look at the &quot;backroom&quot; areas, other than talk pages, I promise that's a P:GF question.)
To me, ThatWildCard is asking for the sidebar and other references of pseudo-medicine to be removed from the article. Their argument appears to be that: 
# because eldenkrais method|the therapy isn't edication it shouldn't have the emplate:Alternative medical systems|pseudo-medicine sidebar. (This argument ignores that &quot;medicine&quot; in this instance refers to the science discipline, not pharmaceuticals.)
# they have a general objection to the use of &quot;pseudo&quot; within that article. But no P:PROOF has been put forward to contradicts the current POV of the article.
e|ThatWildCard do you have any P:MEDRS sources to back up your position that the Feldenkrais method isn't pseudo-medicine? ser:Little pob|Little pob (ser talk:Little pob|talk) 16:37, 17 December 2019 (UTC)

Ah! Backroom = anything that's not an article or user guide-type page; especially sysop areas. Though I realise today that for some &quot;backroom&quot; may imply a clandestine or insidious purpose. That was not my intent, hopefully I didn't offend anyone. ser:Little pob|Little pob (ser talk:Little pob|talk) 09:06, 18 December 2019 (UTC)
The navigation sidebar says &quot;Alternative medicine and pseudo-medicine&quot; at the top.  This is probably more altmed than pseduo-med, but we lump them together.
I'm not entirely convinced that the article has struck the right POV.  Any exercise therapy is likely to have some health benefits, at least compared to doing nothing.  &quot;Glorified yoga&quot; is not a bad thing in our sedentary age.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:01, 17 December 2019 (UTC)

I don't know if any sources draw a distinction between them, but if they're &quot;the same thing&quot; (likely, as far as I know), then perhaps that title in the navbox is redundant.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:16, 18 December 2019 (UTC)
Yoga would also be categorized as alternative medicine when making health claims. ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk · pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 23:20, 18 December 2019 (UTC)
Shouldn't it depend upon the nature of the claims?  The idea that stretching exercises improve flexibility is pretty conventional.  oga as exercise doesn't appear to be considered any type of medicine at all.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 07:21, 19 December 2019 (UTC)

There aren't too many here.  If you've never tried this before, it's usually pretty easy.  Just go to the page, find the little blue thing that says [disambiguation needed], figure out which article it ought to link to, and fix the link.  Remove the l|dab template, and then come back here to mark the item l|done.  If you find a tough one, then let's talk about it, and maybe we'll be able to puzzle it out together.

 Orphanet has its advantages and disadvantages.

 Ideally, that's what the page should be converted into.  There's technically no structure restriction on an SIA though, so it could become a list article while remaining an SIA.  I just don't have the time/interest to create a wikitable, look up the corresponding genes, and cite this many entries, so I just opted for the least time-consuming approach.  The only reason I didn't use OMIM is that there were 184 entries linked.  Orphanet includes 1 or more links to OMIM for its entries though, so it probably covered a good chunk of them.  The 7 Joubert syndrome disorders in this list together encompassed like 30-40 OMIM entries. ser:Seppi333|Seppi333 (ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert 2¢) 15:34, 29 December 2019 (UTC)

 Please apply for free access to paywalled medical sources 

This is your occasional reminder that https://wikipedialibrary.wmflabs.org/ exists and will give you free, 100% legal access to all sorts of paywalled medical (and other) sources.  https://wikipedialibrary.wmflabs.org/partners/ has the list.  At the moment, cienceDirect and a couple of others are waitlisted, but many others, including the Cochrane library, are waiting for you.  

The usual ragedy of the commons|common-sense advice applies:  Please sign up for (only) what you will (realistically) use.  Please (try to) use whatever you sign up for.  Please (try to) &quot;share the wealth&quot; by telling other editors what you have access to, if you're willing to look up sources and do quick verification checks for others (note that this does not mean e-mailing copies to other editors – they can sign up, too).

P:TWL also takes suggestions for other sources, and I encourage you to make your requests.  Some publishers won't agree, but many simply haven't been asked yet.  (Imagine a world in which most WPMED folks had online access to the best med school textbooks...)

Finally, at least if you're in the US, I recommend that you find the website for your local library and figure out what online resources it offers.  Although general libraries (especially small ones) often don't have medicine-specific sources, it is not unusual for editors to discover that you have free online access to a variety of reference works and newspapers.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 01:23, 30 December 2019 (UTC)

 CBC to GA 

Something has gotten into me and I've decided to take omplete blood count to GA status. I've started working on it, but there is much more work to be done.

nterventional radiology
Could I get some extra eyes on this article.  I went to fix a disambiguation on this page and got lost.  It's undergone rapid expansion over the past 4 months from a group of new editors (most of which have received COI messages on their talk pages).  From what I can see, the intent is to cover every aspect of IR in a single article with a list like format. Jytdog was moving a lot of unsourced material to the talk page.   Ideally, I'd like to chop it down to something more manageable (e.g. the ertebral augmentation section which is poorly referenced could just be pointed at the main article).  Any opinions are welcome, especially which MOS to choose.  Thx.  ser:Ian Furst|Ian Furst (ser talk:Ian Furst|talk) 01:09, 3 January 2020 (UTC)

Added: much of the added content reads like a webpage rather than an encyclopedia,

&quot;In addition to your normal liver tissue, your liver has three main vessels traversing it: arteries, veins and bile ducts. While bile is made in your liver and stored in your gallbladder, the bile will eventually pass into your GI tract through your hepatic, cystic and common bile ducts. Any condition that prevents the normal flow of bile from your liver, through these bile vessels and into your GI tract can cause a condition called jaundice.&quot;

After further review... I've found that we have a whole host pages on interventional procedures.  Most of the procedures listed on the IR page itself are a weak synopsis of the other pages.  My plan is to change IR into a procedure page that deals with the broad strokes and refers the readers to each of the subspecialty pages.

Health information-seeking behavior
Hello, I have added ealth information-seeking behaviour to WP:Libraries and WP:Med. I am a PhD candidate in Library and information sciences (LIS) researching the use of Wikipedia as a health information resource. From January to April I plan to make extensive high-quality contributions to this article. In my reading of the literature I have found that much research of health information-seeking has come from health researchers or professionals who have little knowledge of existing human information practices or behaviour theories. Further, the use of the term &quot;information seeking behavior&quot; is  different in the literature published by health researchers than in the LIS literature. While I understand this article is not a medical entry, it is important to share information theory within the context of health information as broadly as possible. I welcome discussion and debate on this decision. ser:Mcbrarian|Mcbrarian (ser talk:Mcbrarian|talk) 15:41, 5 January 2020 (UTC)

I've added both pics to the Farsi language article, and put one in the Wikidata item. 
If anyone likes adding images to articles, then I've found that you can add simple images even when you don't know the language, so long as a reasonable caption could be identical to the title of the article.  So, for enotomy scissors, I used the visual editor's Insert &gt; Image tool, searched for the file name (VE can search Commons, so you don't have to remember the file name), found the pic, and then copied and pasted the article title into the caption.  This works fairly well for people and things, but not so well for concepts or anything complicated.  I can only remember such an image being reverted once (and I still have no idea why:  the explanation was that a picture of a boy holding his science fair project wasn't a boy holding his science fair project?), and sometimes people will expand and improve the article as a result of you making a small change.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:31, 9 January 2020 (UTC)

 Antifungal  ikkomycin Z 


I noticed that information about the drug &quot;Nikkomycin Z&quot; is missing.

I am not a doctor or a Pharmacist, and only contain a little knowledge of the drug used to treat Valley Fever.

Could you put together a page on the drug?
I don't feel qualified enough to do it.

This is the little I know.

A fungal cell has two cell walls, the outer wall is composed of Beta-Glucan and Chitin, and the inner wall is composed of ergosterol.
&quot;Nikkomycin Z&quot; help destroy fungus by weakening the outer cell wall by breaking down the Chitin and allowing other antifungal drugs (azoles) to gain access into the inner cell wall composed of ergosterol. In certain cases the Azole drugs cannot kill the fungus because they are blocked from gaining access to the inner cell wall, this is the case with Valley Fever.

When a fungal cell dies, it explodes, releasing several enzymes into the body, 
these enzymes can damage surrounding tissues causing inflammation and pain, and itching, 
The dead fungal cells can cause a herzog reaction when the liver needs to deal with the disposal of many dead cells in the blood.

Nikkomycin Z needs to be taken in combination with other fungal drugs to work effectively.

Another molecule that breaks down Chitin is Lysozyme Chitinase, this enzyme Lyses the Chitin by breaking down glycosidic bonds, destroying it.

The Antifungal page does mention Nikkomycin  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifungal 

Also the Caspofungin  Page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspofungin has a table which does not contain any reference to Chitin inhibitors, or Mannoprotein inhibitors.

 Short description standards 

Spinning this topic off of ikipedia talk:Short description#Inevitably long short descriptions that are useless when 40 characters|this discussion, in which I proposed a help diagram for the ikipedia:SHORTDESC|short description help page and debated some proposed rules and changes to the contradictory and unnecessarily ambiguous help information. There's been no other discussion on short descriptions in this WikiProject other than ikipedia talk:WikiProject Medicine/Archive 107#Wikipedia:WikiProject Short descriptions|one when they first came out.

I'm seeing a strong need for this WikiProject to establish a standard practice for gene and syndrome short descriptions as per that discussion of mine. Moreover, I've been seeing how ikidata:User:ProteinBoxBot|ProteinBoxBot has gone around and added &quot;protein-coding gene in the species Homo sapiens&quot; or some variation (&quot;mammalian protein found in Homo sapiens&quot;, &quot;Human gene&quot;) to every gene on Wikidata. I've been wanting to import and edit them, but based on my discussion above (and the fact no one else has touched the bot's descriptions) I didn't know if the changes I wanted to make were acceptable. I was thinking they could do with some further disambiguating, i.e. for a notable role like RCA1 and RCA2 in cancer or the nature of the gene (e.g., &quot;ranscription factor&quot;, &quot;nzyme&quot;), though I wanted to make sure that fell in line with a new standard practice reached by consultation. My topic discusses the length rule exceptions that may apply to topics of both similar names and similar natures with unwieldy differentiating features, like certain syndromes, to facilitate disambiguation in search. Also, some of ProteinBoxBot's descriptions are just wrong, like &quot;mammalian protein found in Homo sapiens&quot; on istidine decarboxylase, which is found in &quot;eukaryotes, as well as gram-negative bacteria&quot;. Another thing it's done is add &quot;nterPro domain&quot; to almost every rotein domain, so I wanted to know if that need be included in such a standard practice established for protein domains (I'd prefer not). I welcome your input towards these new conventions. ser:SUM1|SUM1 (ser talk:SUM1|talk) 02:51, 14 January 2020 (UTC)

ing|WhatamIdoing It isn't really &quot;my goal&quot;, short descriptions are a community goal, which is why I'm consulting the community on what their views are on what a good gene or syndrome short description should like given the mentioned scenarios. But if you ask me, my ideal description for BRCA1 would be &quot;Gene known for its role in breast cancer&quot;, while Histidine decarboxylase's would be &quot;Enzyme that converts histidine to histamine&quot;. The main issue mentioned in the original discussion was when it came to syndromes, because differentiating between some became very difficult. Though Seppi333 is right, I'll take this to WikiProject Molecular Biology. ser:SUM1|SUM1 (ser talk:SUM1|talk) 07:53, 14 January 2020 (UTC)
ser:SUM1|SUM1,
First, and less importantly, the entire community doesn't actually support the local short description project.  Anyone supporting translation probably wants to see good descriptions everywhere, which means Wikidata – not just here and locked into CC-BY-SA requirements, which means that any copyrightable short description can't be imported into Wikidata.
Second, and much more importantly, if you want to know what to write, you need to know how it will be used.  There are many possible descriptions for those subjects, but when would someone actually use that description to make a decision?  If you're trying to figure out whether to click on &quot;abbreviation for British Canandian&quot; or &quot;gene known for its role in breast cancer&quot;, then something as vague as &quot;biology&quot; would probably be good enough for BRCA1.  If you're trying to come up with a pithy description that will appear at the top of Google's [Knowledge Graph, then you need something else.  So what's the use case? ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:52, 14 January 2020 (UTC)

ser:Whispyhistory|Whispyhistory:  Very few.  Surveys of the English Wikipedia's editors usually run ~15% women.  Readership splits almost 50–50 in Western countries, although men may spend somewhat more total time on the site (e.g., by reading every day instead of every other day, or by looking at two articles instead of one). 
I'm sure that some of the causes for the gender gap among editors are external (e.g., less time to research an article, because of the gender gaps in childcare; we have a lot fewer fathers than we &quot;should&quot;, too).  
However, some of the gaps are self-inflicted injuries.  People create content when they expect that content to be accepted.  If you don't see content in your area of interest, then you won't think that Wikipedia is the place for it.  So, to use a tired example, we don't have much content on feeding kids.  Consider eeding on demand and ivision of responsibility in feeding – both things that anyone who survived a rotation in pediatrics has heard about, and they're both red links.  llyn Satter, who developed the &quot;DOR&quot; method, was deleted years ago as being non-notable.  ottle propping is basically a form of force-feeding babies, and it's a red link.  The problem is pervasive below the level of individual articles, too.  egetarianism doesn't mention babies, except to say that vegetarian women give birth to more girls than boys.  one broth, which I'd never heard of until a few years ago (turns out that it's another name for homemade stock), is apparently the internet's favorite thing to feed to older babies these days, and our article doesn't mention that at all.  The grocery store is filled with tand-up pouches for toddlers, and the article doesn't mention that market (nor the sugar in those &quot;vegetables&quot;).  Articles that are definitely about this under-represented group, like ippy cup, tend to be thin and insubstantial.  We don't look like we're here for their interests, so the people who might be obsessing about whether this trend or that one is the best go to other sites.  This includes previously active male editors, who know our actual rules around notability, but who don't write articles about babies when they have them (and instead write me e-mail messages explaining that they don't edit much any longer, but am I interested in baby pictures?

 Research on CBD 

Finding that there was little in the article on the benefits or alleged benefits of annabidiol (CBD), I went to Medline and looked at recent research, and from it inserted the following:

Recent (2020) research has found that:
&quot;CBD has shown to have benefit in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including autism spectrum disorder, anxiety, psychosis, neuropathic pain, cancer pain, HIV, migraine, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, hypoxic-ischemic injury and epilepsy. CBD is generally well tolerated. Most common adverse events are diarrhea and somnolence. CBD also shows significantly low abuse potential.&quot;[15]
&quot;Accumulated evidence indicates that cannabidiol (CBD), a nonpsychotomimetic and nonaddictive main component of the Cannabis sativa plant, reverses anxiety-like behavior.&quot;[16]
&quot;CBD is non-psychoactive but exerts a number of beneficial pharmacological effects, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. ...[CBD has] therapeutic potential...for many diseases, including diseases associated with oxidative stress.&quot;[17]
&quot;Newly available evidence supports earlier findings that cannabidiol probably reduces the frequency of seizures among children with drug-resistant epilepsy.&quot;[18]
&quot;CBD has neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects.&quot;[6]

The articles I cited as support were:

As much of the research is recent, I don't think we'll have success in finding books that describe it.  

On a more general note, Wikipedia assumes that CBD is effective for at least two neurological conditions, because the FDA approved pidiolex as being safe and effective for the treatment of ennox–Gastaut syndrome and ravet syndrome.  Therefore we should avoid language that contradicts that.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 19:31, 18 January 2020 (UTC)

Of course they do.  They're librarians, not enforcers of a scientific purity standard.  They even index edical Hypotheses.
If you're trying to support a claim that COS and autism have some symptoms in common, then try a reference book such as the DSM-5, rather than journal articles.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=s4w9DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=107 &quot;Behavioral and cognitive symptoms associated with COS overlap features of autism spectrum disorders (ASD)&quot;] should do nicely for you.  Page 99 [https://books.google.com/books?id=zxf4Z4PAiXwC of this book] says &quot;Autism and autism-like conditions were long considered synonymous with childhood schizophrenia.  Since about 1980, childhood schizophrenia is regarded as clearly separate from autism.  Most authors agree that it is rare, the prevalence being just a tiny fraction of that of autism.&quot;  [https://books.google.com/books?id=QU-eYqtLGt8C&amp;pg=PA526  This book]  says that COS and autism were considered very similar only in the DSM-2, and that the research proving the two were separate conditions appeared only a few years after its publication.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 04:43, 15 January 2020 (UTC)

The pursuit of filling Wikipedia with all the right information. By way of example, Kleenex a brand name of a facial tissue and Puffs both have pages. 

Jeuveau, Dysport, Botox and Xeomin are all different brands, have different kDAs and are different formulations of neurotoxins. Unfortunately today are bundled together. Which is missing because they last different amounts of times, are manufactured differently and have different business models. ser:Dgranite|Dgranite (ser talk:Dgranite|talk) 00:13, 20 January 2020 (UTC)

 Indeed James. leenex is a bit of an oddity because we have an article about the brand itself, rather than a particular product. uffs (facial tissue) is a non-notable stub that hasn't been improved since it was created by a now-blocked editor in 2005. I've just proded it.
 e|Dgranite I can't say I'm in sympathy with your desire to fill Wikipedia with trivia tantamount to advertising. Are there good sources discussing the differences in efficacy or application of the different brands of botulinum toxins? Otherwise, who cares about the differences, apart from each brand's marketing department? Given what is stated in P:WEIGHT, q|&quot;Undue weight can be given in several ways, including but not limited to depth of detail ...&quot;, why is the treatment in otulinum toxin not sufficient to reflect what the best quality sources say? --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 01:00, 20 January 2020 (UTC)

Sorry, I guess I'm just trying to understand. What about Tylenol or Excedrin, which are medical brands using acetaminophen differently.  ser:Dgranite|Dgranite (ser talk:Dgranite|talk) 02:06, 20 January 2020 (UTC)
ser:Dgranite|Dgranite, xcedrin redirects to the generic, which is what euveau does.  ylenol takes you to a page with links to the generic (if you want to know about the drug) and to a specialized article about the brand (if you want to know about the brand).  The Tylenol brand is studied in business school textbooks, because of their response to the hicago Tylenol murders.  If your brands ever get that famous, then they'll get their own articles, too. 
As a practical matter, if you want people to know about the differences between the various brands, then the generic is the place to put that information.  People tend to read those articles more often than the others (about 5:1 for Tylenol).  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 02:27, 20 January 2020 (UTC)

Ah. I understand. Can someone create a redirect page then? similiar to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tylenol - for euveau, eomin, otox and ysport? ser:Dgranite|Dgranite (ser talk:Dgranite|talk) 06:38, 20 January 2020 (UTC)
 It seems they all already existed. I've done some minor tidying. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 10:41, 20 January 2020 (UTC)
I think that ser:Dgranite was asking for ikipedia:Disambiguation pages, rather than redirects.  ikipedia:Redirects send you straight to another page.  Disambiguation pages make the reader stop and pick which page to read.  e.g., otox (disambiguation) to let the reader choose either otulinum toxin (to read about the product) or otox (brand) (to read about the marketing work).
It's not clear to me that the condition I stated earlier (&quot;If your brands ever get that famous...&quot;) has been fulfilled for all of these brands.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 22:21, 20 January 2020 (UTC)
I think this will be interesting because most people do not realize that Botox is a brand. They think Botox is a category. ~~~

That page irritated me.  

t|&quot;couldn’t make the connection between Carrie and the classical depression symptoms I learned&quot; – That's probably because classical depression is not the only cause of suicide.
t|&quot;No physical illness invites as much shame and social stigma as mental illnesses do&quot; – This might be true in some overall sense, but the shame most (Western) patients feel over common mental illnesses (anxiety and mild depression) less than the shame they feel about common sexually transmitted diseases.  Infertility has a huge social stigma in some parts of the world.  There are  places in which you aren't considered an adult until you produce children, and where infertility is considered divine punishment for your sins.  There's also the difficulty of classifying some situations:  If you can't manage parts of your everyday life because you're on the autism spectrum, or if you rage is always one breath away after your brain injury, is that &quot;physical&quot; or &quot;mental&quot;?  
t|&quot;in reality, [mental illness] is generally caused by uncontrollable chemical imbalances in the brain&quot; – except when it isn't.  This is one &quot;story&quot; we tell, but it is not true for every condition, and it may not be true for most people.
  I know; it was written by a teenager.  It's not bad.  She's doing some good.  She probably even has a more nuanced and complete understanding than fits on that page.  But we should probably make sure that our articles aren't pushing these oversimplified ideas.  
Also, in the specific context, which is about Asian cultures, what the Western countries call &quot;mental&quot; illnesses aren't necessarily seen the same way.  For example, a Chinese person with depression may focus on physical symptoms (e.g., fatigue, appetite, sleep quality) rather than emotional ones (e.g., irritability).  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 22:45, 20 January 2020 (UTC)

 Can non-members update assessments? 
I've been going through countless articles that have out of date or otherwise very inaccurate WikiProject assessments. I've been wanting to update this seemingly neglected area of Wikipedia but didn't know if I'm allowed to, as I'm not a WikiProject member. The policy on this has been conflicting. The main ikipedia:Content_assessment#FAQ|article assessments page and ikipedia:WikiProject_Molecular_Biology/Genetics/Assessment|some WikiProjects say anyone can edit or update assessments. But some WikiProjects (ikipedia:WikiProject Medicine/Assessment|including this one) say, in the FAQ anyway, that only members can update assessments. However, this WikiProject contradictingly says on the same page that &quot;Anyone can assess articles. You do not need to be an administrator, or even be a registered editor. Please follow the instructions below to help out with this ongoing task.&quot; All WikiProjects also seem to be highly inviting to the prospect of editors editing assessments. Of course, the difference between being a WikiProject member or not is adding your name to a list, which either completely new or highly experienced editors could do, so, regardless, it's vesting that responsibility in anyone.

And with a 'referer' of 'external', [https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/metrics/mediarequests/per-file/external/all-agents/%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fb%2Fbe%2FWikipedia-VideoWiki-Appendicitis.webm/monthly/2019120100/2019123100 1800].  Still leaves ~10k coming presumably from other wikis, which don't host the video anywhere. I am not aware of a way to just ask for the breakdown by wiki.) 
 Can we say that the medical videos are among the most watched? (To the extent that this is not a trivial question anyway; I mean that videos are quite rare on WP, as far as I know.) Even there I wonder: if this count is completely mangled by a technical issue, it's quite possible that the videos show up on this list only because they are among the only videos that are found in articles that receive notable traffic--and the technical issue may correlate strongly with/be caused by simply visiting the article. This might be disproven by finding a fairly high-traffic article with a video that has particularly low views.
 Finally, I looked at my browser requests when I viewed the appendicitis video, and it requested the video twice: once in a 7 megabyte file that matched the main file name, and then another 7 megabyte file associated with one of the video's encodings, resulting in a 14+ MB transfer.

*I continue to be happy with the progress and impact of this experiment. Video continues to grow in popularity and importance. Wikipedia needs experiments in video production and publishing. This project has been low cost, low disruption, and been an excellent demonstration of concept and exercise in scoping the challenge. Since 2015 the Wikimedia Foundation has consumed about US$400,000,000, and I would guess that about US$50,000,000 of that money is relevant to the development of medical projects. This video project is among the more prominent of Wikimedia experiments since its establishment in 2015 and its expenditure seems to have been less than US$10,000 in that time, which is almost negligible in the frenzy of consumption in the past few years. I feel satisfied that we recognized the popularity of online video and that WikiProject Medicine's support has led to enthusiasm for this video project despite its modesty. With the WMF dependably pulling in $120,000,000 per year and growing for the foreseeable future, I appreciate that we have low cost agile experiments like this one to present among the many options we have for investment after the meta:Strategy/Wikimedia movement/2018-20/Recommendations|5-week comment period of recommendations and when we move into the implementation page which will guide spending. I anticipate a future of great change as Wikimedia projects move from almost entirely volunteer developed, to including some professional support somehow. I have no idea how that will look, but including video is an obvious idea to develop in preparation for relevance in future media. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 18:45, 28 January 2020 (UTC)

* e|Doc James There probably needs to be a better system in place for attribution. I note on File:Wikipedia-VideoWiki-Cholera.webm the image File:Cholera hospital in Dhaka.jpg isn't credited on Commons even though it's clearly in the video and credited on videowiki.wmflabs.org. Probably should just be one page on videowiki that credits all the media in the latest version, and one template on Commons that links to that page.
 What happens if we delete an image on Commons? Does videowiki react to that in any way? ser:GreenMeansGo|GMGser talk:GreenMeansGo#top|talk 19:17, 27 January 2020 (UTC)
ser:GreenMeansGo at 2:18 of the video I see attribution provided to Mark Knobil and the license listed? On Commons I see the author listed.
When an image is deleted from Commons that deletion will remove it from the video script[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:VideoWiki/Cholera]. When the video is recreated it will be removed from the video. 
How does commons work currently with derivatives? We have it listed that a video is a derivative of all the files that make it up.[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wikipedia-VideoWiki-Cholera.webm] ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk · pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 08:48, 28 January 2020 (UTC)
James, I think you've described what you believe happens, but the actual file description page on Commons does not mention this image or author, though it does mention others. This suggests perhaps an attribution bug in the software.
Further, the File:Wikipedia-VideoWiki-Cholera.webm page on Commons says q|Author User:Doc James, User:Ian Furst which is not permitted per CC licensing: you need to name all authors, not just the two who wrote the text and assembled the images. You are using CC4.0 but some files are licensed CC3.0 which further requires that all contributors be given equal prominence.
You have a further problem with the whole idea of basing the video on the article text (or even the lead) in that unless you rewrite the video transcript entirely in your own words, you have committed plagiarism by not attributing the Wikipedia article and are breaking the terms of the Wikipedia licences by not crediting the authors of article text upon which this is based. -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 10:39, 28 January 2020 (UTC)
d 
As to CCBYSA 4.0, CCBYSA 3.0 is also designed to be explicitly compatible with all later versions, and the use of any media that is CCBYSA 4.0 requires that the composite work also be the latest version. So I don't think that's an issue. 
What is an issue is a sustainable way to sync the ever changing VideoWiki version with the version on Commons. My thought is that there should just be a page on VideoWiki that auto-generates based on the content that is included in the live video. On the Commons side, we can just include a standard template something to the effect of:
mbox
| type  = license
| style = 
| image = ile:VideoWiki Logo - Official (cropped)Sized.png|120px
| text = This video was created using m:VideoWiki|VideoWiki, a project for collaboratively building videos using free content available on Wikimedia Commons. Media from Commons may be c:COM:PD|in the public domain, or may be released under a number of c:COM:L|free licenses accepted by Commons.

The transcript of the video may also incorporate content from the corresponding Wikipedia article or articles as of the latest revision of the video. Content on Wikipedia is dual licensed under ikipedia:Text of Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License|CC BY-SA 3.0 and ikipedia:Text of the GNU Free Documentation License|GFDL. See the history of the corresponding Wikipedia article for full attribution.

This video itself is licensed under the [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International], in order to be compatible with all prior versions of the same license. 
For a full list of content used in this video, please see the live version of the video attribution page on VideoWiki.


I think that takes care of most of the legalese. We just need a few things to happen VideoWiki side. First, we need an automatically generated page to link to that lists all the media and all the references currently in the live version of the video. This can just be a compilation of all the content included in the individual reference sections for each &quot;slide&quot;. Second, we need to update the license for VideoWiki to 4.0 from 3.0. These licenses are forward compatible but not backward. So you can't have a 3.0 work that is derivative of 4.0 content. 

The only thing I'm not sure about is if the video includes something from an obscure license, like MIT, which isn't necessarily compatible with the chain of creative commons licenses, but is still accepted by Commons. There may need to be some kind of fail-safe built in that will actively prevent you from using this type of content. No idea how we would actually implement that. 

But the important thing is that we incorporate a sustainable and scaleable system like this early before we have a big mess of scores or hundred of videos that all need to be cleaned up because we didn't get our licensing and attribution system sorted out. Hopefully this all makes sense more than it confuses things. Also pinging...umm...ing|Jameslwoodward|Alexis Jazz to double check my math on how all the licensing works out. ser:GreenMeansGo|GMGser talk:GreenMeansGo#top|talk 14:26, 28 January 2020 (UTC)
ser:GreenMeansGo|GreenMeansGo you may choose to ignore the 3.0 specific requirements about equal prominence (though imo it is a bit disrespectful) but what isn't possible per CC BY-SA licences is to claim the authors are just James and Ian, which is what [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wikipedia-VideoWiki-Cholera.webm the Commons page does] and if you click &quot;Use this file&quot; it only gives James and Ian for attribution purposes. Look at [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:VideoWiki/Cholera&amp;oldid=893474222 the first version of Cholera VideoWiki transcript]. This is a copy/paste of the lead of holera and yet fails ikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia. So that's wrong to begin with, both legally and morally. The Commons page (and video credits) needs to find a way to say that this video transcript is derived from the Wikipedia article and link to that in order to satisfy attribution. -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 14:48, 28 January 2020 (UTC)

This is a good point. In that case, the author parameter on Commons should be entirely omitted or substituted to a link to VideoWiki, where the history of authors contributing to the derivative video is listed. Again, imagining and planning for a scenario where this becomes a fully-fledged project, the list of authors will likely be large, and we cannot individually list dozens or scores of authors including anyone who fixed a typo. So there probably also needs to be a parameter on VideoWiki for Wikipedia article =  that the template can link to in order to satisfy the attribution requirement. Again, I don't know how we implement that technically, I'm just trying to work out the copyright side of what exactly it is we need to find a way to implement. ser:GreenMeansGo|GMGser talk:GreenMeansGo#top|talk 15:03, 28 January 2020 (UTC)

I think that these videos can and should be treated in exactly the same way as Commons treats collages -- namely that each constituent part be present on Commons and be listed separately with its source and license. Images or media taken from external sources are not acceptable as part of a Commons collage unless they are first uploaded separately to Commons and, if necessary, the license passes license review.

The use of the collapse template in the example is not acceptable. It is, however, appropriate to list as authors only those people who put together the work from the constituent parts, with all of the constituent parts cited below them. Of course, to the extent that any of the constituent parts are CC-BY, then their authors must be credited. It is helpful if the person assembling the work actually includes the correct credit line, if one is required.

As far as citing sources of the text goes, all that requires is a simple link to the WP article(s), which can easily be added to the Commons file description above, below, or interspersed with (in order) the video credits. .     Jim .  . ser:Jameslwoodward|(Jameslwoodward) (ser talk:Jameslwoodward|talk to me) 15:18, 28 January 2020 (UTC)
e|Jameslwoodward The authors of the derived works must be credited yes, but would it not satisfy the requirement to link to a page that links back to each individual file on Commons? The difference between this a collages is that collages aren't going to dynamically change from day to day. ser:GreenMeansGo|GMGser talk:GreenMeansGo#top|talk 15:22, 28 January 2020 (UTC)

I don't understand. If the videowiki changes, then the file in Commons that is its container will be changed by the upload of a new version over the old one. Why is it easier to change a credits page kept elsewhere rather than simply changing the page that contains the file? There is also the question of where the credits page will be kept -- Commons does not have an obvious place for that. .     Jim .  . ser:Jameslwoodward|(Jameslwoodward) (ser talk:Jameslwoodward|talk to me) 15:40, 28 January 2020 (UTC)
e|Jameslwoodward The situation currently is that someone has to 1) change the content on VideoWiki, 2) upload the video to Commons, and 3) manually change the attribution on Commons. All this information is already present, has already been &quot;data entered&quot; on VideoWiki. So it should be easy to automatically generate a list there of whatever media is currently used in the live version of the video. So we wouldn't need to account for contributors who forget to update Commons manually, or who do so wrongly. VideoWiki draws from Commons, and feeds into Commons, but is a separate proto-sister-project. ser:GreenMeansGo|GMGser talk:GreenMeansGo#top|talk 15:53, 28 January 2020 (UTC)
There are so many problems with this project, not just licensing, some of which are documented at P:NOTYOUTUBE. For example, ikipedia:Five pillars do not apply to Commons and the :Commons:Overwriting existing files|Commons:Overwriting existing files policy on file updates forbids making in-place edits with &quot;substantially different content&quot;, which is exactly what this tool encourages. The whole thing is a bodge job and it is frankly a relief for Commons that nobody has shown the slightest interest in it. -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 15:59, 28 January 2020 (UTC)
I'm not so pessimistic. I do however think that this has to be done in coordination with Commons in order to be done correctly. The framework has been set up. But I believe it requires further refinement. ser:GreenMeansGo|GMGser talk:GreenMeansGo#top|talk 16:06, 28 January 2020 (UTC)
c OK, but... I assume that this list that would be automatically created on VideoWiki could be transcluded onto the Commons page. It would then appear the same as the current treatment of a collage on Commons. That would be much better than requiring a naive user to click on a link to get the necessary credit information. We have enough trouble getting the world to appropriately credit us as it is.
Colin makes a good point about the overwriting files policy. If this is to work, you need a Commons policy change. .     Jim .  . ser:Jameslwoodward|(Jameslwoodward) (ser talk:Jameslwoodward|talk to me) 16:08, 28 January 2020 (UTC)

I'll add a question. Why is this being discussed here? It affects Commons more than WP and even on WP, the discussion should probably be somewhere more general than WikiProject Medicine. .     Jim .  . ser:Jameslwoodward|(Jameslwoodward) (ser talk:Jameslwoodward|talk to me) 16:14, 28 January 2020 (UTC)
e|Jameslwoodward Mainly because WikiProject Medicine on en.wiki has been the major player in actively incubating VideoWiki thus far. ser:GreenMeansGo|GMGser talk:GreenMeansGo#top|talk 16:36, 28 January 2020 (UTC)
IMO this should be discussed at c:Commons:Village pump/Copyright instead of here.  We are likely to get much better information if we take these questions to Commons' experts. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:22, 28 January 2020 (UTC)
 IF anyone takes that on, could they also figure out why I am unable to upload?  Is it just the speed of my connection?  (Yes, the idea that I write text on Wikipedia, and get no attribution on the video, is as troubling as the idea that I am apparently unable to edit or flag outdated text in videos.)  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  18:26, 28 January 2020 (UTC)

Edit activity:
*Shiprasarangi created Diarrhea at the weekend, and James has made some unpublished edits to that.
*Prior to this, the last video Doc James edited was in September 2019.
*Ian Furst last edited a video script in September 2019 to change a picture, but didn't publish the change, so their last visible edit was in August 2019, not long after the Wikimania presentation.
*Hassan.m.amin (developer of VideoWiki) last edited a video script in July 2019 to change a heading, but didn't publish that change, so their last visible edit was in April 2019.
*Soupvector made a few edits to Dengue fever in September 2019.
*Matanya changed the Commons file in October 2019 but didn't appear to change the transcript on Wikipedia, so who knows what that edit was.
*A redlink editor Oumaissatimbo reverted back two revisions by Hassan.m.amin to the Cancer video on Commons , and nobody seems to have noticed this possible vandalism.
So we have just a handful of editors, who mostly haven't edited videos since their post-Wikimania enthusiasm died. We have two dodgy-looking edits on Commons. The very foundation of Wikipedia is that it is collaboratively written by a large community of volunteer editors, where anyone looking at an article can make an improvement and quickly fix a mistake. VideoWiki, as an attempt to get editors to create and edit videos for Wikipedia, is a failure. The videos are rubbish too. -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 13:19, 27 January 2020 (UTC)

Perhaps my time would have been better spent editing the actual article, which is outdated and has numerous prose issues. When I look at the number of edits, and amount of effort, that went into producing a video with outdated information, I wonder why that same effort can't go into fixing the actual article.

 It does seem to have stalled, so I started it again on a different computer. And it is stalled there, too. So, I wasted a bit of time understanding that we couldn't just put maintenance tags in to the script, rather have to spell out the maintenance issue.  And that some things (like numbers and converts) need to be handled differently.  Other than that, I now have about three hours' worth of work into what would have been a 15-minute copyedit at the article (which is still needed).  How much does this tax the servers ? And I do wish people would be updating our articles before committing them to outdated videos. This video has dated info, which I am unable to easily flag. In the time I spent on these, I could have copyedited and updated a dozen articles. No videos uploaded.  Dengue fever article outdated. But I did get a manicure and pedicure. ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  20:19, 27 January 2020 (UTC)

A possible idea for increasing watchers and contributors to the scripts: in stead of keeping the scripts at WP:VW (e.g. P:VideoWiki/Gout), keep the script inside  tags at the bottom of the article itself (e.g. out). That way all changes are seen by relevant watchers and it is more likely that editors interested in the topic will consider updating the script. If the videowiki system requires it, that page section can be elp:Labeled section transclusion|marked for section transclusion out to P:VideoWiki/Gout. I'd be happy to implement one as an example if in need of testing. ser:Evolution and evolvability|T.Shafee(Evo&amp;Evo)ser talk:Evolution and evolvability|talk 03:39, 29 January 2020 (UTC)
