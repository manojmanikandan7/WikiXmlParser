Weird - I have never heard of it...good idea or....not? Cheers, Casliber (talk · ) 04:40, 12 January 2009 (UTC)
I think I'd have to disagree on this one. It's well referenced, albeit without the inline citations, but I can get round to that later, and refers to a specialised epileptic disease. There's nothing wrong with creating articles for rare conditions as long as they are well documented, which this one is as it has 484 PubMed hits (searching 'Abdominal AND epilepsy') and about 350 on scholar (using 'Abdominal epilepsy' on exact matching). Also, I'm not sure where we'd stick this if we merged it with epilepsy. —Cyclonenim (talk ·  · ) 10:53, 12 January 2009 (UTC)
 I would neither merge it. It is indeed weird, but documented so I feel it has its place in wikipedia. --Garrondo (talk) 11:09, 12 January 2009 (UTC)

Ok, fine by me. Cheers, Casliber (talk · ) 11:38, 12 January 2009 (UTC)


Pathology for medical practitioners

I think we should make a Pathology section destined for medical students and practitioners.
It should be organized the way pathology is studied in medical schools. Most of the articles are already there but they are not organized ...
What do you think ?

Wikipedia is written for the general public. What you are suggesting might be more appropriate for . --Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 15:05, 12 January 2009 (UTC)

the general public can understand medicine.  The only thing that is hard is the vocabulary.  Medicine is not hard to understand.  I agree, we should drastically improve the pathology sections and articles.  Use good writing, and the general public will understand and it can be modeled after how medical students are taught.  Medical students are like the general public when entering medical school and pathology is taught right away... you can do it here and I will read your articles.  (talk) 05:34, 13 January 2009 (UTC)

Scleritis Article

The article on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scleritis scleritis] was vandalized. I think I've fixed it adequately, but (1) I'm a patient WITH scleritis, not a medical professional, and (2) I've never done more than correct spelling, grammar or obvious spam before, so I would really appreciate it if someone more knowledgeable would review the article and make sure it's OK now.

Medical acronyms; also, my brain hurts

G'day all.  Today I am struggling with the acronym 'PICU', and related topics.

PICU stands for Pediatric Intensive Care Unit.  It also stands for Paediatric Intensive Care Unit.  In an arguably less-common (but every bit as valid) usage, it stands for Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit.

Recently, I created Pediatric intensive care unit.  I redirected PICU to this page, as previously it went to Intensive care unit.  I also redirected Paediatric intensive care unit.  So far so good.

Here comes the tricky part.  The page Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit has just been created.  This morning I have placed  on Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit, and  on Pediatric intensive care unit.  Questions from an inexperienced wikipedian:

* Have I used the two templates correctly? Are there others which are better suited?
* Am I correct in thinking that the 'pediatric' usage is more widely-known and should remain the target of the PICU redirect?
* &quot;Pediatric Intensive Care Unit&quot; in the article name or &quot;Pediatric intensive care unit&quot;?  I notice the psych ICU article uses the former style.
* &quot;Pediatric Intensive Care Unit&quot; in the article body, or &quot;Pediatric intensive care unit&quot;?  Or &quot;pediatric intensive care unit&quot;?

I know what I'd use, but wanted to get a sense of what was preferred by the project. Cheers, Basie (talk) 21:34, 12 January 2009 (UTC)

Depends where you are, services change from hospital to hospital, to get an accurate evaluation would involve reviewing loads of hospitals. I have also seen IPCU (for Intensive Psychiatric Care Unit) at the old Rozelle Hospital and other combinations. I wouldn't say one was more common than the other - eg Sydney (pop 4 million) has two big kids hospitals (where most childrens services are funnelled to) and loads of psych wards attached to bigger hospitals and 2 intensive psych units at least. Cheers, Casliber (talk · ) 22:32, 12 January 2009 (UTC)

 Yeah, I used to work at the Westmead PICU (the paediatric one, not the psychiatric one).  It was immediately adjacent to one of Sydney's psych hospitals (Cumberland) which I'm sure had an intensive care unit.  However, I wasn't saying the units were less common, just the use of the acronym in general publications.  When I tell people I work in PICU, most seem to assume I mean working with children.  Cheers, Basie (talk) 23:00, 12 January 2009 (UTC)

 Fair enough, Rozelle has now closed and moved lock-stock-and-barrel to Concord Hospital as well. Yeah, I take your point, though I suspect it would be somewhat tricky to back it up with a  although maybe a peads textbook might use the acronym. Cheers, Casliber (talk · ) 23:05, 12 January 2009 (UTC)
If &quot;PICU&quot; is most commonly used to refer to a peds ICU (I'd personally never seen it used as an acronym for &quot;psychiatric intensive care unit&quot;), there's no reason why it shouldn't redirect to Pediatric intensive care unit, and a  in each article suffices. Pediatric intensive care unit (sentence case) is also preferred per , unless the article is about a particular PICU in a particular hospital :)
On another note, if you're looking for a RS for acronyms and abbreviations, I believe Stanley Jablonski's [http://books.google.com.br/books?id=HPdGAAAACAAJ Dictionary of Medical Acronyms &amp; Abbreviations] is held in quite high regard. I don't own a copy, but someone might; perhaps  has access to a similar source. Fvasconcellos (t·) 23:15, 12 January 2009 (UTC)

Long term complications from blunt force abdominal trauma and hemoperitoneum

I need to find a review of the long term complications of blunt abdominal trauma and hemoperitoneum in children.  Can you help?  —Preceding  comment added by  (talk) 22:16, 13 January 2009 (UTC) 

 Pubmed is the place to go for such specific questions. It will probably be hard to find an article about the long term consequences of all blunt abdominal trauma. You can probably more easily find articles on specific injuries, such as in this case splenic, hepatic or renal injury. Let me know if you find anything, one of my main interests is pediatric surgery. --WS (talk) 01:10, 14 January 2009 (UTC)

I think you should start by finding a good general source on the subject.  A book about TCM-in-general is going to be more useful to you than a research paper about this-herb-at-this-dose-in-specific.

Pictures of Science: 700 Years of Scientific and Medical Illustration

http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/explore/?collection=SeeingIsBelieving700&amp;col_id=197

Brought together originally in 1999 for an exhibition held at the New York Public Library's Gottesman Exhibition Hall, this set of intriguing images covers the fields of astronomy, chemistry, geology, medicine, and physics taken from different engravings, lithographs, and manuscript illuminations. The images here range from the 16th to the 19th centuries, and they are culled from works such as the 1798 volume &quot;Elemens de la philosophie de Neuton&quot; and the important 1830 volume &quot;Principles of Geology&quot; written by geologist Sir Charles Lyell. All told, visitors can browse through ten crucial texts in their entirety, and they are all wonderful meditations on the skills and talents of unique scientists (and artists) throughout the ages.

It's on my watchlist.  We had problems with this editor over at Physician assistant; having that article locked down tightly is probably pushing the editor off to the NP article.

Bile acids and colon cancer

Could someone more familiar with cancer studies review [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hyodeoxycholic_acid&amp;diff=264360574&amp;oldid=264328231 this] paragraph I added recently. I think I correctly summarized the sources, but I'm confused by the fact that DCA, which causes apoptosis, is a cancer promoter. Xasodfuih (talk) 00:14, 16 January 2009 (UTC)

I think it is rather speculative. Some of your statements seem to be based on in vitro studies on aritifical cell lines. JFW | T@lk 01:15, 16 January 2009 (UTC)

This is outside my area of knowledge, but the thinking is probably as follows. Bile acids (like DCA) can cause DNA damage (e.g. ), but they also promote apoptosis, which serves as a check against the development of cancer. As with most cancers, multiple &quot;hits&quot; are probably necessary here - that is, if the colonic epithelial cells become resistant to bile-acid-driven apoptosis, then the DNA-damaging effects of the bile acid may accumulate to generate a cancer (take a look at , which indicates that loss of sensitivity to bile-acid-driven apoptosis is a key event in colon carcinogenesis). I guess it's a bit odd that all of this work seems to originate from a single center, but who knows. MastCell Talk 18:00, 16 January 2009 (UTC)
 Yeah, something like that. They formulate a hypothesis [http://carcin.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/25/5/681 here]: &quot;We have proposed that frequent exposure of the colonic epithelium of an individual to high concentrations of cytotoxic bile acids can select for an apoptosis-resistant cell population, making that individual at risk for colon cancer&quot;. Same AZ group, of course :-) Thank you both for your time, Xasodfuih (talk) 00:40, 19 January 2009 (UTC)
 N.B.: They publish in good enough journals though. Carcinogenesis has IF &gt; 5. So I guess other experts find it plausible. Xasodfuih (talk) 00:46, 19 January 2009 (UTC)

 The confusion here was around the carcinogenesis mechanism(s) of secondary bile acids. There doesn't seem to be a definitive answer, only hypotheses advanced by researchers in this area. Thanks, Xasodfuih (talk) 18:45, 19 January 2009 (UTC)

Anti-surgery editor

We have a POV push at Hyperhidrosis, Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy, Compensatory hyperhidrosis, and who knows what else.  I've barely had any time to review the (medical journal) sources, but I suspect general misrepresentation and/or using primary sources to debunk reviews.

I've started a detailed review of some of (her?) sources at .

We'll see what the response is.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 23:34, 19 January 2009 (UTC)

Yeah, almost all the proffered sources are less than stellar.  I do think we should be careful not to come down resoundingly on the side of the surgery though, or at least make it clear that the recurrence of symptoms is extremely common.
My impression is that the editor has a close personal interest in the subject and has a hard time staying objective.  We'll see what happens.  Good on you for being patient!  Cheers, Basie (talk) 13:11, 20 January 2009 (UTC)
&quot;Less than stellar&quot; is an understatement.  I think the 1973 surgery involving five dogs (which cannot sweat) is my favorite proof of side effects in hyperhidrosis patients, but about 80% of the proffered &quot;scientific proof&quot; in Hyperhidrosis is single-patient case studies, people with unrelated diseases, and similarly pathetic sourcing.  And the editor says that she's relying on these studies because the current, mainstream papers don't sufficiently support her POV. 
There are certainly both short-term and long-term side effects and complications from sympathectomy, but we don't have to rely on these pathetic sources to demonstrate that.  Limitations and side effects are  addressed at some length in solid, up-to-date medical reviews and textbooks.  There's absolutely no need to use these cherry-picked sources to paint the picture worse than it is.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:22, 20 January 2009 (UTC)

Will someone straighten out article title, redirects

I am not sure, but I think the article CHILD, known as Congenital hemidysplasia with ichthyosiform erythroderma and limb defects syndrome, also found through Congenital_hemidysplasia_with_ichthyosiform_erythroderma_and_limb_defects_(CHILD)_syndrome, and possibly other redirects, may need some cleanup of its article title and redirects to conform to accepted naming conventions?  Could someone help fix this if it needs fixing? Thanks again! kilbad (talk) 00:45, 21 January 2009 (UTC)

Redirects are cheap, and anything that a reasonable reader might search for (including capitalisation confusion) may exist. Of course they should be pointing to one single correctly-formated-titled article. The article title needs to be medically correct (vs common lay term) as per , but then as commonly used in medical cicles, and &quot;Congenital hemidysplasia with ichthyosiform erythroderma and limb defects&quot; just ain't going to be what any expert in the field uses in their day-to-day speach. That said consider CREST syndrome which is much better known and similarly only by the abbreviation (vs &quot;Syndrome of Calcinosis, Raynaud's syndrome, Esophageal dysmotility, Sclerodactyly and Telangiectasia&quot;). That said, we refer to &quot;CREST syndrome&quot; not &quot;CREST&quot;, and so I would move CHILD to CHILD syndrome. David Ruben  Talk  01:43, 21 January 2009 (UTC)
As the article creator, I have no objection to the proposal. I've moved it to CHILD syndrome. --Arcadian (talk) 05:23, 21 January 2009 (UTC)

Drug dosage

I've received a few e-mails about why we don't include drug dosage information in WP entries. I know  states:

Do not include dose and titration information except when they are notable or necessary for the discussion in the article. Wikipedia is not an instruction manual or textbook and should not include instructions, advice (legal, medical or otherwise) or &quot;how-to&quot;s; see WP:NOT#HOWTO.

But some physicians said WP shouldn't be that paternalistic. You can follow the discussion on [http://search.twitter.com/search?q=drug+dosage Twitter]. Others asked why we can't include such information plus attaching an additional disclaimer. 

What do you think?

NCurse  work 13:33, 19 January 2009 (UTC)

 I'm not a member here, but I have an opinion.  The clause &quot;except when they are notable or necessary for the discussion&quot; seems to be interpreted liberally, and that is as it should be.  For example when &quot;large doses&quot; or &quot;small doses&quot; are mentioned, some range may need to be presented for it to make sense.  Also many drugs when new (for example birth control pills) contained high doses which since have come way down, and that would be a valid part of the discussion.  To conclude, I think the paragraph you quote is reasonable as it stands.  
 Also, I think one shouldn't begin with &quot;additional disclaimer[s]&quot;, as where might that end? If you have one in article A, then you certainly must at B, but whether needed at C needs discussion.  Better not to start on that, IMO. - Hordaland (talk) 14:29, 19 January 2009 (UTC)

I can see where it would be problematic to have dosing information in an article if people read it and then take whatever dose the article says. Mistakes or vandalism could lead to ODing. But including dosing information straight from a PI sheet, to me that doesn't fall under &quot;instructions, advice, or 'how-to's&quot; - it's descriptive information about the drug. Being able to say &quot;the usual dose for condition x is 2 mg&quot; or 200 mg tells the reader about the strength and efficacy of the drug in a quantitative way, which is better than simply stating that the drug is potent or some other ambiguous statement. Titration information, on the other hand, is instructional and shouldn't be included. But I don't see the harm in being able to say, for example, &quot;The usual dose of propranolol for hypertension is 120-240 mg per day.[http://pi.watson.com/data_stream.asp?product_group=1506&amp;p=pi&amp;language=E]&quot; My sister was watching ER the other day and I saw a doctor order 1 mg of propranolol for a hypertensive patient. Had I not been around to inform my sister that 1 mg is barely enough to affect an infant, she should be able to go on Wikipedia and see that the ER writers made a mistake, rather than believing that 1 mg of propranolol is going to lower an adult's blood pressure. Wikipedia is intended for a general audience - a PI sheet is not. Articles should include the useful, descriptive information about a drug from reliable sources (e.g. PI sheets) stated in a way that a general audience can easily comprehend. twirligigLeave one! ⋄  17:28, 19 January 2009 (UTC)

Maybe if there was a dose template and only people with 500 or more edits could edit it, it would work. Vandalism can already happen. There is nothing to stop someone adding in misinformation on dosage now.--Literaturegeek | T@1k? 17:55, 19 January 2009 (UTC)

Have a I made a mistake? Who knows! Colin°Talk 19:02, 19 January 2009 (UTC)

Good point! . I have no objections to mentioning dosages, but only when they are worth discussing. I disagree with Twirligig that it says something about the drug's strength in a quantitative fashion. Discussing how omeprazole is usually given at 20 to 40 mg is a mindless uninteresting fact. Discussing the colors of warfarin tablets, or the difficulty of preparing adrenaline/epinephrine in the right dosage for iv bolus in anaphylactic shock, those are examples where the dosage has notability per se.
This is obviously a spin-off of the recent publication in Annals of Pharmacotherapy, see also previous discussions here and on the more relevant . --Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 21:04, 19 January 2009 (UTC)
P.S.: nice seeing you around NCurse!

I'm a little concerned about including dosing info - I realize we took a beating in that journal article for not including drug dosing, but nonetheless. The problem with dosing info is that it's often not particularly cut-and-dried, as Colin points out. What's the proper dose of intravenous haloperidol, for instance? As far as I know, IV Haldol is still not FDA-approved, so there is no &quot;approved&quot; dose. The doses used in practice vary substantially. The other problem has to do with currency - drug dosing information changes occasionally, and it creates a major maintenance problem when we're already stretched thin. Is there a freely available, reliable dosing guide out there on the Web that we could include as an external link on our drug articles? Maybe that would work? MastCell Talk 21:34, 19 January 2009 (UTC)
I have added a Daily Med field to  (context ). I believe that this may help address this issue. Click [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pregabalin&amp;diff=265161448&amp;oldid=262757645 here] to see what Pregabalin looks like with this field in the infobox, or click [http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?id=5166 here] to see the external link. --Arcadian (talk) 21:54, 19 January 2009 (UTC)

Thanks Colin, and if people don't think that's suitably  to be avoided in articles, he did rather simplify things ! For the BNF appendicies also need referring to:
*Appendix 2: Liver disease p 783 &quot;Propranolol - reduce dose&quot;
*Appendix 3: Renal Impairment p798 &quot;Manufacturer advises caution - dose reduction may be required&quot; and for &quot;Principles of dose adjusment in renal impairment&quot; there is a whole page 787 in eye-straining size-10 font to be digested. Of course that in turn needs to combined with &quot;NICE clinical guideline 73 Chronic kidney disease: early identification and management of chronic kidney disease in adults in primary and secondary care&quot; (only some of its 204 pages of relevance here) as to what counts as &quot;renal impairment&quot;
Twirligig, as above indicates 1mg intravenously is propably a good adult dose, so appologise to ER writers and your sister :-)  Seriously though this all shows just how problematic including simplified adult oral dosage is, eg of &quot;40mg once to thrice daily in anxiety &amp; 80-160mg twice daily for hypertension&quot; (PS I generally try hard not to prescribe for anxiety directly at 40mg - patients generally complain of light headiness, so prefer to issue as 10mg 1-4 thrice daily as required, and then step up to 40mg if so needed/tolerated).
Drug information sheets are no help either, as can vary significantly between countries, eg cardioprotection dosage of aspirin is typically 75mg in UK, but very different I believe in the US.
Even where we could agree on a global dosaging, the range of strengths is frankly meaningless to the average reader: Atorvatatin 40mg tablet is of a size that bears no relationship to the drug quantity (being similar in size to a Paracetamol 500mg and not that much larger than Doxazosin 1mg). Nor is potency given by the dosage weight where large differences might be equi-potent (eg Lisinopril 2.5mg is not disimilar in effect to Irbesartan 75mg) or wildly different as in Morphine 10mg m/r twice a day being approx  equivalent to 2 tablets of the combination codeine/paracetamol 30/500mg  taken 4 times a day - an apparent weight ratio 1:212 - and thus a cancer patient on Morphine 90mg twice a day will be in a totally different league of pain control from just 2x500mg paracetamols for a headache ! And yes I have encountered patients seeking &quot;less agressive treatment&quot; because they have looked up online various members of a drug class and seen that one seems to come in a lighter tablet size 
Finally as Twirligig correctly states &quot;Articles should include the useful, descriptive information about a drug ... stated in a way that a general audience can easily comprehend&quot; and a general audience does not mean the targeted audience of patients wishing to take a drug who should have discussed with their doctor, had a pharmacist check with them that they understand the indication &amp; instructions (having checked the prescription for being reasonable in its details, eg Digoxin 125mg is a 1000-fold overdose vs Digoxin 125mcg), and then bother to read the enclosed, and totally-free, drug leaflet. Doh! how naiive I am, patients should be freely deciding for themselves to self-treat their arthritis with methotrexate ordered illegally over the internet and taken unsupervised (if you need to ask, this great drug has potentially life-threatening side effects) David Ruben  Talk  22:22, 19 January 2009 (UTC)

I think it's also worth noting the monumental amount of work we'd be adding to an already busy editing schedule!  But maybe I'm just lazy ;)

I really don't want to be responsible for some poor emergency department registrar having to explain to a patient, &quot;Yes, I know Wikipedia said I should give you two grams, but that would kill you!&quot; Cheers, Basie (talk) 22:51, 19 January 2009 (UTC)

I just don't see the encyclopedic value.  I mean, we could list the drug registration milestones for each drug with each agency, too, as that's also information that some readers will really want to know and which directly affects their personal medical care, since &quot;ain't registered here&quot; means &quot;you can't take that drug&quot;.  But that's also a violation of .  We're supposed to provide meaning and context, not create a database. 
And as for the physicians:  have they really thought through the implications of an &quot;encyclopedia that anyone can edit&quot;?  Do they really want patients demanding higher doses of opiates, because an addict-vandalized &quot;Wikipedia says you gave me a very low dose&quot;?  Do they really want patients to cut back on their antihypertensives because a noncompliant patient vandalized Wikipedia to make his/her family think that the normal dose was so high that it's dangerous?  Think about the negative effect of the worst internet chat board, and now add the authority of the information coming from an encyclopedia and one of the most popular websites in the world, instead of from Natural_Joe@hotmail.com, who joined the chat board four days ago. 
Sure:  vandalism can happen now.  But if 95% of the time, there's no information given at all (and therefore no incorrect information given), with the result that most of the time, people will have to look at more secure sources for that information.
And it would be a maintenance nightmare.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 23:51, 19 January 2009 (UTC)

Without a reliable source of dosing information I do agree it's better to not include it. However, I think if the argument is going to be made that we're responsible for people who decide to use Wikipedia as a primary source of information about their medication, which I'm sure will continue to happen regardless of how much information we include, then I have to ask, is the information on Wikipedia supposed to be censored simply because people might make poor decisions based on it? twirligigLeave one! ⋄  23:56, 19 January 2009 (UTC)

I guess I'm exposing myself as a social Darwinist (of the Darwin Awards variety). I just don't believe in sacrificing the exchange of knowledge for the protection of people lacking in the ability to use that knowledge. Anyway, since it appears that no one in favor of including dosing information in articles cares enough to participate in this discussion, I think the more important issue is that  or the links mentioned above are missing from many drug articles (e.g. Adderall, Olanzapine, and Risperidone). Correcting that should be sufficient to bring this debate to a close. twirligigLeave one! ⋄  01:54, 20 January 2009 (UTC)

From what I've seen people are doing just fine killing themselves off without our help!  Seriously though, I take your point and it is a fine line between saying what we say already in the articles (knowledge people could use to hurt themselves) and specifying exact numbers.  The line is there though, and I'd rather not cross it. (By the way, I like correcting TV medical shows too.

Thank you, guys, so much for your valuable comments. It seems we can stick to the former concept and we won't include drug dosage-related information in entries. I also think that is the best decision. Wikipedia has an entry on bombs, but not an instruction about how to create one (sorry for the bad example). NCurse  work 00:05, 23 January 2009 (UTC)

Disease navigation templates - emphasise disease vs. causative agent

The navigation templates  and  have become increasingly virology templates rather than disease templates.  (For the versions I am commenting on, see [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Zoonotic_viral_diseases&amp;oldid=265327406] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Viral_diseases&amp;oldid=265396155])

While the name, title, categories and wikiproject information indicate that they are about diseases, the viral causes of the disease and the taxonomy of the viruses are being emphasized, and the diseases buried.

I think we should move it back to dealing with diseases (i.e. disease first), group items by disease characteristics, and remove taxonomic information on the causative organism (since the templates have grown so large).

If want to keep the focus on viruses, then the name, title, category, color scheme, etc. should be changed to make them virology templates (e.g. viruses that affect humans).  

Thoughts?  Suggestions?  Is there previous discussion/consensus on whether disease templates should list disease or causative agent first, and whether groupings should favor disease or agent characteristics?

(Please note that before starting this discussion I did revise Zoonotic viral diseases to try to re-emphasize the disease aspect, but upon realizing how widespread the issue was I decided it would be well to seek input before pursuing further.) Thank you. Zodon (talk) 01:29, 21 January 2009 (UTC)
I disagree with many of the assumptions underlying your arguments, but rather than debating them individually, could you create a model in your userspace of what you would consider to be ideal? --Arcadian (talk) 01:02, 22 January 2009 (UTC)

Which assumptions?  What is unclear about the suggested edits?
An additional template with the same problem is  (see [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Protozoal_diseases&amp;oldid=264758738] for current version).
Protozoal diseases is so overweighted with taxonomy that most of the screen space is empty, and the diseases are off the screen.  (Just imagine looking at it on a mobile internet device with a small screen).
The purpose of s is navigation.  Infoboxes, taxonomic navboxes and other aids exist for taxonomy.  Or perhaps the navboxes should be split - one for virology/parisitology (emphasize taxonomy), and one for medicine (diseases).  Zodon (talk) 02:38, 22 January 2009 (UTC)

I think  is fairly good format. ie. DISEASE (agent). The Protozoan template could be changed to follow a similar fashion - at the moment it is Parasitic agent (disease).
Taxonomy could be further reduced by removing the columns with taxanomic division (eg. virus family names).--ZayZayEM (talk) 06:31, 22 January 2009 (UTC)

The examples are not straight taxonomic templates, but they are classification schemes and they are complicated.  Checking some of the entries, I see their categories do not begin to reflect what is in the templates.  Eg, each virus could be in a category referring to its host, its own taxonomy, and possibly one or more disease categories.  --Una Smith (talk) 09:53, 22 January 2009 (UTC)

eMedicine template usage and Infobox Disease

Just a quick heads up, eMedicine website been restructured, don't worry, the current Wikipedia external link templates still will work as eMedicine internally redirects to its new /article space. 

Anyone now searching eMedicine for links to use with our templates of ,  and  will need set 1st parameters as the fixed literal text of &quot;article&quot; (vs previously the medical field of say 'emerg', 'med', 'pmr' etc) and use as the second numerical parameter value the new-style eMedicine article-numbers.

I've edited the above external linking templates to be backwards compatable and rephrased their documentation accordingly. David Ruben  Talk  06:50, 10 January 2009 (UTC)

 It should be possible using some if statements to use the new url structure when no second parameter is present (i.e. ). I gave it a try earlier, but I am not that good with the template magic. Could you make them behave that way? --WS (talk) 22:29, 11 January 2009 (UTC)
Good thought, but what of providing the additional parameters for article name or subpage ? (i.e. )  Whilst the article numbers have more digits than the older topic numbers (and so presumably a useful test distinction), I was sort of hoping for preserving the text topic name parameter, as I for one thought it has been useful to see ped/1234 neph/5423 previously in the  - one link clealy pediatric and other nephrology
As presumably I can test that second numerical parameter to see if of more than 4 digits (and thus a new-style article number), one option was for the  1st text parameter to be used merely as a display text option rather than being directly used now to generate the url link address (eg  would show as &quot;Paediatric immunology: Asthma at eMedcine&quot; or something similar.
The new eMedicine style webpages clearly exist in a structured series of content pages, with a style of &quot;pediatric &gt;&gt; radiology &gt;&gt;&quot; being shown above the header disease name. So I wrote to eMedicine/Medscape to see if the article number can be automatically linked to the section location (eg all &quot;8-&quot; being orthopaedic, &quot;7-&quot; being rheumatology or whatever, or indeed automatically getting more article details from just an article number). I've had a nice initial email reply back from Erin Michael Kelly, Editorial Director, so I'll let you you what transpires. David Ruben  Talk  22:14, 12 January 2009 (UTC)

PS I also was trying to maitain current 2parameter usage seen at  with its eMedicinesubj &amp; eMedicinetopic parameters. Also whilst the infobox allows setting up of a search list, the direct external link templates do not, and it might be simpler for long term maintenance to give  this functionality (and hence 2 parameters required, so that can specify &quot;search|&quot;). We would then nolonger need to duplicate esoteric coding for old &amp; new style eMedicine links across the current 3 templates, but instead just make   a metatemplate used by  &amp;  (only issue is if Infobox should not have very long link names, but that's a separate issue to consider). David Ruben  Talk  22:23, 12 January 2009 (UTC)

In the long run, the links will have to be converted anyway (one day the old links might stop working). For simplicity, we might have a bot converting all links and setup the new template exactly the way we want it without having to preserve backwards-compatibility and making things mroe complicated. --WS (talk) 15:32, 25 January 2009 (UTC)

Osteitis Fibrosa Cystica

I'm sure no one here has this information just laying around, but on the off chance... does anyone know how often hyperparathyroidism turns into osteitis fibrosa cystica, or where I could find such information?

Strombollii (talk) 03:49, 27 January 2009 (UTC)
&quot;The distinctive bone manifestation of hyperparathyroidism is osteitis fibrosa cystica, which occurred in 10-25% of patients in series reported 50 years ago. &quot; - . Unfortunately, it doesn't give any clues as to the identification of that series, and if it's from 50 years ago, it isn't available online.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections - ethics issues

Following the death of a Brazilian woman, there has been a debate at  about the propriety of including details of the case within the article. The debate raises questions of rights to privacy and the notability of certain types of sufferers (i.e. celebrities) A similar although less rational debate is also going on at Mariana Bridi da Costa about the same case. Independent views would be greatly welcomed. Velela (talk) 10:38, 27 January 2009 (UTC)
To put it bluntly, I don't think this merits inclusion in the Pseudomonas aeruginosa article. P. aeruginosa infection is very common, and its treatment can be notoriously difficult. Sepsis is not really a rare condition, death from sepsis is not rare at all (quite the contrary) and many people are afflicted in dramatic ways such as hers (people who develop necrotizing fasciitis, for instance). Our article on necrotizing fasciitis actually includes a &quot;List of famous victims&quot;, but that's a whole other story—we're talking about adding this information to the article on the bacteria that may have caused the infection that led to her death! I think that's a stretch. While this case has brought much-needed attention to the dangers of sepsis (still a surprisingly little-known condition) and multidrug-resistant bacteria, Wikipedia is not the place to further add to that attention. Fvasconcellos (t·) 15:20, 27 January 2009 (UTC)

I think this would be interesting info to add to the article on this woman.  That article can than link to the condition.  But adding this info to an article about a bacteria or disease is trivia.  And shouldn't be done.  --Doc James (talk ·  · ) 15:42, 27 January 2009 (UTC)
Per Pseudomonas aeruginosa‎, her infection might have been due to this particular bacterium;  that does not belong in Pseudomonas aeruginosa‎. --Una Smith (talk) 15:59, 27 January 2009 (UTC)
James is right—it's trivia. And Fvasconcellos hits the nail right on the head; deaths from sepsis are not rare. Graham Colm Talk 19:27, 27 January 2009 (UTC)
I agree with Fvasconcellos and Doc James - discussing the woman's death in the article about her and linking to sepsis and P. aeruginosa would be a good way to increase awareness, but mentioning her in those articles would not be appropriate. twirligigLeave one! ⋄  21:27, 27 January 2009 (UTC)

Publisher's Pushback against NIH's Public Access and Scholarly Publishing Sustainability

This latest PLoS article is worth a look. It notes that Bush's last days tried to derail public access to science via the innocuous sounding “Fair Copyright in Research Works Act” (HR 6845) introduced into the House by John Conyers, Jr. (DEM-MI). The push is likely to continue and may not be stemmed by Obama [http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000030&amp;ct=1] Mccready (talk) 06:12, 28 January 2009 (UTC)

Articles in both nursing and medicine wikiprojects

I have an idea that some articles don't really belong in the nursing wikiproject.  I'd like to consider removing some of them where WP:MED has already got their banner up, and where there does not seem to be a need for both projects to be attached.

An example for discussion: National_Health_Service_(England).  Now, don't get me wrong: the NHS is a huge employer of nurses, but does that make this a nursing article?  I don't know.  I would be tempted to leave articles like this under the WP:MED banner, and assume that some nurses (like me) will be working in both projects anyway.

Of course, the reverse tends to be true.  Should Florence_Nightingale be in both projects?  Clearly she has had an impact on medicine, but in terms of Wikipedia she is of course the iconic nurse and one might expect  to be the relevant project.

It just seems that there's quite a bit of dual-tagging between the two projects, and I wonder whether it is really necessary. Cheers, Basie (talk) 12:44, 22 January 2009 (UTC)

And then there are those articles that probably shouldn't be in either, like School_head_lice_policy! Basie (talk) 13:15, 22 January 2009 (UTC)
Errr poor choice of example - I would think that very much should be under Nursing project, for at least in UK, this would be something for school nurses to take overall lead of this health issue :-) David Ruben  Talk  19:25, 22 January 2009 (UTC) 
Yes, I see now I'm woefully ignorant on the subject!  The most contact I have with the 'wee beasties' is when they're found hitch-hiking on one of our patients!  Er, lice... not school nurses :)
Would it be appropriate for me to start a list of articles here that I boldly remove from WP:MED, and one over at WP:NURSE where I have removed articles from that project?  That way if there are any objections we can discuss it (without laboriously considering each individual case). Cheers, Basie (talk) 00:24, 23 January 2009 (UTC)
Yes that seems good compromise, allowing bold actioning, but allowing project members an easy means of quick scanning the list for anything felt appropriate to have kept in :-) If you have in mind a huge number of article changes, perhaps set up a proposed to-do list, and then remove 5 days later items that others have not removed from the list ?  David Ruben  Talk  03:06, 23 January 2009 (UTC) 
I doubt there will be many proposed changes.  If I see something I'm pretty sure of, I'll de-tag it and post up here; it can always be reverted, after all.  Cheers, Basie (talk) 03:46, 23 January 2009 (UTC)

Amygdalohippocampectomy, anyone? :)  Removed from WP:NURSE. Basie (talk) 13:59, 22 January 2009 (UTC)

Fundamentally, a WikiProject gets to tag whatever it wants.  Nobody can force it to accept an article, or to reject an article.  So if there's something that WP:NURSE wants (or doesn't), they can tag it (or not) -- no matter what else other projects might do.  As for WPMED:  We take a lot of things simply in default of a more appropriate project (e.g., a 'WikiProject Human Physiology').  But you wouldn't believe how much some people fuss when I pull WPMED tags from articles that really have only the weakest connections.   addresses some of the common issues.

&quot; health&quot; vs greek

I have an article naming problem over at , but the issue affects many health sciences articles so I assume it's been discussed before.



&quot;Pediatric nursing&quot; is a phrase I identify with.  I am more than just a &quot;child health&quot; nurse; some of the kids I work with are very sick indeed.  I see &quot;pediatrics&quot; as an inclusive term, &quot;child health&quot; less so.

It's not as simple as that, because while I believe &quot;pediatric&quot; lacks negative connotations, &quot;psychiatric&quot; and &quot;geriatric&quot; have a certain stigma attached.  Of course I speak of the general audience here; both terms can be seen as pejorative.  Does that mean they shouldn't be used in article or category titles?  I'm a bit inconsistent myself, as I tend to use &quot;pediatrics&quot; and &quot;mental health&quot; to describe the two fields.

I refer you to two discussions.  A move proposal at , and a discussion of the rather unwieldy article name at .  Cheers, Basie (talk) 23:53, 28 January 2009 (UTC)

Here in Norway there was a period of a year or two when everyone complained that the GP never looked at the patient, but only at the monitor and the keyboard.  (Someone should do a study on any effects of that; maybe it's been done.)  Now my GP does his scribbles by keyboard, and it works, both for journal and prescriptions, while he is mostly looking at me!  Any paperwork concerning me is scanned into my journal.  Legibility is one advantage.  Another is that the program may complain that no blood pressure has been entered for ages, etc. It also suggests date/time for follow-up visit and knows whether I've already paid the maximum for the year, or not.

PathologyAtlas.ro and pathology on Wikipedia

Take a look at Cirrhosis#Pathology and then [http://www.pathologyatlas.ro/secondary-biliary-cirrhosis.php here]. Part of it seems a copyright violation. I removed multiple links to pathologyatlas.ro today. See also .

--Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 19:56, 31 January 2009 (UTC)

Mdanciu released the content under the GFDL, but that is not clear at all from his edits at the time. We should be using more reliable sources anyway. JFW | T@lk 20:54, 31 January 2009 (UTC)
We should probably clarify by indicating that different etiologies of cirrhosis can show different pathologic patterns (e.g. zone 3 predominance with alcohol; nutmeg liver with cardiac cirrhosis; zone 1 with bile spilling in PBC, etc.) -- Samir 21:08, 31 January 2009 (UTC)

It's not about cirrhosis, it's about how we relate to pathologyatlas.ro . I don't have any problem if the edits were released under the GFDL. I've removed inline external links, because we just don't do that. I've removed the website from the External Links sections because I don't think we should. I'd like to hear from other editors here, and if we decide that pathologyatlas is a resource we want to link, then I'll be happy to put back the links. --Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 21:57, 31 January 2009 (UTC)

PS: have a look at my talk page and  for some of our concerns.
Oh.  Ok.  I rewrote the cirrhosis pathology section anyways.  The application of the link was incorrect there.  There are probably more reliable sources that this -- Samir 22:07, 31 January 2009 (UTC)

YMMV on this. That Romanian site, which surprisingly doesn't have any ads, seems to have some pictures not freely available elsewhere. E.g. on Wilm's tumor we had a link to [http://pathologyatlas.ro/nephroblastoma-wilms-tumor.php]. It doesn't appear objectionable to me. Perhaps the links should only be removed when a better alternative is found, not before? [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wilms%27_tumor&amp;diff=267675012&amp;oldid=267396458 Replacing] all those links with a DMOZ link, which doesn't even include them, seems a bad idea. Xasodfuih (talk) 01:50, 1 February 2009 (UTC)
The content is excellent, but at www.pathologyatlas.ro it is difficult for the reader to validate the provenance. If we could persuade Dr. Danciu to host the images at his university (Grigore T. Popa University of Medicine and Pharmacy), then the decision would be much easier. --Arcadian (talk) 02:59, 1 February 2009 (UTC)

Well my friends, I have some observations:
1. I don't have to defend my credibility, and I won't. You have my identity, so I won't post on internet photos with me near a patient in the SR (with or without the patient's written consent) as a credential or a CV. But I have a proposal to you: if you are not pathologists, you can show my explained pictures to your Pathology Professors, so they may decide.
2. I was the one to start the Pathology chapter for some diseases. Parts of the text I wrote here were first on pathologyatlas, and not vice-versa. Of course, Wikipedia improves every second, and I agree that everything I wrote there can be done better and in a perfect English, as well.
3. At that time, I put the links immediately after the microscopically description, because I considered that one might want to read and see the pictures, without any other effort to search for link at the end of the topic. This is to be decided by Wikipedia's rules.
4. I am sure you all have good intentions. But I don't think it is a benefit for Wikipedia to remove a link (especially when you are not sure it is an unreliable one) without putting something else instead. To be short, Xasodfuih's observation was right. Thank you and sorry for more than 100 words. mdanciu Mdanciu (talk) 10:37, 1 February 2009 (UTC)

I'd like to remember everyone about #1: we should avoid &quot;Any site that does not provide a unique resource beyond what the article would contain if it became a Featured article.&quot; A featured article would contain a pathology description without incomprehensible jargon, and would contain a picture. When it comes to external links, I admit to being a deletionist. Yet since we include so many other external links that also violate the ELNO#1 principle (e.g. virtually any MedlinePlus or eMedicine link), maybe this can be considered as a valid external link. --Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 21:32, 1 February 2009 (UTC)

MDanciu:  Actually, with medicine-related articles, we tend to err on the side of caution, which means we tend to reject external links until we are sure that they are reliable.  
In general, I think that  #1 is both very important and routinely violated.  If no path images are available for the article, then I might accept the links.  But in general, I'm with Steven on this issue.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 22:09, 1 February 2009 (UTC)
 ELNO rule #1 is utterly pathetic. &quot;Any site that does not provide a unique resource beyond what the article would contain if it became a Featured article&quot;. Most article will never become FA. Xasodfuih (talk) 15:51, 2 February 2009 (UTC)

Is good to live according to rules, but now I understand that you prefer to hide the mistake of deleting my link behind some rules and words (e.g. reliable). None of you have the qualification to analyze the images on pathologyatlas and find the eventually mistakes, which would label the site as unreliable? None of you can say: “It is (un)reliable!”? Therefore, you chose to use “we need something more reliable” and suggested to me to put my site under Iasi University’s umbrella. Question: is Iasi University more reliable than Cornell University ([http://vivo.cornell.edu/entity?home=1&amp;id=11499]), The American Society for Cell Biology ([http://cellbase.ascb.org/microscopy.html]), The University of Auckland, and others? You should have done some research before, Steven! Primum, non nocere! It’s a must, if you want to become a doctor. I wonder how many other useful links you deleted. Mdanciu (talk) 14:55, 2 February 2009 (UTC)

I'm going to interrupt here to warn .  It is a decidedly low blow to say that removing links to your website will make another user a poor doctor.  I ask you not to do that -- Samir 02:29, 3 February 2009 (UTC)

I'll try and completely ignore yet another personal attack on me, and ask this question: everyone agree on the compromise of adding the website back on articles where good pathology images are otherwise lacking? --Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 16:13, 2 February 2009 (UTC)

Dear Steven, it is nothing personal. I consider that an admin should act as a reviewer, so I ask from him/her to be profound and responsible. Admins are not robots, they first have to analyze. It is a hard job. This is what I'm trying to explain. If this is against the WP's laws, I'll shut up, but not before saying Sorry! Mdanciu (talk) 17:17, 2 February 2009 (UTC)

Mdanciu, Steven is trying to work within Wikipedia's &quot;rules&quot;.  He doesn't get to make those rules any more than you or I do.  And Steven is 100% right:  the rules very clearly discourage links that would duplicate the contents of an excellent article.  This rule is written for the purpose of motivating editors to improve articles instead of taking the lazy approach of simply listing a website at the end.  If you do not like the rules, then I ask you to leave a message at  and explain that your website is so valuable, and getting good information added to the Wikipedia articles is so unimportant, that your website should be linked at the bottom of many articles even though doing so would violate the standards set by  #1.   I suggest that you read  first. 
Steven, I support your compromise as a temporary solution until such a time as an adequate number of high-quality path images are available on Wikipedia.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 01:06, 3 February 2009 (UTC)

No one is 100% right. Maybe sometimes, or maybe from some points of view. But, for sure, at that time and in that matter, Steven was wrong when deleting my links from Wilms’ tumor page. His reason: we have plenty of pathology images available on Commons. Hmmm, plenty... So, I checked. There were none (zero) images about Wilms tumor. Or, look at the crescentic glomerulonephritis in Commons. Where are the crescents? Were these two articles excelent? Let me doubt about. Then, why deleting my links? Which was the gain? Not to mention the decision to blindly delete all the links to pathologyatlas. You don’t want a collection of external links? OK! Is that DMOZ external link better than a direct link to an image? Only one click and the user has the explained microscopical image. I don’t really like what DMOZ offers to the user, but maybe I’m subjective. Anyways, Wikipedia is not mine, nor yours, and we spent too much time with this discussion. Do what you want, but it is sad that you first send someone to gallows and only after that you organize the trial. So, if you find better images, go ahead. All the best to all of you. Mdanciu (talk) 14:01, 3 February 2009 (UTC)

I agree that pathologyatlas can be a very useful EL.  It should be linked to if it supplements the article appropriately, and better than our current content, or the content of other links.  I'll cite another couple of examples.  The secondary biliary cirrhosis slide above [http://www.pathologyatlas.ro/secondary-biliary-cirrhosis.php here] is excellent unquestionably, and should be linked to the secondary biliary cirrhosis article when it is made (as I doubt there is free content better than that online).  The Helicobacter pylori FA, on the other hand, has an excellent silver stain image of Helicobacter, and this link: [http://www.pathologyatlas.ro/gastritis-helicobacter-pylori.php] does not add much to the article and shouldn't be included. -- Samir 02:29, 3 February 2009 (UTC)

BIG headache!!!

As far as I can tell, all articles on headaches in Wikipedia are a complete mess! The conflicting NIH, ICD, and the completely missing ICHD classifications ([http://ihs-classification.org/en/]) are mostly responsible for this. There seem to be no active editors in this area, only active deletionists. Xasodfuih (talk) 06:31, 2 February 2009 (UTC)
 Actually, there are some active editors in this area: chiropractic promoters! Xasodfuih (talk) 07:13, 2 February 2009 (UTC)
Don't get me wrong, all of us who have voted in that AfD for toxic headache are actually productive editors here, we all edit articles to make them better more than we delete. However, we can only work on a few at a time as a relatively small project, and as such things like headaches get pushed aside for the bigger topics that people enjoy writing about more. We will get round to them eventually, it just takes a lot of time. —Cyclonenim (talk ·  · ) 07:57, 2 February 2009 (UTC)

ICHD code in infobox

 Actually,  looks like a better candidate since most headaches are not a primary condition. For instance thunderclap headache should have ICHD-2 4.6, ICD-10 G44.80. Also, it's not clear to me how to code the link to the IHS site since their URLs are rather complex, e.g. [http://ihs-classification.org/en/02_klassifikation/02_teil1/04.06.00_other.html].

Drug-related articles generally a mess

Wikipedia's drug-related articles are generally a mess
Perhaps this is because current thinking about drugs is generally a mess
Perhaps there is no coherent objective way of thinking and writing on the subject
We have laws seemingly dedicated to the notion that drugs are evil, and the use of force (sometimes lethal) to suppress their production and supply
Somehow, at the same time, we have a vast legal drugs industry, forever chasing the holy grail of immortality
I offer the following as potentially useful definitions:
* Controlled drug: drug within the scope of laws which are named, effectively, as drug control laws, for example, in the United Kingdom, the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 and the Drugs Act 2005
* Pharmaceutical drug: product of a body, pharmaceutical company or drug company, which is licensed to produce and supply controlled drugs as medicines
* Legal drug: 
** pharmaceutical drug, provided it is not held contrary to drug control laws; or
** drug falling outside the scope of drug control laws and not otherwise illegal, for example, in the United Kingdom, alcohol or tobacco, 
* Illegal drug: 
** drug held contrary to drug control laws; or
** drug falling outside the scope of drug control laws and defined as illegal in some other way, for example, in the United Kingdom, alcohol sold to someone under the age of 18

Sertoli-Leydig cell tumour

Are all the following diseases synonymous?: Sertoli-Leydig cell tumour, leydig cell tumor, and arrhenoblastoma?  The prior two seem to be synonymous, but I was uncertain if arrhenoblastoma was something different? kilbad (talk) 22:18, 3 February 2009 (UTC)

MeSH recognizes separately Sertoli cell tumor and Leydig cell tumor, groups them together under Sertoli-Leydig cell tumour (which includes &quot;mixed&quot; tumors having both cell types), and notes re arrhenoblastoma A sex cord-gonadal stromal tumor consists of LEYDIG CELLS; SERTOLI CELLS; and FIBROBLASTS in varying proportions and degree of differentiation. Most such tumors produce ANDROGENS in the Leydig cells, formerly known as androblastoma or arrhenoblastoma. Androblastomas occur in the TESTIS or the OVARY causing precocious masculinization in the males, and defeminization, or virilization ( VIRILISM) in the females. In some cases, the Sertoli cells produce ESTROGENS.  --Una Smith (talk) 23:42, 3 February 2009 (UTC)

I've abandoned working on any doping related article while he is active on them. He is obviously a pro-doping (in particular pro-AAS) advocate with whom collaboration is impossible because he expects all articles to simply reflect his POV.

There was a very good documentary on this topic recently call Bigger stronger faster  --Doc James (talk ·  · ) 21:58, 28 January 2009 (UTC)

I think these articles are problem areas, because they do not represent the current understanding of the health effects of anabolic steroids. They are skewed toward a bodybuilding-magazine perspective and away from a medical one.  feels very strongly about the topic; I have had difficult interactions with him in the past. If Xasodfuih is leaving, that's a problem, because s/he was active in improving these articles. Perhaps we should put together a task force of editors from the WikiProject or elsewhere to review these articles - they are high-profile and I'm becoming more and more deeply concerned about their content, particularly in light of this note. MastCell Talk 17:40, 29 January 2009 (UTC)

Somewhat to my surprise, I actually don't have a problem with the switch from &quot;doping&quot; to &quot;performance-enhancing drugs&quot;, though my fingers seem to want to insert a hyphen there.  &quot;Doping&quot; doesn't strike me as a particularly encyclopaedic term.  Basie (talk) 01:37, 30 January 2009 (UTC)
 I partially disagree. Searching for &quot;doping sports&quot; returns nearly 30,000 articles on google scholar; &quot;performance enhancing drugs sports&quot; almost the same number. Doping is the term used in almost all other language wikis except English now. Xasodfuih (talk) 08:07, 5 February 2009 (UTC)

... just a short question of a German doctor, who asks kindly for an answer: Is there an English word for what we call &quot;Hängetrauma&quot; in German? I'm right now working at the article, I mentioned above - and I wonder if there is a precise translation. A &quot;Hängetrauma&quot; (in short) means, that signs of an &quot;orthostatic&quot; shock (I think You classify it as a kind of hypovolemic shock) appear, if patients (maybe caused by an accident) hang a long time in an upright position. Greetings from Bavaria Redlinux (talk) 22:20, 1 February 2009 (UTC)

As far as I know, there is no English equivalent for this concept (nor is there one in Dutch, for that matter). --Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 22:52, 1 February 2009 (UTC)

Thanks for Your answer, but anyway, I don't understand &quot;why?&quot;. There is for instance an important difference in treatment in order to prevent a sudden increase in blood-volume that may provoke a circulation-failure. Redlinux (talk) 23:07, 1 February 2009 (UTC)

I suspect that this concept simply hasn't penetrated into the English-language literature. --Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 23:18, 1 February 2009 (UTC)

.... yes the article Suspension trauma describes a different concept. I think I will mention this in the German article. Redlinux (talk) 23:30, 1 February 2009 (UTC)

Is it different from Orthostatic hypotension, which describes the same kind of thing but without specifying the cause?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 02:41, 2 February 2009 (UTC)

I just skimmed  and I am wondering how is it a different concept from Suspension trauma?  --Una Smith (talk) 05:32, 2 February 2009 (UTC)

Hi Ina, thanks for the hint - how do You classify an &quot;orthostatic shock&quot; - as &quot;hypovolemic&quot;? Maybe, my English is too poor [http://www.osha.gov/dts/shib/shib032404.html →]. Redlinux (talk) 13:59, 2 February 2009 (UTC)

Suspension trauma and Orthostatic hypotension and Hypovolemia are very distinct, although all three conditions have some physiological processes in common.  To a first approximation,  appears to correspond exactly to Suspension trauma.  However, I do not know if  is a fair representation of the concept of Hängetrauma in the German language medical literature.  If the question is about interwiki links, then  and Suspension trauma should be linked.  If the question concerns is larger than that, then I do not know the answer.  I hope this helps.  --Una Smith (talk) 17:24, 2 February 2009 (UTC)

@ Una, thanks - well the article is not yet finished, - but I meant neither &quot;orthostatic incompetence&quot; nor &quot;Orthostatic hypotension&quot;. Maybe its just a problem of translation. Redlinux (talk) 23:25, 2 February 2009 (UTC) ... now I found a description for &quot;orthostatic shock&quot; in the English literature in this context [http://www.hse.gov.uk/research/crr_pdf/2002/crr02451.pdf → page 2] - shoud I add it to Your article Shock (circulatory)? Redlinux (talk) 11:37, 3 February 2009 (UTC)
Well, &quot;orthostatic incompetence&quot; may not belong in the lead of Suspension trauma.  --Una Smith (talk) 18:09, 3 February 2009 (UTC)

This science popularization paperback, which is linked from the electrophysiology article, appears to be tethering on the verge of fringe science according to the enthusiastic review of some people very inclined to believe conspiracy theories anyway [http://www.amazon.com/review/R1UWW09B1DR0PP/ref=cm_cr_pr_viewpnt#R1UWW09B1DR0PP].

Nineteen individual case studies

I'd like to have several people please take a look at the proportion of examples to standard description in Brown-Sequard Syndrome.  It contains nineteen separate case studies, most of which have one or two very long paragraphs dedicated to them.   is very unhappy with my statement that it's an examplefarm.  (About 90% of the article is examples.) 

I don't think that I'm willing to deal with this editor today, and I'd be happy to have several other editors look at the article and give an opinion about whether an article that is 10% description and 90% sample case histories is the right balance.  

Also, if there's a bored admin online, the page ought to be at Brown-Sequard syndrome, but it won't let me move it over the redirect.  Thanks, WhatamIdoing (talk) 02:46, 9 February 2009 (UTC)

Vandalism

Pharyngitis has been getting vandalized a lot lately.  I do not know if this is just an issue on medical pages but I have not seen many useful edits by anons.  All the vandalism makes editing more difficult.  And I presume this is one of the big reasons why wikidoc.org went off to make their own site.

In my opinion I think all medical pages should be protected such that only registered editors can make changes to them.  I would add more reliability to the medical pages of Wikipedia.  If you are not willing to take a few seconds to create a user name than it is unlikely that you will be willing to reference the point you are adding ( and you definitely will not be referencing to a good source with proper formatting ).--Doc James (talk ·  · ) 18:32, 10 February 2009 (UTC)

Actually, if a page is protected against anon IPs, then it's also protected against new registered accounts.  Only accounts that have made more than 10 edits and are more than four days old are allowed to edit them.  
I've seen some good work done by anons, and daily checks of changes to articles on my watchlist make it pretty easy to undo the vandalism.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 19:02, 10 February 2009 (UTC)

Trust me, pharyngitis is not the worst example... and anons can make very helpful edits. Your suggestion would need a project-wide consensus and policy change. Yes, vandalism is annoying, but also revertible -quickly too, if you use a few extra tools like  and .  would be a way of improving the situation, imho -at the expense of immediate edit-ability. We protect pages were vandalism is at its worst, which for my personal standards means vandalism several times per day for extended periods and, most importantly, it is not reverted quickly. --Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 19:23, 10 February 2009 (UTC)

Third opinion on  paleolithic diet

I need another opinion on this FA that I'm considering nominating for FAR owing to bias and lack of stability. Since it has been promoted last year it has seen over 1,000 substantive edits, most of which were done by the same user that nominated it for FA. The result of these edits has be mostly a bias of the article towards an overly favorable POV by several means:
* citing obscure reviews in journals not indexed by JCR, e.g. World Review of Nutrition and Dietetics; in general the papers selected often come from [http://thepaleodiet.com/published_research/ thepaleodiet.com]
* cherry-picking abstracts only for favorable facts, e.g. from  only the positive findings are presented
* mentioning every disease ever associated with (modern) diet as to imply that paleo diet somehow would help [even though this is not explicitly stated], even those diseases that it would clearly not do so, e.g. osteoporosis.
* reference spamming the studies section: every little newsflash about a study and even a Ph.D. thesis resulting from it is given as a separate reference in addition to the study giving the impression that bigger of evidence actually exits, e.g. &quot;The results of initial prospective medical studies on the Paleolithic diet have shown positive health outcomes.&quot;

(Also if you read the NHS article on the study, it's nowhere near that optimistic.)

I will agree with Xaso.  Medical correlation is confused with causation.  The effectiveness is presented in a rosy light based on trial of maybe 50 people and a bunch of pigs.  I would agree that it is not FA quality and needs its neutrality addressed.
Looking at the research base this doesn't seem like much more than a fad diet.  And a fad diet as a FA without it being presented as such is a disservice to all who work hard to create FAs.

Surgical release means relieving any compression on the tendon. Abduction (kinesiology) is an anatomical term which means movement of a joint away from the midline. Not sure which tendon he is talking about. --Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 16:02, 12 February 2009 (UTC)
The fascia lata is part of the thigh, and thigh abduction is by the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus muscles.  You've got some muscles with the word &quot;abductor&quot; in your hands and feet, and as such the term &quot;abductor tendon&quot; isn't very specific.  Generally you'll find that tendons are named after their associated muscles, so maybe the thing to do would be to find out what muscle is having problems and go from there.  Some good anatomy atlases (probably available at the library) are Netter's (pretty), Grant's (not as pretty, but supposedly more accurate), and Gray's (huge).  I hope your wife is feeling better.

Chronic cystic mastitis possible name change

At the momment, Fibrocystic breast disease, Fibrocystic breast changes and several other synonums all redirect to Chronic cystic mastitis.

My response follows:
Thanks Steven, that's actually still somewhat of a contentious issue.  According to Rosai and others, the condition fulfils the criteria to be called a disease (for example there is associated morbidity including pain &amp; risk of malignant transformation), whereas other authors, like Rosen,  contend the condition is too ubiquitous (much like prostatic hypertrophy) to be really considered a disease.  If you feel strongly enough about calling it fibrocystic change, then I'm happy for you to do it that way.  As far as I'm concerned, the jury's still out &amp; I'm  in arguing over it (I !)

As a general dermatologist who is not dependent on mohs surgery to generate my income, I am much less concerned about commercialism and propaganda issue of mohs surgery.  I find that his edits are strongly pushing her own personal opinions (not wanting to discuss about the weakness of breadloafing pathology processing) - and blaming the Mohs surgery for his own ignorance.

At the same time, if you went through and deleted all which are not referenced, 95% of the content of wiki medicine is deleted.  Just simply look at the article on &quot;veterinarian&quot;, almost 95% of it is unreferenced - but probably good information.  I believe that you need to give some contributor a little laxity on editing and contributing without rapid deletion.  Otherwise it would discourage many specialists from wanting to contribute.  If you want more contributors - perhaps gives some folks a little laxity - before you go happily deleting for &quot;lack of reference&quot;.  —Preceding  comment added by  (talk) 21:13, 17 February 2009 (UTC)

With all due respect, do you honestly believe this encyclopaedia would be better off with additions without references? If so, I'll just go ahead and add &quot;Meningitis kills everyone&quot; to Meningitis, because that's essentially what you'd be asking us to allow. Every statement needs a reliably-sourced reference, anything that isn't added in this was can either be tagged with a 'citation needed' tag (if its likely a reference exists) or it can be reverted. That's that, IMHO. —Cyclonenim (talk ·  · ) 23:51, 17 February 2009 (UTC)

It is not even a problem with the law there. These antidepressants are recognized by doctors and by the government to be &quot;non-abusable&quot;.
Nevertheless, the drug-recovery industry and the teetotalers etc etc and the controllettis and the forbidders and the strong-christians and the liability lawyers are lurking around, trying to create a hype, by collecting 5 cases of abuse in the past 30 years and pumping that up to an elephant size addiction potential. And this is a problem, as it scares patients away from treatment, and drives them toward the numerous quack-medicine patent methods and Narconon and spiritual crap etc etc, and besides stigmatizes them as addicts with that kind of desinformation.

 (talk) 16:53, 20 February 2009 (UTC)

What evidence is available that a particular drug is abusable? In terms of Evidence-based medicine, is there Level 1 evidence, Level 2 evidence, etc.? Is it just a government determination, without regard to the science? My understanding is that abuse determinations are made on the basis of relatively weak evidence. 

For example, the UK is having a big debate over the category for ecstacy. According to the New Scientist, the scientific panels said that it was not particularly dangerous (more people die from peanut anaphylaxis), but the legislature wants to put it in a category with much more dangerous drugs. Nbauman (talk) 17:20, 20 February 2009 (UTC)

I would appreciate if the discussion about drug laws and illegal drugs is being kept separate from the discussion about antidepressants, which are recognized as non-abusable. It is not tenable in such a discussion if whenever the word &quot;abuse&quot; comes up, a dozen people jump on it with &quot;cannabis too&quot; and &quot;ecstacy too&quot;. Thats not the discussion here.
I mind if fringe groups are carrying such discussion into anti-depressant articles. That is the point. The other stuff belongs into a discussion/article about sense and nonsense of drug laws, and is not applicable here.

Who recognizes antidepressants as &quot;non-abusable,&quot; and what is the evidence that they are non-abusable? 

For example, Purdue, the manufacturer of Oxycontin, claimed that it was non-abusable, but there are many published claims of abuse. Nbauman (talk) 18:19, 20 February 2009 (UTC)

Antidepressants are recognized as non-abusable by the government.
Evidence: Non-scheduled, only a handful of abuse cases in 40 years.
Oxycontine: Bollocks, Oxycontin was scheduled II from the beginning by the government.

Everything is abusable, even chocolate and wikipedia.  For patients with clinical depression, the two main options are psychotherapy and medication.  For those who prefer medication, SSRIs and SNRIs are much less &quot;abusable&quot; then older medications.  This is one reason why they are so popular.

 (talk) 03:31, 22 February 2009 (UTC)

Yes, exactly. I wrote

Take a look at tricyclic antidepressants. This started as &quot;generally all antidepressants have some dependence potential&quot;, and proceeds along a line which imo confuses a discontinuation symptom with dependence and habit-forming properties. I have edited this section myself also. In the result it is now full of obscure cases. Without doubt tricyclic antidepressants are regarded non-abusable.

And then the pot-legalizers, ecstacy, oxycontin and chocolate philosophers came waltzing in and disrupted the thread, turning it into a drug-chatroom.

I wanted some medical professional to take a look at the bogus that has developed around antidepressant abuse in the articles of practically all antidepressants. (driven by the pot-legalizer, ecstacy, oxycontin and chocolate feeble minded editors)

Please take a look at the top of the thread. Thats what I wanted.

Regarding message on my talk page anon 70.137. While you are resolving your dispute with Sceptical Chemist with regard to the abuse case reports, I have moved it down to the bottom of the page, due to it being very rare. It has little notibility so it can go to the bottom of the page like where trivia type sections and other non-notible sections go. I don't care one way or the other if it gets deleted so I am not picking sides. I am not very interested in antidepressants anyway and don't want to get too involved. I do think that there should be a short description of discontinuation/withdrawal and mention of gradual reduction minimising such symptoms but it doesn't need to go into great detail. Those are my thoughts but am too busy on quinolone articles at the moment.--Literaturegeek | T@1k? 23:05, 22 February 2009 (UTC)

If antidepressants are non abusable because they are not &quot;scheduled&quot; by governments, then I guess the same is true of alcohol and tobacco
Does scheduling&quot; make abusable something which otherwise would not be?
Laurel Bush (talk) 13:01, 23 February 2009 (UTC)

This argument doesn't apply.  Alcohol and tobacco are not prescribed drugs, so they cannot be &quot;scheduled&quot;.  IMHO selling tobacco should be illegal, but that's another kettle of fish, too.  --Scray (talk) 13:49, 23 February 2009 (UTC)

My point is that decisions about whether and how to &quot;schedule&quot; (prohibit except under licence) are not dicisions of medical science, and can be seen as irrational from a scientific perspective, as, for example, in 
Any reference, as has been made above, classing abusability with &quot;scheduling&quot;, is not rational science
Also, because their practice is contrained by irrational law, it is not clear to me that it is possible for medical professionals to practice scientifically
Laurel Bush (talk) 16:29, 23 February 2009 (UTC)

This comment is not specifically about the one above it:
It sounds to me like several editors don't have a clear understanding of the difference between dependence, addiction, and discontinuation syndromes.  For example, people with Diabetes mellitus type 1 are dependent on insulin, but they are not addicted to it.  Getting a headache if you don't drink coffee one morning is a discontinuation syndrome, not proof of an addiction to caffeine.  I think that all the editors involved in this discussion might benefit from reading widely on the broad concepts and definitions before misunderstandings cause any more problems.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 19:38, 23 February 2009 (UTC)

It is obviously impossible to ask here for help by a doctor in proper wording of the antidepressant article, according to scientific consensus. Immediately the conversation is hijacked and diverted into a conversation about drug policies and legalization and sense and nonsense of the drug laws and alcohol and nicotine etc. etc.
Good bye, edit your articles alone. This is too much.

Admin help? Problems with standard dash versus em dash

Today I was adding a category to Cronkhite-Canada syndrome and noted several copies of the article and redirects, several with differences in the type of dash used between the two words (ie. standard dash, – , versus the longer em dash, — ).  If you search the word &quot;Cronkhite&quot; and look at the dropdown suggestions you will see what I mean.  Anyway, I tried to unify all the redirects but was having problems with the dashes.  Could someone take a look at this for me? kilbad (talk) 18:19, 25 February 2009 (UTC)

Although I cannot make the changes myself, I added  on Cronkhite-Canada syndrome.  An admin periodically goes through the CSDs and will reverse the cut and paste between Cronkhite–Canada disease and Cronkhite-Canada syndrome.  The article was also briefly cut and pasted to Cronkhite–Canada syndrome, but I do not think this needs to be history merged.  What is the ideal article location?  Cronkhite-Canada syndrome (en) or Cronkhite–Canada syndrome (em)?  If it's the en version, then you can just change the redirect on the em to the en, and everything should be good.  If it's the em version, then once the history merge is completed, you can probably use  (en) on Cronkhite–Canada syndrome (em) to move the article over a redirect.  In the future, you can avoid this by never cutting and pasting articles.  --Scott Alter 20:43, 25 February 2009 (UTC)
I have been using en dashes when an article title requires them; therefore, unless there is a guideline against doing so, I would favor an article title of Cronkhite-Canada syndrome (en), but do not have a strong preference either way.  I just happen to come across this during some minor editing. kilbad (talk) 20:47, 25 February 2009 (UTC)
The correct answer is a plain old hyphen, which is not technically the same as either an en-dash or an em-dash.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 20:59, 25 February 2009 (UTC)
Ok... now, after reading En-dash#Common_dashes, I know more about dashes than I ever wanted to. kilbad (talk) 21:04, 25 February 2009 (UTC)
So after looking at that article, just replace the word &quot;en&quot; with &quot;hyphen&quot; in my response above.  I think all the articles mentioned above have either a hyphen or an em dash in the title.  And I agree that hyphens are probably most appropriate.  I really dislike non-keyboard characters in article titles.  --Scott Alter 21:17, 25 February 2009 (UTC)

Admin help

I think I will be needing some admin help over at Adverse effects of fluoroquinolones / Fluoroquinolone toxicity.  This article is in horibble shape.  It breaks nearly every wiki rule including OR and WEIGHT.  I am working hard to clean it up so that it reflects current medicine rather than a bunch of fear mongering supported by case studies. This user

is trying to keep it the way it is and reverted all the good faith edits without justification that I made. --Doc James (talk ·  · ) 10:33, 19 February 2009 (UTC)

I disagree, I did not want to interfere, but James apparently made many drastic edits removing many sources, and relevant information from the page. Right now, this is getting into a huge debate between two sides, one saying that quinolones are completely safe, and another emphasizing the serious adverse reactions. Before James started editing it, we were already having a lot of debate over this article. Having personally seen what these drugs can permanently do to someone, I obviously have a different point of view. Quinolones are obviously useful for serious infections, but there are also serious adverse reactions implicated, which is one reason why the FDA has ordered black box warnings on them, and also why the drug companies were forced to include &quot;Irreversible Peripheral Neuropathy&quot; in their package inserts. Of course, these reactions are uncommon, but patients and doctors need to be aware of them.

I believe that if someone makes a statement, and they have a reliable source to justify it, that statement has some credibility. Someone else shouldn't delete it because they disagree completely with it.

JamesLockson (talk) 10:45, 19 February 2009 (UTC)

First of all we need to reference this to reviews and good secondary sources NOT case studies.  I have seen people die from complications of fluoriquinolones and I have seen cases of tendinopathy.  So not claiming they are safe.  Lockson did you even look at the edits you removed?--Doc James (talk ·  · ) 10:51, 19 February 2009 (UTC)

The more I work on this the more I think it would be best to delete it ALL and start over.  It is one case study after the next.  Words like common are supported by a study of one human and maybe a cat or two.  I am not joking.  The main editor must collect case studies of every bad outcome that has every occurred with a fluoriquinalone.--Doc James (talk ·  · ) 11:54, 19 February 2009 (UTC)

People moving page, having two articles going and now we have swung from a journalistic biased hit piece to clinical trial data saying only 4 people per 100,000 experience severe CNS adverse effects! Maybe for tendonitis but CNS adverse effects I cannot believe. I have decided that I can no longer support either side in this conflict and no one seems to be taking the middle ground here so I am going to move on to other things. The article is too stressful.--Literaturegeek | T@1k? 12:58, 19 February 2009 (UTC)

Here is what David sent me by email &quot;Please refrain from such edits at this time.  There is a serious and continuing argument regarding the direction the article should take.  James believes it is far too bias and has been editing the article extensively to reflect his views.  Failing to heed the fact that the bias has now shifted 180 as a result.  The other editors are trying to reach a compromise.  If you were to start hacking away at this mess the dispute will only escalate further and seriously hurt any chance of a resolution.  

I would compare the current situation to trying to write an article about the holocaust.  James, though not denying the holocaust took place, is of the opinion that it really wasn't that bad and Hitler is to be protrayed as being rather benign, and in fact had a number of redeeming qaulities.  James is championing the main stream medical view concerning the fluoroquinolones. 

Those of us who have had our lives utterly destroyed by these drugs and have been crippled for life who are working on this article, he considers to be holocaust victims, hence we are far too bias to be contributing anything, and whatever we do contribute he claims to be propaganda and unsupported (Since it displays Hitler and the holocaust in a very bad light)and promptly edits to reflect his own bias.  Here in lies the current problem with this article.

So please give us some time to work this out rationally without starting an editing war. I understand your concerns and a lot of us editors share them.  But starting a war with Steve will not resolve them any faster.  It will more than likely piss off an administrator who will delete the whole article.  

You do as you see fit, but I thought I should at least give you the courtesy of a heads up that you are walking into a mine field here blindfolded.

But keep in mind it took me over two years just to get to the point where the article is actually being written.  Poorly, but at least being written. So I quess I am asking you not to blow this chance for us to be heard. david fuller&quot; --Doc James (talk ·  · ) 17:09, 19 February 2009 (UTC)

 (Disclaimer: on I fairly superficial reading) the problem appears twofold:
* your article is lacking some info that's certainly not coming from fringe groups, e.g. the Fluoroquinolone_toxicity#Associated fatalities info is from the FDA. Another example is the severity of PNS effects from  (a review of case reportes); the FDA [http://www.fda.gov/medwatch/SAFETY/2004/jul04.htm info] you give only covers the frequency of such effects, but says nothing of their severity.
* the other article is worthy of a &quot;science review&quot; tag because it relies on primary sources too much. It also uses statical tricks, e.g. from  it claims that there are &quot;numerous reports&quot; when the frequency is what matters here (the FDA says rarely). But it's not reasonable to outright delete it at this stage because some all-policies-I-can-think-of-conforming info would be lost.
 The main NPOV issues seems to be how the frequency and (i?)reversibility of side effects are presented. Here the two articles outright contradict each other. More merging needs to happen at this point. And no, I'm not volunteering, I've got plenty other stuff to do at this point in time. Xasodfuih (talk) 09:16, 21 February 2009 (UTC)

Let me know what FDA references you are missing and I will either find the correct links or scan and post the original docs on my server.  Can't figure out what you are referring to here as the article has undergone so many revisions and reverts all is lost.  

No we have not reached Reductio ad Hitlerum.  The point I was attempting to make was one of denial is all.  Bad example used, readily admit that.  There are those who have no idea of the potential damage this class may induce.  They are bias due to their lack of such knowledge and tend to dismiss any such claims out of hand as being false and the work of extremist.  There are those who are fully aware of this damage having lived it.  They are bias due to their personal experiences.  One cannot dismiss the views of the other as to having no validity and then start deleting things willy nilly.  Nobody is right when everybody is wrong.  This is all that I was attempting to state.  Don't start hacking away at an article relying upon either your ignorance or past experiences as justification for doing so.

Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)

I have been followed by three Veterans Administration Hospitals (San Juan, PR; Miami, FL; and Tampa, FL) for the condition known as CIDP.  Eventhough my treatment has been on since 1994, I found some treatments in Wiki that I had not heard of before.

The entire treatment article is copied here:

&quot;First line treatment for CIDP includes corticosteroids such as prednisone, plasmapheresis (plasma exchange) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) which may be prescribed alone or in combination with an immunosuppressant drug.

&quot;IVIG and plasmapheresis have proven benefit in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Despite less definitive published evidence of efficacy, corticosteroids are considered standard therapies because of their long history of use and cost effectiveness.

&quot;Immunosuppressive drugs are often of the cytotoxic (chemotherapy) class, including Rituximab (Rituxan) which targets B Cells, and cyclophosphamide, a drug which reduces the function of the immune system. Ciclosporin has also been used in CIDP but with less frequency as it is a newer approach.[4] Ciclosporin is thought to bind to immunocompetent lymphocytes, especially T-lymphocytes.

&quot;Non-cytotoxic immunosuppressive treatments usually include Imuran and Cellcept.

&quot;Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), an immunosuppressive agent that selectively destroys T lymphocytes is being studied for use in CIDP. Anti-thymocyte globulin is the gamma globulin fraction of antiserum from animals that have been immunized against human thymocytes. It is a polyclonal antibody.
Although chemotherapeutic and immunosuppressive agents have shown to be effective in treating CIDP significant evidence is lacking, mostly due to the heterogeneous nature of the disease in the patient population in addition to the lack of controlled trials.

&quot;Physiotherapy may improve muscle strength, function and mobility, and minimize the shrinkage of muscles and tendons and distortions of the joints.&quot;

Due to some necrosis in my body, corticosteroids have not been used in my treatment, however I did recieve several IVIg therapies.  I heard one of my doctors in PR say that CIDP was somewhat a chronic Guillan Barré and I am somewhat cognizant of GB because it was one of my early &quot;possible&quot; diagnosis.

All this is to ask two questions: are the treatments mentioned in the article the correct ones?  Should I show this article to my doctor?

Thanks,

 [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubmedid=12090400 This review article] is helpful. The treatments described in Wikipedia's article are correct. Showing the article to your doctor (a neurologist?) is unlikely to be helpful. Your doctor should know more about the practical management of CIDP than what is contained in Wikipedia's article. Your doctor will not rely on Wikipedia as his source of medical knowledge. CIDP does indeed resemble a chronic form of Guillain-Barré syndrome, but the treatments are subtly different. Your doctor has tailored your treatment to your specific circumstances. I recommend that you contact your doctor to discuss your treatment and clarify any confusion.

They have tweaked the mediawiki software, so for example page creation has a tool box to enter standardised section headers for disease or drug articles. 
However major issues to be sorted out, and they perhaps should have used more of what wikipedia has done and this project (ie instructions miss out large swayths on using the wiki markup - all there for just a copying over some help pages) and issues we have addressed at  and  might have been sensible to include.

The article has so many dreadful mistakes and the prose stinks. Looks like any old &quot;Ima Nutjob MD&quot; can sign up, and they don't allow non-expert copyeditors (which any decent publisher would employ). Trying to write lay and expert versions sounds like a very bad idea. The lay readers will probably prefer Wikipedia, medical charities or government sites and the experts readers should trust professional publications (I hope!). First rule of writing is to determine your audience. Colin°Talk 23:27, 18 February 2009 (UTC)
The most important rule in my book, but alas, often the hardest to adhere to.  Graham Colm Talk 00:05, 19 February 2009 (UTC)
medpedia vs citizendium
I don't understand why people would want to join medpedia when they could join citizendium and get the same thing.  Can anyone explain what the differences between the two are?  Is it more like knoll?  (talk) 02:35, 3 March 2009 (UTC)

Copying content
How should we deal with their content? I think that for some of our stub articles, we can take a big leap forward by copying their content; after all, it's GFDL. Take at look at what I did in just a few minutes with [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pleurisy&amp;diff=271653675&amp;oldid=271396000 Pleurisy]. --Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 22:13, 18 February 2009 (UTC)
How much of it is referenced properly though?  I am all for taking whatever they have that is good.  Much of it is just copy and pasted from wiki.  Anyway we can determine what they have that is new?  www.wikidoc.org is under the same copyright.--Doc James (talk ·  · ) 23:04, 18 February 2009 (UTC)
Not all content is GFDL.  What they adapt from wiki is, but what they produce themselves is marked &quot;Content on this page is the sole copyright of the author.&quot;--Doc James (talk ·  · ) 23:11, 18 February 2009 (UTC)
See Attribution (copyright), it applies to GFDL. Colin°Talk 23:27, 18 February 2009 (UTC)</segment>
