Subcats of Category:People by medical or psychological condition

In looking at the contents of , is there a method to the madness (pun intended :) of the naming of the subcategories?  There are &quot;People diagnosed with Foo&quot;, &quot;People with Foo&quot;, &quot;Foo people&quot;, &quot;Fooers&quot;, &quot;Foo patients&quot;.  Comments on a consistent naming style are welcomed. — MrDolomite • Talk 16:18, 20 August 2010 (UTC)

Image correction?

I think  may be a photo of idiopathic scrotal calcinosis, NOT epidermoid cysts.  You can see [http://www.google.com/images?q=Idiopathic%20scrotal%20calcinosis&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wi&amp;biw=1680&amp;bih=864 here] for additional examples of idiopathic scrotal calcinosis.  If the community agrees, perhaps someone could rename the file and add it to the correct article?  ---kilbad (talk) 20:24, 13 August 2010 (UTC)

Citing an entire journal

I would like to cite the entire issue of a journal, specifically, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/dth.2010.23.issue-4/issuetoc this journal issue].  Could someone help me with this?  Thanks in advance! ---kilbad (talk) 20:25, 21 August 2010 (UTC)
It is not usually recommended to cite a whole book since it is hard to verify the info it supports, thus the need of saying the specific pages. I would say that similarly it is not a good idea to cite a whole issue: I would cite the specific article or articles supporting your claim and if you want to point that there is a whole issue on a related theme put it in the further reading section of the article as an external link. Citing a whole issue is most probably too general.--Garrondo (talk) 00:41, 22 August 2010 (UTC)
I agree, although I can see some uses. Why exactly do you need to cite the whole issue?
For 5-HT3 antagonist, I used the following format for a similar citation: See Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol 1989; 25 Suppl 1. Fvasconcellos (t·) 20:34, 22 August 2010 (UTC)

dashes

I just moved Frank-Starling law of the heart (with a hyphen rather than a dash) to Frank–Starling law of the heart (with a dash).  Then, as always, I clicked on &quot;what links here&quot;.  I fixed the double redirects.  I found a huge number of articles linking to the incorrect (i.e. former) title and very few to the title with the dash.  I have long suspected that there are some subject-matter communities within Wikipedia that this particular standard hasn't reached yet, even today.  (See  on dashes and hyphens.  Dashes are used in ranges of numbers including years, pages, etc., and in contexts like the title of this article, and also for parenthetical offsets.  Hyphens are to be used in certain other kinds of contexts.)  The lopsided results on &quot;what links here&quot; make me suspect what one of those communities is.  Could others help fix those links?

'disease' vs 'defect'

Hi,
I've noticed a bit of vagueness and confusion between articles dealing with diseases and those dealing with congenital defects. I'm wondering if there's any consensus on whether a disease generally means something acquired after birth and a defect is something someone is born with? Particularly in reference to the heart-related articles. Thanks very much.--TyrS (talk) 05:50, 26 August 2010 (UTC)

I don't think there is consensus here. A defect is a chemical or physical abnormality that may or may not cause any particular symptoms, while the disease may be caused by such a defect but is almost by definition symptomatic. Cleft palate, for instance, is regarded as a defect. An atrial septum defect is often asymptomatic. Then there is &quot;syndrome&quot;, which is another story. JFW | T@lk 19:36, 26 August 2010 (UTC)

Can we find any source at all for that?  I'd like to expand Disease#Terminology.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 20:29, 26 August 2010 (UTC)

&quot;Disease is the aggregate of those conditions which, judged by the prevailing culture, are deemed painful, or disabling, and which, at the same time, deviate from either the statistical norm or from some idealized  status.&quot; This is from: King, L.S. What Is Disease? Philosophy of Science 21, 193-203 (1954). It was an interesting read on how our values shape what the idealized state is, for example foot binding in China or seers with hallucinations being regarded as prized members of society. But I agree, there is no &quot;real&quot; definition and the concept of disease is debated.  Defect on the other hand would probably be the latter half of the disease and would therefore be less specific than disease and perhaps therefore less ethereal: a deviation from the statistical norm or from some idealized status.

A little while ago I started this project page but have been too busy to do anything with it. I've been thinking about it though, and now have some time, so would like to run a trial.

On my mind

Two thoughts:

* I've proposed an  at .  If you've got an article with a recurring, subject-specific &quot;problem&quot; from good-faith newbies, then a brief edit notice might be a useful educational tool.  I doubt that it would be helpful for vandalism, but it could educate new editors about how-to issues, the value of sources, charity spam, fringe views, etc.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 17:05, 1 September 2010 (UTC)

Hospital articles

I've noticed that there are many hospitals that are at least somewhat notable (no less than high schools) that are either not covered in the encyclopedia, or we only have stubs on, and I'm contemplating as to whether it would be more appropriate to start a task force within Wikiproject Medicine or to create a WikiProject from scratch. We find the facilities notable enough to compile lists such as List of hospitals in Florida, yet many well known trauma centers are covered only by stubs as with Allegheny General Hospital and Bayfront Medical Center, and many only have redlinks like Lee Memorial Hospital and Lakeland Regional Medical Center.

If you did want to go ahead with it, you might consider a new task force at ./Task forces. I can see some basic notability discussion would be worth having in any case. I think you'll find virtually any teaching hospital will be easy to support, though for sheer interest factor I'd want to focus on the oldest (for history, e.g. Guy's Hospital) and on the obscure (e.g. isolated third-world hospitals).

See also section

 has been adding Risk factors in pregnancy in the see also section of many articles [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/TyrS].  Per  &quot;See also: Avoid when possible; use wikilinks in the main article and navigation templates at the end.&quot;

I agree with this sentiment and believe we should push harder not to have see also sections.  If something is notable enough to be mentioned it should be written into the text. Comments?Doc James (talk ·  · ) 09:09, 3 September 2010 (UTC)

Coincidentally, I spotted TyrS' edit – it seems to be indirectly sourced to the Merk online manual, so I assume the risk factors (each way) are accurate. The recommendation to reduce See also sections is sensible, and a comprehensive article is unlikely to need them. Nevertheless Asthma is in need of further work, so I wouldn't worry much about the addition to the that section at the moment, since it serves as both a reminder to editors that expansion is needed and as a pointer for readers to further info. As soon as the issue is discussed in the main text, the See also entry can go. --RexxS (talk) 10:11, 3 September 2010 (UTC)

I think the whole construction is very confused. I think &quot;risk factors&quot; is the wrong term for diseases that may deteriorate in pregnancy (e.g. pulmonary hypertension) or increase the rate of complications (e.g. cirrhosis and asthma). At present, many of our articles contain little information on pregnancy, and this is mirrored by the reality. Maternal medicine is, at least in the UK, the answer to underlying or superadded illness in pregnant women. This includes the diagnosis and treatment of pregnancy-induced diabetes, management of asthma in pregnancy, diagnosis and treatment of venous thromboembolic disease, and even preeclampsia.

I think risk factors in pregnancy should be renamed to something more overarching, and its reliance on the Merck Manual should be decreased by adding references to good reviews. Also, if a disease interacts with pregnancy it is only right that this is represented in the content. JFW | T@lk 13:15, 3 September 2010 (UTC)

To be fair, Doc James, the fact is that I have mostly added Risk factors in pregnancy to articles which already had 'See also' sections. So I am clearly not the only 'culprit'.
RexxS, I totally agree. It's a question of how much time editors have available.
JFW, I heartily agree with you about the lack of information &amp; awareness on pregnancy and complicating health issues (especially presented in a factual, dispassionate way), on Wikipedia and in general. I created the Risk factors in pregnancy article to try to fill this gap. It is an unasessed article, not even a start article at the moment, so it's of course very much open to people's improvements. The best place to talk about a move or any other improvements is at . Also (as I replied to you on my talk page) I am working on putting in better citations than the Merck Manual, as time permits.--TyrS (talk) 02:31, 6 September 2010 (UTC)

Sorry, but the applicability of pending changes overlaps exactly with that of semi-protection, so it cannot be used preemptively. A change like this requires wider discussion. Fvasconcellos (t·) 01:35, 6 September 2010 (UTC)
Which is what I am hoping we can have here.  As GAs and FAs are some what peer reviewed to keep them sort of peer reviewed requires a system like PC.

Ok, Doc, I am not a spambot and although I disagree that I did this to &quot;way too many articles&quot; (they are all disability-related), I will follow your directive until directed otherwise by WP:MED. Kikodawgzzz (talk) 02:49, 7 September 2010 (UTC)
(edit conflict) Huh. Well, I'd have expected such a template to be around already, but apparently it's new. The only problem here is size—it's much too wide. (The wording could also be improved, e.g. &quot;Inclusion · Freak show&quot; sort of jumps out at you—and not in a good way). At any rate, this appears to have been added with the best of intentions, and it's basically a very good idea. I'd support its inclusion (no pun intended) after some polishing—I wouldn't view this as spam. A horizontal navbox version may also be a good idea (not as a replacement but an alternative). Fvasconcellos (t·) 02:53, 7 September 2010 (UTC)
Yes,I do not consider it spam just inappropriately placed and formatted.  It should IMO be placed at the bottom of the page in a horizontal fashion similar to other such templates.  It is definitely needed I agree so kudos for creating it.Doc James (talk ·  · ) 02:55, 7 September 2010 (UTC)

 A normal-sized horizontal template at the bottom of articles would work, but this enormous vertical template is unsightly in the leads of articles and doesn't conform with  on all articles it's being placed at. SandyGeorgia (Talk) 02:57, 7 September 2010 (UTC)
A skinnier version () could also work. I'm not entirely against vertical templates (such as the old ), as long as they're used with caution. Fvasconcellos (t·) 03:03, 7 September 2010 (UTC)
I like the . I encourage anyone with the energy (probably not me) to incorporate that version into disability-related articles, including the ones to which I added the original that I made. And YES this Disability Template should have long ago existed. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE DISABLED, WORLD. WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN!!! ;)  Kikodawgzzz (talk) 03:09, 7 September 2010 (UTC)

 A vertical template isn't appropriate everywhere it's being added, like at Multiple sclerosis, a featured article. The lead should be a summary of the article and contain an image relevant to the article or, in place of an image, a template related tightly to the topic of MS specifically-- not a big template with links marginally related to MS. This would be appropriate as a horizontal collapsed table at the bottom of MS, but not as a vertical template in the lead. It might be an appropriate vertical template in other articles.  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 03:12, 7 September 2010 (UTC)
Yes, I agree. Just as an example, Paralympic Games could have a footer (horizontal navbox) and articles such as Inclusion (disability rights) could have  in lieu of a lead image. Fvasconcellos (t·) 03:18, 7 September 2010 (UTC)

(outdent)  There should really be a central place to discuss such templates, whether they should be used at all, what they should look like, etc.  Is there such a place?  The most annoying one, because of its gawdy appearance, is  IMO.  --Hordaland (talk) 08:03, 7 September 2010 (UTC)

I agree with all the above comments.  Hordaland: I think  would be the place for discussion.  Adrian J. Hunter(talk•) 10:42, 7 September 2010 (UTC)
Good advice!  They've just been discussing this sort of thing over there.  I've now read  where categories and lists are covered pretty well, including their advantages and disadvantages.  The section on navboxes/templates is poorer, but I believe the Disability Project should stick to lists, see also or possibly a horizontal navbox at the bottom of articles, if for this reason alone: &quot;If the navigation template appears prominently in the top-right corner of articles (...), the collection of articles should be fairly tightly related....&quot;  It also says &quot;The subject of the template [Disability] should be mentioned in every article.&quot;   
I agree with SandyGeorgia and Fvasconcellos above.  --Hordaland (talk) 17:35, 7 September 2010 (UTC)
Agree with H above except that &quot;see also&quot; sections are discouraged by .  Ideally the significance of the disability should be described in the text either in the &quot;prognosis&quot; or &quot;signs and symptoms&quot; sections.Doc James (talk ·  · ) 17:43, 7 September 2010 (UTC)
 Guidelines in this area are already clear enough; horizontal navigational templates at the bottom of the page are more appropriate.  Imagine the mess we would have in leads of articles if every editor wanting to add every remotely related template to the lead did so-- the lead would be longer than the article.  Unless the template is specifically the topic of the article, or is used in place of the lead image, these templates should be horizontal and added to the bottom-- please stop adding it to Multiple sclerosis. There are too many potentially related templates to add them all to the lead, and this templates is not integral to the MS topic.  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 11:59, 8 September 2010 (UTC)
I agree that this template should be in the form of a horizontal navigational template at the bottom of articles. P. D. Cook Talk to me! 12:54, 8 September 2010 (UTC)
Hey guys, I responded to  comments by Hordaland and Noleander thus: I am the creator of the Disability template and I can tell you that my adding of it to distinctly disability-related articles does mean that the adding is anything but indiscriminate. I do agree with both of you that there should definitely be a central location at which to discuss the appropriateness or inappropriateness of templates — it would make life for Wikipedians a whole lot easier, including myself. For instance, I have had zero idea of whether to paste it into just articles that refer strictly to disability culture and organizations, or whether to also paste it into articles about conditions that are widely recognized by humanity to be definitive disabilities, such as cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis and muscular dystrophy. So I've largely done both. That does not mean my major &quot;tagging&quot; job has been indiscriminate or that I am trying to make trouble by defending my case. I just wish that this could all remain open to discussion by as many different people as possible, and I also hope that mass reverts won't occur in an effort to purge most of these without discussions as to their appropriateness within each individual article's Talk page (for the most part anyhow). Lastly, again, I hope that some kind of discussion area for the specific guidelines for sidebars could be started, or better yet, an official Wikipedia page detailing a policy on them.

Where does it end?  Templates will become longer than the article-- the marginally related templates belong at the bottom of the article, as horizontal navigational templates.  This problem has an easy fix-- design a horizontal template that complements the vertical one, and use them depending on the article.  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 13:58, 8 September 2010 (UTC)

If you insist on putting this template in the lead section of articles, please make it auto-collapse by default, for screen reader users like myself. I would have no problem with a disability template at the bottom of the page that is initially collapsed. Graham87 14:01, 8 September 2010 (UTC)

*The problem with navigation boxes is that they have a tendency to replicate but flatten our hierarchical category scheme. So unless you have a set of articles that all naturally fit at the same level in some grouping hierarchy (or can be neatly grouped within the box), it doesn't work. This looks like a fairly limited and loose collection of topics related to disability. I wonder if our reader is better served simply by reading our articles on disability and following the hyperlinks to topics that interest them. I'm pretty strongly opposed to the box as it stands and would only accept a horizontal box on explicitly disability-related topics that are included in any such box. BTW: cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis and muscular dystrophy are not disabilities, they are medical conditions that cause disability. The difference is important.

* I agree with Colin about the difference between a disease and a disability, and I generally oppose adding this type of template to articles about medical conditions.  Many people with MS, for example, do not consider themselves to be disabled.  (These are not the sort of MS patients that one sees on television.)  One rule of thumb to consider:  If the article doesn't contain at least one section primarily about disabilities (e.g., a section whose heading contains the word 'disabilities'), then this template is probably inappropriate.

Are manual therapies effective in reducing pain from tension-type headache?: a systematic review.

Abstract
OBJECTIVES: A systematic review was performed to establish whether manual therapies have specific efficacy in reducing pain from tension-type headache (TTH).

METHODS: Computerized literature searches were performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, MANTIS, CINAHL, PEDro, and Cochrane databases. Papers were included if they described clinical (open noncontrolled studies) or randomized controlled trials in which any form of manual therapy was used for TTH, and if they were published after 1994 in the English language. The methodologic quality of the trials was assessed using the PEDro scale. Levels of scientific evidence, based on the quality and the outcomes of the studies, were established for each manual therapy: strong, moderate, limited, and inconclusive evidence.

RESULTS: Only six studies met the inclusion criteria. These trials evaluated different manual therapy modalities: spinal manipulation (three trials), classic massage (one trial), connective tissue manipulation (two trials), soft tissue massage (one trial), Dr. Cyriax's vertebral mobilization (one trial), manual traction (one trial), and CV-4 craniosacral technique (one trial). Methodologic PEDro quality scores ranged from 2 to 8 points out of a theoretical maximum of 10 points (mean=5.8+/-2.1). Analysis of the quality and the outcomes of all trials did not provide rigorous evidence that manual therapies have a positive effect in reducing pain from TTH: spinal manipulative therapy showed inconclusive evidence of effectiveness (level 4), whereas soft tissue techniques showed limited evidence (level 3).

CONCLUSIONS: The authors found no rigorous evidence that manual therapies have a positive effect in the evolution of TTH. The most urgent need for further research is to establish the efficacy beyond placebo of the different manual therapies currently applied in patients with TTH.

Physical treatments for headache: a structured review.

Abstract
BACKGROUND: Primary headache disorders, especially migraine, are commonly accompanied by neck pain or other symptoms. Because of this, physical therapy (PT) and other physical treatments are often prescribed. This review updates and synthesizes published clinical trial evidence, systematic reviews, and case series regarding the efficacy of selected physical modalities in the treatment of primary headache disorders.

METHODS: The National Library of Medicine (MEDLINE), The Cochrane Library, and other sources of information were searched through June 2004 to identify clinical studies, systematic reviews, case series, or other information published in English that assessed the treatment of headache or migraine with chiropractic, osteopathic, PT, or massage interventions.

RESULTS: PT is more effective than massage therapy or acupuncture for the treatment of TTH and appears to be most beneficial for patients with a high frequency of headache episodes. PT is most effective for the treatment of migraine when combined with other treatments such as thermal biofeedback, relaxation training, and exercise. Chiropractic manipulation demonstrated a trend toward benefit in the treatment of TTH, but evidence is weak. Chiropractic manipulation is probably more effective in the treatment of tension-type headache (TTH) than it is in the treatment of migraine. Evidence is lacking regarding the efficacy of these treatments in reducing headache frequency, intensity, duration, and disability in many commonly encountered clinical situations. Many of the published case series and controlled studies are of low quality.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Further studies of improved quality are necessary to more firmly establish the place of physical modalities in the treatment of primary headache disorders. With the exception of high velocity chiropractic manipulation of the neck, the treatments are unlikely to be physically dangerous, although the financial costs and lost treatment opportunity by prescribing potentially ineffective treatment may not be insignificant. In the absence of clear evidence regarding their role in treatment, physicians and patients are advised to make cautious and individualized judgments about the utility of physical treatments for headache management; in most cases, the use of these modalities should complement rather than supplant better-validated forms of therapy.

Abstract
BACKGROUND: Non-invasive physical treatments are often used to treat common types of chronic/recurrent headache.

OBJECTIVES: To quantify and compare the magnitude of short- and long-term effects of non-invasive physical treatments for chronic/recurrent headaches.

SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the following databases from their inception to November 2002: MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, CINAHL, Science Citation Index, Dissertation Abstracts, CENTRAL, and the Specialised Register of the Cochrane Pain, Palliative Care and Supportive Care review group. Selected complementary medicine reference systems were searched as well. We also performed citation tracking and hand searching of potentially relevant journals.

SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials comparing non-invasive physical treatments for chronic/recurrent headaches to any type of control.

DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two independent reviewers abstracted trial information and scored trials for methodological quality. Outcomes data were standardized into percentage point and effect size scores wherever possible. The strength of the evidence of effectiveness was assessed using pre-specified rules.

MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-two studies with a total of 2628 patients (age 12 to 78 years) met the inclusion criteria. Five types of headache were studied: migraine, tension-type, cervicogenic, a mix of migraine and tension-type, and post-traumatic headache. Ten studies had methodological quality scores of 50 or more (out of a possible 100 points), but many limitations were identified. We were unable to pool data because of study heterogeneity. For the prophylactic treatment of migraine headache, there is evidence that spinal manipulation may be an effective treatment option with a short-term effect similar to that of a commonly used, effective drug (amitriptyline). Other possible treatment options with weaker evidence of effectiveness are pulsating electromagnetic fields and a combination of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation [TENS] and electrical neurotransmitter modulation. For the prophylactic treatment of chronic tension-type headache, amitriptyline is more effective than spinal manipulation during treatment. However, spinal manipulation is superior in the short term after cessation of both treatments. Other possible treatment options with weaker evidence of effectiveness are therapeutic touch; cranial electrotherapy; a combination of TENS and electrical neurotransmitter modulation; and a regimen of auto-massage, TENS, and stretching. For episodic tension-type headache, there is evidence that adding spinal manipulation to massage is not effective. For the prophylactic treatment of cervicogenic headache, there is evidence that both neck exercise (low-intensity endurance training) and spinal manipulation are effective in the short and long term when compared to no treatment. There is also evidence that spinal manipulation is effective in the short term when compared to massage or placebo spinal manipulation, and weaker evidence when compared to spinal mobilization. There is weaker evidence that spinal mobilization is more effective in the short term than cold packs in the treatment of post-traumatic headache.

REVIEWERS' CONCLUSIONS: A few non-invasive physical treatments may be effective as prophylactic treatments for chronic/recurrent headaches. Based on trial results, these treatments appear to be associated with little risk of serious adverse effects. The clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of non-invasive physical treatments require further research using scientifically rigorous methods. The heterogeneity of the studies included in this review means that the results of a few additional high-quality trials in the future could easily change the conclusions of our review.

Abstract
OBJECTIVES: To systematically collate and evaluate the evidence from recent systematic reviews of clinical trials of spinal manipulation.

DESIGN: Literature searches were carried out in four electronic databases for all systematic reviews of the effectiveness of spinal manipulation in any indication, published between 2000 and May 2005. Reviews were defined as systematic if they included an explicit and repeatable inclusion and exclusion criteria for studies.

RESULTS: Sixteen papers were included relating to the following conditions: back pain (n=3), neck pain (n=2), lower back pain and neck pain (n=1), headache (n=3), non-spinal pain (n=1), primary and secondary dysmenorrhoea (n=1), infantile colic (n=1), asthma (n=1), allergy (n=1), cervicogenic dizziness (n=1), and any medical problem (n=1). The conclusions of these reviews were largely negative, except for back pain where spinal manipulation was considered superior to sham manipulation but not better than conventional treatments.

CONCLUSIONS: Collectively these data do not demonstrate that spinal manipulation is an effective intervention for any condition. Given the possibility of adverse effects, this review does not suggest that spinal manipulation is a recommendable treatment.

This [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chiropractic&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=382400768 edit] added more unreliable references. References from 1978 are not reliable because we have newer sources currently used in the article. These [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chiropractic&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=382400768 old references] do not pass .

Per MEDRS: * Look for reviews published in the last five years or so, preferably in the last two or three years. The range of reviews examined should be wide enough to catch at least one full review cycle, containing newer reviews written and published in the light of older ones and of more-recent primary studies.

Per MEDRS: &quot;These guidelines are appropriate for actively researched areas with many primary sources and several reviews, and may need to be relaxed in areas where little progress is being made and few reviews are being published&quot;.

We should not relax the reference selection because there are currently plenty of sources on the topic of hand. There has not been little progress and there has not been a few reviews being published. In fact, there has been a lot of progress and there has been more than a few reviews on the topic. MEDRS is not a policy but for alternative medicine articles like Chiropractic editors have followed MEDRS.

Pharma industry steering group

Hi all,

I received this message through LinkedIn, maybe someone here is interested? Let me know.

cheers, --Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 20:11, 13 September 2010 (UTC)

---------------------------------

Dear Michaël
I hope you don't mind my contacting you.

I understand you are a Wikipedia expert. I work for a medical communications company that works with a lot of global pharma companies. Our clients are increasingly concerned about inaccurate and out-of-date information on Wikipedia about medicines, but in many cases they are not permitted to correct the problems due to perceived or real issues with either Wikipedia's own rules, the industry regulations they are bound by, or both.

I am convinced we could come up with a process to correct these inaccuracies, that pharma could sponsor but not necessarily be a hands-on participant in, much like clinical publications or CME. I'm looking for professionals to join a steering group to scrutinise this process as it develops, to ensure it represents the best interests of all stakeholders.

Would you be interested in joining this steering group? Please let me know. Thanks very much

Kind regards
xxxx

I think you should respond that people are certainly allowed to make edits in the face of a COI, as long as the content is verifiable and they declare the COI from the start. I think the concerns are quite correct, but I can't imagine any of us wanting to act as a proxy for a commercial company. JFW | T@lk 20:37, 13 September 2010 (UTC)

I agree with JFD. As long as the content is appropriate and verifiable, there really shouldn't be an issue. Tyrol5  [[User talk:Tyrol5|[Talk]]] 20:42, 13 September 2010 (UTC)

Yes agree.  They need to follow.  to the letter.  Reference to peer reviewed review articles and not be found to be removing verifiable content that the company they work for might disagree with.  Otherwise I do not see a problem with them editing.Doc James (talk ·  · ) 20:53, 13 September 2010 (UTC)
 Perhaps this is common enough for a FAQ or similar to be made (a subpage here?) giving guidance to medical industry contributors in the same way that  is a guide for the cultural sector. Essentially, it could make clear our conventions on COI and recommend posting proposals on Talk pages with suitable references. Learning how to find references meeting  might be a better use of time for &quot;stakeholders&quot; than setting up steering groups to examine the processes. --RexxS (talk) 20:54, 13 September 2010 (UTC)
(outdent) Agree with JFD, Tyrol and doc james. In addition to editing articles, pharm companies could do something similar to the google sponsored experts; performing a review of an article and posting issues and references on the talk page.--Literaturegeek | T@1k? 20:57, 13 September 2010 (UTC)
LG, I respectfully—and strenuously—disagree. It would turn into an industry-sponsored-data lovefest. Fvasconcellos (t·) 22:33, 13 September 2010 (UTC)
Perhaps a little extra caution is due. Google isn't editing, the Google Foundation is funding third-party reviewer/editors. There is no COI in those cases and they, like we, clearly want to produce quality information. With pharma (or other) industrys' editors working on articles pertinent to their products, many subtle forms of content manipulation are possible, from the marketing of novel syndromes (excess perspiration, ED, restless leg, etc.) onward through reference selection bias. Even short term manipulation timed around major anouncements could create problems. The advice in  on how to edit in the face of a COI should be very carefully observed, and until there is a solid reputation established it is highly advisable to stick to the talk pages. LeadSongDog come howl! 22:25, 13 September 2010 (UTC)
I agree. I would be much more comfortable instructing this &quot;group&quot; to leave concerns at article Talk pages, where they can be assessed by experienced Wikipedians and acted upon if and only if action is really warranted. Fvasconcellos (t·) 22:28, 13 September 2010 (UTC)
If we do indeed allow them to edit, we must insure that they are familiar with our NPOV, COI, and other relevant content policies. Tyrol5  [[User talk:Tyrol5|[Talk]]] 22:32, 13 September 2010 (UTC)

*   SandyGeorgia (Talk) 02:41, 14 September 2010 (UTC)

Mostly agree with Fvasconellos' idea, perhaps it would be handier if this group would use a central talk page which is easier to keep an eye on. Richiez (talk) 12:53, 14 September 2010 (UTC)
The thing is this is the encyclopedia that anyone can edit, there is nothing to stop them editing articles or talk pages as long as the edits are not disruptive or harmful. When I made my posting I was thinking of the wide array of pharmacology articles which are littered with uncited amateurish original research, articles which often lack entirely from contradinications, drug interactions info and so forth and saw this as potentially having more benefits than negatives. However, rereading Steven's message my view now is this may be a return of the prulifloxacin content dispute with regard to whether a primary sourced preclinical trial can be used to state the drug has a safety profile similar to placebo in place of known class effects of the drug sourced to recent reviews and also whether the self published source from a drug company conference should be used to describe safety and efficacy information. I suspect that this request is going to be limited to only a very small number of articles, probably just one article; we are not going to be over-run by drug companies and wikipedians will be too busy to &quot;join their cause&quot;. Really I think the first thing that should be established is; what public relations company are they from? What article(s) do they want to edit/change/update? And advise them just like any other editor to raise concerns on article talk pages and to just like any other editor to use existing wiki projects and noticeboards to raise disagreements. They are bound by the same editing guidelines such as ,  etc etc. I could say more but ugh it is getting close to .--Literaturegeek | T@1k? 17:43, 14 September 2010 (UTC)

As a point of fact,  doesn't require people to declare their conflicts of interest.  It is &quot;strongly encouraged&quot;, but not required.
Where outright errors and vandalism exist (&quot;This antibiotic kills viruses&quot;), I think that we would welcome anyone to fix the problems.  Beyond that, though, I think that we'd do well to encourage them to leave a note on the article's talk page, here, or at  about the problem.  A note that says, e.g., 'This article says X, and all the recent reviews, such as  and doi:123 say not-X&quot; would be helpful.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:32, 14 September 2010 (UTC)
Agree. That sounds sensible.--Literaturegeek | T@1k? 01:16, 16 September 2010 (UTC)

 I responded to the email copy I received (setting out issues of WP:COI and not forming a cabal), not had feedback since. By way of comparison,  has been very open and has left suggestions on  for others to look at. David Ruben  Talk  21:25, 16 September 2010 (UTC)

As I am sure everyone is aware we have serious issues with a lack of editors.  There are 23,000 article in our topic areas.  Most of us are simply volunteers and we are few.  If this person would wish to make suggestions in the format of please replace this currently poor unreffed section with this fully properly source to high quality reviews section I would be happy to review stuff in this form and add it if appropraiate.  I agree a central page would be useful anyone wish to create it?
A secondary review by one of us I think would protect the company from undesirable media attention which I assume is why the pharma industry does not wish to edit directly. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 21:50, 16 September 2010 (UTC)
(outdent) Interesting David. Maybe it is not connected to prulifloxacin then. The mystery deepens. :) Agree with what you are saying Doc James in principle but we still don't know anything much about this pharma group so I think setting up a page for them at this point would be premature.--Literaturegeek | T@1k? 22:18, 16 September 2010 (UTC)
I think this would be a good venue for dealing with all people with COI which present information pertaining to medical topics.  Would give people who attempt to add stuff like this WikiProject_Medicine#Short_Course_Immune_Induction a place to go for questions, etc.Doc James (talk ·  · ) 01:25, 17 September 2010 (UTC)

It is interesting to note that the e-mail I got referred to &quot;perceived or real issues with either Wikipedia's own rules, the industry regulations they are bound by, or both&quot;. They are essentially seeking advice in the matter of how to deal with this process, not in us becoming their editors per se. I think it would be good if someone took more time and discussed different possibilities with them in more detail, because I agree that this is a problem that I can image many big pharma companies face. --Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 20:15, 21 September 2010 (UTC)
I think Steven, they would get helpful feedback here on wikipedia. Why not suggest to these people to create accounts on wikipedia and post either here on this project talk page or on wiki pharm talk or on the talk pages of the articles in question?--Literaturegeek | T@1k? 20:24, 21 September 2010 (UTC)

Propose Addition of Fluarix and Flulaval Articles

Hi, I work for GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) in the United States as a Medical Information Scientist. I have been engaging on the Cervarix talk page with the intent to provide information to the editors of Wikipedia for their use in the article.  I would like to propose the addition of articles for the GlaxoSmithKline influenza vaccines, Fluarix and Flulaval.  I believe that it is important to provide safety and clinical information about the vaccines for this upcoming flu season.  Additionally, I have noted that many of the other influenza vaccines have a dedicated article.  If article stubs are created, I can provide information about the products in accordance with the Wikipedia Manual of Style for Medicine Related Articles.  Thank you. Maitri Shah, PharmD, GSK (talk) 19:50, 21 September 2010 (UTC)

We use generic names usually. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 21:04, 21 September 2010 (UTC)
Vaccines don't have official generic names as such. The closest thing to a generic name is usually just something along the lines of &quot;XXXX vaccine, strain Y, live/attenuated/etc.&quot; In this case, trade names would be most adequate if the articles are created, as the articles would refer to these specific trademarked preparations of influenza vaccine. For instance, we have articles on Advil and Tylenol as well as ibuprofen and paracetamol, as the brand-name drugs are notable in their own right. Fvasconcellos (t·) 01:56, 22 September 2010 (UTC)

That's because it should be multiple fibrosclerosis. The ICD entry is missing a comma; it's fibrosclerosis, multiple, not fibrosclerosis multiple.

The most common cause of &quot;influenza-like illness&quot; is, of course, influenza. Particularly during flu season. This should probably be redirected to our article on influenza, and merged into the sections on differential diagnosis and symptoms. MastCell Talk 16:42, 24 September 2010 (UTC)

The CDC says the majority of ILI cases are not caused by influenza but &quot;other viruses (e.g., rhinoviruses and respiratory syncytial virus [RSV]), adenoviruses, and parainfluenza viruses). &quot;, although the source (#2 in the article) is more concerned about anthrax they did pay close attention to this detail for obvious reasons.

The edit is currently POV worded. The term SSRI can be misleading in that it sounds like it selectively targets certain serotonin sites and it could be argued SRI is more accurate and it is quite possible the name was chosen for marketing reasons. I think it would be difficult to find a reliable source for this though. I think it should probably be deleted and the editor asked to find a reliable source if it is to be added back in, or else if someone here as you have requested finds a source.--Literaturegeek | T@1k? 14:09, 25 September 2010 (UTC)

That strikes me as a sea lawyer's explanation.  Any biochemist would automatically understand the name as meaning that it doesn't inhibit uptake of non-serotonin chemicals.  If the average person has a different guess about the meaning, then this is merely another data point indicating that science education is inadequate.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 20:21, 25 September 2010 (UTC)
Not heard the sea lawyer expression before, but I take it that it is not a good thing. :) I think it can be read either way. Not everyone is a biochemist though, a lot of doctors as well as lay people take nonbenzodiazepine literally for example as meaning it does not work on benzodiazepine receptors. Also drugs which selectively block the reuptake of other neurotransmitters are not called selective reuptake inhibitors. Maybe this is a sea lawyer explaination but I am not a biochemist and was only expressing my viewpoint, which may be wrong. Anyhow as it is not sourced and POV it should be deleted.--Literaturegeek | T@1k? 20:59, 25 September 2010 (UTC)

Good catch.  I don't think the changes  made to  represent that project, and his changes have a large, probably unwanted effect on this project.  VetMed was previously tagged as inactive, so the number of tagged articles was at 0 before September 19, and is gradually re-populating.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation

Greetings participants, 

I'd like to draw upon your experience for some outside input.  An anonymous editor has been doing some quite good work on transcranial magnetic stimulation, but is also advocating for the inclusion of a single, recent, primary source on the page.  After several weeks of edit summary-based communication and reverts, there is finally a discussion on the talk page ().  A diff in question is [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Transcranial_magnetic_stimulation&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=388208283 here] and the paper itself is [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20439832 here].  I'm of the opinion that we're better off waiting for a secondary source per MEDRS#Secondary but anon believes it is sufficiently noteworthy to include now.  There has been an [http://psychiatry.jwatch.org/cgi/content/full/2010/614/6 editorial] published that I'm not able to read which may provide context, and it has apparently been the subject of a . 

Since it's a judgment call, I was hoping for your judgment.  I'm open to being wrong, I just don't think I am.  Any input would be welcome.  Thanks, WLU (t)  Wikipedia's rules:/ 12:59, 2 October 2010 (UTC)

It is a judgement call, and you've done the right thing by asking for more editors to help you find consensus. It's very difficult to balance our need to ensure the highest quality sourcing against the desire not to exclude significant new information. I've commented, indicating a weak preference for including the primary for the moment, while looking for further sources. I could be way off-base there, so I'd strongly urge as many other contributors here as possible to have a look at the issue, and try to find a consensus that is acceptable to all. --RexxS (talk) 16:22, 2 October 2010 (UTC)

Medical research ethics eyes needed

CCSVI article - comments needed

In the CCSVI article I have added the following source: . Such source in its final paragraph concludes: &quot;Although CCSVI remains an interesting hypothesis, evidence linking it to increased iron in MS is lacking. Iron dysregulation in MS is apparently more complex than simply a matter of iron accumulation in the brain.&quot; The article is an editorial in neurology, which is one the few closest to secondary sources that we have. 

I believe both conclussions are important and that only adding one is a POV while another editor believes that only the second sentence should be included in the article, being the reasons stated &quot;keep it short&quot;. 

Comments on whether it is best to include one or both conclussions would be most welcomed.

--Garrondo (talk) 12:50, 4 October 2010 (UTC)

Unfortunately, our honourable editor Garrondo is not neutral on the issue of CCSVI.

Wikiproject First Aid has been nearly devoid of activity for nearly two years. Would there be any objection to merging it into WP:MED as a task force?

It's not as fancy as Diberri's tool, but it also doesn't require third-party web servers.

Why waste it?

I typed the following information in an email to our first year dermatology residents regarding gammopathy/paraproteinemia, and figured since I put the work in, why not share it with you all.  I am fairly busy right now, but perhaps someone could integrate this information into some of our articles?  I think it may help dispel some confusion on the topic.


DEFINITIONS:
*1. Paraprotein - &quot;A normal or abnormal plasma protein appearing in large quantities as a result of a pathological condition&quot; [1]
*2. Paraproteinemias - &quot;A group of related diseases characterized by an unbalanced or disproportionate proliferation of immunoglobulin-producing cells, usually from a single clone. These cells frequently secrete a structurally homogeneous immunoglobulin and/or an abnormal immunoglobulin.&quot; [2]
*3. Gammopathy - &quot;a disorder characterized by a disturbance in the body's synthesis of antibodies&quot; [3]

GENERAL COMMENTS:
*1. Serum is composed of two general types of protein, (1) albumin, and (2) globulin.
*2. There are many globulin proteins in the blood, of which one group is immunoglobulin.
*3. The normal or abnormal plasma protein appearing in large quantities as a result of a pathological condition constituting paraprotein is usually (1) immunoglobulin, or (2) immunoglobulin-derived.
*4. Immunoglobulin or immunoglobulin-derived paraprotein is produced by plasma cells.
*5. Using the above definitions, the terms &quot;gammopathy&quot; and &quot;paraproteinemia&quot; are synonymous. [But see footnote 1 for nuance...]
*6. If this paraprotein is produced by only one clone of plasma cell, it is considered a &quot;monoclonal gammopathy&quot; or alternatively a &quot;monoclonal paraproteinemia.&quot;
*7. If this paraprotein is produced by multiple clones of plasma cells, it is considered a &quot;polyclonal gammopathy&quot; or alternatively a &quot;polyclonal paraproteinemia.&quot;
*8. Immunoglobulin or immunoglobulin-derived paraprotein is usually composed of IgG or IgA, or pieces of those proteins
*9. Individual immunoglobulin proteins are made up of heavy and light chains.
*10. Immunoglobulin light chains may be one of two types, either lambda (λ) or kappa (κ)

GAMMOPATHY/PARAPROTEINEMIA AND CUTANEOUS CONDITIONS:
*1. Many cutaneous conditions have been associated with a gammopathy/paraproteinemia (**SEE: Bolongia Table 119.2 for a near complete listing, and the ETAS study guide table 4-4 (pg138) for a high-yield listing)
*2. With regard to the above definitions and general comments, here are some examples of usage from Bolognia:

*&quot;Some patients with Sneddon–Wilkinson disease have an associated IgA paraproteinemia.&quot;

*&quot;[The] monoclonal gammopathy of IgG paraprotein in those with scleromyxedema...is usually IgG with γ light chains.&quot;

*&quot;A hallmark feature of necrobiotic xanthogranuloma is the associated paraproteinemia, an IgG monoclonal gammopathy, which is found in at least 80% of cases, most often IgG with k light chains.&quot;

*&quot;[With the] neutrophilic dermatoses, Sweet's syndrome or pyoderma gangrenosum (particularly the atypical bullous form), approximately 10–20% of cases are associated with hematologic disorders such as acute myelogenous leukemia or IgA paraproteinemia.&quot;

*&quot;Primary systemic amyloidosis [is characterized by a] immunoglobulin light chain monoclonal gammopathy due to plasma cell dyscrasia &gt;&gt; multiple myeloma.&quot;

DETECTION AND MANAGEMENT:
*1. Several tests can be used to detect paraprotein.
*2. The most common test is serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP).
*3. There is some nuance to interpreting SPEP results, and this is not always the most specific/sensitive test for evaluating a possible gammopathy/paraproteinemia (we can touch on this another time; see reference 4 for a good review of SPEP interpretation)
*4. When evaluating a cutaneous condition that may have an associated gammopathy/paraproteinemia, you should order testing to evaluate for paraprotein.
*5. When a monoclonal gammopathy is present, the possibility of underlying multiple myeloma needs to be considered. [Bolognia][4][5]
*6. Monoclonal gammopathy is present in up to 8 percent of healthy geriatric patients. [4]
*7. Patients with monoclonal gammopathy of &quot;undetermined significance&quot; require close follow-up because about 1 percent per year develop multiple myeloma or another malignant monoclonal gammopathy. [4]

FOOTNOTES:
*[1] Some authors define the term &quot;paraproteinemias&quot; in a more strict sense to mean only &quot;a plasma cell disorder in which an abnormal amount of a **single** immunoglobulin is present in the serum.&quot; [2]  If one holds to this definition, then the general terms &quot;paraproteinemia&quot; and &quot;gammopathy&quot; would NOT be synonyous.  Rather, in this case, the terms &quot;paraproteinemia&quot; and &quot;monoclonal gammopathy&quot; would be synonymous.

Pending changes redux

After some experience with it, I'm inclined to think that except in the case of BLPs, pending change protection is more trouble than it's worth -- it doesn't make reverting vandalism any easier, and generally just makes watching an article more difficult.  My impression is that it probably shouldn't be used for medical articles.  Any reactions? Looie496 (talk) 18:04, 14 October 2010 (UTC)

I disagree and feel that pending changes is something that is needed on many medical articles:
#Concerns have been voiced both by academia and our readership regarding Wikipedia's reliability. Pending changes addresses some of these concerns. And thus there is a good chance that &quot;pending changes&quot; will not only increase our readership but the number of people who edit. No one wants to put in the work to create something good or excellent just to have it vandalized and left un-repaired. ( we have had a number of recent examples )
#Vandals like to see their work go &quot;live&quot;. Pending changes stops this and will thus potentially decrease the entire volume of vandalism.
#We will have a tool to allow the world to seamlessly contribute to a greater part of Wikipedia. Instead of semi protecting some pages ( and thus making it difficult for IPs to contribution ). We can use PC making Wikipedia more open per our founding principles.
Pending changes forces someone to review all changes and thus keeps GAs/FAs sort of peer reviewed and IMO should be applied to these as a group ( at least the ones watched by only a few people ). It could definitely use some more speed though.
Doc James (talk ·  · ) 18:19, 14 October 2010 (UTC)
I agree with the points made by Doc James. I am a strong supporter of pending changes; while indefinite semi protection is the best way of making editing easier on articles which get a lot of vandalism, admins usually refuse to semi-protect due to policy and guidelines unless there is an exceptionally high level of vandalism. Pending changes is the next best thing. Like Doc James says vandals like to see their edits go live so it should have at least some effect in reducing vandalism levels as well as improving the article content for our readers.--Literaturegeek | T@1k? 00:39, 18 October 2010 (UTC)
I agree with both Dr James and litgeek.  I seem to have been investing rather a lot of time lately reverting vandalism in medical articles I'm watching, and its a pain, quite frankly.

There are no medical articles left to run as .  What would it take to interest folks in bringing Jean-Martin Charcot to FA status?  A bio of a dead person, about whom much has been written, might be easier than a medical condition, where every Tom Dick and Harry has to weigh in with primary sources.  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 17:00, 21 October 2010 (UTC)
I have been working hard at Parkinson's disease, and I was thinking of taking it to FAC in about a month or two, but with some help it could be much faster...(2 weeks?) Sourcing I believe its about the best we can get, and all sections have been fully rewriten with minor exceptions. If anybody is interested can ask at the talk page or me directly about whan is left to be done. To begin with I am horrible at the lead, and copy editing of the article would be most welcome. A bit more work is needed only in the pathophisiology section and society section.--Garrondo (talk) 18:17, 21 October 2010 (UTC)
 I will look when I have time, but it would help if you would first assure me that primary sources are not used unnecessarily, and the article relies heavily on secondary reviews.  If not, I'll oppose at FAC :)  We've got to get a handle on the use of primary sources in medical articles by making FAs an example (and in that vein, it's about time someone sent Schizophrenia to FAR, because I've been asking for it to be cleaned up for a very long time on the article talk page).  Anyway, there is tons of good literature on Charcot if anyone wants to dig in.  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 18:23, 21 October 2010 (UTC)
Probably less than 4 primary refs out ot the society and pathophisiology section (where some work has still to be done), most refs in first line journals and recent ones. It should not be difficult to pass FAC... take a look to refs and you will see what I mean. Only 50 refs for all the article, but every sentence sourced to them.

Worried well

Worried well seems to be a redlink.  It looks like the old code was &quot;2008 ICD-9-CM Diagnosis Code V65.5, Person with feared complaint in whom no diagnosis was made&quot;.  Is there a new name for it?  Is there anything much to be said about it, beyond that it exists?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 20:51, 22 October 2010 (UTC)
Hypochondria, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18454583 might be the alternative name perhaps].--Literaturegeek | T@1k? 21:56, 22 October 2010 (UTC)
Hmm.  I wouldn't paint the worried well and hypochondriacs with the same brush.  I don't know if there's a more PC term to describe the worried well, but these people are the one who turn up to clinics with fairly innocent enquiries about something that's bothering them - and once reassured tend not to return with the same complaint.  Hypochondriasis is a pathological variant of this behaviour.  Matto Say G'Day! 05:21, 23 October 2010 (UTC)
What you say makes sense Matt. Perhaps worried well was removed from ICD because it was no longer judged to be a disorder by a subsequent panel of experts? If anyone has the interest and time, putting &quot;worried well&quot; into quotes and searching pubmed or google books should provide enough references to use to create a stub or maybe a C class article.--Literaturegeek | T@1k? 14:23, 23 October 2010 (UTC)

Chief Medical Officer in US hospital administration

Could someone have a look.  We have a CMO for the UK and Ireland, but for the US it redirects to &quot;Surgeon General&quot; !!!  I don't know enough about the exact tasks to create a page myself.  All I know is that the CMO is some &quot;big cheese&quot; in a hospital's administration and not the Surgeon General.  Compare: [http://www.ajc.com/news/grady-ceo-rethinks-firing-287931.html], [http://www.jobhost.org/jobs/viewjob/chief-medical-officer-3ef6815b75177f22?source=indeed&amp;medium=organic], [http://www.msa.md.gov/msa/mdmanual/25ind/priv/html/med.html], [http://www.enterhealth.com/docs/DrCarlosTiradoJoinsEnterhealth.pdf]  (talk) 05:38, 26 October 2010 (UTC)

It looks like the redirect at Chief Medical Officer, United States was created by a Brit, presumably in the spirit of 'translation'.  Perhaps the article on the position in hospital administration should be at Chief medical officer (hospital).  WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:12, 27 October 2010 (UTC)
Shouldn't the UK term be &quot;medical director&quot; for the hospital post. At the moment, the medical director article describes a different sort of post with that name in the U.S. Physchim62 (talk) 19:07, 27 October 2010 (UTC)
The article currently at medical director was mostly written by a person who focuses a lot of their contributions on models of care in different EMS systems.  The content is good, but I don't think it belongs under the title of &quot;medical director.&quot;  This was briefly discussed a few years ago at .  In the US, a medical director is a licensed physician who provides medical oversight to a department consisting of allied-health providers (people who provide some sort of health care, but do not have independent licenses to practice medicine themselves).  I believe the article at medical director should be re-focused to reflect this.  There is a separate hospital position in the US called something like &quot;chief medical officer&quot; or &quot;chief of medical staff,&quot; whose role is to be a part of the hospital administration and be a liaison from the staff physicians to the hospital administration.  If this position is unique to the US, an article on this could be located at Chief medical officer (United States), otherwise, it could be at Chief medical officer (hospital).  --Scott Alter (talk) 22:18, 27 October 2010 (UTC)

Research directions

A discussion at  has raised the question of whether ClinicalTrials.gov is usable as a reference for sections on ongoing research that is not yet reporting results. The alternatives seem to be either relying on news media sources or else excluding such discussion entirely. Additional input would be helpful. LeadSongDog come howl! 18:04, 28 October 2010 (UTC)

From a different point of view: there are two questions: Is clinicaltrials reliable to cite trials? 
Does it stablish notability of a trial or does it have to be inferred from other sources such as media reports?.--Garrondo (talk) 18:13, 28 October 2010 (UTC)

It's hard to judge reliability without knowing what you want to say in the article.  IMO that website is a reliable source for whether a trial exists, and even information about study design and (for completed trials) what the preliminary results were (although you should cite a proper paper whenever possible).
It is certainly not evidence that a given trial is  (deserves its own article) or even necessarily  (should be mentioned in another article).  For those purposes, the media sources might be better.  If, on the other hand, the goal is to say something like &quot;Only look!  People are doing research!  Isn't it exciting/hopeful/etc&quot;, then I'd invoke the &quot;not a directory of clinical trials&quot; standard and exclude it all together.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 19:31, 28 October 2010 (UTC)

Plans for Breast cancer awareness

I'm plotting a new article at Breast cancer awareness.  I haven't figured out whether it should subsume all of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month and Pink ribbon, or just the less specific elements.  I've just picked up a few good history/society books from the library, and reading those will doubtless keep me busy for a couple of weeks.  

In the bigger picture, we should also have an article at Disease awareness (coordinated with Awareness ribbons), and perhaps at Cancer awareness.  They should cover history, advantages (people recognize symptoms and seek care), and disadvantages (e.g., [http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-welch-mammograms-20101020,0,2961910.story these concerns]) -- but I don't know how easy it will be to find sources on the general subject, rather than the individual diseases.

If you've got ideas, sources, or know of any relevant existing articles, please speak up!  WhatamIdoing (talk) 23:50, 1 November 2010 (UTC)
You'll need to take due measures to ensure such articles don't become s, of course, but it sounds like a good plan, with the added benefit of forking much of this awareness- and fund-raising content out of the medical articles. You might find [http://scholar.google.ca/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=public+health+awareness+ribbon&amp;as_sdt=2000&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_vis=0 these] useful for starters. Good luck!

Parkinson's disease to GAN

I have just nominated Parkinson's disease for good article, as a way of improving it before taking it to FAC. While I believe that sources and scope are a strong point of the article, I know that my prose is far from being as professional as it should. Any kind of comments or copy-editing would be most useful. A commited reviewer would also be great, since the article is quite long. Thanks to everybody.--Garrondo (talk) 18:57, 3 November 2010 (UTC)
I was also thinking of an image for the symptoms section, and I thought of a writting by a PD patient with micrography.

Other articles in search of a reviewer at  are:

* Protein C (blood clotting and inflammation)
* Haplogroup E1b1a (Y-DNA) (looks a bit technical and list-y)
So we need just four people who can read , and follow .  GA reviews aren't difficult, and if anyone is at all nervous about trying it out for the first time, then I'd be happy to help you learn the ropes.

Sometimes in cases like this, it's worth stubbing the article down and starting fresh from whatever independent, reliable sources exist. I'm saying that without having looked at the disputed content in detail, though, so it's just a general observation. MastCell Talk 20:00, 5 November 2010 (UTC)
I agree that improving problematic article usually involves a complete rewrite. Actually, I've twice given this article an overhaul over the years I've been watch in it.

Regardless, the current version is unacceptable and I don't revert more than once. Colin°Talk 10:38, 6 November 2010 (UTC)

Looking for a good example

At Disease#Burdens_of_disease, I'd like to have a good example of disease burden that separates the economic costs from the estimated market value of years lost.  That is, I'd like to be able to say that  costs $X (cash) plus Y years lived with disability plus Z years of potential life lost, rather than a single number.  That is, I want &quot;Tobacco costs the world $10 billion cash, plus 10 million person-years of disabled life, plus 20 million person-years of potential life lost, not &quot;Tobacco costs the world US$100 billion a year&quot;.

I don't really care what the medical issue is, but I've never run across a source that is straightforward and reasonably accessible, which I think is preferable for this article. 

If you've got a good source, please feel free to add it directly into the first paragraph at the above-linked section.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 00:49, 6 November 2010 (UTC)
 In this moment I do not have full access to the article, but in  reviews different studies which quantify disease burden of Parkinson's disease, and I think that at some point it separates direct and indirect costs similarly to what you look for.

&quot;Chronic&quot; Lyme disease controversy

In this section

* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Lyme_disease#The_word_.22chronic.22_should_not_be_in_quotes

I have provided why I restored the scare quotes, but they have been removed. We need medical experts, besides myself, to look into this. Please see my comments there and the article's edit history. -- Brangifer (talk) 06:47, 10 November 2010 (UTC)

 BTW, I'm not accusing the other editors of willingly promoting this medical scam and quackery. They are likely ignorant of the controversy over this matter. -- Brangifer (talk) 06:48, 10 November 2010 (UTC)

From reading over the article, it looks like the dominant view is that untreated lyme disease infection can be chronic. The fringey belief is claiming that the infection can remain chronic despite an adequate course(s) of antibiotics which the causative organism is sensitive to and the even more fringey and harmful belief is that people need to be on chronic antibiotics. I have no opinion on whether the quotes should be used as I don't know what the terms are used in the peer reviewed literature. I read the talk area and my advice is that you be more tactful when talking to some people on there. Presumably some of them have long-term &quot;injury&quot;, a post infection syndrome of some sort and unfortunately have a belief in &quot;bad science&quot;. Calling their belief a &quot;criminal opinion&quot; when some editors on that talk page may have lyme disease related disability, is only going to stir up a big hornet's nest which no or few uninvolved editors will want to go near.--Literaturegeek | T@1k? 08:25, 10 November 2010 (UTC)

 Thanks for catching that poorly worded phrase. I have fixed it. When I use the word &quot;criminal&quot;, I am referring to those who are earning a livlihood by passing off substandard and ineffective treatments as if they were &quot;cutting edge&quot;, a phrase sometimes used by those who push treatment of &quot;chronic lyme disease&quot;. Occasionally they are prosecuted and lose their medical licenses, but far too many are practicing, placing people's health and livlihood at risk, since untreated lyme disease is no laughing matter and bleeding people of their last dime for ineffective &quot;alternative&quot; remedies is so wrong in so many ways.

 &quot;Untreated&quot; is really the proper term, because the treatment these people receive isn't proper treatment, leading to them just continuing to have the disease and suffer its ravages of their health. -- Brangifer (talk) 15:35, 10 November 2010 (UTC)

Mostly agree with what you write, a few points:
* untreated lyme disease: here is one problem - perhaps 80-90% of infections are not noticed in acute stage and never adequately treated. Even though largely asymptomatic this is not enough to exclude a chronic course. Hence if untreated lyme can cause chronic lyme it is not unrealistic to assume a significant number of cases. Diagnosis of chronic cases, presumably becoming symptomatic several months or more likely a few years after first event practically never happens.
* chronic lyme disease is poorly understood - just like acute lyme disease. There are rather confusing results of microbiological testing during diagnosis and treatment of all kinds of lyme disease.
* adequate treatment is very poorly evaluated by controlled trials. We do not know what the best treatment of acute lyme disease is and how effective it is.
I would remove the quotes and treat all kinds of chronic antibiotics with great scepticism. Richiez (talk) 10:11, 10 November 2010 (UTC)

 I'm not sure what your last line really means. Would you please tweak the grammar? -- Brangifer (talk) 15:35, 10 November 2010 (UTC)
* Some reliable sources use scare quotes to emphasize the dubious nature of &quot;chronic&quot; Lyme disease (e.g. , from the New England Journal of Medicine). Other reliable sources don't use scare quotes. I lean towards not using quotes, because I think that's the more encyclopedic choice. I'm mostly concerned with how we present mainstream medical and scientific thought on the subject, and honestly I don't think it's worth fighting about the quotation marks one way or the other.

See the tool's wiki page, [http://toolserver.org/~svick/CleanupListing/CleanupListing.php?project=Medicine this project's listing in one big table] or [http://toolserver.org/~svick/CleanupListing/CleanupListingByCat.php?project=Medicine by categories] and [http://toolserver.org/~svick/CleanupListing/Index.php the index of WikiProjects]. Svick (talk) 20:54, 7 November 2010 (UTC)


People interested in cleaning up these articles should click [http://toolserver.org/~svick/CleanupListing/CleanupListing.php?project=Medicine here] for the list (large sortable table) and [http://toolserver.org/~svick/CleanupListing/CleanupListingByCat.php?project=Medicine here] for the list divided by type of problem.  So if, for example, you wanted to have a look at the 1600 (allegedly) unreferenced articles, then you'd click [http://toolserver.org/~svick/CleanupListing/CleanupListingByCat.php?project=Medicine#Articles%20lacking%20sources here] to go to that subsection of the second page. 
The previous /Cleanup listing pages haven't been updated since March, so perhaps these should replace those links.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 23:01, 7 November 2010 (UTC)

BTW, I've been going through the allegedly unreferenced articles, and I'm finding that almost a quarter of them shouldn't have the  tag.  A lot of times, it's because the tag was added years ago and nobody thought to remove it, but sometimes it shouldn't have been added in the first place.
&quot;Unreferenced&quot; is only appropriate if there are actually zero sources mentioned, in any form, anywhere on the page.  It's not a substitute for  (=sources named at the bottom, but we'd like them inline, please) or  (=something better than the subject's website would be nice, please) or  (=we'd like more sources, please).  
It looks like the bot will update the list over the weekend, so if you've got a little time, please feel free to have a look at these articles, and remove the templates from anything that actually contains some sort of reference.  (I've done almost all of the articles starting with A and B, and hope to do C tomorrow.)  WhatamIdoing (talk) 04:13, 11 November 2010 (UTC)

How is the word autism used today?

I'm concerned about the clarity of the lead at Autism. It says only that autism is one of the autism spectrum disorders, but under Autism#Classification the article explains that &quot;autism&quot; can also refer to the spectrum conditions in general.

Male lactation

The article male lactation could do with a few more competent eyes. It is getting a lot of attention from people who either think every man can lactate with a bit of manual stimulation, or that it's completely impossible except in transsexuals. If I read the sources correctly, the truth is somewhere in between. Sourcing could generally be improved. For such an attractive edutainment topic as galactorhhea in human males it would be good to have more than one research paper to be on the safe side. E.g., can someone locate a research article about lactation in starving males?

There is also significant overlap between male lactation and galactorrhea, with the first article concentrating on males and the second on humans. Maybe they could be merged? In any case it would be nice if an expert could have a look and clarify the relation between the two articles. Hans Adler 16:22, 13 November 2010 (UTC)

 There is way too many articles about breastfeeding, lactation and related subjects:(. Richiez (talk) 16:59, 14 November 2010 (UTC)
Richiez, your claim seems implausible unless both of the following are true:
- A large number of WP editors are fascinated by breasts
- Editors allow their fascinations to distort judgment regarding the value of content on WP
Now, do you want to retract your claim?  Oh, and don't even think about citing facts from reliable sources to counter my concerns. -- Scray (talk) 20:19, 14 November 2010 (UTC)
Quick Pubmed/Ovid search yielded very few results specifically discussing lactation in males; resuls were mostly in relation to galactorrhea in general with some discussion in their about males.  Probably should merge the two articles. Yobol (talk) 20:57, 14 November 2010 (UTC)

I realize that Scray's comments were meant in jest, but if anyone has a use for such a source, James Olson's Bathsheba's Breast  discusses the pop culture &quot;breast obsession&quot; in America after about WWII.  I've got a copy in hand for Breast cancer awareness at the moment, but it's also searchable on Google Books.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 04:14, 15 November 2010 (UTC)

I think fascination of some people is taking this article far from reality.... one can see by reading MALE PREGNANCY IN HUMANS, that some people (I don't know why) are trying to make or you can say INVENT MEDICAL TERMS of their own. False claims from Hoax web-sites should not be a part of a genuine encyclopedia. Medical Terms should be noted as they are noted by professionals not mere stories written by some bloggers irrelevant to the field. I am a general medicine resident and will be appearing for step exam later....I will be very busy for a while...so can't help on this article for sometime. Please relevant people from medicine and related disciplines should come forward and address this situation and mend such articles so that they appear as informative yet concise as they appear in our medical encyclopedias and medical literature. I again say that GOSSIPS and material from unauthentic, hoax web-sites must not be taken! Thanks and peace be to all! §kam§ (talk) 10:16, 15 November 2010 (UTC)
Furthermore does any one from MEDICINE heard ECTOPIC PREGNANCY IN HUMAN MALES. The answer will obviously be NO. Even in human females, implantation of an embryo in abdominal cavity is never attempted,...because it will result in the death of such female..the embryo can not survive the harsh environment of abdominal cavity especially due to the ph AND OTHER FACTORS(environment in uterus is different). Then WHY INVENTING WORDS (these terms one can not find in medical encyclopedias) that damage reputation of wikipedia. Similarly We won't find term TEST TUBE PREGNANCY instead of TEST TUBE BABIES in medical literature (exception is hoax web-sites). ALL I WANT TO SAY IS BE CONCISE AND RELATE ONLY MEDICAL TERMS, ALSO SAY A BIG NO TO LINKING UNAUTHENTIC AND MEDICALLY INAPPROPRIATE SOURCES TO MEDICAL TERMS. §kam§ (talk) 10:29, 15 November 2010 (UTC)

It is not easy to discuss male lactation without a definition. Does the lead sentence of lactation look correct to everyone? What is the difference to breastfeeding or nursing? For me the difference is mostly human vs non-human and lactation does not necessarily say &quot;providing that milk to the young&quot;. Richiez (talk) 23:15, 15 November 2010 (UTC)

Male lactation is not the word used in major medical encyclopedias and literature BECAUSE it is not a NORMAL PHYSIOLOGY in HUMAN MALES.......it is infact an abnormal functioning.....THE PROPER WORD FOR THIS IS &quot;Galactorrhea&quot; (Everyone will find this word in Medical encyclopedias and is the word referred to: 1:milk production in some new-born-witch's milk, 2:and in humans with metabolic disorder-as was the case with POWs-starvation is accompanied by metabolic liver disorder (here point should be noted: only some POWs develop this abnormality and their number as compared to others was very less), 3:AND due to some other DISEASES (PITUITARY CANCER etc.) and SYNDROMES (For example: Klinefelter Syndrome etc. are major ones); This CONDITION is so rare, only found in some hand-full of people with such disorders, BUT is present in medical literature). Also being concise is the key in making good articles that are medically correct, otherwise the article with inappropriate and unauthentic citations goes far from reality. Thank you very much. Well at the end I would like to say Its very hard job to maintain an encylcopedia ( especially where everyone, relevant or irrelevant to the field) is allowed to make and edit articles. Thanks again and a big clap to everyone who have strove hard for converting weak and scientifically poor articles into competent ones. PEACE BE TO ALL.§kam§ (talk) 07:56, 16 November 2010 (UTC)

One of the many things that you are obviously missing is that Wikipedia is not just a medical encyclopedia. It may sound bizarre to you, but it also happens to be a general encyclopedia on the side. You would never find entries on topics such as pipe organ, cuckoo clock or even Green Knight in a medical encyclopedia, yet here they are perfectly legitimate. Whether we should have a separate male lactation article or not is a perfectly legitimate question that needs to be discussed. But you are not contributing to this discussion. You are just generating noise.
And please, please, read  and observe that you are the only person on this page using that particular technique. Maybe that's because you are so much more knowledgeable and intelligent than everybody else here? Hans Adler 09:26, 16 November 2010 (UTC)

Whatever you are trying to prove,(I don't know), But one thing I know for certain is that wether it a medical encyclopedia or a general encyclopedia....majority of people here would agree that articles should have authentic sources otherwise no irrelevant source be cited and Medical terms be used as such.Thanks §kam§ (talk) 10:40, 16 November 2010 (UTC)

Let's look at the related articles in context:
* mammary gland (mammals, biology) / breast (humans, culture, medicine)
* milk (mammals, biology, agriculture, food) / breast milk (humans, culture, medicine)
* lactation (humans, medicine) / breast feeding (humans, culture, medicine)
* male lactation (mammals/humans, culture, medicine) / galactorrhea (human, medicine) [includes neonatal milk]
* nipple discharge (human, medicine)
* prolactinoma (human, medicine); galactogogue (human, medicine)
I think the separation in the first two items makes sense: A general biology article about mammals, and a specific human article with cultural and medical aspects. Perhaps we can follow the same pattern for the third and fourth article? This would entail the following:
* Generalise lactation so that it deals with mammals in general. (That would be a job for  or .) Move the human medicine stuff to breast feeding, where mothers are more likely to read it.
* Generalise male lactation so that it deals with atypical or abnormal lactation in mammals of both sexes; move the specific material about human male lactation and its cultural context to galactorrhea. Any ideas for a name for the resulting article? Hans Adler 09:58, 16 November 2010 (UTC)
This is an excellent framework!  Non-trivial milk production by humans (male or female) outside the normal physiology is &quot;galactorrhea&quot;.  Thus, I would support a simple redirect from &quot;male lactation&quot; to galactorrhea.  -- Scray (talk) 10:11, 16 November 2010 (UTC)
Well there are some complications:
* According to male lactation, male lactation does occur, with its usual function in reproduction, in Dayak fruit bats and goats -- although I have not checked the sources. Together with neonatal milk in mammals (assuming it occurs in non-humans) and lactation-like phenomena in non-mammals this would be enough material for an article about non-standard lactation. That's why I would not simply merge the article into galactorrhea. Prolactinomas, galactogogues and prolonging the nursing period (e.g. in humans and in cows) could also be covered there.
* It's not OK to simply suppress the cultural material around male lactation. There is a tendency for primarily medical articles to censor non-medical content, but that's only acceptable if the non-medical content is covered elsewhere. The phenomenon of men trying to breastfeed is widely reported, whether it exists or not. That makes it notable, and Wikipedia is where readers expect to find accurate information that puts it into the correct context. Hans Adler 10:56, 16 November 2010 (UTC)
If the consensus in reliable sources is to apply the term &quot;male lactation&quot; to humans, then I agree.  If, as is my sense, &quot;male lactation&quot; is used in the context of other mammals and human male lactation is generally referred to as &quot;galactorrhea&quot;, then we need to respect that distinction.  I have a fair amount of experience in health-related matters, but I resist editing on the basis of my own opinions and I'll defer to the preponderance of evidence (which I have not recently reviewed).  -- Scray (talk) 13:19, 16 November 2010 (UTC)
I am personally not worried at all about the terminology so long as the information is organised sensibly. Please don't interpret anything I have written as insisting on a specific term. I don't know what the consensus in reliable sources is. I guess that depends on what kind of sources we read -- scientific papers, popular science, or newspapers/magazines. Hans Adler 13:50, 16 November 2010 (UTC)

I agree with sacry. Wether it a medical encyclopedia or a general encyclopedia....majority of people here would agree that articles should have authentic sources otherwise no irrelevant source be cited and Medical terms be used as such. Galactorrhea is the correct term....now &quot;Hans alder&quot; is offensive to medical articles by saying that &quot;There is a tendency for primarily medical articles to censor non-medical content&quot;. Its only Hans alder who says that. Millions of people and medical doctors and medical educationists are using medical articles from text-books and medical encyclopedias. Such medical articles and terms are correct and authentic in nature because they don't contain incorrect sources. Who has given you the authority to over-ride these medical terms. If I would have enough time, I would certainly went to legitimate People here on Wikipedia (related to medicine) and report the whole case. Thanks §kam§

&quot;Authentic sources&quot; is not a technical term on Wikipedia, and I have no idea what it means. But it does seem to exclude articles in Scientific American [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Male_lactation&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=396897876&amp;oldid=396891308], so I am very concerned. By the way, that edit has not been reverted yet, and since the IP is edit warring about it I think it would be ideal if an admin with a professional medical background did that, along with a warning. Hans Adler 11:07, 16 November 2010 (UTC)
The IP has changed the post above since I responded [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AWikiProject_Medicine&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=397083052&amp;oldid=397082712], and is once more demonstrating a lack of reading comprehension. It's simply not reasonable to misunderstand &quot;medical article&quot; in the sentence in question (&quot;There is a tendency for primarily medical articles to censor non-medical content, but that's only acceptable if the non-medical content is covered elsewhere.&quot;) as anything but medical articles in Wikipedia. Surely this jumping to conclusions about sources and me and then writing lengthy attacks about supposed incompetence has been going on on the talk page for long enough. Can an admin step in, please. Recently the IP has shown rudimentary signs of learning (such as finally ceasing the shouting), but the rate of this learning process is still not satisfactory. Hans Adler 11:25, 16 November 2010 (UTC)

Yes, we do sometimes see social issues suppressed—just like some articles about social issues suppress medical issues—and we don't want either of those things to happen.  In this case, perhaps men's efforts to breastfeed should go into a section on
Deliberate induction
in Galactorrhea. 
I'm not sure about the proposed division.  Shouldn't abnormal lactation of either sex be covered in Lactation, rather than in a separate article named Male lactation?  I'm also a little concerned about Galactorrhea inadvertently turning into abnormal male human lactation, rather than abnormal human lactation, which affects both males and females.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 19:30, 16 November 2010 (UTC)

I would prefer to keep changes and controversy contained in male lactation else we could end up adding a section &quot;male breastfeeding&quot; to breastfeeding. Is there any evidence of the term &quot;male lactation&quot; in pop culture? I am sceptical - http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=male%20lactation . If there isnt anything then we should create an article &quot;male pregnancy fantasies and associated psychologic conditions&quot; and treat it there. Richiez (talk) 20:52, 16 November 2010 (UTC)

Vocabulary quiz

Consider untreated, advanced breast cancer (e.g., in the medieval era):

The tumor eventually outgrows its blood supply, and the center necroses.  A natural hole may form in the skin so that the putrid fluid can drain out of the body.  Is this a fistula, or is there a more specific term?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:31, 17 November 2010 (UTC)
 Ulcer? --WS (talk) 17:03, 17 November 2010 (UTC)
You're thinking of fungating. MastCell Talk 17:52, 17 November 2010 (UTC)
Wouldn't the hole/tract be more of a fistula, though?  I associate &quot;fungating&quot; more with the type of tumor/wound that is heaped up and breaks up through the skin, looking like a mushroom (thus &quot;fung&quot;-ating).Yobol (talk) 18:42, 17 November 2010 (UTC)
True, I suppose that to be precise, the lesion would be described as &quot;fungating&quot; while the drainage tract itself might be described as a &quot;fistula&quot;, although I think &quot;sinus&quot; might be a more appropriate term. A fistula is typically a connection between two enclosed, epithelialized cavities, while a sinus is a tract that drains from an internal cavity to the surface. MastCell Talk 19:25, 17 November 2010 (UTC)
Ulcer is the right term.  A fistula, by definition, connects two epithelium-lined cavities.  A sinus tract is a connection to the skin that is longer than it is wide.  A &quot;fungating lesion&quot; is a higher-level structure consisting of the mass and overlying changes on the ulcerating surface.  -- Scray (talk) 19:29, 17 November 2010 (UTC)
I did not know that a sinus had to have length &gt; width. Learn something new every day. :) Actually, most days here I just become slightly more pessimistic about humanity in general, but today I learned something new. :) MastCell Talk 20:21, 17 November 2010 (UTC)
The sinus is used in normal breast anatomy so there might be opportunity for confusion and there is also lactiferous fistula which develops when something goes wrong in that sinus. Necrosing tumor might be comedocarcinoma but unless it is specific ulcer is probably the most accurate term. Richiez (talk) 20:44, 17 November 2010 (UTC)

There is no audible difference between &quot;Down's syndrome&quot; and &quot;Down syndrome&quot;, hence Americans, who like to drop letters they find no use for, have eliminated the possessive. The same cannot be said for &quot;Parkinson's disease&quot; or &quot;Alzheimer's disease&quot;. I feel the author of that article might as well argue for consistency in the pronunciation of &quot;ough&quot;. Language is inconsistent. Deal with it. Google does. Colin°Talk 22:48, 22 November 2010 (UTC)
Did you read the cited articles?  The argument for the possessive form is not compelling, whereas we have cogent published arguments for the non-possessive.  How many people know whether the namesake for hyperthyroidism was named Grave or Graves?  A redirect for one of the possessives, Graves' disease or Grave's disease, is evidence of this confusion.  When the possessive of an eponym ending in &quot;s&quot; is used, one cannot tell from hearing, and misspellings leave one in doubt.  If the non-possessive form is used, the proper spelling is clear.  I don't know of a prominent expert arguing in a peer-reviewed publication for retaining the possessive.  Let's not set this up as a conflict between British and American speakers, unless the literature says that's what it is.  -- Scray (talk) 01:44, 23 November 2010 (UTC)
I no of no wise expert arguing in a peer-reviewed publication that the tide should not come in, either. It is all a rather pointless debate. People will say and write what they want to.

 Apart from a few very specific exceptions, article titles are always singular. The current title is reasonable, as long as the synonyms are redirected to it. The only other possibility I might suggest would be to re-write the article to be about the activity (Athletic training or Athletic therapy), rather than the person. I suspect those would be just as liable to being misinterpreted as the current title though. --RexxS (talk) 23:35, 24 November 2010 (UTC)

Hydroxycut: request outside input

I'd like to request some outside input on . This is an article about a nutritional supplement which was linked to serious hepatotoxicity and death, and ultimately withdrawn from the market (although a &quot;new formulation&quot; has since reappeared). Reliable-source coverage has focused on serious adverse events caused by the supplement (Fong et al., 2010, ), dubious marketing and research practices by the manufacturer ([http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940CE2D6143BF930A15755C0A9659C8B63 New York Times 2003]), lax oversight of dietary supplements contributing to the harms caused by Hydroxycut ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2668789/?tool=pmcentrez Lobb 2009]), and FDA warnings about the product ([http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/30518843 Associated Press 2009], [http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm152152.htm U.S. FDA 2009]).

Vertebral artery dissection

On vertebral artery dissection I am having a dispute with various editors about a paper by Edzard Ernst about the complications of chiropractic. Two editors (BullRangifer and Quackguru) think I am being unfair about its methodological limitations, while one editor (VAPhD) wants it gone. Could others take a look and say what they think? JFW | T@lk 23:58, 30 November 2010 (UTC)

I thought it odd that JFW didn't specify a particular talk page section, so I went to take a look...  The discussion during the last week comprises 50K out of the 52K on the talk page.  There's a lot going on, and JFW needs help from several people here.  Please pitch in, even if it's just to give a thumbs up/thumbs down whether statements like these:  [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vertebral_artery_dissection&amp;diff=399280217&amp;oldid=399271302][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vertebral_artery_dissection&amp;diff=399265135&amp;oldid=399264757][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vertebral_artery_dissection&amp;diff=399073237&amp;oldid=398734958] based on  (might be a systematic review of bad data?) seem like a &quot; problem&quot;.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 01:45, 1 December 2010 (UTC)

 I don't intend to spend more time arguing about Ernst's 2010 paper () after the time I already spent on the topic at . The paper meets  in that it's recent, secondary, and a review (arguably systematic), published in IJCP. It carries all the authority of the editorial process of the IJCP, and it's not our place to introduce our our analysis of such a source - that's the job of the published literature, and if flaws emerge, they will be documented there. It is less relevant to VAD than to Chiropractic, but relevant nevertheless. It is true that Ernst is a controversial figure, but it is equally true that some chiropractors have a problem with his conclusions. The difference is that Ernst is published in top-quality publications, while rebuttals seem to have only been made on self-published websites, or parochial journals. In short, if I were to pitch in, it would be only to argue strongly for the inclusion of Ernst's conclusions from his 2010 study. --RexxS (talk) 02:28, 1 December 2010 (UTC)

Yes I agree should be included. But manipulation of the neck is still a minor cause of VAD. Therefor per  should be discussed in the body of the text not the lead IMO. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 02:45, 1 December 2010 (UTC)

We are already citing another paper from Ernst, and indeed I use it to source the objections from chiropractors. The 2010 paper does not add anything and is UNDUE. This has been my line, but I have the feeling that my arguments are falling on deaf ears, particularly with BullRangifer. JFW | T@lk 09:54, 1 December 2010 (UTC)

 The 2010 Ernst specifically examines deaths associated with CSM, while the 2007 review looks at all the adverse effects, so I don't agree it adds nothing. But even then, look at how the 2007 review is used: the review's conclusions are &quot;In the majority of cases, spinal manipulation was deemed to be the probable cause of the adverse effect&quot;, and the review is only used in the article to support &quot;the association is disputed by proponents of these treatment modalities&quot; - in other words, there's nothing in the article drawn from Ernst's actual conclusions! --RexxS (talk) 13:25, 1 December 2010 (UTC)

 RexxS is spot on. Jfdwolff, I'm not deaf, I just disagree and feel you're an immovable wall who isn't collaborating by accepting other's suggestions. This is a Wikipedia article we're writing, not a textbook. We must include many other types of details, both MEDRS and RS. Otherwise I value your skills and expertise. I've dealt with this subject for a couple decades now, as well as treated patients who have nearly died and still have deficits. It may not be the main cause, but a number of MEDRS sources refer to high cervical manipulation as a &quot;major cause&quot; and others a &quot;leading cause&quot; of VAD in those &quot;under 45&quot;.

 I'm only asking for mention of the vast (nearly 100%) underreporting problem. It's described in MEDRS and leaving it out leaves the reader with the false impression that the statistics you do include are somehow the whole story. They aren't. There is no WEIGHT problem because we're only talking about a sentence or two. -- Brangifer (talk) 17:00, 1 December 2010 (UTC)

I'm not sure where to jump in on the talk page, so I'll comment here. A detailed review of the chiropractic controversy doesn't really belong in vertebral artery dissection. It should be sufficient to say that chiropractic manipulation has been described as a cause of VAD, and that the exact incidence and risk are unclear because of (among other things) potential underreporting and the difficulty of establishing a cause-effect relationship with crappy data. It seems to me that we can do that in a couple of sentences, with good-quality MEDRS-compliant sources, but maybe I'm overlooking some of the subtleties. MastCell Talk 17:20, 1 December 2010 (UTC)

The evidence of underreporting is very circumstantial. We already have a statistic if 16-28% cases being due to chiropractic. JFW | T@lk 20:35, 1 December 2010 (UTC)

 Yes, we do have that statistic of &quot;reported&quot; cases. It's the tip of an iceberg.

 MastCell is pointing in the right direction. The evidence of underreporting is published in a MEDRS source. Speculations about &quot;circumstantial&quot; don't override its use. That's OR, or whatever else one wishes to call that policy violation. My concern is that risk and occurrence statistics are unreliable (and far too low) for several reasons, among them underreporting. -- Brangifer (talk) 22:01, 1 December 2010 (UTC)

Please see the relevant talk page discussion regarding that edit.  In response to a request for a critique of treatment techniques, you found one 2009 primary study which involved a survey of students at a chiropractic college, and the injuries they received as students (worked on by other students, presumably).  This is not a good study for the 'treatment techniques' section, or really for any section, due to its primary nature, its limited scope, its self-reported methodology, the non-representative sample of students who are being worked on repeatedly by non-professionals, and its generally limited relevance to broader issue of techniques; also, it belongs in the 'safety' section if at all.  I'll stop deleting your contributions when they follow the same standard of policy you reliably advocate. Ocaasi (talk) 09:49, 5 December 2010 (UTC)

This discussion here does not yield consensus in any form. There are unresolved issues on the talkpage that need to be addressed before consensus is likely to emerge. I have now summarised them for everyone's benefit.
Could I ask everyone who was prepared to offer their opinion here to respond to my post on the talkpage, so we can concentrate the viewpoints?

JFW | T@lk 10:46, 5 December 2010 (UTC)

Editors already gave their opinions here. You started this thread for opinions from uninvolved editors. Now that consensus is for including the reference you want to ignore consensus. It is essentially a  violation to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vertebral_artery_dissection&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=400638751&amp;oldid=400638163 delete] a recent systematic review. QuackGuru (talk) 21:47, 5 December 2010 (UTC)

Conflicted on this one, but I will give my opinion as a previously uninvolved editor (in this dispute anyway). I'm conflicted because following wikipedia's policies, we should include this reference (perhaps baalanced by the much higher quality bone &amp; joint decade 2010 reference).  On the other hand, this study is of such low quality, seems deceptively described as a systematic review, and is authored by someone with a (huge) known bias. For those interested in quality issues, see [http://www.chiroaccess.com/Articles/Death-by-Chiropractic-Another-Misbegotten-Review.aspx?id=0000190 this review] With such quality issues, I really feel we are not improving the quality of WP by including this work. DigitalC (talk) 01:56, 6 December 2010 (UTC)

Which policy actually mandates the inclusion of that study? JFW | T@lk 07:25, 6 December 2010 (UTC)
I'm guessing QG would argue that MEDRS and NPOV require us to mention the significant viewpoint and its status as a systematic review gives it all the weight it needs.  I'd argue that its uniqueness as a MEDRS source in this situation as well as its proportionate relevance to the VBA article are up for debate.  Ocaasi (talk) 08:21, 6 December 2010 (UTC)

MEDRS does not force the inclusion of anything. It simply sets standards for sources where there are multiple sources available. From a MEDRS perspective, the review shows that chiropractic has probably caused death, VAD being an important mechanism. It alludes to underreporting in the medical literature.
WEIGHT is a subsection of NPOV, and it does not demand that every viewpoint is included. This applies especially in extreme or marginal views. JFW | T@lk 15:24, 6 December 2010 (UTC)
 Indeed, JDW is correct about the relationship between MEDRS &amp; WEIGHT. The relevant section is Neutrality requires that each article or other page in the mainspace fairly represents all significant viewpoints that have been published by reliable sources, in proportion to the prominence of each viewpoint. However, it does say all significant viewpoints, so the base guidance is that if a viewpoint is relevant and published by reliable sources, then it should be included.  guides us on how we treat the viewpoints of minorities, and how much prominence we give them (if any). Unless the argument is being made that Ernst's conclusions represent a minority viewpoint in the published, reliable literature, it needs to be fairly represented as the majority viewpoint. The fact is that his conclusions are not of huge relevance to VAD, but that is not what WEIGHT is about. As long as CSM is described as a cause or risk factor for VAD in the reliable literature, the article remains incomplete without mentioning it. If consensus can be gained that the following fairly represents Ernst's conclusions, then there is no problem:
 Chiropractic and other forms of neck manipulation have been linked to vertebral artery dissection (16–28% of cases in hospital-based studies). Many of the reports have methodological flaws, and the association is disputed by proponents of these treatment modalities.

Personally, I feel it gives insufficient weight to the majority viewpoint and excess weight to minority viewpoints. YMMV. --RexxS (talk) 20:48, 6 December 2010 (UTC)

 I agree that MEDRS does not force its inclusion, however once someone has included it, I don't see that its reliability can be used to remove it, even though from original research it is a study of extremely low quality. Why? According to MEDRS it comes from a reliable source. I disagree that the study shows that chiropractic has probably caused death (this study can't show cause of anything, and another study has given a much more plausible explanation for the correlation). DigitalC (talk) 02:00, 8 December 2010 (UTC)
 On the contrary,  is a study of extremely high quality. It's published by IJCP with all the authority of their editorial and peer review processes. That's the benchmark of quality here, not personal dislike, amateur analysis, or suggestions of bias of the author. If its conclusions were to be contended in the reliable literature, you would have a point, but the best anyone has come up with so far is a self-published rant from a website called &quot;chiroaccess.com&quot; - a very long way short of a . From what I've read about the forces involved in CSM, I might guess that VAD should only be a consequence if a condition pre-existed, but until we see that exposition in a source comparable to IJCP, there's no place for such speculation in Wikipedia. --RexxS (talk) 03:11, 8 December 2010 (UTC)
 No, the study is of low quality. I agree that it is published by IJCP, and therefore according to WP:MEDRS we give it the authority of their editorial and peer review processes. However, the study is not a systematic review, yet portrays itself as one. It is in reality a simple case series. A proper systematic review would have included all relevant study on the topic, including the research from the Bone and Joint Decade Task Force, which found a similar association between stroke after seeing a chiropractor and stroke after seeing a GP. This was explained by patients with &quot;vertebrobasilar artery dissection-related neck pain or headache seeking care [either GP or DC] before having their stroke.&quot; The article on Chiroaccess.com should not be considered a self-published article anymore than something on medscape.com or webmd.com would be. Chiroaccess.com is a website for [http://www.healthindex.com/ HealthIndex Inc], the group that created MANTIS (literature database). Of course, the article on chiroaccess.com would also be considered reliable by SPS, as it is published by a published expert in the field, [http://scholar.google.ca/scholar?as_q=&amp;num=10&amp;btnG=Search+Scholar&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_sauthors=Anthony+Rosner&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;as_sdt=1.&amp;as_sdtp=on&amp;as_sdts=5&amp;hl=en Anthony Rosner]. DigitalC (talk) 03:59, 8 December 2010 (UTC)
 No the study is high quality, and it doesn't matter how often either of us opine on it. It's not just MEDRS, but  that guarantees that, because of the quality of the publication process of ICJP, and stating otherwise doesn't make it so. The review has a stated methodology, and it's not up to you to suggest other inclusion criteria. You state that the research by the Bone and Joint Decade Task Force (where's the link?) was on stroke, and - tempting as it may be - to suggest that their conclusions apply to CSM is blatant . Of course chiroaccess.com is self-published. It has no peer-review process or stated editorial policies and is run by chiropractors for chiropractors, and all the cautions in  apply. Finally, Google Scholar indexes pretty much anything; the search for AL Rosner that you link shows where he's been published - top results are: cited in &quot;The role of subluxation in chiropractic&quot; - Foundation for Chiropractic Education and Research; The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine; chiro.org. In fairness, he's had a paper in Seminars in oncology nursing and a letter published in Stroke, but nobody is seriously going to accept him as &quot;an established expert on the topic of the article whose work in the relevant field has previously been published by reliable third-party publications&quot;. --RexxS (talk) 04:44, 8 December 2010 (UTC)
  does not, and cannot comment on the quality of a study, it can only ensure that there is an editorial process. Just as wikipedia cares about verifiability and not truth, wikipedia's policies prevent us from actually looking at whether a study is high quality or not. Stating that the Bone and Joint Decade Task Force [http://journals.lww.com/spinejournal/Fulltext/2008/02151/The_Bone_and_Joint_Decade_2000_2010_Task_Force_on.4.aspx] conclusions apply to spinal manipulation is not OR. &quot;We found no evidence of excess risk of VBA stroke associated chiropractic care compared to primary care&quot;. A bias seems to show through when you then discount JACM, a peer-reviewed medical journal indexed in MEDLINE, CINAHL, and MANTIS, and miss that he has been published in other peer-reviewed journals such as JMPT, The Journal of Chiropractic Medicine, Chiropractic &amp; Osteopathy, and Pediatrics. DigitalC (talk) 19:18, 8 December 2010 (UTC)
It is a little more complicated than that as there is  to consider. :p--Literaturegeek | T@1k? 20:50, 8 December 2010 (UTC)
 That's exactly the point: a Wikipedian is not qualified to judge the quality of a source, so we rely on the published literature to make that judgement. Where's the RS that says  is &quot;extremely low quality&quot;? Thanks for the link to Bone and Joint Decade Task Force, but I don't see your quote anywhere. The only conclusion they make about chiropractic is a result from a study they conducted themselves - making it a primary source for that conclusion. Please note that  specifically warns against using primary sources to rebut the conclusions of secondary ones. You'd be better concentrating on what I'm saying, rather than leaping to accusations of bias, since I clearly stated top results when describing AL Rosner's publications in the relevant field. JACM is about computer science, not medicine. If you mean Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine, then I flatly deny that it's relevant to VAD - which is the relevant field here. Rosner may be an expert on vertebral subluxation, but he's about as expert on the causes of VAD as I am. --RexxS (talk) 21:38, 8 December 2010 (UTC)
Please point me in the direction of this consensus, and keep in mind that consensus can change. From the discussion that is currently going on, it certainly doesn't appear that there is consensus. The link I gave you for the Bone and Joint Decade Task for was one of many. In fact, here is another one, this time a secondary source that specifically mentions the primary source. This one is a &quot;best evidence synthesis&quot;[http://chiroqualnet.com/wp-content/uploads/Treatment_of_Neck_Pain__Noninvasive_Interventions_.16.pdf].&quot;Of specific concern are VBA strokes, which are extremely rare, but have been reported to be associated with chiropractic visits.20,54 However, the association between chiropractic visits (which frequently include cervical manipulation) and VBA stroke is similar to the association between physician visits and VBA stroke. This suggests that, on average, patients who seek chiropractic care for neck pain or headaches, and who then developed a VBA stroke may have actually been in the prodromal phase of a stroke when consulting the chiropractor; that is, the neck pain or headaches, which lead them to seek care were early symptoms of a VBA stroke.54/&quot; and &quot;because this increased risk is also seen in those seeking health care from their primary care physician, this association is likely due to patients with headache and neck pain from VBA dissection seeking care before their stroke.8,20&quot;. As for Rosner, some of his pulished works include topics such as etiology of cervical artery dissection, as well as adverse events associated with manipulation, as well as on Ernst's &quot;misrepresentation of the literature&quot;. If he isn't a reiable source in this field, I don't know who is. DigitalC (talk) 03:02, 9 December 2010 (UTC)
 People aren't reliable sources; relevant articles are. Nevertheless, I was quite impressed with [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2647091 Rosen's article on CAD], although he does conclude that &quot;Despite the many risk factors that have been proposed as possible causes of CAD, it is still unknown which of them actually predispose patients to CAD after cervical spine manipulation&quot;, which is pretty much what I thought. You'd be much better off using that, with the authority of J Chiropr Med, than to try to build a case for treating Rosen as an expert on VAD, just to be able to quote a website. --RexxS (talk) 19:02, 9 December 2010 (UTC)
 The thing is, I have never suggested quoting chiroaccess in the article. As originally posted, I am conflicted in including Ernst, because of the low quality of the study, despite the fact that it bills itself as a systematic review. I agree that we shouldn't use OR to determine whether a study is good or not, but we have Rosner, who is able to point out the many problems for us. As it stands, WP:MEDRS would have us cast doubt on any study NOT mentioned by Ernst's review, even though his review failed to catch much of the literature on VAD/SMT. DigitalC (talk) 19:13, 9 December 2010 (UTC)

The text was rewritten as suggested on the talk page and then was added to the appropriate section. A consensus formed from unvolved editors at this thread to include the systematic review but that was [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vertebral_artery_dissection&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=400910700&amp;oldid=400910411 ignored].

 Instead of always claiming there's a consensus and making edits before the discussion is finished, how about ASKING if there's a consensus first, and only then making an edit? -- Brangifer (talk) 20:50, 6 December 2010 (UTC)
I think that's good advice, Brangifer.
QuackGuru, I've noticed that on a large number of pages, you have asserted that a consensus exists, when every single other editor believes that the discussion remains unfinished.  Let me advise you to behave as if no consensus exists unless and until someone other than you has directly and unambiguously told you something like &quot;I believe we have a consensus to do ____ in this article&quot;.  Until then, I think your track record indicates that you would be wise to assume that your personal belief in the existence of a consensus is probably wrong.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 04:00, 7 December 2010 (UTC)

Suggest a break
Someone has proposed banning QuackGuru at .  I think it would be good for all of you to take a break from this particular dispute until that discussion is resolved one way or the other (usually 24 hours).   for resolving this content dispute:  it can easily wait until tomorrow.  Please consider working on something else for today, and getting back to this in a day or two, when there isn't a sword hanging over QG's head any longer.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 03:03, 9 December 2010 (UTC)

Can I also suggest that this thread here not be used to rehash the discussion over and over. I have already asked other contributors to post on  as well to discuss the reliability of &quot;Ernst-death&quot;. JFW | T@lk 06:45, 9 December 2010 (UTC)</segment>
