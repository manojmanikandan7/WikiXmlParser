 Possible error on arasympathetic_nervous_system|Parasympathetic Nervous System 

The arasympathetic_nervous_system|PNS article says the utonomic_nervous_system|ANS has three divisions, whereas the utonomic_nervous_system|ANS and ympathetic_nervous_system|SNS articles say there are only two. Is this an error? To the best of my knowledge the latter is true, but I am not a doctor and I would like somebody with the proper knowledge to make this correction.—The preceding ikipedia:Signatures|unsigned comment was added by ser:217.205.103.243|217.205.103.243 (ser talk:217.205.103.243|talk • pecial:Contributions/217.205.103.243|contribs)if:2|}| 2}|.

I think the problem is the relatively ambiguous categorization of the nteric nervous system, which seems to function with a degree of independence from the PNS despite vagal innervation. The wording should be changed to reflect this relationship in the articles. Opinions, anyone else? -- ser:Scientizzle|Scientizzle 16:42, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

I would have said that the autonomic nervous system has two subdivisions only - the parasympathetic and the sympathetic - which have usually, although not always, opposing functions within the organism. We might here trip over differences in nomenclature between USA and UK usage; in the UK the concept of a separate enteric nervous system is not recognised, the sympathetic/parasympathetic systems being regarded as all-embracing. --ser:Anthony.bradbury|Anthony.bradbury 16:54, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

I think Dr. Bradbury may be onto something. ervous_system#Vertebrates shows three divisions of the utonomic nervous system; utonomic_nervous_system#Motor_neurons explains that the nteric nervous system is the &quot;is the only truly autonomous part of the ANS&quot;, sometimes called the &quot;the second brain&quot;; arasympathetic nervous system, ympathetic nervous system, &amp; eripheral nervous system don't link to the ENS article, &amp; don't really discuss this. I stick to the brain in my research, so I've no strong opinions on the peripheral stuff...How common is it to refer to the ENS as an independent part of the ANS? Looks like we need a neurogastroenterologist in here, stat! -- ser:Scientizzle|Scientizzle 18:44, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

I have read nteric nervous system, and do not agree with it. The point made therein that the &quot;enteric nervous system&quot; continues to function in the adsence of connection to higher centres is quite true, but fails to note the fact that the very same applies to the sympathetic system. Calling ganglia associated weith this system an autonomous nervous system also makes no sense, when we consider that there are a large number of ganglia, wholly indistinguishable in form which have very clear sympathetic system functions. Also, the agus nerve, for instance which is ther tenth cranial nerve, and which ennervates the stomach among other things, has pure parasympathetic functions therein. Is there such a spciality as a neurogastroenterologist? If so, bring one on, but bear in mind that you will get one answer from an American and another from a Brit.--ser:Anthony.bradbury|Anthony.bradbury 21:55, 26 March 2007 (UTC)
&quot;Neurogastroenterologist&quot; looks like a real term, just not widely used (no doubt partially because it's 9 syllables).[http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=neurogastroenterologist] As I said, I've no strong inclination as to what's &quot;right&quot; here, and the neural physiology of the gut is out of my area of expertise...[http://www.springerlink.com/content/f1rl017k71324607/fulltext.pdf This paper] describes the ENS thusly:
The vertebrate ENS is made up of an extrinsic and intrinsic component. The extrinsic component consists of a parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions. The parasympathetic innervation via the vagus nerves controls the motor and secretomotor function of the upper gastrointestinal tract, and via the sacral nerves regulates the functions of the distal colon and rectum. The sympathetic adrenergic fibres from the prevertebral ganglia are responsible for secretomotor neurons containing vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, presynaptic cholinergic nerve endings, submucosal blood vessels, and the sphincters of the gastrointestinal tract. The intrinsic component consists of myenteric plexus (Auerbach’s plexus) that is seen between the inner circular and outer longitudinal muscle layers, and two layers of submucous plexuses. The outer submucous plexus (Schabadasch’s plexus) is seen adjacent to the circular muscle layer and the inner submucous plexus (Meissner’s plexus) is seen close to the muscularis mucosae. The myenteric plexus primarily provides motor innervation to the two muscle layers and secretomotor innervation to the mucosa. The submucous plexuses innervate the muscularis mucosa, intestinal neuroendocrine cells, glandular epithelium and submucosal blood vessels.
That the ENS has both sympathetic &amp; parasympatheic input as well as its own autopilot does make it hard to categorize...Frankly, I glaze over when talking of the peripheral nervous system. :) I'll support any valid plan to rectify the existence of two or three autonomic nervous systems--I'd just like to see all our articles agree on the subject. -- ser:Scientizzle|Scientizzle 23:21, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

In the UK the various plexuses in the bowel wall are all seen as parts of either the sympathetic or the parasympathetic systems. I am absolutely not going to argue at all, but as I say above we have a situation here where there is a difference of nomenclature and perception on the two sides of the Atlantic. I would suggest that we might think about extending P:POLICY as it applies to UK/US spellings, and recognise that what is correct here is wrong there, and vice versa. In other words, whoever writes it, if it is otherwise a good article, leave it alone, but consider adding (USA) or (UK) where appropriate.--ser:Anthony.bradbury|Anthony.bradbury 17:19, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

 Peer review request - un violence in the United States 

Lately, I have been working on criminology topics which is an area that Wikipedia sorely lacks. Often this topic is interdisciplinary and involves public health and medicine, as is the case here.  Last weekend, I discovered there was no article on &quot;Gun violence&quot;, so started one. Most of the research literature pertains to the United States, so the article has become Gun violence in the United States. Obviously, people have strong POV on this topic. To try and rise above politics, I have only included the highest quality reliable sources (mainly peer reviewed, scholarly journals, many from public health). Personally, I really don't have a POV on this topic, and am staying out of the un politics in the United States article.  With the gun violence article, I have stayed with presenting the current state of research on this topic. I think is close to featured status, though some &quot;gun rights&quot; folks have already come along and place a neutrality tag on the article. I could really use some peer review on the article, at this point. Do you at all agree with the person who placed the neutrality tag? Any suggestions on making in more NPOV.  In reality, I feel that the article deals fairly with both POVs, citing strategies advocated by gun-control folks as ineffective, while citing some strategies advocated by the Bush administration as effective.  Do you have any suggestions on improving the article? are there aspects of the topic that are missing? Any help would be greatly appreciated. I have filed a formal peer request ikipedia:Peer review/Gun violence in the United States/archive1|here, though feel free to leave comments on the article talk page if you prefer. Thanks. --ser:AudeVivere|Aude (ser talk:AudeVivere|talk) 19:02, 10 November 2006 (UTC)

 Please review merge proposal for ickets and steomalacia 

Hi there. I've proposed a merge of ickets and steomalacia. I do not have a medical background, so this merge may be incorrect, but I was prompted to propose it because the Rickets article currently starts &quot;Osteomalacia, also known as rickets&quot; and I was surprised that steomalacia has its own article. I actually bolded Osteomalacia in the lead of the Rickets article before realizing this; it was previously normal text. ser talk:Mike Dillon|Mike Dillon 03:48, 17 November 2006 (UTC)

After reviewing the history more thoroughly, it looks like the change from ickets to steomalacia was a copy-and-paste move done by ser|JSpudeman on anuary 5, 006. ickets then seems to have been recreated out of thin air on eptember 12, 006 by ser|59.93.2.156 (with all sorts of spelling and character encoding issues)...

 Medical equipment articles guidelines 

Currently, Project Medicine has some guidelines on the writing of articles on drugs and diseases: what infoboxes to use, what sections to have, etc. I was wondering whether it would be helpful to develop similar guidelines for medical equipment articles. I tried looking into the list of featured articles, as well as A-class ones, and saw none on medical equipment, so I couldn't infer it from there.

 Veterinary medicine 

I'm not sure if I should post this here or at the clinical medicine wikiproject.  Following a discussion at alk:List of dog diseases, it's become clear that we need to decide whether to always have a separate article for the veterinary aspects of a disease, or if this can be tacked on to the main article (compare ymphoma in animals or erebellar hypoplasia (non-human) to ryptorchidism or left).  While there are a lot of diseases exclusive to vet med, such as seudorabies or ollie eye anomaly, there are many more that affect both humans and animals.  What's the best way to approach this?  I suspect that there is not always going to be a definite way to do this, but a general guideline would be great.  I know the ideal thing to do would be to set up a wikiproject for vet med, but that's more than I can do at this point.  --ser:Joelmills|Joelmills 02:55, 24 November 2006 (UTC)
Actually, I think maybe the best way to go would be to create a work group within the Medicine project dealing specifically with veterniary medicine. That way the new group could take advantage of the existing project's structure, and the lack of formal separation of the two groups would make cooperation between the two units easier. I could set up a work group, sub-project page for this purpose if there was agreement to the creation of it. ser:Badbilltucker|Badbilltucker 17:48, 3 December 2006 (UTC)
I think that's a great idea, but I'm worried about how many people would participate.  There are only three vets that I know of that regularly participate in editing, including myself, and two of those specialize in certain areas.  However, if you feel it's worth trying, let's do it.  What's your opinion on my original question?  --ser:Joelmills|Joelmills 03:51, 5 December 2006 (UTC)
Two responses. (1) Right now I'm kinda busy updating the Project Directory, but I will try to add a proposed project on veterinary medicine on the Wikipedia:WikiProject Council/Proposals page and drop messages on the talk pages of many of the Tree of Life projects about the new project. (2) This I know a LOT less about. My personal opinion would be to maybe, to eliminate redundancy, make separate pages only for those diseases which manifest much differently, either in symptoms, frequency, treatment, or other factors, between the various species. For the other diseases which are kind of standard across genetic lines, maybe only one page with perhaps different sections of the page relating to the different manifestations. orneal ulcer might (I stress, might) be an example of this sort of case in which one article for all the species might do. One of the things I think most all projects want to do is bring as many articles up to good- or featured-article status as possible. Consolidation of these articles might help make more of these articles eligible for a coveted status. ser:Badbilltucker|Badbilltucker 21:31, 6 December 2006 (UTC)

 Wikiproject Pharmacology 

While looking for information on harmacology I found that Wikipedia was woefully lacking - just look at the article - with lots of stub articles lacking essential information in the Pharmacology Catergory. As I am sure the member of this project know the understanding of human pharmacology is the basis for most of modern medicine, as well as to some extent surgery and of course herbal medicine. Without understanding pharmacology - non-infective pathophysiology makes little sense.

So what I propose is to make a Wikiproject Pharmacology as a sub if this main project. 

Is this a good idea? Are people willing to help? Your thoughts please. Cheers ser:Lethaniol|Lethaniol 15:07, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

Yes and that is strange is it not - that there is a category for Pharmacology (am already working on sorting it out) but it is not associated with any Wikiproject. The problem with being part of Wikiproject:Drugs is that really drugs should be part of a Pharmacology Project not the other way round - not that am adverse to the suggestion I just thought Pharmacology would fit better as a subproject under Medicine. Pharmacology incorporates more of a meta view of drugs and systems - explaining how they work. ser:Lethaniol|Lethaniol 13:04, 1 December 2006 (UTC)

 Wikipedia Day Awards 

Hello, all. It was initially my hope to try to have this done as part of ikipedia:Esperanza|Esperanza's proposal for an appreciation week to end on Wikipedia Day, January 15. However, several people have once again proposed the entirety of Esperanza for deletion, so that might not work. It was the intention of the Appreciation Week proposal to set aside a given time when the various individuals who have made significant, valuable contributions to the encyclopedia would be recognized and honored. I believe that, with some effort, this could still be done. My proposal is to, with luck, try to organize the various WikiProjects and other entities of wikipedia to take part in a larger celebrartion of its contributors to take place in January, probably beginning January 15, 2007.

 A Problem 

I have just determined to become active in the project, having been a practising physician for some 39 years, and having been nearly one year on wikipedia. 

A problem. A very high percentage of medicine-stubs, which I am wholly competent to expand, carry a l|Unreferenced tag. When I want to write something which I have known for 20-30-40 years, I can't quote references. I would like to write &quot;personal experience&quot;, but that sounds very like a breach of P:OR. How do I make a reference for something that i have always known?--ser:Anthony.bradbury|Anthony.bradbury 22:22, 14 January 2007 (UTC)

Indeed a problem on many levels:
# It is essential to P:Cite in order that others may P:Verify. Whether what is claimed in the citation is true or not is not up to wikipedia to decide (nor indeed as you correctly point out one persons P:OR), that is the point of citing from P:Reliable sources - it is the peer-reviewed journals' job to vet the information printed, wikipedia is merely reporting and summarising on this material.
# It is not possible within wikipedia's current structure to verify that you are whom you claim to be or to therefore have the experience and knowledge base either. Similarly I claim to be a UK based GP, but unless I were to meet up with another editor and show both my passport and GMC certificate, this can only be taken on trust (P:Assume good faith). So experts are welcome, but they need to be able to cite material everyone else can access to confirm details.
# Finally not all expert knowledge is correct. Medical science progresses and treatment approaches change. I recall well the dose of diazepam to give in impending eclamptic seizures and then the infusion rate of phenytoin, problem is that 6 months after I completed my Obs&amp;Gynae SHO post, a better treatment of agnesium sulphate injection was introduced. Similarly pidural analgesia used to confine a pregnant women to bed with essentially paralysed legs, now low-dose combination drugs allows for &quot;mobile epidurals&quot; (they can remain mobile during 1st stage of labour). Final example from last year was the demotion in the UK hypertensive guidelines of eta-blockers as 1st line option (now about 4th in the list). So if one had retired 2 years ago, experience and editorial help would be invaluable to wikipedia, but one's knowledge for hypertension therapy would already be outdated - finding current sources in researching edits would though alert one to such changes.
Its not actually that bleak - as a doctor you will know what information is missing or needing improving. This then allows you to search specifically for that information (you are already at the top of the learning curve, unlike most non-medics).
* A realy good place to search is at ubMed abstracts of 1000's of international biomedical journals, just go to [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi this search page] - see also MID and ikipedia:PMID for details. You should find identifying likely suitable papers easy with your medical experience. Details on the most recent citation system, cite.php, is at P:Footnotes and ser:Diberri has [http://diberri.dyndns.org/wikipedia/templates/?type=pmid this tool] to take a PubMed abstract number and generate the full emplate:cite journal mark-up to copy &amp; paste into an article.
* Also the emplate:Infobox Disease that should appear at the top of most medical disorder articles has space for Medicine links - so provided there is a suitable article there (go to http://www.eMedicine.com), any of your own knowledge that you find also mentioned in the eMedicine article, can be added without having to add specific further citations (good idea in the edit-summary to comment source eMedicine, and check that one is not then plagiarising that website).
* For information from UK sources: for therapeutics we can obviously cite from the BNF (NB on line access is not freely available to non-medics, so cite relevant version, e.g. ite book | title=ritish National Formulary|BNF | date=Sept 2006 | edition=52 and the ICE website (http://www.nice.org.uk/) or the more accessible Scottish SIGN website (http://www.sign.ac.uk/) can give current guidelines.
Personally I find the need to review research and interact with other editors in writing clear articles has helped refresh and sometimes update my own clinical knowledge, so not just a process of giving to wikipedia :-) Hope this helps, and look forward to your further contributions, and experience shining through :-) Yours ser:Davidruben|David Ruben  ser talk:Davidruben|Talk  02:51, 15 January 2007 (UTC)

As you say, the article is in bad shape. Speaking as a Medical Practitioner of some 38 years experience, my inclination is to put the thing up for l|AfD; I have not yet decided. The essential point is that pain is wholly, totally subjective, and is therefore intrinsically unmeasurable. Not only will different people experience pain to varying degrees, but also an individual will experience pain in wildly differing degrees in different circumstances. Trying to measure pain is like trying to measure joy, or sadness, or any other sensation.

Certainly phage therapy is not part of accepted treatment modalities currently used. As such it is not a notable treatment in such infectious diseases and therefore doe not belong in encyclopaedic entries under treatment. That is not of course to say that the treatment of surface bacterial infections by viruses is not intriguing, and certainly some researches in Russia have researched into this. This though is speculative research or speculation as to what might be novel treatment approaches - for now counts as trivial minority opinion or personal opinion (original research). Discussion of the topic at all perhaps would be best as a &quot;Research&quot; section of acteria, or harmacology etc, rather than in individual disease articles. ser:Davidruben|David Ruben  ser talk:Davidruben|Talk  01:55, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

Ok thanks. (Your contributions will be more clearly identifiable and user-talk page discusion directed at you, vs some anon URL address that changes each session. Also registered users identities are more hidden than the URL's which may be traced (assuming of course that you do not feel that your chosen username is not too &quot;open&quot;)). There are two aspects to your main question:
* Is a source credible - ikipedia:Reliable sources discusses sources that may be used to P:Cite to P:Verify. So yes these journals, if RS, could be used to cite in order to verify a fact. This though takes us only to something along the lines of &quot;A previously line of research was phage therapy&quot; with then a footnoted citation to a 40 year old paper.
* Secondly is &quot;only references to recent Western literature&quot; - the issue here is one of P:Notability. A single paper, even in a reliable source of a peer-reviewed journal, does not solely in itself establish an accepted approach, nor even necessarily of the viewpoint being more than a &quot;trivial minority&quot; opinion (only &quot;significant minority&quot; opinions must be included under P:NPOV policy, albeit not necessarily with equal article space).
* Phage therapy is clearly intriguing, was definitely researched into (mostly in Russia if I recall correctly), and phage viruses clearly also exist. So articles on these are clearly appropriate. the issue becomes whether they are extablished current therapies, and 40-50 year old papers on their own do not suggest it has has current notability as a treatment. Blood letting was clearly previously used and there are many sources attesting to its use from hundreds of years ago, but the absence of recent papers does largely follow from it nolonger being a generally practiced therapy.
* Personally some mention of phage therapy in acteria and ntibiotic resistance#Alternative therapies seems not unreasonable, but not in specific disease articles. NPOV balance of a non-majority approach will though require current such mention be short (if new research comes along or clinical practice changes then wikipedia's description would of course need to change to reflect this)
* It will be interesting to see what other editors have to contribute to these points. ser:Davidruben|David Ruben  ser talk:Davidruben|Talk  03:01, 29 January 2007 (UTC)

I think the need to use 40-year-old references suggests a problem with how widely used or accepted the therapy is. The foreign medical literature is acceptable but needs to be available in translation; otherwise it's impossible to P:V|verify. The bottom line is that phage therapy for bacterial infection is not utilized anywhere in the English-speaking medical world that I'm aware of (sources proving me wrong would be appreciated), and is certainly not viewed as a viable alternative to antibiotic therapy. I agree with ser:Davidruben|David that mention will have to be constrained to reflect that. ser:MastCell|MastCell 23:15, 30 January 2007 (UTC)

ikipedia:Scientific peer review

It is nearly 11 months since we established this review process as a minimal process after we failed to reach consensus about a number of matters. During that time it has been largely left alone with nobody really keeping a close watch on it. A couple days ago I cleaned everything up. I archived old reviews, corrected the tags on talk pages and made minimal changes to the process based on what I had learnt. I also reviewed how it had operated. There were some reasonable reviews and some that attracted no interest what so ever, but I guess that is the case even with ikipedia:Peer review. Some entries may have missed some attention since they were not properly formatted, or had no tag on the article's talk page and hence did not appear in the category. See ikipedia talk:Scientific peer review for my review and report on the clean up.

Of course, in hindsight, I wonder whether we, and particularly I, could have done better a year ago. In hindsight, does anyone have ideas how we progress this review process. To be worthwhile, it must attract reviews that perhaps would not go elsewhere such as ikipedia:Peer review and it must attract expert reviewers to add to what might be achieved by the general ikipedia:Peer review. If it can not do either, perhaps we should close it down and just encourage articles to go to ikipedia:Peer review. Articles for review are listed on the science WikiProjects such as this one, but they are transcluded in so changes do not appear on watchlists. I have also added recent reviews to ikipedia:Peer review in the same way that WikiProject reviews such as ikipedia:WikiProject Chemistry/Peer review are added. In this way both review pages refer to the same page for the review discussion and hopefully more editors will be attracted. The key point is attracting expert reviewers who might look at ikipedia:Scientific peer review but not look at ikipedia:Peer review.

If you have any ideas on this, please add your views at ikipedia talk:Scientific peer review. --ser:Bduke|Bduke 03:04, 14 February 2007 (UTC)

 Can Dry Heaves lead to Seizures? 

Can anyone tell me if Dry Heaves lead to a seizure? —The preceding ikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages|unsigned comment was added by pecial:Contributions/70.233.142.238|70.233.142.238 (ser talk:70.233.142.238|talk) 05:24, 16 February 2007 (UTC).

In my opinion and in the light of my experience, the answer is essentially no. Two corollaries; if the subject is a poorly controlled epileptic then it is barely possible that vomiting, or dry heaving, might bring on a convulsion (seizure is not a generally accepted clinical description); and if the subject is a child with a pyrexia caused by a gastrointestinal infection causinf vomiting, then the pyrexia might induce associated febrile convulsions. This is a personal opinion, and I do not accept medico-legal responsibility for any actions undertaken in response to this opinion.--ser:Anthony.bradbury|Anthony.bradbury 15:46, 16 February 2007 (UTC)
On its own, the word seizure is imprecise, can be ambiguous and in lay parlance may refer to such things as a stroke, heart attack or even a fit of rage.[http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.0013-9580.2005.66104.x] Modern medical use of the term is largely restricted to the epileptic kind and usually there is no doubt as to the intended meaning when the word is used by a physician. The word convulsion is not, however, a synonym for seizure as it refers to only one aspect of a particular kind of epileptic seizure. Not all epileptic seizures produce convulsions. The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) define:[http://www.ilae-epilepsy.org/Visitors/Centre/ctf/glossary.cfm]
*convlusion – Primarily a lay term. Episodes of excessive, abnormal muscle contractions, usually bilateral, which may be sustained or interrupted.
*epileptic seizure – Manifestation(s) of epileptic (excessive and/or hypersynchronous), usually self-limited activity of neurons in the brain.
Other causes of vomiting, e.g. alcohol abuse, could also lead to seizures. ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 19:48, 16 February 2007 (UTC)

I don't know much about it, but just looking at the acronym, the label looks like it describes a broad class of &quot;disorders&quot;.  The emphasis on whether or not PANDAS is hypothetical seems inappropriate, since I'd expect controversy over a specific disorder, not about a word that seems to refer to a class of disorders in general.

Some of your assumptions may be wrong, perhaps because the NIH didn't name it well (it does apply to a rough constellation of conditions).  It's not a broad class of disorders; perhaps it's just too loosely-defined as a hypothesis.  The entire hypothesis is controversial—there is no part of it that isn't (pls do read some of the links sourcing that statement - [http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/113/4/883 this one is full text], but MID|12842229 is probably the better paper, if you can get the full text).  Encephalon had started to rewrite it at one point, but he hasn't been around Wikipedia much, and I have no interest in expanding on an article that is an unproven hypothesis.  As far as I know, there is no one else on Wikipedia who knows PANDAS, which isn't unusual, since few physicians do (I seem to run into this problem every time I ask for medical help on TS-related articles).  The concern is the POV tag:  where's the POV?

Still hoping someone out there understands the issue, which is the inappropriate tagging of the article as POV.  I've written up something at alk:P.A.N.D.A.S.  Since there are no other editors on Wiki (that I'm aware of) who understand PANDAS (and I can't write the rest of the article myself), I'll need additional input in resolving the POV claim.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 15:31, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
Oh, I would have tagged the article as POV myself, because it clearly demonstrates an attempt to persuade the reader that PANDAS is quackery.  The bias is obvious to me.  If the article were rewritten to say &quot;PANDAS stands for this and refers to this... criticism includes allegations that PANDAS is unproven...&quot; then it wouldn't be so POV anymore.  See P:NPOV ser:Reswobslc|Reswobslc 17:06, 14 March 2007 (UTC)
PANDAS is not quackery by any means; it is a well-studied, well-published unproven scientifically-based hypothesis that has engendered massive controversy and doesn't enjoy widespread support of specialists outside of the NIH.  Nothing about it is quackery.  To my eyes, the article does say PANDAS is this, the controversy is this; a more specific example of adjustments needed would be helpful, keeping in mind that undue weight would actually require more to be written about the controversial aspects (text I don't feel qualified to expand).  This is quite difficult without an expert on board, but NPOV requires mentioning the controversy, which is currently understated if anything.  If you see attempts to persuade, pls give me some concrete examples of where to adust.  The facts are the facts; it is massively controversial, and that is undermentioned in the current version of the article.  (I do appreciate that someone is at least looking at it, since there are so few editors on Wiki who can examine this topic, and we have an editor placing an POV tag based on anecdotal personal experience—thanks for helping.) ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 17:56, 14 March 2007 (UTC)

The article's opening statement calls PANDAS a hypothesis, but the NIH reference it attributes it to does not.  In fact, the article appears to be plagiarized word-for-word from the NIH site, and then altered to say it's a hypothesis.  Don't get me wrong, it's OK to plagiarize the US Government, as copyright doesn't apply to its works.  But right now, the article calls PANDAS a hypothesis, and attributes that assertion to a source that clearly does not say that.  We can't have that.  You can attribute the idea of PANDAS to NIH in the article, and then attribute the dissenting viewpoint to the dissenters, but the article cannot narratively call PANDAS a &quot;hypothesis&quot; (nor can it refer to it as &quot;fact&quot;) when that is a matter of disagreement between NIH and others. ser:Reswobslc|Reswobslc 08:46, 15 March 2007 (UTC)
I don't know who wrote the original article, but the NIH is public domain, so it's not a problem.  Please produce an ICD or DSM code for PANDAS, and the word hypothesis can be dropped.  Here's a starting place for searching for diagnostic codes; note what they say about PANDAS.  [http://www.elib.gov.ph/edatabase/elibgetdb.php/http/supportforms.epnet.com/eit/emr/record.asp?an=115782&amp;search=Acetaminophen&amp;page=3] Listed under complications of the strep diagnosis, they state:  &quot;existence of PANDAS as a distinct entity is controversial: autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders have been described after streptococcal infection, overall evidence weak based on small case series and case reports.&quot;  Again, in the absence of a diagnostic code, it's a hypothesis (not the same as quackery), as recognized by an enormous body of journal-published research.  Alternately, maybe someone here can suggest a better word. Either it is a recognized medical diagnosis, or it's not.  That's not an issue of POV; it's a matter of fact.

This may help: http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/547096?rss  There is no diagnosis; only diagnostic criterion proposed by the NIH.  &quot;The study investigators were concerned that the PANDAS diagnosis had been widely adopted in the community without confirmatory scientific evidence, ...&quot;  Studies are based on the criteria proposed by Swedo/NIH (&quot;The center used diagnostic criteria for PANDAS that were based on research criteria established in 1998 known as the Swedo criteria for their founder, Susan Swedo, MD, from the National Institute of Mental Health.&quot;).  (Just a note, Murphy is one of the few non-NIH proponents of the theory; this article quotes her more extensively than others—even as a proponent, she says, &quot;The gap reflects the fact that PANDAS still has nebulous criteria that may need more refining.&quot;) ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 16:20, 15 March 2007 (UTC)

chmidt Sting Pain Index
Can some of you knowledgable and discerning medical and scientist Wikipedians take a look at this please? This article has currently been getting some coverage in popular &quot;gee whiz funny link of the day... how goofy!&quot; type blogs ( I hate it when this happens and the article in question is dubious... I think it gives a bad impression of wikipedia), but it seems to be mainly based on the idea that this one insect scientist guy wrote some goofy comments for an insect sting pain index one day. Ok, I agree that insect scientists are allowed to have senses of humour (WITHIN LIMITS, for the sake of us all), but I am concerned that 1) this scale is not really widespread and may be just one scale promoted by one guy without much acceptance in the insect expert and/or medical community. 2) the pdf article linked which this wikipedia entry seems to be based on does not seem to say that Schmidt actually wrote those goofy comments. Its a bit ambiguous, but its seems to say that &quot;the media&quot; (without specifying what media) came up with the goofy comments to append to Schmidt's original dry scale(I think this may be another case where people exaggerate or misinterpret what an article is saying). I dont have any access to science or medical journal databases, and am certainly no science or insect expert.

 Should nhaler Become A Disambiguation Page? 

I believe the Inhaler page needs to become a disambiguation page because it omits the types of inhalers such as nasal inhalers (e.g. Vics Vapor Inhaler, sprays,NasalCrom,...). I know it may cause a few stub articles but once going it may take a much informative form. Anyone else care for comment?

--ser:RonEJ|RonEJ 10:10, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

* Inhalers are, by common understanding &amp; definition, drugs inhaled into the lung. NasalCrom etc are sprays sprayed into the nose whilst sniffing and delivers their drugs to the nose, not the lungs. Nasal sprays require just partial respiratory effort (to sniff in), whereas all inhalers used for asthma should be with full effort (from a deliberate fully expired lung to full total capacity). Furthermore with inhalers the breath should ideally be held for 10 seconds to allow drug deposition (use of spacers as secondary volume is a side issue here), whereas once a nasal spray has been sniffed-in, a person is free to immediately exhale through their mouth. Not all asthma inhalers are aerosol, having instead dry powder in many products. Whilst all asthma inhalers deliver a pre-defined fixed dose for each activation, Meter Dose Inhaler (MDI) is a term generally reserved for aerosol inhalers. ser:Davidruben|David Ruben  ser talk:Davidruben|Talk  12:48, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

References to PubMed
What is the prognosis on fixing the system of creating references to citations at PubMed? While simply typing &quot;PMID ########&quot; is easy to do and works, it does not provide citation information at the bottom of the article. While http://diberri.dyndns.org/wikipedia/templates/?type=pmid helps, it still requires busy authors to become conformatable working with tags and markup language. Technically, we should be able to let the author simply type &quot;PMID ########&quot; at the appropriate spot in the article and the citations are collated and the reference list is built automatically. I have suggested this as a project for WP's participation in Google's summer of code (http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Summer_of_Code_2007/proposals). 

Is there anything else that can be done to improve this system? It is really painful as if you adequately cite your sources, you may create paragraphs whose source content has more text inside of the ref tag that outside. These paragraphs become very hard for subsequent authors. I suspect this either keeps a lot of docs from being authors, or prevents some authors from citing the sources.
ser:Badgettrg|Badgettrg 21:02, 5 April 2007 (UTC)
Sounds useful, but I can see some problems. BTW it is quite acceptable/encouraged for editors who are inexperienced to insert a basic citation (such as just the PMID) and for more established editors to format it for them. If editors avoid the template, and format their citation by hand, the text isn't particularly bulky. I keep thinking about asking Diberri to create an option to output wiki markup rather than the template.
Would the lookup and replacement of text occur at initial edit time, or every time the HTML version was created from the markup (I understand this is cached)? The latter seems to be what you want wrt keeping the edit size down. However, this could have a significant performance hit and place a continual dependency on a third party for data. The PubMed site is sometimes slow or even down. What would happen if you tried to submit an edit while PubMed was down?
Another issue is which citation style you would pick? WP positively encourages anarchy in this regard. The l|cite journal template has a home grown format that doesn't match any third-party guide, let alone the medical merican Medical Association|AMA or niform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals|URM styles that most WP Medicine editors will be familiar with reading. PubMed also lists all three-hundred co-authors for these big international collaborative articles. I suppose the tool could be engineered to truncate and stick an et al on.
Finally, there is the issue of reliably extracting the info. Diberri is great but doesn't always work. Sometimes it fails to pick up the year, for example, other times the PubMed data is lacking authors when they are clearly listed in the paper. The advantage of inserting humans into the process is that these minor glitches can be overcome. ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 07:39, 6 April 2007 (UTC)
The use of the template is important for maintainability, but if a user is having trouble with it, they can always use ser:Cacycle/wikEd to hide the refs while editing. --ser:Arcadian|Arcadian 11:15, 6 April 2007 (UTC)
I agree. The maintainability argument is the reason I wouldn't consider generating wiki markup rather than template code for citations. I'd forgotten that wikEd allows you to hide refs; this should make palatable the extra length of the generated template code. IMO, what would be nice would be the ability to highlight a PMID while you're editing, click a bookmarklet, and then have the template code auto-filled in for you. A while back I worked on a .js file to do just that; I'll dig it up and see if I can't get it working. Cheers, ser:Diberri|David Iberri (ser talk:Diberri|talk) 14:52, 6 April 2007 (UTC)
Whilst I (currently) use the templates, I'm being drawn to hand-formatting for various reasons. The layout of l|cite journal is non-standard and the code too simplistic to format perfectly. I detected a &quot;ot invented here&quot; attitude towards adopting an established standard. I fail to see how:
ite journal |author=Hedley AA, Ogden CL, Johnson CL, et al |title=Prevalence of overweight and obesity among US children, adolescents, and adults, 1999-2002 |journal=JAMA |volume=291 |issue=23 |pages=2847-50 |year=2004 |pmid=15199035
is more &quot;maintainable&quot; than 
Hedley AA, Ogden CL, Johnson CL et al: Prevalence of overweight and obesity among US children, adolescents, and adults, 1999–2002. JAMA. 2004;291:2847–50. PMID 15199035
The latter also has the benefit of working on all languages of WP and on any other MediaWiki based site. There are lots of editors who don't use (and even despise) the templates. Shouldn't editors have the choice? ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 19:43, 6 April 2007 (UTC)

Personally I like the templates, and whilst I agree their current display is not standard to biomedical journals (which have an internationally agreed referencing style - see my failed attempt to suggest observing this at emplate talk:Cite journal#Publication volume number in bold / additional data / descriptive labels), at least if wikipedia agreed to standardise citation formating it would only require a tweak to the relevant citation template and not require a trawl through hundreds of thousands of articles. Finally copying over a blank citation template at least helps show what fields are available and perhaps rather more parameters will be specified by some editors (no reflection intended of course on anyone above). Yes diberri's template filler fails add the year if the date has a month range eg &quot;2007 Jan-Feb&quot; - but is this not just a reason to ask Diberri as a &quot;wish list&quot; upgrade rather than abdandon the (optional) citation templates ? ser:Davidruben|David Ruben  ser talk:Davidruben|Talk  20:13, 6 April 2007 (UTC)
The flaws in the tool would be a problem whether it generated template or wiki code. I merely pointed them out since the proposal was for a fully-automated system. At least with Diberri's tool, you can check the output and add in the extra couple of fields (e.g. URL for freely available papers).
I believe that Wikipedia will never standardise citation formatting (it might have, if at the start it enforced all refs to use one machine-readable format). We have editors from all disciplines, many of whom have entrenched habits for how they wish to cite their text. As I noted on the cite news talk page, P:CITE/ES says &quot;please use the citation style of your choice&quot; (their emphasis). It is also an established practice to encourage editors to cite their source using whatever means they can manage (e.g raw URL, book/author name) and for more experienced editors to tidy up later. ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 07:04, 11 April 2007 (UTC)

Using the example above:

Hedley AA, Ogden CL, Johnson CL et al: Prevalence of overweight and obesity among US children, adolescents, and adults, 1999–2002. JAMA. 2004;291:2847–50. MID|15199035

Wouldn't it be nice if simply inserting something like &quot;PMIDV 15199035&quot; automatically generated the citation in Vancouver format with doi and publisher links?

Diberri and Cacycle are great, but I do not think they are enough here. We are all relatively early adopters of WikiPedia, but to really get quorum going to achieve the effect of Linus's law, we need to make editing easier. I just taught an informatics elective to 21 senior medical students. Their final project was to do an EBM-style edit (with references) in WP. Although these were self-selected students from a class of 200, only 1-2 students used the complete reference template (I probably should have taught them your free text method above).

In addition, we still are not addressing reusing a citation multiple times in a page. Do we expect authors to search the whole wiki page to see if an article is already cited and to use the same ref name attribute? Aren't we going to end up in a mess with one article appearing multiple times in a bibliography?

Regarding the implementation, when WP finds the trigger string &quot;PMIDV 15199035&quot; in a page being saved, it would look in its database of already used PubMed citations. If not found, it would use PubMed's e-utility to retrieve the xml for the citation and add it to the local database for use in the current page and for any future pages calling the citation. I suppose you could allow other formats so that PMIDA would be in the APA format. Regardless the markup would only have &quot;MID|15199035&quot; or &quot;PMIDV 15199035&quot;  or &quot;PMIDA 15199035&quot; .

Authors not wanting to use this system can still use other existing methods (although at risk of a single citation appearing multiple times if authors are inconsistent in their naming the ref tag.ser:Badgettrg|Badgettrg 01:35, 11 April 2007 (UTC)

I think you are trying to merge the ref system with the citation format. Are you saying that writing PMIDV 15199035 would automatically put something like ... in so that multiple refs to the same article would be tied by ref name. The editor can achieve this by hand. I don't think merging the ref system is a good idea. There are cases when editors wish to cite a paper outside of the footnotes. They might be general (bullet-point) refs for the whole article, or a historical paper that is actually fully cited in the body text.

The problems you mention with multiple refs aren't Wiki's biggest worry. They are fairly easily sorted by asking someone to review your article. Encouraging editors to supply well sourced and well written content is far and away the most important issue. Wrt medical articles, I'm sure plenty project members would be happy to help tidy the refs for a well written article, if asked nicely. ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 07:04, 11 April 2007 (UTC)

Yes, I am proposing that there is a solution that simultaneously solves the display of citations and the numbering system. It would not create &quot;&quot;, but rather something like &quot;(pmidv 15199035)&quot; to avoid colliding with other systems. I admit that WP has bigger problems to address than references; but eventually the clunkiness of creating references will limit our pool of authors, or limit the pool of authors who take the time to cite their references and willing to edit paragraphs where there is more markup text than displayed text. This problem will grow as paragraphs become better referenced. This process can be automated and should not have to rely on asking other authors to create our tags.

 [edited above paragraph to change  to &lt;ref...&gt; to avoid Cite error. –Dan Hoey 16:39, 13 April 2007 (UTC)

 Inflammation -  to merge or not to merge? 
Just searching for some input here. nflammation as it stands is a messy, half-done article focusing more on acute inflammation from a clinical standpoint. Chronic inflammation is a little stub at the moment. I'm in two minds at the moment over what to do with them. I would prefer to have nflammation as a general introduction to both with each having their own pages, rather than having both in one article. What do you guys think would be the best course of action? -- ser:Serephine|Serephine ♠ ser talk:Serephine|talk - 11:50, 7 April 2007 (UTC)

It would probably be best if the Inflammation article was expanded and worked on, and then having a seperate page for both chronic and acute inflammation. Hopefully in time someone can end up putting effort into working on the articles, but maybe if no progress is done, for the time being just do redirects for chronic and acute inflammation into just inflammation? petze 05:22, 13 April 2007 (UTC)
 Review request: eralgia paresthetica 

Having been diagnosed with eralgia paresthetica, I read the wikipedia article and informative articles on emedicine.com, aaos.org, mayoclinic.com, neurosurgery.ucla.edu.  The wikipedia article was notable for failing to mention the site of the nerve constriction that usually causes this condition.  I added the information that I had gleaned from the other sites, and edited some wikicommons pictures from Gray's anatomy to illustrate the text.  I invite professional review to make sure the article conforms to P:MED standards.

I also noticed an article on chiroweb.com suggesting that chiropractic treatment is often effective for this condition.  I do not know how chiropractic medicine is treated in this venue, and I have no authoritative references for such treatment, so I have not added any mention of such treatment in the article.  I bring this up in hopes that an informed professional has something useful and encyclopedic to add. –Dan Hoey 22:46, 8 April 2007 (UTC)

 Thanks to ser:Davidruben and ser:Arcadian for the cleanup.  By the way, the note on exercise came from http://neurosurgery.ucla.edu/Diagnoses/PeripheralNerve//PeripheralNerveDis_3.html ; I don't know how reliable that's considered. –Dan Hoey 00:22, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

Thanks - I've added above ref to the details (and also added suggestion for trial NDSAIDs) ser:Davidruben|David Ruben  ser talk:Davidruben|Talk  00:47, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

And thanks again for the good work.  It doesn't look like a stub any more, so maybe alk:Meralgia_paraesthetica is due for a rating change, though I don't know enough to give it a grade.  The only really annoying part (and this is probably true of a lot of infoboxes) is that printing the article, which wisely expands the external links, makes the infobox picture so wide that the first page is half empty.  We would need someone with deep knowledge of template design to work on that.  –Dan Hoey 15:53, 9 April 2007 (UTC)
