		<segment id="id69483603">What to do if a source is obviously wrong?

What is the policy if we are getting data from a  source, and the source is obviously wrong?

In Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, table called &quot;Vaccine efficacy against confirmed symptomatic COVID‑19&quot;, the &quot;Age ≥75&quot; group, the 95% CI for efficacy includes negative numbers, which is impossible. This is what the [https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/assessment-report/comirnaty-epar-public-assessment-report_en.pdf source] (Table 10) is showing: a number that cannot be negative, whose CI includes negative values. Isabela31 (talk) 20:06, 19 November 2021 (UTC)
In the general case, if an otherwise solid source is &quot;obviously&quot; wrong for something, don't use it for that wrong thing. Alexbrn (talk) 21:15, 19 November 2021 (UTC)
Good. Will you please edit the table to remove the wrong information? Isabela31 (talk) 21:16, 19 November 2021 (UTC)
I know nothing about the particular case and its obviousness. If there's an obvious fix to make, you . I would however, caution any Wikipedia editor from adjudging a reputable source as &quot;obviously wrong&quot; without first ruling out the &quot;I don't understand it&quot; option. Obviously wrong has to mean obviously wrong. Alexbrn (talk) 21:21, 19 November 2021 (UTC)
I remember seeing this when Pfizer first published their data. I assumed it was a Wikipedia editor's mistake but as you noted, it's in the source data. In fact, the negative numbers appear throughout the report. It's not an error. Rather just the result of their calculation methodology left unadjusted. - Wikmoz (talk) 21:41, 19 November 2021 (UTC)
How certain are we that 1 minus an odds ratio cannot be a negative number?
What would you expect this number to be, if someone who got the vaccine paradoxically had a higher risk of hospitalization than someone who did not?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 06:53, 21 November 2021 (UTC)
Wouldn't it be consistent with the observation that extremely frail people right on the cusp of &quot;natural&quot; death are quite likely to be pushed over the edge by the adverse effects of a vaccine? Alexbrn (talk) 08:37, 21 November 2021 (UTC)
There is nothing wrong with these numbers from statistical point of view. Such negative numbers are frequently reported in clinical trials. Ruslik_Zero 20:39, 21 November 2021 (UTC)
 That's not what's being reported here.  What's being reported is the &quot;vaccine effectiveness&quot; in terms of (for the specific 95% confidence interval that includes the negative number) people being hospitalized with COVID-19.  This particular range says if you are infected specifically with SARS-CoV-2-gamma, the vaccine effectiveness is somewhere between 82% and –9% (i.e., somewhere from likely to help a lot to likely to be slightly harmful).  The &quot;vaccine effectiveness&quot; is calculated from an odds ratio, not a relative risk.  The only think I can tell you with certainty about an odds ratio is that &quot;25% relative risk&quot; means you are a quarter as likely to get the specified result, and that &quot;25% odds ratio&quot; does not mean this.
On the immunology side, it is possible for a (bad) vaccine to make you more prone to side effects or more prone to infection.  I don't think there's any evidence of this happening with any of the COVID-19 vaccines, but with other viruses/vaccines, Antibody-dependent enhancement is a thing.  This has been a failure path for HIV vaccines in the past. WhatamIdoing (talk) 20:52, 21 November 2021 (UTC)
If you want to use numbers that humans can understand, it would be worth looking for sources that discuss the Number needed to treat.  This is the metric that lets you say useful things, like how many people hospitalized with COVID-19 need to take dexamethasone to prevent one death (answer:  about [https://www.thennt.com/nnt/dexamethasone-hospitalized-patients-covid-19/ 36]).  People can understand this even if they don't have graduate degrees in statistics. WhatamIdoing (talk) 20:58, 21 November 2021 (UTC)
A confidence interval can easily include &quot;impossible&quot; values, because it's mathematically derived from a statistical model, and models often include assumptions. And assumptions are there to make the model simple enough that it's useful.
A very common example would be when we model a variable such as age, which can only be positive, as a normal distribution, which goes from -oo to +oo. We do that because it makes the model very simple, and very useful. Of course, there is no free lunch: in doing so, we end up with a model where there is a small (but non-zero) probability that the variable that models age is negative. It's the price we pay.
The way we calculate confidence intervals entails inverting a normal distribution or any of a number of related distributions with similar assumptions.
As George Box said, all models are wrong, but some are useful :) Dr. Vogel (talk) 21:04, 21 November 2021 (UTC)

 I would like to confirm that we are looking at this line:-
 Age ≥75, n1b 0, surveillance time 0.102 (774), n1b 5, surveillance time 0.106 (785), VE 100.0, 95% CI (-13.1, 100.0) 
 from page 87 of the pdf? Axl ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 21:54, 24 November 2021 (UTC)
For that paper, &quot;VE is defined as 100% × (1 – IRR), where illness rate ratio (IRR) is calculated as the ratio of first confirmed COVID-19 illness rate in the vaccine group to the corresponding illness rate in the placebo group&quot;. WhatamIdoing (talk) 23:34, 24 November 2021 (UTC)
 I was hoping that Isabela31 would answer my question. Anyway, just as you say, WAID, VE is defined like that on page 73. Axl ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 00:07, 25 November 2021 (UTC)
 For the time being, I shall assume that the answer to my question is &quot;yes&quot;.
 Firstly, I draw attention to Alexbrn's comment: &quot;I would however, caution any Wikipedia editor from adjudging a reputable source as &quot;obviously wrong&quot; without first ruling out the &quot;I don't understand it&quot; option.&quot;
 The authors derived the confidence interval using the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval#Clopper%E2%80%93Pearson_interval Clopper and Pearson method]. I am not familiar with this method, but I can give some basic information about the confidence interval.
 The top end of the VE confidence interval corresponds to an illness rate ratio of 0. This makes sense because no people in the vaccinated group acquired the disease during the surveillance period.
 The bottom end of the interval corresponds to an IRR of 1.131 . This value would represent vaccinated people being more likely to acquire the disease than unvaccinated people. 
 This confidence interval is large, and includes the null hypothesis (i.e. vaccination has no effect). The reason for this large CI is because of the small number of cases. Only five people in the group of 1,559 acquired the disease. This means that we should not have much confidence with pinpointing any effect from the vaccine.
 If we look at the rest of the table, we see that five other subgroups also had negative values in their confidence intervals. The most extreme value is &quot;American Indian or Alaska Native&quot;, with a bottom value of -3429 . This corresponds to an IRR of 35.29 . If this value was the actual IRR, it would mean that vaccination would increase the illness rate in these people by a factor of 35. (This value is not the actual IRR). However we should note that in all five of these subgroups, the number of cases was five or fewer in each. This explains the enormous sizes of the confidence intervals.
 There is no limit to the extremity of a negative bottom end of the confidence interval.
 The top end of the CI should not exceed 100%, because such a value would correspond to a negative number of people acquiring the disease. (Such a value would be &quot;obviously wrong&quot;.)
 In summary, I see nothing wrong with the statistical method used, the presence of negative values in the confidence intervals, or the way that the results are presented. Axl ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 09:50, 25 November 2021 (UTC)

PANDAS advocacy
As mentioned in secondary reviews (as well as countless media sources), PANDAS advocacy is widespread on the internet and social media, with hundreds of advocacy sites and groups, including multiple Facebook pages. Misinformation in the PANS/PANDAS realm has a considerable impact on the well-being of vulnerable children.   recently had to re-semi-protect the article because of advocacy IP edits and vandalism, and today, talk page posts were removed.

Writing internationally

A common problem I have when editing pages is that I know that something is common practice in a couple of countries (and can find sources), but often can't find a paper that discusses practices internationally. What are good approaches here? I am sort of reduced just to listing the policies in countries that are &quot;important&quot; (though I imagine for the people living there their country's policies are important... but a list of 200 countries might be unhelpful). An approach I've seen is that you have a summary in one page and then link to another page which is effectively a list of policies in as many countries as people care to find. 

On this topic, does anyone happen to know the equivalent of UK's GMC (general medical council) in the US and, say, Germany or France? What about the NICE (national institute of clinical excellence). What I really want is a kind of &quot;rosetta stone&quot; of medical bodies in different countries.

I'm a little afraid that in federal countries like the US and Germany you will have a proliferation of bodies for each separate state - one nice think about the UK is that they often have a single national body solely governing policy for 60 million people or so.

creating a wiki page for medical education conferences and journals 

Hello! 
I am working with physicians to create a wiki page with resources for specific medical education conferences and one for specific medical education journals to be in one spot for educators or students interested in this field. They start with general conferences and journals that take things from all fields then they go into specific specialties based on alphabetical order. They have been rejected and their recommendations were to use WikiProject Medicine as the platform instead of just the general wiki page. I was wondering if anyone can help me or guide me to create these resources for our students.

Positive impact of MEDRS

Naturally, one might interpret these findings differently, but I choose to see this research as demonstrating 's positive impact.

The following journals rank in the top 1% of all journal references (not just medical journals) found on the English Wikipedia, ranking exceptionally high based on most—or even all—10 methods for measuring journal popularity and reliability.

* BMJ
* Cell
* Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews
* JAMA
* Lancet
* Nature
* New England Journal of Medicine
* PLOS ONE
* Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences

Miscellaneous notes
* The article's authors all hail from the Department of Information Systems, Poznań University of Economics and Business, Poznań, Poland. I don't know if the authors wrote the article in Polish and then had it translated into English or if they directly penned their report in English. Either way a professional translator would have improved the prose. It's understandable, just not standard English. And hey, their English is much better than my Polish. ;^]
* Ironically, the journal in which this article was published, Information, is on the blacklist. My take: Even bad, black-listed journals will occasionally publish good research articles. I am hoping this paper is one of those exceptions. 
* Along those lines, I'm not an information scientist so I might not have recognized flaws in the authors' research methodology or statistical analysis. However, it is a well-organized paper that proceeds logically from one topic to the next and despite the language issue (Polish → English), it's written in a clear, crisp manner such that the complex, detailed nature of their investigation did not overwhelm this non-expert. I look forward to reading others' analysis.   
* &quot;top 1%&quot; is my guesstimate—see what you think.
* I learned about this study in the  of .
* The researchers analyzed a wide variety of Wikipedia sites, i.e., across continents, cultures, and languages. 
* More details about the data, quoting from the article:Table 9. Position in rankings of journals in English Wikipedia depending on popularity and reliability model in February 2020.
