So far, the only editor to show up from this WikiProject is pushing the POV that we should never use the words &quot;woman&quot; or &quot;man&quot; in medical articles, despite the fact that P:MEDRS routinely use these terms to refer to the sexes. For example, search Google Scholar for &quot;only in women&quot; or &quot;pregnant women&quot;, in quotes, and selecting &quot;since 2021&quot;: [https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_ylo=2021&amp;q=%22only+in+women%22&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,33][https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C33&amp;as_ylo=2021&amp;q=%22pregnant+women%22&amp;btnG=] This is on top of the fact that two editors who popped up there very recently, Sideswipe9th and Newimpartial, who mostly edit articles about transgender identity, are pushing the same POV. So, as I always worried would happen one day, the P:RGW gender identity language crusade has arrived on Wikipedia. Woe for any article on omen's health, which will probably soon be crammed with godawful euphemisms before long if this push is not stopped. ser:Crossroads|Crossroads ser talk:Crossroads|-talk- 06:27, 21 December 2021 (UTC)
I do not understand why the issue of transgender people is so exigent, often more than not studies involving sexes ([https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/9/11/1326/htm such as this one]) stick to using sexes, and presumably lumping transgender men into women and transgender women into men. I would presume that this is done to avoid the whole schism around genders, and they also have a &quot;not specified&quot; category, presumably for intersex &amp; other such peoples. It would not make sense for a study to have such a little sample size which will probably have little to zero statistical significance in the long run. Unless the article focuses specifically on the effects of something on people who have had sex changes (i.e. effects of hormone therapy on AFAM &amp; AMAB), I do not see the reason to be so petulant (as evidenced in the degradation of formalities). The conversation seems to have shifted from meaningful discussion over a minor detail into just petty semantics, snide side remarks &amp; veiled insults. I cannot say that I'm a linguistics professor nor a sociologist by any means but there's my two cents. ser:Obama gaming|Obama gaming (ser talk:Obama gaming|talk) 08:09, 21 December 2021 (UTC)
Addendum, also per P:MEDMOS, we are writing for the general audience, we are not catering to niche progressive democrats who only occupy a small fraction of the traffic that articles such as this receive, we are catering to an audience who quite frankly in my opinion, couldn't care less what words were being used as long as they can find what information they wanted and is there for them in a concise, detailed form. Context matters, if this were about a sensitive issue where light-footed language is necessary, then I believe editors would adhere what is generally accepted, except it isn't about a sensitive issue. It is literally comparing the differences between the female and male sexes. I understand that some people in society these days view gender as a social construct, hence why that article doesn't engage in discussion of that aspect, but we are looking at sexes, not genders. I think that's the distinction that some of these people are either struggling to understand or willfully ignoring in order to forward their own agenda/views, which quite frankly is a violation of P:NPOV. I do not hold particularly strong (far right/left) political views both socially &amp; economically but this sort of pedantry is just silly. ser:Obama gaming|Obama gaming (ser talk:Obama gaming|talk) 09:46, 21 December 2021 (UTC)
&quot;q| So far, the only editor to show up from this WikiProject is pushing the POV that we should never use the words &quot;woman&quot; or &quot;man&quot; in medical articles. Hi, I believe you are referring to me, and I would tell you that is exactly not what I believe or am advocating for in any way. I think when referring to &quot;biological sex,&quot; (as in, chromosomal, gonadal, phenotypic) we should use the terms &quot;male and female&quot; and then when referring to &quot;gender&quot;, we should use the terms &quot;men and women.&quot; That's it, that's the radical conception. It's also the consensus opinion of the Institute of Medicine [https://www.nap.edu/read/10028]. — ser:Shibbolethink|Shibbolethink (ser talk:Shibbolethink|♔ pecial:Contributions/Shibbolethink|♕) 20:28, 21 December 2021 (UTC)
Sorry for accidentally overstating it. It was early in the debate. However, there is zero justifcation in that source for what you are advocating. It nowhere says we can't use e.g. &quot;women&quot; in reference to sex. They themselves do so sometimes (see pages 120-121 for example: [https://www.nap.edu/read/10028/chapter/7]) as do numerous MEDRS review articles to this day. The sources do not justify but contradict the sweeping changes you are asking for. ser:Crossroads|Crossroads ser talk:Crossroads|-talk- 21:33, 21 December 2021 (UTC)
And now we have two more gender-identity-focused editors P:TAGTEAM [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sex_differences_in_medicine&amp;diff=1061365033&amp;oldid=1061357089 edit] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sex_differences_in_medicine&amp;diff=1061367924&amp;oldid=1061367804 warring] [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sex_differences_in_medicine&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=1061368277&amp;oldid=1061368197 to] include a confusing, irrelevant, and P:UNDUE aside about &quot;other genders&quot; also getting diseases of the emale reproductive system, even though the text spoke solely of the female reproductive system and didn't even say &quot;women&quot;. But for some reason they demand we say that 'women and other genders' get it. There are almost no regular medical editors at this article; almost all of them have followed other editors here recently from gender identity articles. ser:Crossroads|Crossroads ser talk:Crossroads|-talk- 08:27, 21 December 2021 (UTC)
The status quo ante has the wording about &quot;other genders&quot;. This was introduced in February 2021 and not disputed for many months, so I think editors should respect that wording until an RfC can resolve things. Do alert us to the RfC when you get there. ser:Bondegezou|Bondegezou (ser talk:Bondegezou|talk) 10:12, 21 December 2021 (UTC)
Writing a paragraph about this section is on the to-do list at T:MEDMOS.  Perhaps I need to prioritize this (unless someone else wants to draft a starting point?  Or at least give me some hints about what they think would be a reasonable proposal?).
There are several reasonable, generally accepted things that we can say.  One approach is to respect the ex and gender distinction:  &quot;The leading cause of death in female humans is heart disease, not breast cancer.&quot;  Another is to talk about people:  &quot;The leading cause of death in women is heart disease, not breast cancer&quot;.  A third is to choose the language according to the subject matter:  &quot;Females are more likely to die of stroke than males&quot; but &quot;After half a century of breast cancer awareness efforts, American women fear breast cancer more than heart disease, even though they are more likely to die of heart disease&quot;.  
Another consideration is whether the language should depend on the subject matter (e.g., gynecological topics use this style, non-gynecological topics use the other style).  I suspect most editors agree that gender-neutral language is appropriate in trans-specific articles, although now that I think about it, that might not be preferred.  Some editors might think that we should talk about a gender-affirming &quot;men&quot; in ex reassignment surgery (female-to-male) but a gender-neutral &quot;people&quot; in varian cancer.
Finally, as a matter of collecting information, it's been my impression that the pressure has been strongest in the last year or so to remove &quot;women&quot; from articles (i.e., to use gender-neutral language when talking about people who were assigned female at birth), and that there is less pressure to make male-specific articles be gender-neutral.  I'm concerned that my impression might be skewed by what's on my watchlist or which disputes appear in this page.  I would be very interested in hearing from other editors about whether their experiences are consistent with or different from mine. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:49, 21 December 2021 (UTC)
My impression is that so far as such pressure exists, prior to this latest dispute, it came entirely from extremely inexperienced editors (P:Student editors, IPs, and very new and/or sporadic accounts). And yes, it seems the push to replace &quot;women&quot; is stronger than for men. ser:Crossroads|Crossroads ser talk:Crossroads|-talk- 20:21, 21 December 2021 (UTC)
 It is perhaps worth noting that the present dispute at ex differences in medicine began with the efforts of a somewhat experienced, but [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Enforcement#Maneesh controversial] editor to replace the stable heading text &quot; &quot;female&quot; with &quot;women&quot;[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sex_differences_in_medicine&amp;diff=1060062952&amp;oldid=1060062865] and &quot;male&quot; with &quot;men&quot; [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sex_differences_in_medicine&amp;diff=1060062865&amp;oldid=1057208797] rather than edits in the other direction. ser:Newimpartial|Newimpartial (ser talk:Newimpartial|talk) 20:30, 21 December 2021 (UTC)

She asked for personal experiences and I gave mine. Observing many sex-related medical articles for a few years is what I base it on. ser:Crossroads|Crossroads ser talk:Crossroads|-talk- 21:33, 21 December 2021 (UTC)
I think for sure, any MOS entries we make about this should be equally applied to articles about males as they are to articles about females. But I would urge us to RfC between these several options. And my vote would, as it stands right now, be for the first option. bAnd then, for it to be in context. I think most often, when writing this sentence &quot;q|After half a century of breast cancer awareness efforts, American women fear breast cancer more than heart disease, even though they are more likely to die of heart disease This sentence is actually about gender anyway. So it would comport with option 1, respecting the sex/gender difference. When referring exclusively to people born female, we should use the term &quot;female.&quot; But when speaking about everyone who &quot;presents&quot; as a woman, we would use the term &quot;woman.&quot; And similar to how we would treat males vs men. — ser:Shibbolethink|Shibbolethink (ser talk:Shibbolethink|♔ pecial:Contributions/Shibbolethink|♕) 20:31, 21 December 2021 (UTC)
But perhaps this sentence is not about gender.  Perhaps it is a statement about social effects that apply almost exclusively to biological females who still have their breasts.  Breast cancer does not appear to be a significant source of fear among trans women.  (Rationally, it shouldn't be; the risk for hormone-taking trans women is approximately a third that of cis women – a level at which cis women would be advised that routine screening mammograms would be unnecessary and even verdiagnosis|potentially harmful.)  The risk for trans men is also low, due to hormones and masculinizing top surgery.  So we could write about &quot;women&quot;, but in practice, it doesn't apply to trans women, and we could write about &quot;females&quot;, but in practice, it doesn't apply to trans men.  I don't think there is a perfect solution here. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 01:08, 22 December 2021 (UTC)
There are a fair number of trans men who have not undergone gender-affirming &quot;top&quot; surgery, and are still at increased risk for breast cancer compared to their cis-gendered counterparts. Only about a quarter to a half of trans men in the US have undergone the procedure, for instance.  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC6626314/] The risk in those who take hormones is understudied. It is likely lower than cis-women, but still much much higher than for cis-men. [https://www.bmj.com/content/365/bmj.l1652]b&quot;cis-women&quot; or &quot;cis-gendered women&quot; would be the phrasings I would suggest, to overall capture the citation we use in the article, though. (which does not account for any trans persons, as far as I can tell) — ser:Shibbolethink|Shibbolethink (ser talk:Shibbolethink|♔ pecial:Contributions/Shibbolethink|♕) 15:02, 22 December 2021 (UTC)
Presumably the source cited in WhatamIdoing's thought experiment says nothing about &quot;cisgender&quot;, as most don't. So if that's the case, would you be arguing that we need to speak in a way our sources do not? That is not only original research, but means adding P:UNDUE emphasis on gender identity issues across numerous articles. It is writing articles as though the exception is typical. And it hypothetically could be done for all sorts of conditions. ser:Crossroads|Crossroads ser talk:Crossroads|-talk- 18:44, 22 December 2021 (UTC)
 I'm not sure whether you are familiar with the explanatory supplement P:NOTOR, but it is pretty clear about this kind of thing:
alkquote|Accurate paraphrasing of reliable sources is not considered original research. In fact, in most cases you are actually required by policy to write in your own words rather than plagiarizing the source's wording. This includes:
using synonyms rather than quotations;
using plain English rather than jargon from a technical source; and
summarizing whole pages, chapters, or books in one or two sentences.
 In other words, if the source uses synonyms for &quot;cisgender woman&quot;, and those synonyms would be less clear to our readers than the plain English &quot;cisgender woman&quot;, then we are supposed to paraphrase with &quot;cisgender woman&quot; rather than being enslaved to the language of the source. Pick whatever other example language you want, but the policy-based principle should be clear. ser:Newimpartial|Newimpartial (ser talk:Newimpartial|talk) 19:15, 22 December 2021 (UTC)
Supplement pages carry no more weight than an essay. This is no mere &quot;paraphrase&quot; unless you think woman = cisgender woman. And more to the point, writing our articles in a way the medical sources do not is basically saying that we know better than they do how to cover the topic, which is very much OR as well as POV. ser:Crossroads|Crossroads ser talk:Crossroads|-talk- 19:56, 22 December 2021 (UTC)
dThe nature and status of explanatory supplements isn't the same as essays, though. Per P:SUPPLEMENT, q|information pages should supplement or clarify technical or factual information about Wikipedia impartially, rather than carrying a particular POV as essays do. And no, that is not what I think about &quot;woman&quot; - as I have said repeatedly, I think what &quot;woman&quot; means depends on context, so part of our job as editors is not to parrot the words used in specific sources but to convey their meaning to our readers. P:MEDMOS also reminds us that we are writing for a q|the general reader and to avoid using jargon. I don't see anything in NOTOR that conflicts with other WP policies or guidelines; we are writing an encyclopedia, and q|writing our articles in a way the medical sources do not is part of our job, here as in any other highly technical or specialized area. ser:Newimpartial|Newimpartial (ser talk:Newimpartial|talk) 20:12, 22 December 2021 (UTC)
Supplement pages say, q|This page is not one of Wikipedia's policies or guidelines, as it has not been thoroughly vetted by the community.
Appealing to q|the general reader to override MEDRS usage discuss the subject is quite the argument. They all the more so simply use the words &quot;man&quot; and &quot;woman&quot; (rather than more complicated jargony constructions) to refer to male and female adults, as testified by any dictionary. Even you admit that the meaning can 'depend on context', so then let's accept that applies here as well. ser:Crossroads|Crossroads ser talk:Crossroads|-talk- 06:15, 23 December 2021 (UTC)

Three distinct issues at that article
Things seem to have coalesced into 3 distinct disputes. From lesser to greater general implications they are (1), whether a particular bullet point about the female reproductive system should include a statement about trans men and other genders, (2) whether the article should be split up into separate parts for &quot;sex&quot; and &quot;gender&quot; and whether they even are separable, and (3) whether the article can use &quot;men&quot; and &quot;women&quot; to refer to sexes. Per P:DUE and following the P:MEDRS sources, my view is (1) no (2) no (3) yes. But the article desperately needs editors who are willing to stick to MEDRS and are familiar with medical topics. ser:Crossroads|Crossroads ser talk:Crossroads|-talk- 20:12, 21 December 2021 (UTC) (Addendum: point 1 seems to be handled now with a unanimous &quot;no&quot; on the talk page. ser:Crossroads|Crossroads ser talk:Crossroads|-talk- 19:56, 22 December 2021 (UTC))
I would fall as (1) no (2) yes (3) no. But the framing is also biasing. I would ask you the question (4) &quot;q|should we use &quot;male&quot; to refer to people who present and look like &quot;men&quot;?&quot; To which my answer would be (4) no. We should use &quot;men.&quot; — ser:Shibbolethink|Shibbolethink (ser talk:Shibbolethink|♔ pecial:Contributions/Shibbolethink|♕) 20:35, 21 December 2021 (UTC)
In which case my answers would be: 1. no; 2. only as necessary (to the extent medical conditions can have anything to do with gender, that mostly belongs in a separate article, except where clarification is sorely needed, e.g. when it comes to hormone-linked disorders); 3. yes (following common usage in reliable medical sources – it is not WP's role to engage in language-change activism), but it is not always optimal; and 4. no, we should be more specific, e.g. &quot;males and trans-women&quot;, &quot;females and trans-men&quot;, or whatever is factually correct in the context (it might be quite specific, e.g. &quot;males including most trans-women, as well as trans-men who are receiving androgen therapy&quot;).  Using &quot;men&quot; for 4 is pretty much m|deliberately confusing to make a socio-political P:POINT, given that we know for uncontrovertible fact that medical literature uses &quot;men&quot; and &quot;males&quot;, or &quot;women&quot; and &quot;females&quot; interchangeably (except where boys or girls would also be affected, in which case &quot;males&quot; or &quot;females&quot; is more accurate than &quot;men&quot; or &quot;women&quot;, and most medical writers already understand that).  — ser:SMcCandlish|SMcCandlish ser talk:SMcCandlish|☏ pecial:Contributions/SMcCandlish|¢ 😼  14:30, 22 December 2021 (UTC)
I would tell you that your #3 and #4 are contradictory as applied to these articles. We have a few reviews which use the gender-based and sex-based terms interchangeably, and then we have guidelines written by expert committees in professional organizations like the AMA and the Institute of Medicine (and many others) which tell us not to use &quot;men&quot; to refer exclusively to members of the male sex. That's the state of things. — ser:Shibbolethink|Shibbolethink (ser talk:Shibbolethink|♔ pecial:Contributions/Shibbolethink|♕) 15:10, 22 December 2021 (UTC)
The AMA says nothing of the sort (and I don't know what source you are referring to with &quot;Institute of Medicine&quot;). Here is what the AMA Manual of Style, 11th edition (2020), actually says under [https://www.amamanualofstyle.com/view/10.1093/jama/9780190246556.001.0001/med-9780190246556-chapter-11-div1-28 11.7 Age and Sex Referents]: q|Adults are persons 18 years or older and should be referred to as men or women...Whenever possible, a patient should be referred to as a man, woman, boy, girl, or infant. Occasionally, however, a study group may comprise children and adults of both sexes. Then, the use of male and female as nouns is appropriate. Male and female are also appropriate adjectives. Neither that nor 11.12 Inclusive Language says anything about not using &quot;men&quot; to refer to the male sex. And the quote from 11.7 implicitly supports use of &quot;men&quot; and &quot;women&quot; to refer to sex. The rule you are proposing goes far beyond what is actually said.

As I said at the article, that National Academies source also nowhere makes the rule you are advocating for. They themselves use &quot;men&quot; and &quot;women&quot; to refer to sexes sometimes (see pages 120-121: [https://www.nap.edu/read/10028/chapter/7]). I am baffled as to why you are claiming these sources make rules they do not make. You are free to write how you want in your academic writing, but here on Wikipedia, since anyone can edit, we have to follow the usage in the sources.
The Lancet article also says things like q|women have X chromosomes from both parents, which cannot have anything to do with gender.

I don't think the above split into three numbered disputes is helpful, particularly when respondents then start going on about option 2 or option 3 as though we were as familiar with option 2 and option 3 as we are with words like &quot;American&quot; and &quot;European&quot;. If you think there are three separate disputes, open a section on each and discuss them separately. I'm uncomfortable that all three are closed yes/no questions for a topic that is complicated. Better to open the discussion for opinions than votes.More generally, I'm disappointed again that the politics of culture wars contaminates the discussion. Please can folk avoid putting our readers or other editors into derogatory boxes. Can we also stop repeating this nonsense that &quot;it is not WP's role to engage in language-change activism&quot;. It might sound like a plea for neutrality but language change is an ongoing natural process. While not all changes get accepted or endure, change doesn't have to be rational or sensible to everyone. It occurs regardless. People will vary on their journey and acceptance of changes depending on their age, geographics, class, politics, etc. It is natural for one to think one's own position is a default. To consider those proposing changes that appear novel as 'activists'. And to view those resisting changes you agree with and are happy to accommodate or accepted long ago, as 'conservatives'. And you may have your own choice political insults for labelling either of those groups. SMcCandlish, by claiming Wikipedia doesn't do &quot;language-change activism&quot;, you are, a bit  arrogantly I think, speaking as though on behalf of a wide and diverse editorship, and implicitly claiming your own position in whatever discussion is at hand is a neutral middle ground that all reasonable people on this global English-speaking project would be happy to accept. Therefore, only unreasonable people disagree with SMcCandlish. A more humble less confrontational approach would be for discussion participants to accept that reasonable people take a variety of positions on these matters. To do more listening and external/expert viewpoint gathering. And a whole lot less original-research-opinion-ranting that seems to permeate these talks. It is possible to discuss language choice for particular articles/statements without making false claims about what &quot;Wikipedia does/does not....&quot; or making it clear all other views are unreasonable and stupid.Unlike facts, where we are tied to our sources, Wikipedians have the freedom to write how they see fit, and to write with consideration for others, including those who have views we may not understand or accept. Our sources can be a useful guide but no more. I don't for example think French Wikipedians would accept anyone insisting they use the terms and idioms of their mainly English sources. Where our source can restrict what we say is that when they talk about group X and group Y and some editors wish to use different labels than 'X' and 'Y' or to extend 'X' into 'X and W', then this may be veering into original research if it is not obviously equivalent. We face that challenge whenever we paraphrase a source.My suggestion is that if we are to have a productive discussion at WP:MED about this, then perhaps a new section dealing with some specific matter, and absolutely no personal attacks or political rhetoric or fairy stories about Wikipedia.  -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 15:51, 22 December 2021 (UTC)
I decline to respond in any detail to this attempt to personalize both a style and a gender-and-sexuality discussion (both subjects under discretionary sanctions), other than to suggest that the above editor needs to re-read P:NOT#ADVOCACY; and to make the should-be-obvious points that a) language changing over time does not mean that WP accepts every language change proposition (rather, our style is based on predominant style across reliable sources on English usage), and b) the positions various organizations advocate on such matters are all primary sources (organizational opinion about their internal preferences)   what we care about is usage across all the RS source material, not what this or that particular entity would prefer.  As to m|that matter, Crossroads has already poked various holes in the overbroad claims being made about such positions, above, so I needn't do it again.  Yes, pushing for unnatural English usage that does not comport with common usage in reliable sources is advocacy. Yes, pushing for WP to adopt such a pattern because some cherry-picked third party allegedly prefers it is advocacy.  — ser:SMcCandlish|SMcCandlish ser talk:SMcCandlish|☏ pecial:Contributions/SMcCandlish|¢ 😼  02:03, 23 December 2021 (UTC)
ser:SMcCandlish, I can't help that the words I disagree with are yours and hence singled-out in this particular case. I think some people in the language debate think there are only 'them', who they label 'activists', and 'us, normal reasonable people'. But to observers of these MOS debates, and observers of the wider culture wars, there are very much two sides. Both sides are using article talk pages and MOS talk pages to P:SOAPBOX their personal opinions, though it is clear that the culture war politics, insults and rants do seem mainly coming from one side. The huge personal-opinion posts that regularly appear (from many editors) in MOS discussions fail P:SOAPBOX regardless of which side in the political-social debate one lies on. My point is that 'activism' is in the mind of the writer, determined by their own 'default' and politics, and labelling 'other' people this way is a short-cut to blocking off viewpoints one disagrees with, rather than finding more constructive ways to consider, understand, and work towards consensus.Our style is not in fact entirely based on that of reliable sources: our articles do not read like medical journals or newspapers. It may be an oft-repeated claim in MOS discussions that we are slave to our sources when it comes to words, terms and idioms, but that argument is made when those sources happen to align with the viewpoint being argued. Other times those sources are dismissed as 'experts' or 'journalists' who have nothing to tell us about how to write an encyclopaedia. The truth lies in between. Our sources can be a very useful guide, and as I noted above, sometimes we must stick close to them for no-original-research reasons.The phrase 'unnatural English usage' just makes me shiver. The word 'unnatural' has been used historically to refer to white and black people marrying, or two men holding hands, and I guess a lot of people think being trans is 'unnatural'. It isn't a helpful word. -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 09:49, 23 December 2021 (UTC) 
Just more socio-politically motivated tone policing.  If you can't understand that &quot;natural&quot; in a linguistic context has a completely different sense that is in no way related to racist and phobic labeling of groups of people, then you are not P:COMPETENT to be participating in a discussion about language usage.  m|You are the one engaging in &quot;othering&quot; here, engaging in a blatant attempt to demonize your &quot;opponents&quot; for activistic reasons.

Hear, here. &quot;othering&quot; people we disagree with is a great way to make a dispute go on forever, and all around to be a real jerk. I could not agree with this comment more. bI would say that I do empathize with where some of the editors here come from, though I may disagree with their end-resulting opinion. It is undeniably true that trans persons are the very low minority. It is undeniably true that 99% of females at birth grow up to be women, and males men. But that does not mean we should write imprecisely or vaguely. And it does not mean we should mix and match terms in a way that is discouraged by professional medical organizations... That's my overall position, and it has nothing to do with &quot;advocating&quot; for any groups. I'm a scientist, and I think we should write precisely, in a way compatible with the consensus opinion of scientists. My guess is that others would disagree with me on what that consensus opinion is. — ser:Shibbolethink|Shibbolethink (ser talk:Shibbolethink|♔ pecial:Contributions/Shibbolethink|♕) 15:57, 22 December 2021 (UTC)

Colin's points notwithstanding, I just want to say that I appreciate reading an abbreviation here of what is going on over there.  I am reluctant to wade in over there, but hope that if a decent RFC is formulated, we'll be made aware here.b Not an insignificant part of not wanting to wade in over there (besides the usual polarization rather than focus on sources) is that I despair when I look at articles with so many issues, and yet, people arguing only about one part of an article with many other problems.
* q|sex-related diseases, which are diseases that are more common to one sex ... how about conditions rather than diseases to account for male-predominance in things like autism and ourette syndrome, which often never comes to clinical attention.
* q| and diseases which occur at similar rates in males and females but manifest differently according to sex, ditto for above, eg, there is new research that TS manifests differently in females. (See MID|34364945 which is a review.)
* Why is the article titled in medicine, when it could be in health and medicine, which would provide a better anchor to P:MEDRS and allow for conditions that don't come to clinical attention, like TS?
* Ugh ... q|That said, both biological and behavioural differences influence human health, and may do so differentially. Such factors can be inter-related and difficult to separate. In the lead.  How about ... 
** Biological and behavioural differences influence human health, may do so differentially, and can be inter-related and difficult to separate.
* Screaming original research and UNDUE in the lead: q|As of 2021 over 10,000 articles had been published addressing sex and gender differences in clinical medicine and related literature.  
* Why are there access dates on journal articles, and why do the sources included editorials (eg MID|32357237 MID|34750117) in the lead, no less. And case studies, like MID|28179807. So often disputes can be avoided by focusing on cleaning up the sourcing!  Like adding a PMID at Hayter, SM; Cook, MC. 
* The lead has a More recently sentence that uses a 2012 source; see OS:CURRENT.  (I like the paragraph as it precisely describes what is going on with TS.
* And after the lead, the article descends into indiscriminate lists rather than prose, when cohesive paragraphs could be written, grouping like topics, eg neurological disorders of childhood onset like autism and TS.

Sorry to dump all of this here, but similar is a big part of why I try to avoid engaging disputes over one issue at articles that need cleanup of multiple issues, that could partially help address problems.

Access dates are pointless for journals, they have fixed-dated publications. They're sometimes kept when a url is given, mostly because it can be useful to look up dead link on a webarchiving service. But that you read a 1982 paper on 10 July 2015 or 9 September 2021 is useless information.  ser:Headbomb|Headbomb {ser talk:Headbomb|t · pecial:Contributions/Headbomb|c · P:PHYS|p · P:WBOOKS|b} 02:09, 23 December 2021 (UTC)

 The clear and long-standing practice is established at ikipedia:Citing sources#Journal articles (which does not mention accessdates, and can be contrasted with ikipedia:Citing sources#Web pages, which can and do frequently change and need access dates for that reason).  The importance of access dates is relative to content that can change, and one of the most important functions of the accessdate is that it allows one to look up that version of a changing page at archive.org, as well as to see if the content has changed since the content was added to Wikipedia. That is why one of the only three times that our content guideline mentions accessdates at all (besides for web pages) is ikipedia:Citing sources#Preventing and repairing dead links. Journal source content doesn't change.  I have never, in fifteen years, seen an editor add or change an accessdate to a journal to indicate that they have checked that the text is verified. Nor am I aware of any editor who routinely adds accessdates to journal citations. Our guideline page, ikipedia:Citing sources, correctly summarizes the actual best practice. It also explicitly states that q|For web-only sources with no publication date, the &quot;Retrieved&quot; date (or the date you accessed the web page) should be included, in case the web page changes in the future. For example: Retrieved 15 July 2011 or you can use the access-date parameter in the automatic Wikipedia:refToolbar 2.0 editing window feature. I shudder to think of the mess that would be introduced if our densely-cited medical articles had access-dates on every journal citation. They would add precisely nothing other than bulk to the page. |Nikkimaria may have something to add on this. ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  02:12, 23 December 2021 (UTC)

 DMA-assisted psychotherapy 
The lead claims: &quot;The research is controversial due to the risks of taking MDMA recreationally, made evident by the illegal and unregulated use of MDMA in the form of ecstasy[3] and also due to its unpredictable neurochemical effects.[4][5] There were 92 MDMA related deaths in England and Wales in 2018, up from 56 the year before,[6] and 10,000 hospitalizations for MDMA related illness/injury in 2011 in the US.[3]&quot;

This is mixing apples with oranges. The fact that there are risks related to substance abuse involving MDMA says nothing about whether research on therapeutic use of MDMA is controversial. And thus unsurprisingly, the sources don't say that &quot;the research is controversial&quot;.

The sources for fatalities and hospitalisations is an article from the Guardian, and this article makes it clear that these figures relate to substance abuse. It says in a quote &quot;MDMA use under medical supervision is a world away from someone necking a load of pills at a rave&quot;. Likewise, the other two sources, one of which has been added yesterday, again, don't say that &quot;this research is controversial&quot;, the effects they report again seem to relate to substance abuse, and it most cases, a mix of substances was to blame: On admittance, the intoxicated MDMA user is typically under the influence of additional drugs, and this observation has instigated controversies regarding the toxicity of MDMA alone. In a survey of 202 ecstasy-related deaths in the UK in the period 1996–2002, MDMA was the sole drug detected in merely 17% of cases [40].

I have looked into several systematic reviews and clinical trials  on the use of MDMA in psychotherapy, especially treatment of PTSD and they all unanimously conclude that clinical controlled use is safe and effective. I haven't seen any reputable sources disputing this claim. Therefore I do find the claim that it is &quot;controversial&quot; unsubstantiated and unwarranted. --ser:Johannes Rohr|Johannes Rohr (ser talk:Johannes Rohr|talk) 08:09, 31 December 2021 (UTC)

 Well... there is still the question of whether the current summary acurately summarizes the literature. And a question of nuance: amongst which people is it controversial. I care about controversy amongst practitioners rather more than controversy amongst lawyers and politicians.
 On the question of the safety of MDMA, I think this has been reasonably well studied within the context of harm reduction.

Is &quot;the research&quot; controversial?  Or maybe it's &quot;the conclusions&quot; that are controversial?  For example, about half a century ago, there was some wildly unethical research into whether sugar causes tooth decay.  It concluded that if you ate extra-sticky candy and never brushed your teeth, you would have more dental problems than if you didn't eat sticky candy and did brush your teeth.

Well, the researchers are only a small part of the &quot;experts in this field&quot;. The major part of this group are psychotherapist who are wondering if this drug might be a useful adjunct.

This is a strawman.The sources you have added now do not back up the claim that the research is controversial because of fatalities and hospitalisations related to recreational use, and the source providing such figures explicitly says that recreational use and clinical use have nothing to do with each other.

One of the two sources you added concludes: &quot;In summary, MDMA-assisted psychotherapy is a promising approach to helping people who have experienced psychological trauma and who have not been able toresolve their resulting problems through existing treatment options. Research into its effectiveness, safety and long-term benefits is still in its infancy, however there is already a great deal of misunderstanding of its aims and findings in the academic literature. If this is to get the research attention it deserves, it is essential that we report this accurately and objectively. MDMA may provide a bridge to effectively overcome the gap between psychotherapy and psychopharmacology, thereby facilitating the integration of an exciting new holistic approach to psychopathology [53] and “...we must not allow preconceptions, politics or puritanism...” [52, p. 420] or misinformation to get in the way of this.

Now you force me to quote from the sources:
* The item in the text is this one: &quot;The research is controversial&quot;
* First source: &quot;MDMA is a unique type of drug with positive acute effects which led Alexander Shulgin to suggest that it might be useful for psychotherapy (Shulgin 1986). However, several issues need to be addressed before MDMA can be accepted as a safe co-drug for therapy. First, acute MDMA can stimulate the release of difficult feelings and memories, which may be distressing. Second, the emergent material can be susceptible to environmental influences and this also makes the MDMA-induced experiences difficult to control. Hence, there may be clinical reactions to this powerful and unpredictable drug (Greer &amp; Tolbert 1986; Parrott 2007). There is also the issue of neurochemical recovery afterwards, when negative moods tend to predominate. This period of negative cognitions may be counter-productive, especially in psychiatrically vulnerable clients, for instance those with predispositions to anxiety, depression, or psychosis. For example, it could increase the likelihood of suicide in those individuals with strong post-recovery feelings of depression. (PMID 24830184)
* Second source: &quot;Small-scale studies have shown reduced psychological trauma, however there has been widespread misunderstanding of the aims and implications of this work, most commonly the notion that MDMA is a ‘treatment for PTSD’, which to date has not been researched. This has harmful consequences, namely dangerous media reporting and impeding research progression in an already controversial field.&quot; (PMID: 32435270)
* Also 2nd source: &quot;Research into the clinical use of illegal substances is highly controversial and misrepresentation of the research hampers progress in a field already fraught with legal and political challenges. MDMA was classed as a Schedule 1 drug in 1986 by the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971 [28], meaning it is illegal and considered to be dangerous without therapeutic value, thus carrying out clinical research with MDMA is extremely difficult. Under the convention, the use of Schedule 1 substances is severely restricted.&quot; (PMID: 32435270)

FWIW the research is absolutely controversial. There is a concerted push to loosen/change restrictions to open the way for therapeutic use currently, which is engendering alot of discussion here in Oz and no doubt elsewhere. ser:Casliber|Cas Liber (ser talk:Casliber|talk · pecial:Contributions/Casliber|contribs) 20:53, 2 January 2022 (UTC)
 Source 1 is pretty compelling and not insanely old (2014) and provides a reasoning to &quot;controversial&quot;, but controversial in a different way to that described in the current lede. 2 and 3 clearly say that this is controversial; but it's annoying that controversial is kind of &quot;throwaway&quot; statement here without much dicussion. Source 2 makes clear that research is made difficult because the drug is illegal, and that the research is misunderstood (MDMA is a therapeutic aid for talking therapy rather than a direct treatment for PTSD within these approaches).
 It's kinda funny for me reading about all the &quot;controversial&quot; side effects in the &quot;controversy&quot; section because a whole bunch of them apply to antidepressants and some pain killers as well (see regabaline or etamine). Antidepressants are known to &quot;trigger&quot; psychosis. It's like we have a list of the side effects of some of the most commonly prescribed drugs that people use chronically (and often for the same conditions) and using it to say that something is dangerous when used once.  Of course... I don't know whether a source will discuss this irony (added: and it is accurate that these therapies have risks that don't exist in talking therapies). --edited to fix up some grammar ser:Talpedia|Talpedia (ser talk:Talpedia|talk) 22:27, 2 January 2022 (UTC)
Saidmann, the lead currently reports the number of hospitalizations due to recreational use.  That seems pretty much irrelevant to me.  Then it provides an uncited statement that zero hospitalizations have happened as a result of clinical use.  This seems to confirm my feeling that these statistics are irrelevant to the subject of this article.  
I notice, too, that the body of the article discusses nothing about recreational harms that sounds more serious than getting the munchies.  Why are these statistics in the lead if (a) they don't apply to clinical use and (b) they aren't important enough to discuss at all in the body of the article? ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 23:25, 2 January 2022 (UTC)
It was not me who put this stuff into the lead. I only added appropriate sources. Would it be ok to move this section from the lead to the body of the article? --ser:Saidmann|Saidmann (ser talk:Saidmann|talk) 12:12, 3 January 2022 (UTC)
It's better than leaving it in the lead, but maybe it should just be removed entirely.  There's a potentially serious P:SYNTH problem in talking about how many recreational overdoses there are – rather like saying that we've got to be careful about medical use of a lucose-elevating agent, because eating too much sugar is unhealthy.
I also wonder if the &quot;due to&quot; wording in that sentence will hold up under close examination.  I'll post more on the article's talk page. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 21:26, 3 January 2022 (UTC)

Red meat and cancer

There has been a decent discussion on the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Red_meat talk-page] of the article ed meat about the use of an umbrella review that looked at 72 meta-analyses related to red and processed meat intake and cancer but further input is needed so a consensus can be drawn. The abstract concluded that &quot;Dose-response analyses revealed that 100 g/d increment of red meat and 50 g/d increment of processed meat consumption were associated with 11%-51% and 8%-72% higher risk of multiple cancer outcomes, respectively, and seemed to be not correlated with any benefit.&quot; [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0308814621007032]. This sounds significant but according to a user who actually has full access to the paper &quot;most studies included in this umbrella review were meta-analyses of observational studies, which are recognised as low quality in the grade of evidence. As a result, most evidence of outcomes was considered as very low or low quality with GRADE classification. Secondly, associations between red and processed meat consumption and cancer outcomes might be affected by several confounding factors&quot;. The same user also has noted that &quot;The 51% increased relative risk figure in the abstract turns out to be one paper for endometrial cancer.&quot; The discussion on the talk-page has been about the GRADE system because on this grading system observational studies are considered of low-quality compared to randomized controlled trials. 

Users have stated that the GRADE system is usually used for clinical trials and is not often used for observational studies which involve large populations. We have a Wikipedia article on GRADE explaining what it is he Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. The discussion between users on the talk-page has been about if the text on the article summarizing this umbrella review should mention the GRADE system or not which would obviously classify it as low quality but as another user pointed out this has not been done for other meta-analyses of observational studies that are cited on the red meat article or others. In conclusion there seems to be some mixed viewpoints about the review. As there has only been four users involved in this discussion (including myself) an expert opinion or different viewpoint from experienced WikiProject medicine editors would be of use so a consensus can be drawn up about this source and we should include it or not.

Runaway success and underfunding have led to growing pains for the preprint server

What started in 1989 as an e-mail list for a few dozen string theorists has now grown to a collection of more than two million papers—and the central hub for physicists, astronomers, computer scientists, mathematicians and other researchers. On January 3 the preprint server arXiv.org crossed the milestone with a numerical analysis paper entitled “Affine Iterations and Wrapping Effect: Various Approaches.” (The Library of Alexandria, for comparison, is believed to have contained no more than hundreds of thousands of manuscripts.)

 Medical care of trans teens 

WPATH has released the latest draft of their guidelines, which adds a new chapter that recommends adolescents not be treated like adults.  [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/13/health/transgender-teens-hormones.html?action=click&amp;algo=bandit-all-surfaces_impression_cut_3&amp;alpha=0.05&amp;block=more_in_recirc&amp;fellback=false&amp;imp_id=601447673&amp;impression_id=952f9694-75bf-11ec-9085-05b28995c452&amp;index=1&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;pool=more_in_pools%2Fwell®ion=footer&amp;req_id=700188032&amp;surface=eos-more-in&amp;variant=0_bandit-all-surfaces_impression_cut_3 Reportedly], this is causing some consternation in some circles.  I think, based on the little I've seen, that the main source of concern is WPATH is stating [https://www.wpath.org/media/cms/Documents/SOC%20v8/SOC8%20Chapters%20for%20Public%20Comment/SOC8%20Chapter%20Draft%20for%20Public%20Comment%20-%20Adolescent.pdf?_t=1638731433 in Statement 12B] that the &quot;persistent&quot; part of the &quot;insistent, persistent, and consistent&quot; mantra means several years for children and teens, which seems to be significantly longer than some would prefer.  This statement is only about medical/surgical – not social – transition.

They are also recommending a &quot;comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment&quot; before starting medical transition.  (I have seen this recommendation before, usually with the explanation that medical transition is hard enough on its own, so nobody should have to transition medically while also dealing with untreated anxiety or depression.)

All of which is to say:  Expect edit warring and stressed editors in the trans-related articles this year.  The updated guidelines are supposed to be released in a few months. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 00:01, 17 January 2022 (UTC)
Really appreciate the heads up, and I've seen these coming down the pipeline for a year or two. There's just too much controversy about reversion and increased risks of medical transition. We have a lot more data about the cancer risks, the psychosocial risks (namely, assault and murder), and the surgical/endocrine risks of transitioning. Frankly, from my perspective as someone in healthcare who has volunteered at trans health clinics, I feel these were a long time coming. There's just slightly too much risk involved for adolescents and teens to be going through this when they aren't really really damn sure its what they want.bBut it will be used as fodder for all sorts of POV warriors. Anti-trans folk will be foaming at the mouth to reference this as a reason for why transgender therapy is dangerous, even though this is showing that transition is safe when done appropriately (and the reversion numbers really are extremely low: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6212091]). Pro-trans folk will be livid at the implication of reversion and medicalization of psychiatric problems as reason for increased transition numbers (even though that's reversing the causality). But ultimately our encyclopedic job is just to represent these as a thing that happened. That did not actually change much about being a transgender person, but will be fuel to the fire of opinion and (often warranted, but also harmful) distrust of the medical establishment. — ser:Shibbolethink|Shibbolethink (ser talk:Shibbolethink|♔ pecial:Contributions/Shibbolethink|♕) 00:12, 17 January 2022 (UTC)

Those sources are a bit apples-and-oranges in nature.  The first asks surgeons how many people they've done top or bottom surgery for and how many people told them that they regretted it.  If you regret it and/or detransition without involving one of these surgeons, then your experience is missed by this survey.  The second asks current LGBTQ+ people about any type of transition, including social transition (e.g., a female who socially transitions to being a man, and then later &quot;detransitions&quot; to being non-binary).  If you detransition and no longer identify as LGBTQ+, or if you otherwise didn't participate in a survey that is marketed as being for trans folks only, then your experience is missed by this survey.  Neither of these sources are comprehensive; all of them will miss some people.  I wouldn't necessarily say that one is better than the other.  They measure different things, to the best of their ability. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:37, 17 January 2022 (UTC)

I believe that all the underlying data can be accessed separately, outside of this tool, if someone wanted to download the raw data and analyze it independently.  I'm not sure how images are handled in that data.
We should probably have an article/section redirect for mpty referer; TTP referer explains some of the background.  I understand that when you visit a webpage, we think we're sending just &quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine&quot; to the internet, but the web browsers are actually sending more information in the background, such as the page we were reading when we clicked the link to this page.  That kind of information isn't present under some circumstances, such as if you visit a bookmarked link, hand-type the URL, or have a browser plug-in that prevents transmission of referers.  I think it could fairly be understood as meaning &quot;we don't know where this reader came from&quot;. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:27, 20 January 2022 (UTC)

 Analysis of Wikipedia COVID-19 articles

Here is the abstract from a recently published article.

Abstract

Background

With the COVID-19 pandemic's outbreak, millions flocked to Wikipedia for updated information. Amid growing concerns regarding an &quot;infodemic,&quot; ensuring the quality of information is a crucial vector of public health. Investigating whether and how Wikipedia remained up to date and in line with science is key to formulating strategies to counter misinformation. Using citation analyses, we asked which sources informed Wikipedia's COVID-19–related articles before and during the pandemic's first wave (January–May 2020).

Results

We found that coronavirus-related articles referenced trusted media outlets and high-quality academic sources. Regarding academic sources, Wikipedia was found to be highly selective in terms of what science was cited. Moreover, despite a surge in COVID-19 preprints, Wikipedia had a clear preference for open-access studies published in respected journals and made little use of preprints. Building a timeline of English-language COVID-19 articles from 2001–2020 revealed a nuanced trade-off between quality and timeliness. It further showed how pre-existing articles on key topics related to the virus created a framework for integrating new knowledge. Supported by a rigid sourcing policy, this &quot;scientific infrastructure&quot; facilitated contextualization and regulated the influx of new information. Last, we constructed a network of DOI-Wikipedia articles, which showed the landscape of pandemic-related knowledge on Wikipedia and how academic citations create a web of shared knowledge supporting topics like COVID-19 drug development.

Conclusions

Understanding how scientific research interacts with the digital knowledge-sphere during the pandemic provides insight into how Wikipedia can facilitate access to science. It also reveals how, aided by what we term its &quot;citizen encyclopedists,&quot; it successfully fended off COVID-19 disinformation and how this unique model may be deployed in other contexts.

 Spices and antioxidants 

The pice article says:
Most herbs and spices have substantial antioxidant activity, owing primarily to phenolic compounds, especially flavonoids, which influence nutrition through many pathways, including affecting the absorption of other nutrients. One study found cumin and fresh ginger to be highest in antioxidant activity.
and cites one article entitled &quot;Antioxidant capacity of vegetables, spices and dressings relevant to nutrition&quot;. That article simply measures &quot;antioxidant capacity measured by the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC)&quot; for various foods. I see some problems here:
* The original article does not support the claim of nutritional value.
* It is only one article, not a review.
* The article is mostly about vegetables and herbs, not spices.

@ser:Macrakis|Macrakis, @ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing: Hey folks. I am not sure if I agree with this &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot; presumption for text that appears either unsourced, or source poorly, or sourced only by a primary source, on many levels. Reasoning for unsourced or poorly sourced is probably clear. With regard to primary sources, I would just point out the ease that there is in finding some primary source, published somewhere, that supports an opinion that an editor wishes to present (whether it reflects the preponderance of scientific perspective, or not). Too, there is an economic argument to be made—consider how much time it would take to review all STEM statements in WP now wither unsupported by a citation, or sourced to a poor or primary source. It is much easier to expect of the original editor that they comply with WP:VERIFY with regard to secondary and good sources, and not place material until a good secondary source is found. (If doing it at start, by the interested and hopefully informed editor, takes X amount of time, in my experience, doing it afterward, by a general and possibly less informed editor takes 5X or more time—especially if you follow P:SAYWHEREYOUREADIT, and expect the incoming editor to really read the source being subbed in.) Is there not a better way to approach this, that sends the right signal—to not place text without sources, or text with poor/only primary sources in the first place?

Not entirely accurate. Bolnick et al. says that it will 'outline the current recommendations from the major medical organizations' at the beginning of the chapter, and at the end of the chapter discusses what was common between the policy statements that were reviewed.
