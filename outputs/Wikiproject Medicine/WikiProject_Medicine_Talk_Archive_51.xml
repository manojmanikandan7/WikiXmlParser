		<segment id="id43294782">Apology

Having had some time to consider the events of the last week, I'd like to offer an apology to Doc James in the same forum in which I took something of a public shot at him.  I believe I raised my concerns in an overly emotional and confrontational way, and did a lousy job of enunciating the real basis for my concerns regarding the &quot;P&quot; journal. I'm going to take some time off to reconsider whether and how I can be more effective here. 

This note is not intended as a fishing expedition for expressions of any sort from the community, but simply as an acknowledgement that I mishandled my conflict with Doc, who has for the most part been very accomodating of my POV, which on some issues is very different from his own. I'd also like to apologize to the community for the histrionics.  (Maybe an SSRI would help.....)  () 21:14, 5 July 2014 (UTC)
Formerly 98 I view your work here as positive. Yes we have a slightly different position on the &quot;P&quot; source but generally I think we are in agreement around most things. Look forwards to seeing you back and working together in the future. [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 21:56, 5 July 2014 (UTC)
Can someone (briefly) catch me up here? What is it that happened? I'm not asking to open wounds here, I'm just wondering if I can help in any way and I'm wondering what is being debated with such intensity.  () 05:57, 6 July 2014 (UTC)
The two expert editors, signing at the top of this section, were briefly characterizing some aspects of  Pharma and Medicine, namely the possibility of others gaming the processes of the encyclopedia, versus potential clinical value of some contribution, in only a few sentences. But they were thinking several steps ahead of what they actually wrote, and their ideals entangled. (My personal reading: it's all good.) OK?  --   14:43, 6 July 2014 (UTC)
Ok.  () 16:30, 6 July 2014 (UTC)
I do not think we were commenting on gaming the processes of Wikipedia. We were discussing the different ways in which systematic reviews are produced and the issues with the various methods. [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 03:24, 7 July 2014 (UTC)
My concern, which I completely failed to enunciate in a way that anyone could understand and respond to, is that Prescrire very clearly makes claims to be more reliable than other sources based on its policy of excluding from its processes not just those with conflicts of interest with respect to a specific topic, but anyone with any relationship with the pharmaceutical industry at all.  It was my impression that Jmh49 was specifically endorsing this viewpoint, which was of considerable concern to me given his obvious and well-earned position of influence. As a member of this (pharma associated) group (and one who is somewhat proud of his career and personal accomplishments) I'd find it very helpful to have some clarification on this and whether this is Wikipedia Medicine's position going forward.   () 22:59, 7 July 2014 (UTC)
To clarify, it is also not my position that Prescrire is more reliable than other sources such as Cochrane reviews or USPSTF reviews. If we use Prescrire it is important to state that Prescrire is a French perspective. It is also of course just a single perspective.

Beware of more quackery

In the past few months, supporters of quackery and mind-body therapies have succeeded in publishing a number of woo articles in various medical journals. Here are some brilliant examples:

1. Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences: [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nyas.12316/full Transcendental experiences during meditation practice] (December 2013)

2. Nature Reviews Neurology: [http://www.nature.com/nrneurol/journal/v10/n3/fig_tab/nrneurol.2014.12_T1.html Effects of meditation in patients with chronic pain] (January 2014)

4. JAMA: [http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1809754 Meditation Programs for Psychological Stress and Well-being] (March 2014)

5. Frontiers in Psychology: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4005947/?report=classic Meditation as a Therapeutic Intervention for Adults at Risk for Alzheimer’s Disease] (April 2014)

6. Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience: [http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fnagi.2014.00120/abstract Mindfulness and the aging brain: a proposed paradigm shift] (June 2014)

7. British Journal of General Practice: [http://bjgp.org/content/64/624/368.short Practical tips for using mindfulness in general practice] (July 2014)

8. PLOS ONE - [http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0100903  The Effects of Mind-Body Therapies on the Immune System: Meta-Analysis] (July 2014)

It appears that every 2-3 weeks, another one of such articles are repeatedly thrown into medical literature, for whatever reason I do not know. Does any of them satisfy  criteria? If not, more eyes may be needed at articles related to meditation or mind-body therapies. Also, now may be a good time to enforce broader and stricter  on Wikipedia to prevent fringe POV editors from promoting fringe quackery. - () 15:57, 6 July 2014 (UTC)

There's no good reason to label any of that as pseudoscience.  There is of course a lot of pseudoscience associated with meditation, but there is nothing unscientific about the idea that behaviors such as focusing attention on one thing for a period of time can produce alterations in brain state that are worth studying and potentially beneficial.  I'm not even stating a minority opinion here -- I believe the majority of neuroscientists view this the same way I do.  () 18:54, 6 July 2014 (UTC)
I think  applies here.  || 19:22, 6 July 2014 (UTC)

(ec) I gotta go with Looie496 on this.  Without going into a deep critique or analysis of the papers listed by A1candidate, we know that patients who are generally relaxed and happy tend to do better than patients who are anxious and depressed, especially with regard to things like pain management.  This is pretty basic Psych 101 stuff.  Obviously anyone who offers a mechanistic explanation involving the movement of qi from the spleen to the colon is spouting mystical bullshit, but encouraging an internal locus of control can have tangible benefits.  (Whether this makes meditation a particularly potent placebo or a genuine intervention is arguably a matter of semantics.) () 19:26, 6 July 2014 (UTC)
The paper in JAMA (the only one I checked) is a systematic review.  A systematic review is not generally considered a &quot;woo article&quot;, regardless of its subject, and quackery is when you reject the data, not when the data shows that something that you dislike works despite your dislike (or that something you do like doesn't work).   () 23:20, 6 July 2014 (UTC)
Agree with WAID. A few of these are primary sources. The JAMA meta-analysis concludes &quot;small to moderate reductions of multiple negative dimensions of psychological stress.&quot;, &quot;Stronger study designs are needed to determine the effects of meditation programs in improving the positive dimensions of mental health and stress-related behavior&quot; and &quot;We found no evidence that meditation programs were better than any active treatment (ie, drugs, exercise, and other behavioral therapies).&quot; so not exactly an endorsement. [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 03:44, 7 July 2014 (UTC)
These are the first two sentences in their conclusion:
&quot;Clinicians should be aware that meditation programs can result in small to moderate reductions of multiple negative dimensions of psychological stress. Thus, clinicians should be prepared to talk with their patients about the role that a meditation program could have in addressing psychological stress.&quot; (emphasis mine)

The words highlighted in italics certainly sound like an endorsement or even a guideline (&quot;be prepared to talk with their patients about the role that a meditation program could have&quot;), although it's good to know that they have acknowledged some limitations in their study. What is more worrying is how JAMA has turned into a sellout advertising board for quackery as demonstrated by a [http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1730519 recent commentary (2013)]:

&quot;For some mind-body approaches, however, there is mounting evidence of usefulness and safety, particularly in relieving chronic pain. A few examples include acupuncture for osteoarthritis pain; tai chi for fibromyalgia pain; and massage, spinal manipulation, and yoga for chronic back pain.

Increasing comfort with this emerging evidence is reflected in practice guidelines from the American College of Physicians, the American Pain Society, and the Department of Defense.&quot;

And just a few months ago in March 2014, they endorsed &quot;[http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1835483 Acupuncture for Chronic Pain]&quot; with a highly dubious claim that &quot;Acupuncture is associated with improved pain outcomes compared with sham-acupuncture&quot;, although every skeptic knows that there is ultimately no difference between acupuncture and sham acupuncture.

As [[User talk:QuackGuru|User:QuackGuru]] recently [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAcupuncture&amp;diff=610011033&amp;oldid=610007345 observed], many of these articles, such as this [http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1357513 fake meta-analysis] pointed out by him, are in fact pseudo-systematic reviews funded by the quackery trade. In contrast to some forms of meditation, there is clear consensus that acupuncture is by every measure pseudoscientific. Why did you, Doc James, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAcupuncture&amp;diff=610038497&amp;oldid=610031618 tell QuackGuru] that you see &quot;no problems with (using) it&quot;?

Remember, we're only talking about JAMA so far. I think the problem is far worse at some other reputable journals - () 07:21, 7 July 2014 (UTC)
 maybe you should quote what QG actually state which was &quot;A pseudo-systematic review funded by the trade?&quot; And yes I do not see a problem with using it. [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 08:40, 7 July 2014 (UTC)
 - I'm more skeptical to overbearing claims such as yours: although every skeptic knows that there is ultimately no difference between acupuncture and sham acupuncture., than something from a systematic review. To me this sounds far more like you are disregarding evidence against your viewpoint. -- [[User:CFCF|CFCF]]  () 10:01, 7 July 2014 (UTC)
I'm with CFCF here:  woo is when you say that anything that you've decided is &quot;alternative&quot; can't work because you magically know that it doesn't work.  Science is when you say that the evidence suggests that (in this case) meditation might have some value for some situations, so therefore you agree that it might not be completely worthless.  
In this case, the possibility for benefit seems so highly plausible to me that it's odd there was ever any truly serious question about it:  Meditation practices a core mental skill, described in our article on the subject as &quot;training attention and awareness in order to bring mental processes under greater voluntary control&quot;, that a person with anxiety often needs to improve, namely being able to focus on whatever task is at hand instead of letting the mind wander off into whatever is worrying you.  Acquiring the basic mental skills to focus on whatever you choose, rather than being incapacitated by uncontrolled worrying, does not sound like &quot;woo&quot; to me.   () 15:17, 7 July 2014 (UTC)
The OP was being sarcastic.  || 15:45, 7 July 2014 (UTC)
 I'm not being sarcastic when I say that a putative review which includes in its abstract the phrases &quot;&quot; is a woo paper, despite being published by NY Academy of Sciences. I accept that your mileage may vary, of course. -- () 16:00, 7 July 2014 (UTC)

When a prestigious journal publishes a pseudoscientific article/review
 

I feel that what  pointed out is a very important point: [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nyas.12316/full This paper] deals with topics that appear to be pseudoscientific (&quot;cosmic consciousness&quot;), yet it is published by a well-established academic journal - The Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences - which has a considerable impact factor. The question I want to ask is this:

Where do we draw the line to separate science from pseudoscience?

The same journal, in the same issue, also published a [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nyas.12348/full systematic review] claiming to have found preliminary evidence that &quot;meditation can offset age-related cognitive decline&quot;. Are we supposed to accept or reject this claim? How can we be sure that the editors of the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences aren't deliberately publishing pseudoscientific reviews? - () 19:32, 7 July 2014 (UTC)
This review states &quot; Growing evidence suggests that cognitive training programs may have the potential to counteract this decline. On the basis of a growing body of research that shows that meditation has positive effects on cognition in younger and middle-aged adults, meditation may be able to offset normal age-related cognitive decline or even enhance cognitive function in older adults.&quot; followed by &quot;Studies involved a wide variety of meditation techniques and reported preliminary positive effects on attention, memory, executive function, processing speed, and general cognition. However, most studies had a high risk of bias and small sample sizes.&quot;
This could be summarized as &quot;Low quality evidence suggests a possible benefit from meditation with respect to age-related cognitive decline&quot;. This is hardly revolutionary. We know that learning a second language can be beneficial [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22464592] as may mind games.

 ...So unlike with homeopathy in the case of (various types of) meditation active therapeutic effects are biologically plausible. (At the same time, I do agree with  that parts at least of that conference supplement are really rather wooey.)  () 20:53, 7 July 2014 (UTC)
I agree with A1candidate that this is a real matter for concern.  How do we &quot;know&quot;?  
If the answer is that we must re-examine the credibility of a journal (that was previously considered well-established and reliable) whenever it publishes something that seems woo to some editors, I think this sets us up to do a lot of original research, and makes the acceptability of a particular journal subject to the views/prejudices/interests of the currently active editors.   () 20:34, 7 July 2014 (UTC)

If a high quality source publishes something that &quot;some&quot; editors see as &quot;woo&quot;, is it still a high quality source?   () 03:15, 8 July 2014 (UTC)
If a high-quality source publishes something that knee surgeons disagree with, is it still a high-quality source?  I think so—and whatever the game, whatever the rules, the rules are the same for both sides.  If a journal is still, overall, a good source despite publishing something controversial about conventional medicine, then it's still a good source despite publishing something controversial about alternative medicine.   () 06:26, 8 July 2014 (UTC)
Even if we generally accept the journal, what about the controversial article itself? I'm referring to this one on [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nyas.12316/full transcendental experiences during meditation], in particular. It may not be a systematic review, but it's still a secondary source published in a reputable scientific journal. - () 08:09, 8 July 2014 (UTC)
Not list as a secondary source by pubmed. [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 03:41, 9 July 2014 (UTC)
 The article in question is part of an apparently proceedings-based issue, and as such was likely subject to limited scientific peer-review scrutiny. I certainly wouldn't suggest refusing content from conference proceedings and journal supplements out of hand, regardless of circumstances, as that would mean discarding good, pertinent content that sometimes isn't so readily accessible, or even available, elsewhere. But in the spirit of MEDRS I feel this category of publication might be worth flagging in a nuanced way.  () 08:16, 9 July 2014 (UTC)
 I've been meaning to ask about that, there are a number of sources, notably [http://www.annualreviews.org/ Annual Reviews] which are not pubmed-indexed as Reviews. What do we do with them? -- [[User:CFCF|CFCF]]  () 07:37, 9 July 2014 (UTC) Not relevant to this case, completely different question. -- [[User:CFCF|CFCF]]  () 07:39, 9 July 2014 (UTC)

A1candidate asked &quot;Even if we generally accept the journal, what about the controversial article itself? I'm referring to this one on 'full transcendental experiences during meditation', in particular.&quot; 
What about the article?  If you mean &quot;can it be used as a source?&quot;, I think the answer is &quot;it depends on what statement from the article is being used and also the context for which it is being considered.&quot;   () 16:14, 9 July 2014 (UTC)
Remember that there is . Waiting until other authors can respond to the paper is a reasonable alternative. Depending on the publication cycle and review speed of the journal, this may be several months.  [[User talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl!]] 17:20, 9 July 2014 (UTC)



At the header link. This is a write-up of the notes made in an initial review by a CRUK specialist. The idea is to sort these points out in the article before sending the article for review by other outside specialists. Epidemiology &amp; the missing research section were not covered - will be done with other people. Not all points made are written up.  I'm hoping this gives the medical editing community enough to go on to start serious work on the article, but I realize it may not. This is the 3rd in a series - see also  and .

Ideally one for the Pharmacology project. Overall our response seems good, but with serious lapses at times - so just like WP in general. Isn't there an FDA online list that someone just needs to check at intervals, after we are sure we are up to date? Of course the FDA is not the whole of the story, and no doubt already far better covered than other regulators around the world. On a quick look I couldn't see anything to complain about in their method, which makes a change.  () 10:22, 3 July 2014 (UTC)

Autism Research Institute

Ok, so I'm already being [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AFringe_theories%2FNoticeboard&amp;diff=cur&amp;oldid=prev accused] of &quot;whitewashing&quot;, which I suppose was inevitable. My editing track record stands on its own, if anyone is interested in perusing it. My edits to this article ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Autism_Research_Institute&amp;diff=616716226&amp;oldid=616379058 diff]) were an attempt to make it neutral, per . To put it simply, the article said the Institute claims that chelation is a viable treatment for autism, followed by what I feel is commentary and original research in context, used to rebut the subject's positions on this and other issues (vaccines cause autism, etc) using citations that didn't even remotely address the subject, but rather its claims. To me, this is a complete lack of neutrality. If there is scientific evidence that chelation is bad, that's fine. That belongs in the chelation article. But turning an article about an organization into commentary about how wrong we think they are, using references that don't even mention them, is a gross violation of the neutrality principle we all must abide to around here, at all times. I note that there are already sources in the article that mention negative effects of chelation treatment and the Institute - those are still there and I have no interest in removing them. 's assertion that we must rebut the subject's view (be that an organization or an individual) strike me as fundamentally contrary to the letter and spirit of the NPOV policy. We have an obligation to show both sides of a story, yes, but not at the expense of impartiality. If a source speaks about the subject, it should be included in the article. If it does not, it should be omitted. I cannot believe that editors in the past came to an agreement to trample NPOV in certain cases (?) where we have a collective negative bias? Is that the case? Is that spelled out in  or some RFC I'm not aware of? And if it is unacceptable to have an article that speaks about a given topic like chelation and we can't help but insert commentary making sure veryone knows that's really bad, is that not a violation of our  guideline? Something's rather wrong here if that's the case. §[[User:FreeRangeFrog|FreeRangeFrog]] 00:56, 13 July 2014 (UTC) Nevermind.

 It is not true that I am whitewashing, only being accurate. Please read the whole paragraph that the statement comes from. The authors are clearly referring to one PRIMARY source. Why would they use past tense if they are drawing a general conclusion? Why is the statement not found in the abstract, or in the paragraph starting &quot;In conclusion, …&quot; in the body? Because it is not the conclusion of the 2011 systematic review of reviews, it is a reference to one study.  () 16:25, 8 July 2014 (UTC)
 You can see what I'm up against? It's not true that the review authors are referring to one source - and it wouldn't even matter if they were. We prize secondary sources because the authors make judgements about what sources are important and here we have an editor trying to tell us we can't use the unambiguous conclusion I stated above because the previous two sentences in the review examined particular primary sources.

 Exactly.  It's how Ernst describes one trial, not the overall findings of his review of reviews. (tl;dr version of my long post below... but there you can read the relevant excerpt) -- ( •  • ) 19:38, 8 July 2014 (UTC)

So, here is the deal.  There's this thing called &quot;context&quot;.  Nothing against RexxS, but he's failing to grasp that in context, the quote &quot;&quot; is the review's description of one trial, not its overall conclusion about the literature.  (doi for Ernst '11: [http://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.pain.2010.11.004].) This becomes obvious when Ernst begins by noting that  [there were 17]   So, right off the bat you can see that this review-of-reviews finds more reviews than not that find efficacy for acupuncture. Still with me?

Now, Ernst does not believe these results will hold.  He believes that the reviews that he has reviewed are all subject to bias, etc., because the trials that they review are not well-designed.  He explains this by discussing two more recent (as of 2011), well-designed studies, and that is the context RexxS isn't grokking (emphasis mine):
cquote|These findings should be seen in the light of recent results from high-quality randomized controlled trials. Cherkin et al. [14] have shown that, for chronic low back pain, individualized acupuncture is not better in reducing symptoms than formula acupuncture or sham acupuncture with a toothpick that does not penetrate the skin. All 3 forms of acupuncture, however, were more effective than usual care. The authors consider, therefore, that the benefits of acupuncture ‘‘resulted from nonspecific effects such as therapist conviction, patient enthusiasm, or receiving a treatment believed to be helpful’’ [14]. This view was further strengthened by a recent randomized controlled trial in patients with osteoarthritis examining the effects of acupuncturists’ communication style [128]. Real and sham acupuncture were both more effective in reducing pain than no acupuncture at all, but real acupuncture was no better than sham. Moreover, a communication style generating high expectations in patients resulted in improved outcomes compared to a normal style,
regardless of the type of acupuncture administered. In the primary studies included in the systematic reviews evaluated above, the risk
of bias was often considerable. Adequately controlling for nonspecific effects in future is likely to demonstrate that acupuncture has
no or few specific effects on pain [89].[http://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.pain.2010.11.004]
Obvious enough?  RexxS also confounds the issue by failing to grasp that &quot;efficacy&quot; is shorthand for &quot;efficacy beyond placebo&quot;, i.e. a stronger response to true acu than sham acu (the latter being the control).  I wish RexxS had taken the time to learn the basics of this topic areas before editing, and read more carefully (he had trouble with the same source earlier, re SAE's [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Acupuncture&amp;diff=615395970&amp;oldid=615342289][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Acupuncture&amp;diff=615448249&amp;oldid=615430922]).

 That's just wishful thinking, Middle 8. Ernst et al have surveyed the literature concerning acupuncture and pain; they found two areas, LBP and osteoarthritis, where good quality reviews showed that acupuncture shows some effectiveness. They then write the paragraph quoted. That's the context and Middle 8 is willfully ignoring it. The paragraph above refers to the finding in the reviews and then goes on to contrast two high-quality RCTs that showed for LBP and osteoarthritis that &quot;true&quot; acupuncture was no more effective than &quot;sham&quot;.
 They then state an important conclusion for this review of reviews: &quot;Real and sham acupuncture were both more effective in reducing pain than no acupuncture at all, but real acupuncture was no better than sham.&quot; We don't know how many reviews or studies were examined by Ernst et al to reach that conclusion, but that isn't our concern as Wikipedia editors. Middle 8 and Herbxue would have us believe that it was just the two primary sources that they looked at - but offer nothing more than their own analysis to justify that claim. Even so, no matter what sources led Ernst et al to reach that conclusion, it does not weaken it as it is a significant conclusion of a reliable secondary source; and it cannot be grounds for removing it from the article.
 As for , I've never heard such absolute rubbish presented in any debate. That is pure fabrication in a desperate effort to shore up an indefensible viewpoint. That's the quality of debate I'm struggling to make progress with.
 Middle 8 is an acupuncturist with an obvious conflict of interest in the presentation of acupuncture in the most positive light. Herbxue is an SPA with over 100 of his 138 article edits to TCM or acupuncture. Is anyone here able to read that paper and explain to them that they need to respect secondary sources? I've tried and all I get is personal attacks from them. -- () 22:23, 8 July 2014 (UTC)

I believe that we all prefer balanced and neutral leads.  Also, we are all against poverty, war, and oppression, and in favor of motherhood and apple pie.
The problem is not our values.  The dispute here is whether a statement that you personally believe to be &quot;balanced and neutral&quot; is accepted by everyone else as being &quot;balanced and neutral&quot;.  So far, your idea of &quot;balanced and neutral&quot; does not line up with most people's idea of &quot;balanced and neutral&quot;.
Given the problems with this dispute, I'm inclined to say that only words in the actual, labeled &quot;Conclusion&quot; section of Ernst's review should be used to support any text in the article.  That would help us produce an encyclopedic summary and eliminate these disputes about whether sentence X is a conclusion about the entire subject or is a description of just one study.

No, understanding that a statement in a paragraph that describes a single study is about that single study is actually something called &quot;having good reading comprehension skills&quot;.

 If you would read the paper, you'd realise it doesn't have a 'conclusions' section. It winds up with a 'discussion' section and that contains the conclusion &quot;Real and sham acupuncture were both more effective in reducing pain than no acupuncture at all, but real acupuncture was no better than sham.&quot; It's a statement of the authors' conclusions, written in the authors' voice, not a quote from an earlier study. It's pure original research, not reading comprehension, to analyse secondary sources by trying to guess what was in the authors' minds. We have to accept that authors of secondary sources do the analysis for us, otherwise we might as well throw away the concept of secondary sourcing and just have the free-for-all of Wikipedia editors reaching their own conclusions from analysing primary sources. -- () 11:55, 11 July 2014 (UTC)
Have you read ref 128 that's cited in that paragraph?  It's  [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3651275/ free at PubMed Central].  The relevant part of that paragraph says, &quot;Let me tell you about ref 128, which had two interesting findings.  The first was, and here I quote from its abstract, &quot;No statistically significant differences were observed between TCA or sham acupuncture, but both groups had significant reductions in J-MAP and WOMAC pain compared to the waiting group&quot;.  The second interesting finding was, and here I'll also quote from its abstract, &quot;acupuncturists’ [communication] style had significant effects on pain reduction and satisfaction&quot;.  To claim that the middle sentence is not a description of the study explicitly named in the first is to say that, of the three sentences here, the first is about ref 128, the second is about all studies in general, and that the third is once again, without any warning, suddenly going back to ref 128.  That's not a reasonable interpretation of the paragraph.  Even if the second statement is actually a universal truth (which wouldn't necessarily surprise me), all three of those specific sentences happen to be about the same single primary study.   () 15:54, 11 July 2014 (UTC)
 Of course I've read PMC3651275. Have you read the paper you thought had a conclusions section? Here's what it actually says:
* 
 So the question you are left with is how did Ernst and his coauthors decide that those RCTs were worthy of inclusion among a &quot;review of reviews&quot;? The answer of course is that they were perfectly aware that sham acupuncture is as effective as real. Those RCTs were mentioned to directly address the two areas of LBP and osteoarthritis that appeared to show evidence of effectiveness in the reviews. The other conclusions are made by Ernst et al quite generally without citing anything until Madsen 2009 at the end of the paragraph. Neither you nor I can possibly know what evidence they had seen to reach their conclusion about real vs sham, but it would be an extraordinary coincidence if the two RCTs that related to LBP and osteoarthritis just happened to be the only ones that the authors had seen that described the equivalence of real and sham, don't you think? And that's why we don't do analysis of secondary sources - because one editor's interpretation can differ radically from another's. We never abandon the secondary source to quote the primaries it's based on for exactly that reason. We should respect secondary sources not make guesses about how the authors constructed their conclusions. -- () 01:16, 12 July 2014 (UTC)
I'm not concerned about how the authors constructed their conclusions.  I'm concerned with whether a single sentence in the middle of a paragraph that appears to be describing specific sources is either (a) a factual description of conclusions reached in that single source or (b) a broad conclusion drawn by Ernst et al. about the entire subject.  You and QuackGuru have settled on (b); everyone else seems to have settled on (a).  
Of course, if you really are right, then perhaps someone would email Ernst about the advantages of using the present tense to describe current facts, and the value of reserving the past tense for things that are over and done with.  In that single past-tense-because-it-happened-several-years-ago study, real and sham acupuncture certainly were equally (in)effective.  If Ernst meant to declare a general fact about efficacy, then the authors should have written that these things are equally (in)effective.  Their choice of past tense in that sentence indicates that they are describing something that is over and finished. 
It seems perfectly reasonable to me to assume that real and sham acupuncture are actually equally (in)effective for pain.  However, that particular sentence should not be used to make that claim, because that particular past-tense sentence is describing facts about a one-time event, not making pronouncements about Ernst et al's own conclusions on the subject.  () 22:59, 12 July 2014 (UTC)
Ernst is singularly cautious in stating only what the evidence supports. He would not extrapolate from the past-tense description of specific trial's findings to a present tense generalization, although it is obviously tempting to do so. Even if that generalization were correct, it would not be academically honest to make it. He doesn't lack access to expert advice on grammar, should he find difficulty in expressing something.

* [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Acupuncture&amp;diff=616262374&amp;oldid=616261807 Here] is my attempted solution, with explanation .  18:53, 9 July 2014 (UTC)

Name for &quot;place where infection spreads&quot;
Is there a name for a place where infection spreads because of sick people being in contact with uninfected people? Hospitals are places where people get hospital-acquired infections, college dorms are places where meningitis can spread, and I just started an article on childcare infection for disease spread in daycare centers where young children meet. Can a place be called a vector (epidemiology), if there is a causal relationship between going to a place with sick people and getting infected? Can entire rooms or buildings be fomites? Is there some word for a place with infection risk? I expect there is no appropriate word, but I thought I would ask. [[User:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ]][[User talk:Bluerasberry|(talk)]] 19:54, 11 July 2014 (UTC)
I don't think vector is the right word you are after. Suggest ask an epidemiologist or something. I think they might say something like center or focus to describe locations in relation to an epidemic, but probably not quite the same thing. How about just saying what you mean: &quot;Area with high risk of infection&quot;. Not sure there is any specific jargon for this.  () 10:41, 12 July 2014 (UTC)
Yes, I think [http://books.google.com/books?id=4kZmAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA112 focus of infection] is probably the term you want.  () 11:34, 12 July 2014 (UTC)
Can also be used in the sense of focal infection theory I think. So at the organism level rather than the population level, &quot;focus of infection&quot; could mean a local infection spreading to other areas of the body.  () 13:54, 12 July 2014 (UTC)
That article is exactly what I wanted. I just made an article called focus of infection in which I listed places, but perhaps that should be merged with the theory article. I suggested that on the talk page for the theory article, and might merge it after thinking for a while. Thanks for your help. [[User:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ]][[User talk:Bluerasberry|(talk)]] 15:13, 12 July 2014 (UTC)
The phrase is used [http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=%22focus+of+infection%22 in both senses]. I'm not sure about the claim that &quot;Focal infection theory is the background concept that such places may exist.&quot; That may well be so etymologically (OR?) Or just an example of a term referring to different concepts according to the context? Anyway, I don't think merging would be appropriate.  () 15:45, 12 July 2014 (UTC)
On looking again, I misread the concept about the theory. They are different ideas. There should be no thought of merging. [[User:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ]][[User talk:Bluerasberry|(talk)]] 17:35, 12 July 2014 (UTC)

A2 milk

The article on A2 milk has recently been rewritten to make health claims based on anecdotes and a few primary sources.  () 04:11, 13 July 2014 (UTC)

, is there a brief explanation for why you blanked the entire set of changes, instead of just the parts involving non-MEDRS-compliant biomedical information?  Statements like  are not covered by MEDRS.  
For example, you blanked the entire
Commercial production and sale
and
Criticism and controversy
sections.  I've restore all of the former and half the latter.  The reason I did this is because a quick glance tells you that
Commercial production
is not about science.  Here are the keywords that stood out when I read that section:    None of that is biomedical information; that's all business information.  Any decent book, newspaper, or magazine article is sufficient to support those kinds of claims.  Business information is not subject to MEDRS.   () 23:34, 13 July 2014 (UTC)

 . It is a normal procedure on wikipedia that if a bold edit is controversial, the edit is reverted and it is discussed on the talk page. That is what happened. Now material is being added back after discussion. This is just normal process. It was a huge controversial edit and revert and discussion were needed.  () 23:45, 13 July 2014 (UTC)

I would wish to support Bhny in this, and indeed did the same thing myself, for the same reasons. I note Whatamidoings comments on the Talk page regarding paragraph by paragraph discussion, and though I have not as yet read the partial reverts (world cup final etc.) WAID has made to the article, I suspect they are entirely sensible. - () 00:26, 14 July 2014 (UTC)

Courtesy would dictate that I would alerted to this conversation. I am astonished by the actions of  in reverting my edit in its entirety within 30 minutes on the basis of entirely false claims. His opening statement above, &quot;The article on A2 milk has recently been rewritten to make health claims based on anecdotes and a few primary sources&quot; is patently wrong. The article covers a wide area including the history that led to the creation and commercialisation of this product, which has now become a major supermarket item throughout Australia, and a brief background on A1/A2 milk and the variants between countries and herds. His edit summary claimed  &quot;much of this 'evidence' is from a single book, anecdotes or primary sources&quot;, yet the article also cites more than 40 separate news reports from Australia, New Zealand and the UK. His repeated claim that &quot;There still seems to be no consensus that A2 milk is somehow better than A1&quot;[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AA2_milk&amp;diff=616729512&amp;oldid=601576875][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:A2_milk&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=616735447] implies that this is claimed in the article, or that it is necessary to prove it before the article is expanded. He dismisses Woodford's Devil in the Milk as &quot;probably useless as a source&quot;, evidently without the faintest knowledge of what the book is. He labels my edit as &quot;controversial&quot;: what is the controversy? There had been no discussion, yet he immediately decides it is &quot;controversial&quot;.
As I explain at the A2 milk talk page, an article dealing with science matters is outside my usual area of activity in Wikipedia and I appreciate the pointers to . The appeal to  by Bhny and  patently ignores the opening lines at the BRD page: &quot;Revert an edit if it is not an improvement, and it cannot be immediately fixed by refinement. Consider reverting only when necessary.&quot; The A2 milk article was clearly inadequate in breadth of content, poorly sourced and poorly structured, all of which were flagged with categories on the talk page. My edit—though it contains some material I now concede fail MEDRS—addressed many of those issues. I'd prefer collaboration and a bit of respect to this display of kneejerk editing. I have left a more detailed explanation of the content and aim of my edit at the talk page. [[User:BlackCab|BlackCab]] ([[User talk:BlackCab|TALK]]) 08:03, 14 July 2014 (UTC)

 I've been editing this page for a while and I knew your edit would be controversial (as it has proven to be!). I appreciate all the work you put into your edit and I think we are beginning to use parts of it. Sorry if BRD is a bit brutal.  () 08:30, 14 July 2014 (UTC)

The phrase from WP:BRD quoted by Blackcab, &quot;Revert an edit if it is not an improvement, and it cannot be immediately fixed by refinement ... &quot; is pertinent here. The bold edit introducing the new version was certainly over egging the a2 milk pudding, turning the article into an a2 milk marketers dream, and should not have been allowed to stand. Refinement was not an option, hence invoking BRD. I do admire the excellent writing skills on display however, and am aware of my own pitiful abilities in that area. I am sure that with discussion taking place on the Talk page, this matter will be resolved to everyone's satisfaction. - () 10:41, 14 July 2014 (UTC)
May I encourage you two to go read the actual , paying particular attention to the  section?  This is a collaborative encyclopedia.  Collaboration is not best served by blanking an enormous amount of apparently good material solely because it happened in the same editing session as some imperfect material.  
One of the reasons that I'm recommending the editing policy is because you seem to have picked up the &quot;popular&quot; (i.e., &quot;not accurate&quot;) understanding of the BRD essay.  I assume that this is because people in the past have misrepresented it to you.  So here's the real story, and it may help you (or anyone else reading this) in the future:
BRD is advice to and for bold editors.  It's a description of what to do when your edit was reverted so that you can avoid an edit war.  It is supposed to be used to prevent the brutality of an edit war.  It is not an authorization to revert bold edits or a mechanism of forcing other people to discuss their material.  It explicitly says that you cannot force any other person to follow this.  It is explicitly not an authorization to revert material that, as in this case, could be immediately refined (e.g., by reverting only part of the changes) or reverting more than once.   () 16:52, 14 July 2014 (UTC)
I'm so disheartened. BRD is used incredibly regularly all over my watchlist, and works well. It worked in this case too. A tiny fraction of wikipedia has been improved by it. I went to the WAID talk page to discuss this and the next thing two hours had passed and I had forgotten my intention. I have read  again, twice, and the BRD essay. I had thought I was starting to get to grips with the basics here, but alas, the foundations are shifting again. - () 20:01, 14 July 2014 (UTC)
Hang in there:  you're doing better than most.
The problem with deciding whether BRD is &quot;useful&quot; is that you first have to decide what &quot;useful&quot; means.  BRD—or, really, pretty much any set of  letters—can be &quot;useful&quot; if your goal is to obstruct article development (I know that's not your goal, but we do encounter people like that occasionally, even here at WPMED).  It is a very effective method of elevating , especially since most people on the receiving end won't go read the page anyway.  They'll be told &quot;BRD, you have to discuss&quot;, and then they dutifully discuss, or give up.
But BRD's point (and yours, ultimately) is to be useful for improving article content.  Under that definition, I'd say that BRD is successful among the tiny minority of bold editors who understand it and follow it.  To the extent that it's used like a get-out-of-jail-free card for reverting rather than collaborating, it is IMO largely a failure.   () 22:37, 14 July 2014 (UTC)

 I'm not a fan of BRD but in this case it worked fine and I think I was correct in doing it (though it was immediately reverted so in fact I did nothing to the article). This was an entire rewrite of the article shifting the POV completely. The parts to preserve are always in the history.  () 22:40, 14 July 2014 (UTC)
BRD &quot;worked fine&quot;? All Bhny achieved was to delete the entire edit and raise the issue of MEDRS. Beyond that (and his thoroughly misleading appeals at two noticeboards, without notifying me), nothing. His indication of that content guideline page was valuable, because I was previously unaware of it and I'm revisiting the science part of my edit as a consequence. I thank him for that. There was otherwise no other constructive discussion on his part, or an attempt by him to reinstate the majority of my edit that had nothing to do with MEDRS. He says &quot;The parts to preserve are always in the history,&quot; but despite my lengthy posts at the talk page, explaining my motives and suggesting points for further discussion, there was no attempt to engage with me on what parts could safely be restored, or what specific areas remained problematic. In this case BRD was used to simply block rather than improve. Working in this part of Wikipedia is a learning curve for me too; hopefully as I gradually restore material to the A2 article there will be a greater level of collaboration and discussion.

Notability of an academic journal

Hello once more, medical experts. I came across this old abandoned AfC submission.  Is this a notable journal?  I would have no idea where to find reliable sources about this.  — () 20:32, 15 July 2014 (UTC)

Most people don't know how to find sources about any academic journals.  I think you usually need specialty publications available to research librarians.  any advice?   () 20:46, 15 July 2014 (UTC)

There is a discussion about this now at , but the guideline with tenuous consensus is at .
My personal opinion away from Wikipedia guidelines is that I do not like journals being heavily cited but without a Wikipedia article. A problem is that practically all journals do not meet , so WikiProject Academic Journals developed their own notability guidelines which have always been problematic. All of these cases are really uncertain and I have no good ideas. If a journal seems minimally good and not a scam or vanity publisher then it almost always passes, but not on any particular merits. [[User:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ]][[User talk:Bluerasberry|(talk)]] 21:17, 15 July 2014 (UTC)
It meets the basic requirement of being in a selective index (Scopus). It's published by a major publish, with a good reputation in the general area it covers. That's sufficient to make it probable that afd would accept it, though there's been a good deal of variability in fields outside the hard sciences (&amp; I consider clinical ethics to be one of them). Such probable acceptance is the working criterion for accepting an afc. Borderline cases are better decided there, if anyone wants to challenge it--I've challenged a number of accepted afcs there myself.  I've therefore accepted it,
On them ore general question raised by , I fundamentally agree with him. WP needs to give information as a basis for evaluating the articles in WP, and I would regard such articles (even when the journals are not otherwise notable)  as necessary auxiliary information to our practice of citations. Similar previous proposals  have included any journal cited here, but I think Blue's wording is more reasonable and has a better chance of acceptance.  () 22:24, 15 July 2014 (UTC)
I wonder if that function (providing basic information about a journal when we can't really write anything more than simple facts like names, dates, ISSNs, etc.) could be better handled at Wikidata.   () 23:21, 15 July 2014 (UTC)
There is an active group at [[d:Wikidata:Periodicals task force]], and Wikidata has a very comprehensive collection of academic journals, and the simple data is being added (including copying from Wikipedia).  However this raw data isnt the reason to write Wikipedia articles about journals - such data is readily available on the Internet.  Articles exist to highlight the important information, which we as encyclopedia writers who regularly review citations need to be aware of.  () 03:40, 16 July 2014 (UTC)

Erythroplaisa = erythroplakia (French or Greek derivations I think, but I am 95% sure they are the synonyms in English dermatology)
Furthermore, According to some sources, &quot;erythroplasia of Queyrat&quot; also occurs in mouth, larynx, anus. 
Imo, might be better to discuss all erythroplasias/erythroplakias on one page.  () 12:14, 14 July 2014 (UTC)

And in answer to your Q about whether ZungenCa2a.jpg could be described as erythroplakia/erythroplasia, the answer is no if you are using the mainstream WHO definition (red patch which is a diagnosis of exclusion, but the red patch may show dysplasia or even be carcinoma in situ). Just to look at it, I would guess that the SCC has almost certainly invaded beyond the basement membrane since there is a tumor mass, and therefore the term carcinoma in situ is no longer appropriate.  () 17:50, 14 July 2014 (UTC)
 (I'm not sure why CFCF pinged me.) &quot;Erythroplasia of Queyrat&quot; seems to have more than one definition. In its most generic meaning, it could indeed be considered the same as (unqualified) &quot;erythroplakia&quot;. However EoQ more commonly refers specifically to erythroplakia on the glans.
 I agree that it would be sensible to merge the content into the article &quot;Erythroplakia&quot;. 
 Regarding ZungenCa2a.jpg, I agree with 188.30.200.29. The tumour is invasive and has progressed beyond erythroplakia. [[User:Axl|Axl]] ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 18:41, 14 July 2014 (UTC)

Different names on Wikidata

Looking up Defibrillation I was astounded to find there was no link in Swedish. After some searching I found the Swedish article [[:sv:Defibrillator]], which covers the same topic. The difference is that it is filed under the machine defibrillator, while the English article has the phenomena in its title. The articles have pretty much the same scope, but despite this they don't link to each other, and instead inhabit two separate entries on Wikidata. Is there any way to solve this?

I think most people associate &quot;relapse&quot; as something a patient has done to themselves (such as drug abuse), while something like &quot;recurrence&quot; relates to the disease re-surfacing. For example, a cancer that came back &quot;recurs,&quot; rather than &quot;relapses.&quot; I'd suggest starting an article called Recurrence (medicine), as Recurrence already exists as a disambiguation page. -- () 17:18, 12 July 2014 (UTC)

Relapse is not specific to drug abuse, and recurrence is not specific to cancer etc.  () 01:05, 13 July 2014 (UTC)
I think that, in common speech, the difference is in your expectations:  if you expect something to be an ongoing condition that occasionally reappears or gets worse (e.g., multiple sclerosis), then you talk about &quot;relapse&quot;; if you thought it was an event that had finished or disease that had been cured, then you talk about &quot;recurrence&quot; (e.g., recurrent miscarriage). 
But it's not a strict rule, and there are factors like the terms preferred by experts early in the sub-field, which tend to be carried on for a long time afterwards.   () 23:10, 13 July 2014 (UTC)
I'm not a grammar expert, but I have noticed a pattern to the use of recur vs. relapse. When these are used as verbs, the choice seems to depend on the actor (grammatical subject) in the sentence. Diseases, conditions, and events recur; people relapse. It seems less straightforward with the related nouns and adjectives. — ‹› 01:54, 18 July 2014 (UTC)

Paper handout and online PDF for students in classes

Hello. We have an opportunity to design a classroom handout explaining health editing best practices. A draft is ready to go now at , and pending community interest, perhaps we could send it to a designer to make a nice pdf for online viewing or printing on paper. I am not sure how we will arrange that but it seems doable if there is interest.

The [[:meta:Wiki Education Foundation]] is a nonprofit organization independent of the Wikimedia Foundation which promotes increased involvement of professors and students in Wikipedia. They especially target universities, and they only can work with schools in the United States and Canada. For those who do not know, general announcements by this organization are made at , which is a general noticeboard for any kind of collaboration between schools and Wikipedia anywhere in the world for any purpose, and not just relating to that separate nonprofit organization.

 was formerly employed by the Wikimedia Foundation to do educational outreach in all kinds of contexts. She is now employed by the Wiki Education Foundation and not the Wikimedia Foundation, and she is promoting education collaborations with them.

At , LiAnna was seeking comment on a draft of a one-page handout to be distributed in classes which edit psychology articles. When the text for this draft is developed, it will be sent to a designer for attractive placement into a document, then distributed as a PDF and printed on paper. LiAnna would like comments on this paper right now.

When I saw this paper, I thought it would be useful for WikiProject Medicine since so far as I know, this WikiProject has collaborated with more classes than any other WikiProject, and since this WikiProject so frequently encounters student editors in medicine. In reading the paper, I felt that it had nothing to do with psychology at all, but was a general primer to editing health articles, and I imagined a fork of the paper which could be given to students in health classes just as the psychology handout will be distributed in those classes.

I am posting to ask that any interested members of this WikiProject look over this fork I made at . I propose that we develop this, then if we ever see a class editing health content, we make this available along with our existing video perhaps in a welcome template like [[:Template:WPMED welcome]].

It would be nice if the Wiki Education Foundation could arrange for the same nice design work on a version of this handout for medicine as they are arranging for psychology, but this is not confirmed and I have not asked Lianna directly if this is possible. In any case, they have already designed this draft and they are going to make it look nice for psychology, so whatever they do, perhaps even if they cannot design it for us we can arrange something for medicine. Perhaps they also would like to copy any revisions we do to this one for they psychology handout.

Thanks everyone - please comment and revise the medicine handout if you like the idea. It seems like an asset which is almost ready to go live, in my opinion. [[User:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ]][[User talk:Bluerasberry|(talk)]] 16:53, 18 July 2014 (UTC)

Question about Wiki coverage of Sicca syndrome

What is Sicca syndrome? It seems to me that every source I look at defines it slightly differently.

* Sicca syndrome ( sends you to page Sjögren syndrome).
* Sicca
* Dry_mouth#Sicca_syndrome
Wiki is currently mentioning Sicca syndrome in one line on Sjögren syndrome, but this is different from how it is defined on dry mouth article.

Best practices for naming &quot;controversy&quot; articles?

There was an article called dental amalgam controversy. Its content is mostly about the fringe view that Amalgam (dentistry) in dental fillings causes a range of personal health problems. I was cleaning up the article and among other things, renamed it to dental amalgam toxicity, since the article was about the purported toxicity of the material and had, in my opinion, little information about debate or controversy despite presenting conflicting perspectives. A user suggested that my name change was not ideal because this person felt that it promoted the fringe view, while also saying that the original name was not good.

Does anyone know of a precedent in having names for articles on fringe concepts in medicine? Should these be called &quot;controversy&quot; articles, or is there another name? I proposed other names at . I am not sure what is best. Thanks. [[User:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ]][[User talk:Bluerasberry|(talk)]] 17:08, 18 July 2014 (UTC)
Without looking at this case in particular, I think for fringe topics the word &quot;controversy&quot; is not good, as it plays into the  fallacy of implying that there are just &quot;contrary voices&quot; in play, rather than a (discredited) fringe and a (sensible) mainstream view. In non-medical topics the solution is often to cast the title in a way which makes plain the nature of the fringe views - for example Chemtrail conspiracy theory. Of course then there is a constant assault by fringe-pushers wanting to remove &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; from the title, but such is Wikipedia. Is the dental amalgam things a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;, a &quot;popular misconception&quot;, a &quot;myth&quot; ... ? What do RS's say?  || 18:43, 18 July 2014 (UTC)
Thanks for helping me talk this through.
There might be two unrelated issues with amalgam danger. It kind of surprises me, but some sources from the WHO and others say that dental amalgam in the mouths of the deceased is the majority source of environmental mercury pollution. I think there is no dispute that bodies with mercury in the teeth need special care and reform of funerary practices, and right now, that content is mixed with general concerns about amalgam. If the article is called &quot;dental amalgam controversy&quot; or &quot;dental amalgam toxicity&quot;, then this environmental problem which is unrelated to WikiProject Medicine work seems appropriate to include. With a different title about the health issue only, perhaps this content could be forked away and the issues separated.
For the idea that amalgam causes illness, it seems to be all of the things you said, &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;, a &quot;popular misconception&quot;, a &quot;myth&quot;, and something which is repeated by some prominent health professionals who are not reliable sources. So far as I can tell, all health organizations that take a position say that the research finds no danger in the practice, but I have not examined all the sources and the article will eventually need to be cleaned more.
I hope that we do not need to resolve the truth right now just because no one has stepped up to parse the sources. I did want to sort the title... I am not sure right now what reliable sources say. I should think more. Thanks. [[User:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ]][[User talk:Bluerasberry|(talk)]] 19:29, 18 July 2014 (UTC)
I prefer controversy, especially when there's an actual controversy with ongoing debate. It is far from accurate to say that the only legitimate controversy around amalgam is environmental. In addition to the patient health concern, there's informed consent debates and occupational exposure. On the patient issue, there is the 2010 FDA scientific advisory panel meeting, which was widely reported in the media as critical of the FDA's interpretation of safety (as was the 2006 scientific advisory panel). Unlike the 2006 panel, the 2010 one did not vote but the [http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/MedicalDevices/MedicalDevicesAdvisoryCommittee/DentalProductsPanel/UCM237211.pdf summary of the meeting] concluded that the &quot;Panel noted a likely susceptible subpopulation that is prone to adverse health effects after receiving amalgams, but noted also that this population could not be easily pre-identified at this time&quot;. This is similar to the [http://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/productsandmedicalprocedures/dentalproducts/dentalamalgam/ucm171117.htm 2009 FDA white paper] which also noted that there seem to be polymorphisms with greater risk. Also, if I recall correctly, for reasons that I'm not sure are yet elucidated, boys (or at least some) excrete less mercury through their urine and it is unclear what that means. Anyway, I haven't looked into this in a while and it is possible things have changed. I'm heading out camping so I won't be around for follow-up, but that's my two cents. [[User:ImperfectlyInformed|II]] | ( - ) 01:24, 19 July 2014 (UTC)
Agree with Bluerasberry's comments above, to clearly demarcate the fringe alternative medicine quackery related to amalgam toxicity (i.e. the purported medical condition which results from the presence of amalgam fillings in the mouth) and the environmental concerns about amalgam disposal and cremation, etc. which is probably more mainstream and science based. Maybe even on 2 separate articles.  () 21:10, 18 July 2014 (UTC)

* Environmental concerns about dental amalgam
* Amalgam toxicity claims

Either of your two suggestions here sound okay to me, but it depends a bit on what the actual subject of the article is.  &quot;Environmental concerns&quot; isn't so good for &quot;making me sick&quot;, and &quot;toxicity claims&quot; might not be so great if it's mostly about mercury emissions from crematoriums.  &quot;Controversy&quot; might works best if there was a time-bounded &quot;event&quot; around it and the issues were (at one time) considered reasonable or possible.   () 21:18, 18 July 2014 (UTC)
 There has been a lengthy precedence for &quot;controversy&quot; titles (see Thiomersal controversy, MMR vaccine controversy, Vaccine controversies, Water fluoridation controversy, Aspartame controversy, off the top of my head). I do feel &quot;controversy&quot; is a more neutral than &quot;toxicity&quot; if the goal of the page is to discuss the controversial claims about the toxicity.  () 20:01, 20 July 2014 (UTC)

Editorials and 

What is the state of editorials and MEDRS? I recently read some editorials from Nature Neuroscience. Is this considered acceptable by  as they are written by the journal itself. I'm not for a blank slate on all journal editorials, but I personally accept Nature as a &quot;reputable major medical and scientific body&quot;, am I right in that reading of MEDRS? -- [[User:CFCF|CFCF]]  () 09:05, 18 July 2014 (UTC)
 The language at MEDRS seems generally permissive of most kinds of sources in reputable journals, but with a clear hierarchy. Sounds to me like they are fair game as long as they do not contradict available systematic reviews. () 14:55, 18 July 2014 (UTC)
The use of editorials and other opinion pieces is regulated by , which says that they may be reliable for statements of opinion (This author or publication believes the sky is green) but not for statements of fact (The sky is green)—or, if I may guess about what's likely to be more relevant, that X is pseudoscience.   () 21:13, 18 July 2014 (UTC)
Research editorials do have some opinion, and the also have clear analysis/synthesis of available medical research (valuable MEDRES compliant material). An intelligent reader can tell the difference. -  () 03:21, 20 July 2014 (UTC)
MEDRS discourages the use of &quot;expert opinion&quot;.  It names it as the lowest possible form of evidence, and later says, &quot;Journal articles come in many types, including...editorials and op-ed pieces, advocacy pieces, speculation, book reviews, letters to the editor and other forms of commentary or correspondence, biographies, and eulogies. It is usually best to use reviews and meta-analyses where possible.&quot; 
Whether it is &quot;MEDRS-compliant&quot; depends primarily on how you use it.  It is possible to use an editorial piece in compliance with MEDRS and RSOPINION.  Generally speaking, that requires  attribution along the lines of &quot;A 2010 editorial in _____ journal said that '(brief quotation or paraphrasing here)'&quot;.   () 15:20, 20 July 2014 (UTC)
I think MEDRS should be revised to elevate so call opinion. Articles labeled as editorial can be used to validate research article if the editorial specifically names the research and affirms the conclusions. This would be an example of source being more reliable than the source being discussed. MEDRS is far from perfect. -  () 18:43, 20 July 2014 (UTC)
Agree with much of WAID has said above. MEDRS specifically deprecates expert opinion; they should be used only sparingly, in-text attributed when used and probably not to contradict higher quality sourcing unless that opinion is of particular contextual importance (see ). I should also note that editorials in journals are not covered by the &quot;Medical and scientific organizations&quot; section, which I think applies to official position statements by these societies.  Editorials are explicitly the opinion of the editor/author in question, and not a position statement by the publisher. For example, the journal Science is published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science; editorials published in Science are solely opinion pieces by authors, and are not the same as position statements by the AAAS, which are covered by the &quot;Medical ans scientific organizations&quot; section of MEDRS.

To my mind, this kind of &quot;folk remedy&quot; article is where the biggest risk (both to readers, and to Wikipedia) lies—all it takes is one kid to die or suffer serious psychological trauma after taking diluted unprocessed opium as a cure for diarrhoea (&quot;Well, Wikipedia says it's a traditional cure so it should be all right&quot;) and there's some nasty explaining to do. I suspect that because it doesn't fall neatly into either pharmacology or psychiatry, this one has a tendency to slip through the net when it comes to fact-checking. – [[User talk:Iridescent 2|iridescent 2]] 12:35, 21 July 2014 (UTC)

RFC regarding neutrality and MEDRS on &quot;fringe&quot; alt-med topics

The RFC found  was started out of frustration due to a number of editor using a very strict, legalistic view of  by removing all primary sources that don't conform to their POV. There's also a lot of bias in the result of this practice. I'm essentially treated as a vandal, with even non-controversial edits being reverted. The debate has been taken up in multiple talk pages.

 You write that the &quot;debate has been taken up in multiple talk pages.&quot; Well, you only have yourself to thank for that situation because you have spammed it all over the place, and now here. You need to stick to one discussion and not seek support elsewhere by  editors and writing on more and more boards and talk pages. If you can't work things out with the editors on a talk page, then give up, because [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Identifying_reliable_sources_(medicine)&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=617676177 your fringe POV pushing agenda] is pretty obvious, violates many policies, and has been exposed.

Candida alternative medicine quackery not covered well on Wikipedia

* Candidiasis#Alternative_medicine

I feel strongly that the small amount of discussion WP appears to have about the alternative medicine claims surrounding candida is not sufficient to provide high quality reliable information to the public. The candida industry is huge, and their lies go well beyond &quot;candida hypersensitivity syndrome&quot;. There is widespread belief among sections of the public that a systemic candida overgrowth is possible, and special diets, antifungals, fasting, &quot;detox&quot;, supplements and other things are required It is my understanding that a genuine infection with candida in the gut is very serious, leaving the patient fighting for their life in intensive care. Maybe there is some WP article on this topic that I have missed, but feel we need more content.  () 18:40, 20 July 2014 (UTC)
 I tend to agree. That's far too little coverage of a huge area of quackery. --  () 19:22, 20 July 2014 (UTC)

Is it possible to use some of these sources [http://www.quackwatch.org/search/webglimpse.cgi?alternate=N&amp;ARCHID_1=1&amp;ARCHID_2=2&amp;ARCHID_3=3&amp;ARCHID_4=4&amp;ARCHID_5=5&amp;ARCHID_6=6&amp;ARCHID_7=7&amp;ARCHID_8=8&amp;ARCHID_9=9&amp;ARCHID_10=10&amp;ARCHID_11=11&amp;ARCHID_12=12&amp;ARCHID_13=13&amp;ARCHID_14=14&amp;ARCHID_15=15&amp;ARCHID_16=16&amp;ARCHID_17=17&amp;ARCHID_18=18&amp;ARCHID_19=19&amp;ARCHID_20=20&amp;ARCHID_21=21&amp;ARCHID_22=22&amp;ARCHID_23=23&amp;ARCHID_24=24&amp;ARCHID_25=25&amp;query=candida&amp;rankby=DEFAULT&amp;errors=0&amp;age=&amp;maxfiles=50&amp;maxlines=30&amp;maxchars=10000&amp;limit=on&amp;cache=yes] to build content about so called &quot;candida overgrowth&quot;? I'm finding it difficult to find anything on pubmed or in google books.  () 20:31, 20 July 2014 (UTC)
There are some decent sources on pubmed, for example [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21802979]:
Candida organisms commonly colonize the human gastrointestinal tract as a component of the resident microbiota. Their presence is generally benign. Recent studies, however, show that high level Candidacolonization is associated with several diseases of the gastrointestinal tract.
So there this some truth to it, but I see what you mean with dubious industry claims.  -- [[User:CFCF|CFCF]]  () 07:07, 21 July 2014 (UTC)
I haven't looked at this for years; some of the claims can be entertaining if you forget that some people really believe this.  Last I heard, the &quot;industry&quot; was saying that eating bread that contains dead yeast would somehow put live yeast in your gut.  
My overall impression was to wonder (as I do for gluten-free diets) how many of them are benefiting from eating less high-carbohydrate food and more vegetables and protein rather than from the ostensible goal of the anti-candida diet programs.  I suppose that psychological benefits are also possible:  restrictive diets and personally chosen &quot;treatments&quot; provide a sense of control over your fate.  (And if your goal is to feel better, and being a true believer makes you feel better, then should people even care that your improved experience is due to psychological or placebo effects?)
Anyway, yes, like Hypoglycemia, there's a mainstream condition under that name and an &quot;altmed condition&quot; piggybacking on the legitimacy of the recognized one.  Writing a good article there will be complicated, and maintaining it will be even harder.   () 15:51, 21 July 2014 (UTC)


OK Candidiasis is protected so I cannot edit. I will start writing something and put it on the talk page. Please anyone feel free to dive in too.  () 21:36, 21 July 2014 (UTC)

Really exhausted
The  is usually one of the few methods of &quot;dispute resolution&quot; on Wikipedia that actually worked. However now it is appearing not to.

They were reverted multiple times by a couple of editors. They re-added content four times making a technical total of 5 reverts in 20 hours.

Could use some feedback on improvements

I'm still undecided on whether or not to use this image outside ΔFosB, but does anyone have any feedback - cosmetic or otherwise, for improving this? [[User:Seppi333|Seppi333]] ( | [[Special:WhatLinksHere/User:Seppi333/Maintenance|Maintained]]) 05:12, 20 July 2014 (UTC)
I would personally chose a slightly different typesetting, as I've personally found it hard to get text to look uniform in SVGs. Apart from that, some of the arrows do not point to the receptor-ligand binding site. For example the arrow showing (glutamate) binding to AMPAR is pointing far below what looks like the binding site. Could you upload a .png file just to compare so that it isn't down to using non-universal typefaces. Take a quick look at [[:commons:Commons:SVG_guidelines]], it might explain some issues. -- -- [[User:CFCF|CFCF]]  () 09:52, 20 July 2014 (UTC)
 Concerning the ligand binding sites on the AMPAR and NMDAR complexes, please note that both of these complexes are ligand gated ion channels.  The central &quot;binding site&quot; depicted in the graphic actually represents the ion conduction pore (as shown in the case of NMDAR).  The ligand binding sites are on the periphery of the complex (see for example [[:File:Activated_NMDAR.PNG]]).  (Note: the depiction of AMPAR should be changed to look more NMDAR in the graphic.)  While position of the arrows may not look quite right, they do point to were the ligand binding sites are approximately located.  () 14:18, 20 July 2014 (UTC)
That is of course true, (maybe I should stop checking Wikipedia one last time 11 pm, and just wait till the morning). Apart from that I still think it might to a lay-reader be slightly unclear where/that they bind, and creating a small indentation to represent the allosteric site would help. As for 7TM receptors, there must be some illustration on Wikipedia we could reuse. The hard work of creating a clear and concise image has been done, if we simply fix the rest this might be ready for featured image. -- [[User:CFCF|CFCF]]  () 07:17, 21 July 2014 (UTC)
  I agree with you that the diagram could be made clearer.  As I have stated , use of &quot;anatomically correct&quot; [[:File:Ion channels.svg|figures]] would be more revealing ;-)  () 12:09, 21 July 2014 (UTC)
I made a variety of changes today - including an optional &quot;Colorcode&quot; parameter that transcludes (4 nested templates...) an annotation containing a reference containing a legend which shows up in the ref tooltip in articles (e.g., see ΔFosB where I've placed the image as a test).  Let me know what you think now. [[User:Seppi333|Seppi333]] ( | [[Special:WhatLinksHere/User:Seppi333/Maintenance|Maintained]]) 03:13, 22 July 2014 (UTC)

Once sorted out I would think it useful for more general articles where we lack a graphic of comparable complexity. Wiki CRUK john/ () 13:34, 20 July 2014 (UTC)
NMDAR, AMPAR, and CAv1.2 were the only structures I tried to actually model in a way that reflects their function.  DRD1-DRD5 are simply geometric shapes that were intended to show similarity in function; I have no desire to try to create the squiggly mess of what a 7TM receptor is supposed to look like, so I went with geometric shapes.  Since I wasn't trying to show AMPAR's function (move Na+ ions inside - not directly related to cascade) in the graphic, I simply chose to make it look like NMDAR to reflect their similarity as LGICs, without showing the ion channel. In any event, the point of the graphic is just to show the signal transduction that induces addiction to stimulants, but I went to far more trouble than the citations I referenced to draw a half-decent diagram.[http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/show_pathway?hsa05031][http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2834246/figure/DialoguesClinNeurosci-11-257-g002/].
About the text though, I'm aware of that page since I read it a while back. I agree SVG text is a pain in the ass to make look right, but I've learned to deal with it.  As long as it renders as I intended (easily checked beforehand with [http://tools.wmflabs.org/svgcheck/ this tool]), I'm ok with using svg text. I'll upload one with no text some time in the future though.  The font in the image is sans, but if anything looks different, it's because I italicized the text for emphasis.   I'll see if serif or something looks better when I next revise it. There are unintended italics on DNA and dendrite that I'll remove as well; I forgot to remove those last night when I cut out a bunch of text.

Where a source supports multiple assertions throughout an article, adding all the text supported by that source to the citation's &quot;quote&quot; parameter could be very bulky, confusing and unhelpful.

 I've encountered that problem on amphetamine a few times.  I think it'd be best to make a &quot;supports&quot; parameter in existing cite journal/web/book templates.

Thanks. I see at : &quot;Do not use techniques that require interaction to provide information, such as tooltips or any other 'hover' text.

I agree with Anthony's guideline that hover text is not suitable. Wikipedia may already be more read on phones and tablets than on PCs with a mouse. I don't support using non-standard templates (don't like templates at all, for that matter) for references because each is a barrier to new editors learning to write/maintain text. James, please stop citing translation as a reason en:wp should not adopt new things or use certain markup. I have in the past shown how trivial it is to add/fix templates on other wikis and even if markup needs changed (to some lowest common denominator) that is a trivial exercise for software tools. You are like a person saying nobody should go swimming because he hasn't got a pair of swimming trunks. You see a problem but not the correct solution. -- ° 09:37, 22 July 2014 (UTC)

Thanks for the feedback, . I presume this is a critical accessibility issue - that unless a way can be found to provide this information (what text, exactly, is supported by a given citation) to all readers, including users of screen readers, it shouldn't be on Wikipedia.

 It is certainly possible to create a tool which strips out the  templates. It is unclear to me from the above conversation at what point this should be done.  was specifically designed to be an addition to  tags such that the  tags were not changed, allowing them to be directly copied if the  functionality was not desired. It is not clear to me what tools are being used for such translations, or where such stripping should occur. I would think it would be easier to migrate the  and  templates to whichever wiki is the target for translation.  Even if all that is done is to create a blank  template on such a wiki which completely drops the functionality, creating a blank  template that just parrots back the  tags would be much easier than trying to make sure that the template was always stripped out of the wiki-text when translating. While this would make it such that there is no tooltip on that wiki showing the supported text, it would result in no error being shown (i.e. the ) template would have no effect on the page).

 Yes,  invokes  as that template already has support built in for the  tag (tooltip functionality) across multiple browsers. If a tooltip is to be used, it is better, if possible, to keep all the browser specific code in one location rather than directly duplicate it within the  template.
If desirable,  can probably be modified such that the supported text shows up within the reference footnote.  However, that would require changing the semantics of what is used such that the  tags do not appear within the wiki-text. Doing so will break other referencing tools as the  tags within the wiki-text are what most tools require to recognize a reference. I considered this to be unacceptable as an implementation. The other possibility would be to duplicate the text within the  tags. Doing so would result in the supported text being in the wiki-text in three different places.

Ultimately, how this functionality is implemented depends on what is desired. So far, there have been three different implementations produced: , , and . All of them were intended to be able to be used with all references (i.e. references which either do or do not use cite/citation templates).  Currently,  is not visible to IP users except as text within the reference.  and  are visible to all users but have no method of displaying the supported text within the reference (doing so would break other tools).

If indicating the text supported by a reference is functionality that is desired on a wider basis, then we should discuss how it is desired to be shown (i.e. exactly what functionality is desired).  There are also various significant issues to be considered as to accessibility; if it is desired to have the functionality available to all users now; is it permissible to break current tools; or even if this is functionality that should be available on a wider basis. These are only some of the issues which should be considered.
If what is desired, is something to indicate the supported text now to all users without breaking current tools (i.e. leaving the  tags on the page), then what is available now is  or . At least  has the drawback of significant accessibility issues (only indication of supported text is visual).
The reality is that at a minimum, without significant wide consensus to deploy the functionality to show the supported text when a reference is hovered, there will be drawbacks and some users will not get to see it.  is what is available now which shows the supported text when a reference is hovered to the widest group of people. 
If what is desired is to indicate the text that is supported to every single user then the only way to do that is to have it show up as plain text in the reference text within the references section. In which case,  could be used and we can change the default functionality to be that the supported text is always shown within the reference. Showing the supported text when hovered would then be relegated to the very small percentage of people which have either enabled the  or are using the [[:mw:Reference Tooltips]] gadget. Having such shown to everyone would require that one of those two scripts become a default enabled gadget pushed to all users (including IP users). —  () 19:26, 22 July 2014 (UTC); better description of near-blank  for translated wikis 19:55, 22 July 2014 (UTC)

 I'm not sure we currently need a separate Perineurioma page. When I wanted to do something for Pacinian neuroma (another rare benign tumor of nerve tissue), James, I think, directed me to Neuroma. On that occasion I tried to do a little clean-up, but as I remarked [[Talk:Neuroma#Page structure: a rationale|on the talk page]] the article is almost inevitably a bit of a rag bag due to the somewhat random (historically-based) designation of the word &quot;neuroma&quot;—an appellative that doesn't really correspond to any well-defined class of lesions. I guess Intraneural perineurioma (aka, I think perhaps incorrectly, intraneural perineuroma) might conceivably also fit in to the miscellaneous list there, which is obviously incomplete.

Wait for them to violate MEDRS (or engage in other disruptive behavior), warn them appropriately, and then seek a topic ban or other sanction if they persist.

Cancer Research UK review
As with the other reviews listed below and previously advised here, I asked a CRUK specialist to do an initial review of Brain tumor, the idea being to sort out basic points out in the article before sending the article for review by other outside specialists. I was hoping this would give the medical editing community enough to go on to start serious work on the article.  The reviewer here was the same as for lung cancer (an FA), and she was struck by the much poorer quality and randomness of this in comparison. We agreed that sizeable parts of the article should just be cut, or at the least entirely rewritten. In contrast to  &amp; lung cancer, the article doesn't seem to have a &quot;primary carer&quot; beyond the indefatigable monitoring of JMH &amp; JDW.  In these circumstances, I won't write up the notes here. If anyone wants to help upgrade the article, please let me know, &amp; I can communicate as is most convenient.

One of the things we learned from the Google Foundation project a few years ago is that a few reviewers can easily overwhelm our volunteers.  When you're working in a single specialty (e.g., cancer), then the rate at which reviews can be absorbed and processed by volunteers might be as low as one a week.   () 21:22, 22 July 2014 (UTC)
Personally I am of the opinion that reviews are not that useful. Yes much of our content sucks but the reason that it sucks is not that we the core editing community do not realize that it sucks it is that the core community is a couple of dozen volunteers taking care of more than 27,000 articles. [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 04:34, 23 July 2014 (UTC)
Well actually rather less than one a week I think. At the moment I am doing more on Pancreatic, so there will probably be at least a week before anything changes on Brain, if anyone does want to take it on. But Brain was the last of the reviews planned for now, and the first arrived nearly a month ago. In response to a specific request by an editor who has been expanding it, I have added Endometrial cancer (a rather quicker review I think) which is being done now. Otherwise there will probably be no further articles reviewed for at least a month, possibly longer, unless somebody specifically asks for something to be looked at, which I encourage them to do.  But there will be further reviews of these 4 articles by outside specialists - no timetable yet. I will also be improving all these articles myself, but I am letting the community have first crack at them. They will then appear at Peer Review and as GA or FA nominations (not Lung, which is FA already).  I am very aware of the ratio of active editors and work-to-be-done.  Another aspect of my CRUK work is to try to increase the number of active editors (I am off to Imperial College this afternoon) but I expect most of us know the difficulties in that at the moment (pending WMF actually publicizing/advertising the need for more editors rather than denying it, and also the arrival of good, working, online training).  () 12:54, 23 July 2014 (UTC)
I feel a thoughtful and graduated reviewing approach like this can be genuinely useful if it helps focus collaboration among us volunteers without stressing anyone out (per WAID's observation). Given the scale of the challenge we face with only limited numbers of volunteers here I think finding good ways to develop interactions with Cancer Research UK and other organizations with broadly similar aims in such a way as to allow judiciously targeted input could be beneficial for Wikipedia's medical content in the long term. Continuing and developing the sort of thoughtful collaborations that John's been fostering should be a priority imo.  () 08:50, 23 July 2014 (UTC)

 I sympathise with Doc James' position. Reviews are only useful if there is someone who will actively respond. (This was one of the problems with Article Feedback.)

True. And the active implementation of changes recommended at GAN/FAC can take days and sometimes weeks. Axl is completely right that a review is only ever really useful if an editor is prepared to go through the recommendations and make the prerequisite edits.

*Favor contributions over reviews In 2012 someone at the American College of Physicians asked me to help them design a program in which they could encourage professors and students at all medical schools in the US to write reviews of Wikipedia articles. It seemed like a good idea to me, and I proposed it at . After talking with others and making every proposal variant I could imagine, I became convinced that getting reviews would not be very useful because even in our best articles, like lung cancer which is a featured article and which you already had reviewed by Cancer Research UK, it is easy for anyone of almost any skill level to propose many ways that an article can be improved. Asking for reviews is fine, and people giving reviews is nice, but if someone gives a review, I feel that they should know that we Wikipedians have found no way to make use of them and that we would much rather request that people add a single sentence and citation anywhere they saw fit to add one. I have never seen a good outcome result from anyone who flies into Wikipedia, makes requests or proposals, then leaves without engaging and having a conversation or exchange with the community. Even with a conversation, there is little progress unless the reviewer actually participates in Wikipedia. Most review schemes imagine that utility can come from this, but I have never seen one work. [[User:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ]][[User talk:Bluerasberry|(talk)]] 19:13, 23 July 2014 (UTC)
 Well, for me &quot;personally&quot; this series of mini-reviews has provided a stimulus to get involved in making a some collaborative contributions, alongside others here, that I doubt I would otherwise have done (and I'm not altogether sure that in all cases others would have either). And I see John has already been implementing some of the reviewers' writing suggestions himself. At least this process would seem to me to supplement the &quot;Collaboration of the month&quot;. Ok, so I may have encountered at least one minor, unintended discouragement along the way. Knowing that an &quot;Epidemiology&quot; section was going to be done by an expert dissuaded me from continuing in an area where, with hindsight, I could probably usefully have just gone on regardless. But hey, that's probably just me.  () 21:00, 23 July 2014 (UTC)
Where is Anthony Cole when you need him? Probably at Wikipediocracy. My main comments are interposed above, in case people missed them. I agree reviews are generally less desirable than edits, and especially where students are concerned, but where real experts are concerned the choice in the vast majority of cases is reviews or nothing. My experience has actually been different from Blue R's above.  () 11:32, 24 July 2014 (UTC)
I must say I was unaware of the previous Google and  medical review efforts, which I've bween reading up on. Without too much poking around page histories I could find , where a Google review presumably prompted  to sort out the review points 18 days later. No doubt he could have done this at any point by himself, but it seems the review led to the improvement (perhaps at the cost of whatever else Garrondo would have been doing). Perhaps it is too easy to write-off such efforts as failures.  In any case the CRUK reviewing (unless specially requested, as at Endometrial cancer) will be concentrated on a much smaller number of articles, and will in most or all cases be presented/mediated by me, rather than posted directly, unless the reviewer wants to take that route.  () 12:45, 24 July 2014 (UTC)
 Without bring more editors to the project, the best outcome from getting more reviews is squeezing more volunteer time out of a community which is already giving everything that it can. Any donation is acceptable, just like when rich people donate dirty laundry to charity shops the poor accept the donations and try to clean the things to make them usable to present to their clients. It is really nice when donors give useful things to those who need them, especially when it seems trivial enough like using the washing machine before donating clothes, but for some reason in charity relationships donors tend to expect a lot of response and business capacity from people who already do not have many resources. Beggars cannot choose what kinds of donations they get, but sometimes if the laundry is dirty and the volunteers have no capacity to clean it then they smile when they take the donation then put it in the trash. There are a lot of nonprofit organizations that have a policy of accepting any donation, just because it hurts donors' feelings if what they offer is rejected and because if donors give low-value things continually over time then maybe someday they will come around and donate what is really needed. Do what you will, but please also consider finding at least one person in your organization who is willing to listen to what this community actually requests. If they understand the situation and still give reviews, then in the long term if they come to see what we do with the reviews they will not resent us for accepting them without appreciating them as they intended.
Or I could be wrong about this. I certainly hope for the best, and if you find a way to make this work, then please talk with me because I could bring in more reviews also. [[User:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ]][[User talk:Bluerasberry|(talk)]] 14:05, 24 July 2014 (UTC)
, if I didn't know you to be a kind sort of person that you are I think I would have found some of your last comment rather galling. As it is, I feel you're coming close to devaluing the gf work of several volunteers here (mine for one).  () 14:28, 24 July 2014 (UTC) previously 
I do not know who you are, IP, so I cannot comment on your work. &quot;GF work&quot;? What is this? I am not sure how to respond. I could restate what I said by saying that the least useful contribution that it is difficult to make use of someone's order that volunteers ought to do more work that everyone agrees ought to be done. Reviews become more useful as they become more conversational, and review submissions from people who do not want to actually talk with us are difficult to use. Outsiders who submit work orders for article development are fairly easy to find. I am not sure who you are, but if you found this conversation, you engage more deeply than by reading an article, telling people to improve it, then leaving forever. Personal relationships matter even in semi-anonymous exchanges. [[User:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ]][[User talk:Bluerasberry|(talk)]] 16:25, 24 July 2014 (UTC)
 What do you need to know to respect my gf work (as distinct, for example, from tireless POV pushing)? :/ If you just glanced at the history of the previous ip address I posted you'd see I've been working on some of the pages under review. Fwiw, I'm someone who's spent his working life responding to reviewers: so it's probably not so strange thatI see differently from you on such matters (and perhaps also that I found your charity shop analogies annoying). Personally, I'd much rather respond to the sort of mini-reviews we've been receiving from outside than to the stuff here that led to LT leaving.   () 17:11, 24 July 2014 (UTC) (previously )
I struck out my above text because I have been told that it is not interpreted in the way that I wish it would be. My point was that lots of people have suggestions for what we ought to do here. In any given month, about 30-40 people participate on this board and in the last year, we had about 120 regular contributors to health content. Whenever anyone gives a review and help managing our labor pool without actually joining the community they do so on the premise that there are more people here than just a small group. We are not equipped to process complicated donations or take work orders. [[User:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ]][[User talk:Bluerasberry|(talk)]] 12:41, 25 July 2014 (UTC)
Indeed, and there are also people in the community (if not today) who do request reviews. We are daily turning editors away, both existing editors perhaps without much medical background, and newcomers, often with a medical background, and apart from existing editors, well-executed reviews may well give some of these ways to get used to the project's norms. I have linked to explanations of the [https://blog.wikimedia.org/2014/05/29/cancer-research-uk-and-women-fellows/#more-29170 varying aspects of my CRUK role] before, but here it is again, including editing training, which was done here before .

Everything you are doing, including collecting reviews, is wholly positive and beneficial. I have always thought so and never doubted it. If I were talking about anything, it was only in the efficiency in use of a good thing. You are doing everything wonderfully and no one should ask more of you because you already are working miracles. I need no further explanation of your work because I am convinced that it is good and I hope you achieve everything you imagine. Keep me posted if you find a case in which someone wants to do reviews, then they start editing articles. So far as I know that is a case study no one has yet described.

Thanks. This is the biggest success story I have seen from these sorts of projects. The person stayed with us three months and made about 600 edits before leaving four years ago.

In another area entirely  is a (retired) expert who came in contact with WP in an editathon, providing expertise rather than editing. Subsequently she began to join in the talk page discussion, and then look at other articles. She has never been actually trained to edit, but picked it up very well, though somewhat held back by perfectionism, which experts are prone to. When adding content she sometimes does so in huge chunks, so her basic stats rather underestimate her contributions.  As her talk page comments show, she has engaged with the community but not found this altogether a delight. She returns now and then, and I hope will resume significant additions in the future.

Woof, woof. This seems an ok topic, with decent refs in place, but not conventionally formatted. Should not take a template wiz long to sort out.

References in body or in reflist

References can be placed inline in an article or placed in the reflist as named references, like so:

reflist|refs=




I prefer the reflist method. Both inline and list references can be used simultaneously in the same article. A complication of the reflist method is if a reference is removed from the article, it must be remarked out on the reflist.

Seeking comment or guidance. Thanks. - -  () 20:39, 26 July 2014 (UTC)

 Just to add more aspects to the discussion, here is what I wrote on QG's talk page. I would add that there are no more problems with removing a reference in either system, IF the references has been used more than once. A search of the page will find them. 
 There are MoS statements which say that either style is allowed, but the one who created the article usually has some right to decide which style they will use. If they were to object, their wishes should probably be respected, but with old articles there may not be any special preference anymore. Just be careful.
 I have always used the most common method, which is having the references spread around within the text, but it is messy and makes editing harder. So, when I created the Charlotte's Web (cannabis) article, I decided to try the &quot;list-defined references&quot; style. If you click on the References link there, you'll see this note:
* This article uses &quot;list-defined references&quot;, per .
* To ease editing and avoid confusion and duplication of sources, the references below are in alphabetical order by ref name.
* While other citation templates are not forbidden, this basic template has been used for most references:
* 
 That means the article only has the short &quot;name&quot; references in the text, which makes for a cleaner editing experience. When anyone adds references, I move the ref to the bottom and use that citation template, unless another citation template has been used and is working fine. I have also tried to follow the advice from my essay: . --  () 21:33, 26 July 2014 (UTC)
I much prefer the refs inline than at the end. [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 22:31, 26 July 2014 (UTC)
See  for &quot;the rules&quot; about changing citation formatting.   () 01:31, 27 July 2014 (UTC)
I justify my work on references with the imposing uniformity mentioned in CITEVAR and the Common Sense exception and boldly edit. I think changing from inline to reflist (or vice versa) is too great a change for that justification so I won't make that change. I do extensive work on references, often boldly, I encourage anyone finding my editing problematic on a particular article to notify me on my talk page. My intention is to provide uniform, useful and accurate references not to impose my preferences or hinder the work of others. Often my formatting of references is a first step in verification. - -  () 02:02, 27 July 2014 (UTC)
Frankly I don't understand the opening comment here - there are several ways of doing references. What I dislike about typical WP medical referencing is that encourages people to reference a whole article, chapter or even book (Doc James' WCH2014 edits, very useful though they are, would be better if page numbers were used rather than chapter sections of several pages) or if the exact references are used the text disappears in the editing view in a sea of citation template text. Referencing whole works (in practice probably meaning their abstracts) is sometimes appropriate, but more often not.  I'm very dubious about imposing styles against . It isn't something I'd do boldly except in articles that are clearly neglected; you should ask on the talk page first, as CITEVAR says.  I recently experimented with the  style at Resection margin as I expanded it; this has the advantage that several different pages from the same work can be referenced very neatly (where the pages are available of course, which they may not be in online publications). Wiki CRUK John/ () 02:22, 27 July 2014 (UTC)
The opening comment is based on an article where another editor moved references out of the reflist into the body and I reverted that change. I thought having some discussion here might be useful as I do lots of ref formatting and value input here. I will endeavor to bring the subject up on the talk page of articles first.
I agree that more precise citations would be useful. Might I suggest using the rp template. I also agree that all too often it is the abstract being cited not the article (which is not really appropriate). Best of luck getting a significant number of editors to actually read an entire article and cite the page the fact comes from. When I do verification I will make a stab at adding the rp template to individual facts. I also like the sfn template but see that more for referencing larger works but I can see how it would be useful for journal articles also. - -  () 02:36, 27 July 2014 (UTC)
Reverting to the status quo is fine. Personally in a case where someone wants to expand an article significantly, and prefers a different style from the current one, I'd be receptive to that if the proposed style works ok, as most of them do.  () 12:05, 27 July 2014 (UTC)
With respect to the World Cancer Report, each chapter is only a few pages long. E-books often no longer give page numbers thus I often just reference the chapter. [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 21:50, 28 July 2014 (UTC)
I very much prefer refs in a reflist at the end but would capitulate and put them inline if absolutely required for technical reasons, such as preparing the article for export to a language that does not support .
Thanks for the input everyone. I guess we have CITEVAR and common sense. As I have said I do a good bit of reference work any objections to my actions can certainly be brought right to my talk page. - -  () 12:44, 29 July 2014 (UTC)

Nagalase
Nagalase previously linked to the Alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase article, which contained substantial amounts of uncited material, and what appeared to be a three-paragraph copyvio from an abstract. Given the recent controversy regarding nagalase research (for example, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ijc.23107/full this article retraction], and the large amount of non-WP:RS interest out there on the subject and also GcMAF (see, for example, material on forums [http://www.davidicke.com/forum/showthread.php?t=160916 such as this]), we should be very careful about ensuring all statements on this subject are both adequately cited, and that a retraction search has been performed on the cited papers. I'd greatly appreciate it if medically knowledgable editors could improve the article to  standards, and/or add both articles and the currently deleted redirect to their watchlists.  --  () 16:32, 27 July 2014 (UTC)

Agree this is problematic, especially given the relative lack of RS on the subject. The Gc-MAF page now carries a mention of misleading use of the so-called test. By no means a complete answer to the issue, I know.  () 13:20, 29 July 2014 (UTC)

He's got some code that tries to compare an article to the assessment standards.  The idea here is to produce a list of articles that are rated as stubs, but have probably expanded since their last review.  It would be much more efficient for us to re-assess only the ones that are likely to be out of date than to re-assess all 9,000 of our stubs.  I'm hoping that someone will try this out.
