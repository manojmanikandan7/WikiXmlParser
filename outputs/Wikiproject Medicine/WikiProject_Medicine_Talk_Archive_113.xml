		<segment id="id57587063">Health care ratings tagged as medical expert required, but that seems a misuse of the tag

The tag says &quot; The specific problem is: Neutrality of the article concerning the financial incentives linked to funding qualifications of healthcare institutes based on greater positive ratings.&quot;

I don't think the tag is appropriate, but as I've already been struggling to explain to this editor that adding NPOV tags without specifics is a bad idea (please do see if you can make sense of  . I'm not a medical expert, I'm not going to touch this one! Doug Weller talk 08:27, 12 May 2018 (UTC)
i worked it over.  Yes the tag was bogus. Jytdog (talk) 21:25, 12 May 2018 (UTC)
It's my experience that many of these tags have been placed inappropriately, and that almost none of them result in any practical improvements to an article.  For example, Criticism of fast food#Food poisoning risk doesn't need an expert, and it's been patiently waiting for someone to fix it for more than five years.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 17:03, 14 May 2018 (UTC)

Carolina Reaper

There is a disagreement regarding this set of edits [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carolina_Reaper&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=842689087&amp;oldid=842685951]  to article as per the discussion: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Carolina_Reaper#Original_research] as to whether or not MEDRS applies to the case/claims.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=(+%22chilli+pepper++health+effect%22+)+AND+Review%5Bptyp%5D PubMed reviews are always a good idea]--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 10:14, 24 May 2018 (UTC)
This is an interesting dispute for medical editors and WP content because the topic concerns ingestion of a particularly hot (high capsaicin content) chili pepper that resulted in hospitalization of the consumer experiencing &quot;thunderclap&quot; headaches, concurrent with vasospasm of major intracerebral arteries, shown in CT images [http://casereports.bmj.com/content/2018/bcr-2017-224085.full here as a single BMJ case report.] Dispute issues: 1) the pepper is among the hottest known chilis, raising its profile about what might happen in chili-eating contests, but the actual mechanism of arterial spasm is unknown and contrary to what one might expect of capsaicin as a vasodilator, 2) one person eating it experienced a severe medical emergency, 3) which generated news hype and an entry in the Carolina Reaper article of a section entitled, &quot;Health effects&quot; [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Reaper#Health_effects here], 4) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Carolina_Reaper#Original_research Talk page consensus] among non-medical editors is that this one case, sensationalized news story is article-worthy, ignoring OR (inferred by the defending editors insisting this one event is encyclopedic), NOTNEWS, RECENTISM, notability and weight, , MEDRS confirmation, etc. --Zefr (talk) 15:00, 24 May 2018 (UTC)

 The key point of the issue is the inference that eating a chilli pepper caused reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome. The plural of anecdote is not data, and a single incident is certainly far too little for it to imply a medical fact. If the article can dispassionately summarise the actual facts (a man ate a very hot chilli pepper in a contest; a few days later he was hospitalised with thunderclap headaches; the neurologists eventually diagnosed RCVS, &quot;probably as a result of eating the chilli&quot;; this was sensationally reported in the popular press), then an argument can be made that it's sufficiently of interest to merit mention in the article. But I find it very difficult to find a form of words that doesn't leave the reader with the impression that eating a chilli caused RCVS, for which there is no significant medical evidence as far as I can see. In fact, the active chemicals are normally considered vasodilators, so any suggestion of causality must be very questionable. --RexxS (talk) 20:11, 24 May 2018 (UTC)

Note that despite its name (reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome), our article states that the condition can be caused by vasodilation as well as vasoconstriction. Looie496 (talk) 13:34, 25 May 2018 (UTC)
 Indeed it does, although it never mentions the word 'vasodilation'. But the actual sources it cites are not so certain. The first source,, is clear that the symptoms are of vasoconstriction, and that &quot;Many conditions and exposures have been linked to RCVS, including vasoactive drugs ...&quot;. The [http://www.ajnr.org/content/ajnr/early/2015/01/15/ajnr.A4214.full.pdf other source] is equally clear that &quot;The pathophysiology of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome is unknown.&quot; I still think we're better off not giving the impression that there's any respectable evidence that eating a chilli can cause RCVS. YMMV. --RexxS (talk) 14:35, 25 May 2018 (UTC)

 The authors of the paper were interested in feedback . Boghog (talk) 07:58, 25 May 2018 (UTC)

They really only mentioned me because my identity is public knowledge. My activities in this article have pretty much been confined to maintaining it. Looie496 (talk) 13:23, 25 May 2018 (UTC)
In my view maintaining pages is vital work.  And one of the things that the paper focused on, was what a good job you all have done over time, updating the article as our knowledge of these systems has grown. It is so great that you all have done that, and also great that it was recognized by the authors of the paper. So thanks for that work! Jytdog (talk) 14:43, 25 May 2018 (UTC)
And I will add, that this is a particular ax of mine.  In my view WMF marketing people generally, especially with regard to outreach,  puts way too much emphasis on new page creation and not enough on maintenance, which is SO IMPORTANT but gets none of glamour that people put on new pages.  It is one reason I am delighted that this paper a) focused on maintenance and b) found us not wanting.  (We got lucky on the latter, as there are topics where we would be found very wanting, if anybody analyzed them this way.) Jytdog (talk) 14:46, 25 May 2018 (UTC)

Wikidata now showing more &quot;appropriately&quot; in watchlists



The way changes to Wikidata show up in your watchlist on English Wikipedia has recently been improved. Previously if a Wikidata property was used within a Wikipedia page any change to any property in the entire item on Wikidata would create a line in your watchlist. 

Now only if changes occur to that specific property used (or the aliases) will a line appear in your watch list. In my opinion this is a significant step forwards so congrats to the Wikidata team. I have requested the option not to show changes to &quot;aliases&quot;. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 21:12, 13 May 2018 (UTC)
very good change!--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 10:36, 14 May 2018 (UTC)
 Still no way to tell, in that image, if the edit is constructive or not. Having to go to a different site with a different UI to figure out whether the infobox has been made inaccurate, or vandalized, is far from ideal. To me, it's against the spirit of this wiki, where changes that are made to the article are recorded here. Outriggr (talk) 02:06, 15 May 2018 (UTC)
Also, you have to change the default of OFF for &quot;Show Wikidata edits in your watchlist&quot; at Preferences, Watchlist. I'd bet very, very few normal editors have that turned on - I certainly didn't. I've now turned it on, but with a watchlist of over 24k articles, I'm rather dreading the result. Johnbod (talk) 03:39, 15 May 2018 (UTC)
There are still improvements needed. It still shows some stuff it shouldn't. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 19:10, 15 May 2018 (UTC)
 Indeed, but it's better than it was. I'm working on our templates and Lua modules to minimise the number of different items that an article reads from Wikidata, which will allow the watchlist to be more specific. We also have very good relations with the folks doing development on this part of the MediaWiki software, and I'm optimistic that further improvements are possible in the near future. --RexxS (talk) 21:29, 15 May 2018 (UTC)
Just picked up my first bit of WD vandalism via this new watchlist.[https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q121874&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=680278846&amp;oldid=639344415] Doc James (talk ·  · ) 18:59, 16 May 2018 (UTC)

Criticisms of medicine

This article/essay came up in the new pages queue. Thoughts? Natureium (talk) 23:48, 30 April 2018 (UTC)
I smell a sock. Hm.  This will take some looking into.  Jytdog (talk) 04:59, 1 May 2018 (UTC)
Yeah and it's not a real topic (too vague/general for RS) - the article is full of /; needs deleting. Alexbrn (talk) 06:38, 1 May 2018 (UTC)
I agree it's quite vague.. it seems like all the subheadings would really be better as their own pages (with better wording of course). For instance, he included a &quot;Scandals&quot; heading and included a handful of scandals, but if we had a &quot;Scandals in medicine&quot; article we could populate it with millions of bytes of information. How did they choose those specific examples? It reads more like an essay because the examples are seemingly arbitrary. The sources are pretty good, it looks like he's interfaced about this article with many members of this WP, as evident through his talk page. I don't think deletion is in order until we figure out which direction to take the article in. I also think each section needs to have a &quot;main article&quot; to direct to if they are going to remain brief. SEMMENDINGER (talk) 13:46, 1 May 2018 (UTC)
There's some good material here. I'm not certain it all fits together under that y title. Better to integrate this content into other articles, I'd've thought. Bondegezou (talk) 15:05, 1 May 2018 (UTC)
The article is unfortunately all over the place. It also fails to recognize that there is no such thing as &quot;mainstream medicine&quot;, but only &quot;medicine&quot;. Carl Fredrik talk 15:39, 1 May 2018 (UTC)
That's one POV, and it is not universally shared.  And you know, there is actually value in being able to differentiate between different types of legally regulated behavior, e.g., the kind that involves setting broken bones vs. the kind that involves physicians prescribing cough syrup for a cold.  I'm not sure what that POV calls prescribing useless stuff, but the law calls it &quot;practicing medicine&quot;.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:16, 1 May 2018 (UTC)

Electrotherapy  - Medical device problem - electricity or EMR in medicine

This will not interest folks mostly interested in drugs, but we have a bit of a problem with our article structures about use of electrical or electromagnetic radiation (EMR) used therapeutically (this is not getting into the whole imaging thing)

There are multiple branchings.  Electricity or EMR can be used to stimulate or ablate, for therapeutic purposes. 

We have (listed roughly from most general to most specific)

* Electrotherapy (total mess)
* Photomedicine
* Laser medicine (many things link from here
* Neurostimulation (broad concept - many kind of nervous system/nerves; electric and EMR)

;Going down the stimulation with electricity pathway
* Electroanalgesia
* Functional electrical stimulation (broad concept, messy article mixing research and medicine and fringey stuff)
* Electrical muscle stimulation
* Electrical brain stimulation (a mess, kind of a subset of the above focused on the brain)
* Cranial electrotherapy stimulation (fringey, pretty solid article)
* Transcranial direct-current stimulation (fringey, pretty solid article)
* Transcranial alternating current stimulation (fringey, pretty solid article)
* Transcranial random noise stimulation (fringey, weak article)
* Deep brain stimulation (real medicine; messy article)
* Electroconvulsive therapy (real medicine, article is OK)
* Vagus nerve stimulation (real medicine, lots of hype from companies, messy article)
* Electrotherapy (cosmetic)

;going down the stimulation or other &quot;therapy&quot; with EMR pathway. 
* Pulsed electromagnetic field therapy (a disambig page that is a mess)
* Low Field Magnetic Stimulation (LFMS)
* Magnetic seizure therapy
* Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (real medicine, pretty solid article)
* Transcranial magnetic stimulation (real medicine, pretty solid article)
* Light therapy
* Blood irradiation therapy
* Low-level laser therapy
* Infrared sauna (yep)

;ablation with electricity
* Cauterization#Electrocautery

;ablation with EMR
* Laser surgery
* Electrosurgery
* Radiation therapy
* Radiosurgery 
* Radiofrequency ablation
* Microwave ablation
** Catheter ablation
** Hyfrecator
** Cyberknife
* Photodynamic therapy
* Alternating electric field therapy (?)
* Photoimmunotherapy and Combinatorial ablation and immunotherapy

;mess around Hyperthermia aka Heat therapy (two articles on the same thing?) 
* Photothermal therapy
* Magnetic hyperthermia (merged to Hyperthermia therapy) Natureium (talk) 17:13, 17 May 2018 (UTC)
* Microwave thermotherapy
* Tronado machine

I am hanging my head over this thicket. This is not even all of it. 

But to focus, what should we do with Electrotherapy? Jytdog (talk) 05:22, 17 May 2018 (UTC) (fixed &quot;EMF&quot; thing without redacting Jytdog (talk) 19:24, 17 May 2018 (UTC))
 Could I ask, please, for you to check what abbreviations you're using above, because I'm finding it confusing. EMF is 'electromotive force', i.e. voltage, which implies moving electrons through the body. EMR is 'electomagnetic radiation', which implies bombarding the body with photons of some wavelength. Magnetism is a different phenomenon again. Lasers won't be based on EMF, for example, nor is magnetic stimulation EMR. If the articles are that confused, they need taking to AfD. --RexxS (talk) 13:59, 17 May 2018 (UTC)
I'm pretty sure EMF is being used to mean &quot;electromagnetic fields&quot;. Looie496 (talk) 14:26, 17 May 2018 (UTC)
 Which would add to the confusion as EMF would then be synonymous with EMR, and if so, then Electrosurgery, for example, wouldn't fit as it relies on an electric current, not an electromagnetic field. There is a huge difference in the mechanisms. But I don't suppose that worries the quacks who are looking for a novelty cure for everything. How long before mesmerism makes a comeback? --RexxS (talk) 18:19, 17 May 2018 (UTC)
i made it consistent, without redaction to avoid clutter.Jytdog (talk) 19:24, 17 May 2018 (UTC))
I think I can resolve one of the smaller questions:  Heat stroke is a type of Hyperthermia.  The proper subject of the Hyperthermia article is a potentially fatal medical condition, not the treatment category that sometimes uses the same name.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:55, 17 May 2018 (UTC)
good idea, more concise--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 10:12, 28 May 2018 (UTC)
 Was the article just moved or has it always been titled that way? It seems fine how it is now. Hyperthermia is a condition and heat therapy is a treatment. Natureium (talk) 17:00, 17 May 2018 (UTC)
 Now I think Jytdog may have meant to link to Hyperthermia therapy instead of Hyperthermia. As written, Hyperthermia therapy and Heat therapy are 2 different things. Hyperthermia therapy uses excessive heat to induce cell death, whereas heat therapy is using warmth to sooth sore muscles... or something like that. Natureium (talk) 17:16, 17 May 2018 (UTC)
 I merged magnetic hyperthermia into Hyperthermia therapy since it's been over a year since it was proposed and no one has given a good argument not to. Natureium (talk) 17:12, 17 May 2018 (UTC)

* Thanks for the thoughts and work everybody!  Quite a tangle, right?  What should we do with Electrotherapy?  Jytdog (talk) 19:20, 17 May 2018 (UTC)
How about a ? We could keep the history section by moving it to History of electrotherapy. Little pob (talk) 19:40, 17 May 2018 (UTC)
 I would first suggest removing the Muscle stimulation and Cancer treatment sections, as well everything from the Modern use up to, but not including, the Effectiveness for particular indications section. Those are stuffed full of biomedical claims without a MEDRS source, and in many cases without any source at all. Next rewrite the lead to accurately summarise the lack of evidence for any significant effects at all.
 Then have a competition to find the worst bit of woo in the present version of the article and preserve it in formaldehyde somewhere on the talk page as a grisly reminder of the amount of complete bollocks there was in the article. My current favourite is  --RexxS (talk) 22:11, 17 May 2018 (UTC)

There is a meta-editing, structural element to my question about Electrotherapy... i put that at the top because as near as I can tell, it is the closest thing we have to a &quot;head&quot; article in Wikipedia about &quot;therapeutic use of electricity and EMR&quot;. (not even saying &quot;medical use of electricity and EMR&quot; because then we would have to pull in all the imaging).  Should it just be a sort of disambig page and outline for the rest of our content about these things? Jytdog (talk) 22:17, 17 May 2018 (UTC)
btw I went and looked at MESH headers on this stuff hoping I would use them as a guide... but they are woefully messy.  I was going to present all that mess but it would have been just another bewildering pile for people to sort thru. Jytdog (talk) 22:18, 17 May 2018 (UTC)
Some sort of &quot;Ways people use (and have used) electricity to treat diseases&quot; articles could be encyclopedic.  I'm not sure that would be called &quot;electrotherapy&quot;, since presumably that article would include pacemakers and deep brain stimulation and defibrillators.

Another textbook copy and pasting from Wikipedia
Per 

This case is interesting as the book is published by Academic Press / Elsevier in 2010. There was an effort to use the book as a reference to support the text. But we had the text first and it had changed over time on Wikipedia.

Found a few spots of copy and pasting. Have not looked at further articles this section may have lifted from. Book in question:

And here it appears Cambridge University Press is copy and pasting from Wikipedia.


This one is notable as they are the oldest publisher in the world. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 02:22, 24 May 2018 (UTC)
See if you can get the primary author of the article to contact the publisher about copyright violations (assuming the primary author wrote most of the article content which was plagiarized - that author would be the copyright holder and would have the power/right to file a DMCA takedown notice and/or initiate legal action).  When I did that for the plagiarized material from the amphetamine article that was republished without attribution in an OMICS journal, the authors and publisher were extremely responsive and rapidly corrected the copyright violation by adding the necessary attribution. In the case of the textbook, they'll probably have to republish a revised edition. Seppi333 (Insert 2¢) 20:49, 30 May 2018 (UTC)
I can copy/paste the email here which I sent the OMICS journal staff about the copyvio in the event it'd help facilitate a correction to the textbook and address this issue. Seppi333 (Insert 2¢) 20:54, 30 May 2018 (UTC)


Really Diabetes is risk factor  for Acute cerebrovascular disease (stroke)?
I am medical doctor , a diabetes consultant . I and all doctors believe diabetes is risk factor for stroke .
But recently I observed usa government statistics ….i recognized that diabetes is not risk factor for stroke. I want to start discussion in this subject to confirm the fact.
*https://hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb17.pdf
*https://hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb51.pdf 
The above links from government of usa health statistics. To get the answer to my question we have to get answer for following questions
#IN one lack non-diabetic persons how much percent suffered with Stroke?
#IN one lack diabetic persons(Primary or secondary) how much percent suffered with Stroke?
The above 2 links can give answers to these questiongs
First link confirms the follows :
#Total hospital admissions for all diseases 32,371,800 , 
#Total hospital stays for diabetes  6,290,000 .
#Stroke diagnosis in these diabetic population is  153,800 (2.4%)
Second link confirms the follows :
#Total hospital admissions for all diseases  29,970,600 
#Stroke diagnosis in this total hospital stays     892,300  (2.97%)
The statistics from usa government records. No chance to get errors. First link from 2004 december 2004 , 2nd link form 2005 …only just few months defference .
Diabetes reduces the risk of stroke ?We recognize the point risk of chance to getting stroke….it is not releted to year of publication.We can get same results in following 2018 links

(Subrahmanya preethamm (talk) 13:10, 3 June 2018 (UTC))
Is it not simply that diabetics are admitted to the hospital more often for non-stroke? Even if diabetics had the same risk of stroke, but increased risk of other diseases the data would show fewer strokes as a % of cause for hospitalization. 
This says nothing about the increased or decreased risk of having a stroke, just that diabetics visit the hospital more often for reasons unrelated to stroke. 
Put differently, there is nothing to indicate that one person could not account for 2+ discharges in that data — hence it can't answer your question. Carl Fredrik talk 13:20, 3 June 2018 (UTC)
You're also not comparing like-for-like cohorts. Since diabetes has a negative impact on life expectancy (something which isn't in dispute), and stroke primarily affects older people, than statistically there are fewer diabetics reaching the age when the risk of stroke becomes a major issue. By the same misuse of statistics, one can equally well prove that driving a motorcycle on the freeway while drunk statistically reduces your risk of developing dementia. This kind of thing is why we rely exclusively on peer-reviewed secondary sources for Wikipedia's medical content and don't engage in our own original research or analysis of data. ‑ Iridescent 14:25, 3 June 2018 (UTC)

I compared the risk of Stroke in diabetic and general hospital stays. I given two links .First link confirms percentage of hospitals stays for stroke in diabetic population (2.4%). Second link confirms percentage of hospital stays for stroke in general population (2.97%)

I compare only numbers count. There is no any other alternative to measure risk factor. But in our medical books they clearly mentioned that diabetes is risk factor for stroke. How the authors confirmed the diabetes is risk factor for stroke? Most of book authors follows systemic reviews. Most systemic reviews based on co-morbid presents with Stroke patients. Commonly Stroke happened in after 60 years age , these people have co-morbid diabetes and hypertension..

Simple logic:

1.100 people drive motor cycle on very nice road .

2.100 people drive motor cycle on bad road .

If 2.97% accidents in nice road and 2.4% accidents on good road . what is the meaning? My answer is bad road is not risk factor for accident.here the bad road is diabetes.even my links are support this .here age is risk factor for diabetes and non diabetes . frequent hospital stays happens in diabetic and non diabetics.it is not issue to take for consideration. 
 
I have studied many reviews on this issue .i am analyzing the reviews ,i will submit high quality secondary source shortly. In every review their final conclusion is &quot;Diabetes is risk factor for Stroke&quot; . Here another point we have to think...every human being have risk to get stroke....we have to compare the risk with normal people.The authors unable to get information from normal healthy people .Normal healthy people not reach hospitals.In normal healthy people how much percent getting stroke?.If we get this answer we can compare . The authors simply reach stroke hospital and verify hundreds of records of stroke patients and conclusion is &quot; Diabetes and hypertension&quot; are risk factors for stroke. in old age people diabetes and hypertension are most common. so they are coming to conclusion. If the authors concludes like this no problem at all. But ever doctors must know the fact ....what happens really ?

  That's an interesting observation you have made. Unfortunately, you need to get it published in a peer-reviewed medical journal before it becomes a suitable topic for inclusion on Wikipedia. We are not qualified peer reviewers (well, some editors are, but that's not the job they do here at Wikipedia).   17:51, 3 June 2018 (UTC)
You would need to get it published as a review article on the topic in question in a major journal for it to be included. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 21:27, 3 June 2018 (UTC)
The analogy fails.  You have no reason to believe that the &quot;100 people who drive motorcycles&quot; are similar.  100 people who ride motorcycles very fast on a crowded, well-maintained road will likely have more problems than 100 people who ride motorcycles slowly on a dirt road.  That doesn't mean that the road has no effect; it means that the road isn't the only factor.   Or, as someone else put it, habitual drunk driving &quot;protects&quot; against dementia.  But dying in a car wreck isn't the same thing as truly preventing dementia.  WhatamIdoing (talk)
That doesn't really hit the central point though...
It's more like saying that diabetes is protective against death, because fewer people with diabetes die than people without diabetes dying. (Mind no mention of premature death.) Carl Fredrik talk 12:29, 4 June 2018 (UTC)

Some more interesting points supporting diabetes not increase stroke rate :
#Other  health  problems common in both diabetic and non diabetic   . Life expectancy  have no  importance  for this risk calculation . Non diabetic may be die with cancer at early age .
#We are counting only stroke rate . one person may get stroke many time, it may be happen in diabetic and non diabetic.
#We are counting only ,how many strokes for 100 hospital stays in diabetes and non diabetes.
#These are very surprising results. Stroke occurred in diabetic population 2.4 % and in non diabetics 2.97 % . We can conclude that diabetes not increasing stroke rate. Diabetes have protected effect in .57 % against stroke .
(Subrahmanya preethamm (talk) 13:57, 4 June 2018 (UTC))
No, &quot;we&quot; cannot conclude anything. That is exactly what  tells us. There's no special dispensation for WP:MED on this, it is a fundamental policy of Wikipedia. LeadSongDog come howl! 14:38, 4 June 2018 (UTC)
It's not only against Wikipedia's policies, but also just blatantly wrong and scientifically illiterate.

#I can not understand what this is supposed to mean.
#Yupp, exactly
#No, we can only conclude that of hospitalizations, diabetic patients are more likely to enter hospital for other reasons than stroke. It's not at all surprising.
It is at best — mildly interesting, telling us that at the ER we should not assume stroke simply because a patient has diabetes — which frankly no one was doing to start with. Carl Fredrik talk 15:01, 4 June 2018 (UTC) 
Carl Fredrik talk 15:01, 4 June 2018 (UTC)

Again, you're comparing apples and oranges; you're looking at the fraction of diabetic patients presenting with stroke; what you want to look at is the fraction of stroke patients who have diabetes. To wit:
*There were 32.3 million total hospital admissions considered;
*There were 6.3 million hospital admissions of patients who had a diabetes diagnosis;
*Therefore 6.3/32.3 = 19.5% of all hospital admissions involved patients with diabetes.
*Among patients admitted with a principal diagnosis acute cerebrovascular disease (stroke) 28.2% had diabetes as a coexisting condition ([https://hcup-us.ahrq.gov/reports/statbriefs/sb17.pdf Brief 17], your first link above, in line 8 of Table 2).
*19.5% of hospital admissions involve someone with diabetes; 28.2% of hospital admissions due to stroke involve someone with diabetes.
*Diabetics are overrepresented among hospital admissions of patients diagnosed with stroke.
Now, there are a number of confounding and controlling factors that I've omitted (diabetics have additional diabetes-related hospital admissions, diabetics on average are a younger population at admission, hospital admissions don't necessarily capture very mild or very lethal disease, etc.) but if properly accounted for I suspect most of those factors would tend to make the trend more pronounced. TenOfAllTrades(talk) 14:52, 4 June 2018 (UTC)
^ This is the correct way to analyze it.  The original was assuming that half the population was diabetic.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 15:51, 4 June 2018 (UTC)

Additional information for discussion : I am physican especially consultant of diabetes . I strongly believes diabetes is risk factor for stroke, already i mentioned the same before . But the USA statistics changed my opinion . diabetic hospitalizations are more . but stroke is same proportion  with diabetic and non diabetic . 
1.Patients with T2D are hospitalized at a considerably high rate for causes.But not stroke . Stroke risk same with non diabetic people.
#Renal failure
#Hyperglycemia
#Infections
#Eye complications  
#Stroke proportion is very less.

2.About co morbid conditions : stroke occurs most frequently to old age people only. Diabetes present nearly 30% old age people….even stroke patients or non stroke patients 
3.I am looking at the fraction of diabetic patients presenting with stroke  and fraction of non diabetic patients present with stroke .
(Subrahmanya preethamm (talk) 16:35, 4 June 2018 (UTC))

The one source you've linked to (PMC5011894) doesn't support the claims you're making about relative risk of stroke.  Did you mean to link to a different paper?  (Indeed, it explicitly describes cardio-cerebrovascular complications as chronic complications of diabetes, though the paper does not attempt to compare rates of complications between diabetic and non-diabetic patients.)
Look, to examine relative risk of stroke, ideally you want to look at two groups of patients that are as similar as possible to each other, except for the diagnosis of diabetes.  Follow those patients for an extended period of time, and look at the incidence of stroke (and other complications) over time in the diabetic versus non-diabetic populations.  In other words, you want to do a study like [https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/412383 this one] ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17502533 PubMed link])—which reported &quot;the incidence of stroke was 62% higher (P = .003)&quot; among patients with diabetes. TenOfAllTrades(talk) 18:41, 4 June 2018 (UTC)
Don't look at the fraction of diabetic patients presenting with stroke versus the fraction of non-diabetic patients presenting with stroke.  Look at the fraction of stroke patients that have diabetes (or not), versus the fraction of non-stroke people that have diabetes (or not).  WhatamIdoing (talk) 19:02, 4 June 2018 (UTC)

The following third source is most reliable and especially it was published in March ,2018 . This source confirms that Stroke occupies in top ten positions of Non-diabetic people . But stroke Not occupies in top 10  positions of diabetic people.Diabetic people frequently admits in hospitals for specific complications Hyperglycemia ,infections ,eye compilations .

I was submitted primary and secondary sources. all sources clearly tells stroke occurs in very limited percentage to diabetic people.(1 to 2.4%)

(Subrahmanya preethamm (talk) 20:04, 4 June 2018 (UTC))

I don't know if this is a language barrier or a competence issue, but those sources don't say what you think they say. The figures are for the proportion of hospitalizations for stroke, not the proportion of the population who suffer strokes. By definition, someone in poor health is going to make more hospital visits than someone in peak condition, and consequently even though diabetics have an increased incidence of stroke they have an even more increased incidence of other diabetic complications, and as a consequence the proportion of hospital visits for stroke is lower. What you've done is akin to proving that shooting yourself reduces your risk of cancer, on the grounds that your next hospital visit is increasingly likely to be for traumatic injury. ‑ Iridescent 22:26, 4 June 2018 (UTC)

This source confirms that Stroke occupies in top ten positions of Non-diabetic people ,but stroke Not occupies in top 10  positions of diabetic people
.Diabetic people frequently admits in hospitals for specific complications Hyperglycemia ,infections ,eye compilations . Prevalence and incidence have close relationship .prevalence is directly  proportionately to incidence. If the factory produces more computers in specific time(Prevalence) , the availability of computers in computer shop automatically increases in that specific time (Incidence). In our situation if stoke happens more in society in particular period, automatically incidence increases in hospital stays on a particular period. Stroke means obstruction blood flow to particular are in brain .More glucose may be prevented this obstruction in diabetics ?.Further research requires in this particular point.

OK, enough. I'm sorry to be so blunt, but Subrahmanya preethamm, you are demonstrating such severe competence issues that this is a formal warning that if you either attempt to add your original research to Wikipedia articles, or continue disrupting Wikipedia talk pages, you are likely to be blocked for disruption. None of the sources you're citing say what you think they say; as TenOfAllTrades has explained in detail above, the issue is that you're misunderstanding what the figures you're citing represent. Wikipedia is not a source of original thought and only repeats what other reliable sources say, and we are not going to change our articles to go against a unanimous medical consensus on the basis of your misinterpretation of a data set. (If you'd actually taken the trouble to read the paper you link above, you'll see that it unequivocally states ; the &quot;no increased risk&quot; line you're misunderstanding relates specifically to there being no increased stroke risk as a complication following carotid endarterectomy in diabetics and non-diabetics.) ‑ Iridescent 18:11, 5 June 2018 (UTC)

&quot;Aids&quot; is &quot;British&quot;, not &quot;wrong&quot;.  In the model used by most British sources, pronounceable initialisms are spelled with title case.  That means that the AcquiredAutoImmune Deficiency Syndrome is &quot;Aids&quot;.

Please look at the irresponsible (it seems to me) pro-CAM slant at .  When I search &quot;alternative medicine,&quot; this comes up first, right before the Wikipedia article.  If anyone knows RS that criticize WebMD for its coverage of CAM, perhaps that should be mentioned on WebMD#Criticism and in the lede.  Nothing in the WebMD article, not even the one criticism mentioned, conveys to the reader that WebMD might not accurately reflect medical consensus.  Thanks.NightHeron (talk) 19:38, 2 June 2018 (UTC)

The first page mostly talks about acupuncture and chiropractic, and says that they work for some things (more things than I'd agree with, but not really an uncommon POV).  The second page talks mostly about herbal drugs and energy therapy, and says that they either don't work or that they could be dangerous (e.g., lead contamination).  I don't think that's unusually slanted.  I doubt that you'd find much criticism except from anti-CAM sources, especially the kind of websites that say things that amount to &quot;It doesn't matter if the patients get better, because the story they tell about the mechanism is utter nonsense&quot;.  That story is just as disconnected from the patients' notion of &quot;working&quot; as the century-old line, &quot;The surgery was a success, but the patient died&quot;.

Well, it says about Magnetic Field Therapy: &quot;It’s also been found to help fractures heal faster.&quot;  Presumably some of what they're reporting is the placebo effect.  I just thought that some of the people here might want to look at it.  I'd mentioned it before, in the context of wanting the alt med article here to reflect scientific consensus so that readers won't reject it as polemical and go to WebMD instead.  I lost that battle, but at least it would be nice if there were something in the WebMD article that criticizes the site for being unreliable about CAM (if there's RS that makes that criticism).  I have no problem with the article on WebMD being largely positive, if that reflects medical consensus, but there's already a template in WebMD#Criticism (from 2013!) saying that section needs expansion.NightHeron (talk) 00:51, 3 June 2018 (UTC)
I think that the efficacy might depend on whether you think &quot;magnetic field therapy&quot; means wearing a bracelet with a little magnet attached to it, or something more like Transcranial magnetic stimulation.    
Also, see  for a 2011 Cochrane review on the subject of healing fractures (spoiler: electromagnetic therapy might actually be helpful).  Bone growth stimulator redirects to Electrotherapy; given the number of reviews on the subject, it should probably be its own article (and what's currently there definitely shouldn't be referencing reviews that are older than the Cochrane paper).

Chemical imbalance redirect

So I came upon an article using the internally linked Chemical imbalance and noticed that it is a redirect. I started to make some changes, but I'm not sure about which way to go with this? There are a lot of uses of the term on the project where it could be changed and I do not know of a good way to do that except one at a time. I guess I am thinking it could be a good idea to just red link Chemical imbalance? But I usually don't do edits that will affect a large number of articles so I'm looking for comments please. TeeVeeed (talk) 16:57, 4 June 2018 (UTC)
 From the current what links here page, they seem to all be using the term in the context of the monoamine hypothesis in depression, and thus the redirect is appropriate. Natureium (talk) 18:45, 4 June 2018 (UTC)
The term &quot;chemical imbalance&quot; was initially used for depression mostly but is now used for all mental disorders.
Could be redirected here Causes_of_mental_disorders#Chemical_imbalances aswell. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 19:40, 4 June 2018 (UTC)
That is much better!  The content that was at Chemical imbalance was really horrible ax-grinding stuff.  We still have a SYNC issue on this stuff at the pages on the various conditions that needs to be addressed, and that stuff needs to be summarized there.  But that is a much better and more general target for the redirect. I appreciate TeeVeed raising this. Jytdog (talk) 21:19, 4 June 2018 (UTC)

Healthism

? Jytdog (talk) 03:30, 4 June 2018 (UTC)
It  a genuine term of art on the tinfoil hat fringes of both right and left, and among the school of sociology led by Nikolas Rose, used to describe the belief that governments and politicians are using public health campaigns—and in countries with a state health service, &quot;these disease-ridden people are costing you money&quot; messages*—as a smokescreen for imposing their preferred moral codes. The article as it stands reads like someone's term paper, but it likely is a legitimate and notable enough concept for a stand-alone article; sociology has so much specialist jargon that articles on the topic always look faintly ridiculous to outsiders. I do not propose to be the one to write it. ‑ Iridescent 04:49, 4 June 2018 (UTC) *If you don't believe &quot;these disease-ridden people are costing you money&quot; campaigns are a real thing in mainstream politics, do a google search on .

Was trying to post neutrally :)   Somebody was trying to putting a lot of WEIGHT on a reference in Vaginal steaming, , in which &quot;healthism&quot; means this: &quot;The ideology dubbed ‘healthism’ situates the pursuit of not just of health, but health optimisation, as a moral obligation and vital to contemporary (neoliberal) selfhood. The subject seeks out, assesses and participates in, self-improvement strategies; without work, the body/self is incomplete, but the task is endless.&quot; This is kind of different from the &quot;government coercion&quot; angle and maybe more about corporate marketing messages and some weird shit that has crept into our culture (especially for women perhaps).  This sense seems useful as a way to talk about the whole &quot;pursuit of wellness thing&quot; - not just that but the next step of intensity to the optimized self&quot;/Quantified self thing ....

WP:MED articles with templates

I was looking for a list of WP:MED articles with improvement templates and I'm running into problems. I tried to use [https://petscan.wmflabs.org/ PetScan] with the categories  and , and it gives me 0 articles, which I'm assuming is because the WP:MED category is on talk pages and maintenance categories are on article pages. When I used  instead, I got some of the appropriate articles, but also a whole bunch of irrelevant articles (analog television, cotton, guitar, squall...). Is there a better way to do this?

Health IT

Do you all feel that health IT pages are within our project?  I came across Crisis Text Line for example.  Likewise Electronic health record.   

This is becoming such a thing, and I don't think we have anywhere to put them, really.  I wonder if we should have a task force, at least to classify them...

Thoughts? Jytdog (talk) 02:46, 7 June 2018 (UTC)

 It's a good question. EHR is a central part of, e.g., personalized medicine, hospital informatics, and patient privacy, which seems medical, or at least medical practices to me. On the other hand, traditional MEDRS sources typically don't have much to say on IT issues. --Mark viking (talk) 02:54, 7 June 2018 (UTC)
I reckon MEDRS becomes relevant where claims are made regarding safety, at the least. For example, some medical devices (syringe pumps spring to mind) have been shown to be insecure, or completely without security (in software). If an article crops up which claims patients are dying as a result, that's going to need a pretty good source. Likewise, say, &quot;patient morbidity/mortality is compromised by long data entry time for hospital EMR&quot;. That kind of thing seems to fall under the umbrella of both med and computing projects. But you don't want to be shepherding every EMR corporation article, either. Basie (talk) 07:05, 7 June 2018 (UTC)

These topics definitely fall within the purview of the project, but since their content is mainly not , MEDRS does not apply to most of the information in them. I think these points really apply to the health care industry in general, not just health IT. Looie496 (talk) 12:27, 7 June 2018 (UTC)

 Crisis Text Line, no. I'm not sure about EHR. If it's more healthcare related than anything else, I would assume so, but maybe WP:HOSPITAL would be more appropriate? This is the distinction between medicine and healthcare. How much do we want to go into healthcare topics that aren't related to medical science? Natureium (talk) 14:53, 7 June 2018 (UTC)

Missing article or section: Prosthetic testicle

There's a lot of material out there on the human version, as well as the strange and semi-recent market for veterinary ones (predicated mostly on a projective and anthropomorphizing folk belief, especially among dog fanciers, that castrated male pets or livestock may suffer psychological trauma, though it sometimes has to do with maintaining the appearance of show animals).

Zeltiq Aesthetics

Sometimes, when I'm feeling lazy and unmotivated, I try patrolling a supposedly easy task like . Today I encountered Zeltiq Aesthetics which raised some questions I'm sure I don't know the answer to. The company is or was a medical device maker. In the references about the company, there are a variety of popular press squibs about the company's products and services that appear to offer health advice and at least verge on making health claims. How would MEDRS apply to this sort of situation? Do these low-quality sources slip under the radar because they are in an article about the company?   04:15, 8 June 2018 (UTC)
What a useful thing to do when you feel unmotivated, I mostly watch youtube... The answer to your question is: No — we try to police this.

That's interesting - they always had a reputation as the highest quality wiki, and tended to rather look down on en:wp. I've had my doubts for some time about that.

RFC on marketing claims

There is an RfC at  on the question:

&quot;Should articles that describe marketing claims also describe their accuracy, using  or  as appropriate?&quot;

HLHJ (talk) 14:20, 3 June 2018 (UTC)
Should the accuracy of marketing claims be described? What would be an example? Doc James (talk ·  · ) 21:51, 3 June 2018 (UTC)

 For example, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marketing_of_electronic_cigarettes&amp;oldid=844231826 until recently], the article stated: 
talkquote|text=
Some often implicit marketing claims and scientific facts expressed by the vaping industry made online.[2][not in citation given]

E-cigarettes are harmless, or even beneficial, to the user, compared with not smoking.[6][7]

E-cigarettes are harmless to others breathing the same air.[2][relevant? – discuss]

E-cigarettes help smokers quit.[8][relevant? – discuss]

E-cigarettes are marketed to non-smokers.[citation needed] [1] [9]


These were originally listed as marketing claims, and juxtaposed with MEDRS-supported statements about their accuracy. An IP dubbed them &quot;scientific facts&quot; and removed most of the content about their accuracy.  argues that the claims should be listed, but information about their accuracy is off-topic. In the current article, the medical claims made for e-cigarettes are not listed. Medical claims are among the most common marketing claims made for e-cigarettes; see [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4018182/ Grana 2014] for an overview.
Sorry I didn't give enough context in the first place. Blindspot. Copy/modded this from my own text on the article talk page RFC discussion.  HLHJ (talk) 02:25, 4 June 2018 (UTC)
An example of discussing the claims and their accuracy would be Nicotine marketing, which needs some work, for balance and MEDRS. HLHJ (talk) 02:37, 4 June 2018 (UTC)
They of course are not scientific facts but yes marketing claims. They should be juxtaposed with the scientific position IMO. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 04:47, 4 June 2018 (UTC)
I'm not sure what the question is. The devil is in the wording - several of these are close to what seems to be the medical evidence, if phrased more carefully. For example there is strong public health statistical evidence that &quot;E-cigarettes help smokers quit&quot;, but inconclusive RCT evidence, even though the question is a good one for an RCT to test. But that costs money, and no good RCT on the matter has yet reported (the main one that has reported used Italian mental health patients who had not expressed a desire to quit smoking).  Most of the reverses of these claims are not in accord with the scientific evidence either, eg &quot;E-cigarettes do not help smokers quit&quot;.  Whether &quot;E-cigarettes are marketed to non-smokers&quot; is not a matter for a medical/scientific &quot;position&quot;.  Johnbod (talk) 15:16, 4 June 2018 (UTC)
I agree that wording the statements well is critical. The (RfC, not medical) question is whether the article should try to discuss the truth of any marketing claims at all, in any wording. Should it say something like &quot;Claims X, Y, and Z are made&quot; or &quot;Claims X, Y, and Z are made; X is true, Y is debatable, and Z is untrue&quot;? More detailed reply, with examples, .

Nervous tone

The concept of &quot;tone&quot; in neurology does not seem to have an article, though the term comes up in a few places such as Vagal tone. Anyone interested in writing it up? The best short description I could find online was: &quot;Most organs have some basal level of stimulation called parasympathetic tone, or sympathetic tone, that establish basal levels of function that can be changed either by increasing or decreasing the tonic frequency of firing of efferent fibers. Thus, removal of parasympathetic output to the heart removes part of its brake on heart rate, and the heart rate increases. The same response would occur if sympathetic output to the heart were increased.&quot; -- Joseph Feher, in Quantitative Human Physiology, 2012 [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123821638000438]

Readability

I posted a question at WT:MEDMOS about  a little while ago.  The question is whether MEDMOS should discourage writing styles that are intended for one, both or neither extreme on the readability scale, namely writing for typical children (i.e., at or under age 12) and/or writing for graduate students (e.g., medical school students).  There have been some interesting and insightful comments so far – including links to two free web-based tools for scoring readability – but perhaps others would like to share an opinion as well, or just have a look to see some of the good advice and examples we've considered so far.   Please add your advice .  WhatamIdoing (talk) 14:53, 14 June 2018 (UTC)

 As far as I can tell, this is a patch that's responding to glucose levels by delivering normal insulin? It doesn't seem to be a drug, but a device. Natureium (talk) 16:07, 15 June 2018 (UTC)
Well, it's more likely to get regulated as a drug than as a device (same with fentanyl patches), but it should get a more specific title.  Natureium, I'm also curious why you've blanked a sentence saying that a product named MK-2640-001 (=named with Merck's code system) isn't being developed by Merck.  Did you really think that's unlikely?  A quick trip to my favorite web search engine immediately confirmed this.  I think you should self-revert.  
James, I believe that in the draftspace, it's considered inappropriate to blank plausible unsourced content.  Blanking accurate content in a draft is really not helpful.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:23, 15 June 2018 (UTC)
This is not plausible &quot;A constant amount would be injected every so often and it would adapt to the user's blood sugar levels.&quot; The doses would not be as boluses but as a gradual infusion similar to an insulin pump. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 19:15, 15 June 2018 (UTC)

 I think that if I'm reading the article right and the subject is a patch that delivers insulin rather than a novel type of insulin, I'm skeptical that all 4 companies are working on this singular product. I'm even more confused after I went to the sensulin website because they seem to be talking about an encapsulated form of insulin, which isn't what the article is about, unless sensulin is developing more than 1 product and I just couldn't find it. I'm certain that Merck had at least some role in the development on MK-2640-001, as that's their prefix, but as far as I can tell from clinicaltrials.gov, that drug is another thing entirely. Essentially, I can't figure out what this article is actually about, because it seems to be about multiple things. Natureium (talk) 16:44, 15 June 2018 (UTC)
I suppose it depends on whether you read &quot;researching&quot; as meaning &quot;cooperatively researching the exact same product&quot; or &quot;researching separate competing products&quot;.  I certainly read it as four companies investing research money in a general area, rather than having formed a partnership. 
The claim that it's a transdermal patch was [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Draft:Glucose-responsive_insulin&amp;diff=845946335&amp;oldid=845946163&amp;diffmode=source added by Doc James].  It appears that's false and should be removed.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 19:55, 15 June 2018 (UTC)

NPOV/N discussion

A discussion is underway at  that may be of interest to participants in this WikiProject. RivertorchWATER 02:43, 20 June 2018 (UTC)

I think that this discussion now exceeds 15,000 words.  I think that the main points of contention are:
* whether the article should begin with the words &quot;A trans woman is a woman...&quot; (rather than options such as &quot;A trans woman is a person...&quot;), and
* whether the process that leads up to the words &quot;it's a boy!&quot; being spoken before or shortly after birth should be described as &quot;assigning male sex&quot;.  (I think the contrary POV is that the adults are usually 'objectively observing' a common anatomical pattern rather than 'assigning' anything, although it hasn't been put in those terms.)

Neglected article in need of attention: In absentia health care


I just discovered this article today, which is poorly integrated into the Wikipedia project (and was even less so before I edited it) and seems to be largely ignored. It was still primarily using a deprecated and unwieldy -and- system (alongside a ; now ), a system that was ; it lacked any WikiProject templates (now ); it is ; it had only  before I showed up; it had a grand total of [https://xtools.wmflabs.org/articleinfo/en.wikipedia.org/In%20absentia%20health%20care 43 edits from 27 editors] before me; and it was apparently  from &quot;Healthcare delivery&quot; in  by a user account that has not edited since .

I may work on it later, though my focus is currently on other articles with  larger viewership. Regardless, I am alerting everyone here in case anyone wants to clean it up, since an article this neglected, obscure, and poorly integrated is bound to be rife with problems. Thanks. —Nøkkenbuer (talk • ) 02:28, 23 June 2018 (UTC)

At a glance, it sounds like editors should consider merging this to Telemedicine.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 20:55, 23 June 2018 (UTC)
That is what I noticed, too; it seems that this article is the lesser-known relative to eHealth, Telehealth, Telemedicine, Telecare, and the rest of the telemedical articles. What distinguishes this article from the rest is that it seems to place greater emphasis on the history of so-called  health care, especially premodern history. The other articles are, unsurprisingly, primarily about such health care within the context of electronic telecommunications.Moreover, this article seems to serve as a sort of hypernym for all these articles, just as eHealth can be a hypernym for mHealth. If any mergers occur, and it does not involve merging this article out of existence, it may actually be worthwhile to use In absentia health care as the central article that  the rest, just as Telemedicine does now with the telemedical articles. Something as simple as summarizing the latter article in the former can accomplish that, at least for the telemedical articles.It does not matter to me what happens to this article, though. Just so long as it is better integrated into the project, that alone is an improvement. —Nøkkenbuer (talk • ) 06:19, 24 June 2018 (UTC)
