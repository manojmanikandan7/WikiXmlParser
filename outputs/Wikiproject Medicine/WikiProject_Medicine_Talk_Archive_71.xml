 Antral Lavage 

Hi. Need some expert advice on an article over at AfC: raft:Antral Lavage. It appears to be notable, but I have no expertise in this field.  Please advise. ser:onel5969|Onel5969 ser talk:Onel5969|TT me 18:28, 18 August 2015 (UTC)

I know what MEDRS says, but do you know what it means?  You haven't actually told us if the information the sources are used to support is correct or not, or if it has been superseded by more recent (but equally robust) sources.

Ozzie, I don't think that either &quot;a PubMed search&quot; or &quot;Look at MEDRS&quot; has any hope of explaining how you concluded that a 10-year-old textbook is likely to be an unreliable for a basic definition of what a rather old procedure is.  Do you suspect that the definition changed in the last ten years?  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 01:45, 19 August 2015 (UTC)
it says dated (old) not unreliable.... Ensure that the book is up to date, unless a historical perspective is requiredikipedia:Identifying reliable sources (medicine)#Books--ser:Ozzie10aaaa|Ozzie10aaaa (ser talk:Ozzie10aaaa|talk) 09:40, 19 August 2015 (UTC)
I would say that your use of &quot;dated&quot; and your use of &quot;fine&quot; to describe the given sources are...problematic in different ways, and it doesn't do to try to gloss over either.
When you declared the publications to be fine, what did that evaluation entail?  I strongly suspect ‚Äì and please correct me if I am mistaken ‚Äì that it involved looking up each citation in PubMed and confirming that the &quot;Review&quot; flag appeared next to its entry.  (Maybe you also checked that the journal was MEDLINE indexed, and not just in PubMed.)  The problem is that that minimal check doesn't establish that a citation is &quot;fine&quot; for use.  It doesn't test whether or not the review is in an appropriately-scoped journal, and written by authors who are recognized experts (or even competent) in the field.  It doesn't test whether or not a primary source might well be relevant or appropriate (perhaps a seminal publication of likely interest to our readers, accompanied by a suitable review). It doesn't test whether or not the statements in our article are based on cherry-picking from or slanting or selectively reading the cited work.  It doesn't even test whether or not the statements in our article are mentioned or supported at all by the cited work.  All it does is confirm that the citation is to a publication that exists and has a &quot;review&quot; tag.  That's far from sufficient to declare that a citation is fine.
The use of dated, meanwhile, suggests that something is old-fashioned or past its prime.  Again, a naive reporting of the date of publication is woefully insufficient to make such a declaration.  It's entirely useless to declare that articles from 2010 are uniformly &quot;fine&quot; and not &quot;dated&quot; (at least, for another 4.5 months) while articles from 2009 are all &quot;dated&quot;.  Some papers are dated ‚Äì that is, superseded by newer, better-quality results and publications ‚Äì from before the moment they appear in print.  Others maintain relevance for years or decades.  A declaration that a citation is &quot;dated&quot; should be based on a two-part test.  The first and least important test is the date of publication; the second and most important (and arguably the only) test is whether or not a more-recent review exists which contains either new information (rendering the previous citation's contents at least partially obsolete) or a better and more-comprehensive presentation of established knowledge (making it a more useful resource for our readers).  The first, unimportant test is something that could be done by a very small script; the second test is the useful one for determining whether or not a source is dated‚Äîand is the test that I strongly suspect you aren't doing.
The point of MEDRS is to provide guidelines that can help knowledgeable editors identify the best sources to support content in our articles (and to determine whether or not content in our articles really is supported by ‚Äì and representative of ‚Äì good-quality sources).  It's not to provide a short, mechanical, binary checklist that lets you crank out a yes/no, reliable/unreliable determination by blindly applying an imagined algorithm. ser:TenOfAllTrades|TenOfAllTrades(ser_talk:TenOfAllTrades|talk) 14:22, 19 August 2015 (UTC)

It's not clear to me what you're objecting to‚Äîmy best estimate of what criteria you were employing, or why your description of your &quot;results&quot; is problematic, or my understanding of the purpose and application of MEDRS, or something else, or all of the above.  It's also not clear to me why Doc James would be able to tell me what you are thinking.  I presume he's not your caretaker or keeper, nor that he filters your edits for you.  Finally, your prior answer is decidedly uninformative; &quot;Ensur[ing] that the book is up to date&quot; entails, as I noted, far more than simply checking the publication date on the cover.  ser:TenOfAllTrades|TenOfAllTrades(ser_talk:TenOfAllTrades|talk) 17:56, 19 August 2015 (UTC)

No, unfortunately the sources (especially the one from 1990) are not fine ‚Äì they are too old see:P:MEDRS|Wikipedia:Reliable sources in medicine. Also the article does not adhere to the P:MEDMoS|Wikipedia ‚Äì Medical manual of style. I think you were pointed to some better source on the talk page.

We probably need to cover this, and of note is also that ypoactive sexual desire disorder is no longer the appropriate name according to DSM-V ‚Äì but it should rather be &quot;sexual interest/arousal disorder&quot;.

I am sensitive to pseudoscience and there is something wrong with this drug. The pharma company that made it organized what appears to be a fake grassroots campaign to influence the FDA approval process. The odd part here is that [http://eventhescore.org/about-us/ these organizations] are endorsing the drug. See alk:Flibanserin#Even_the_Score_members.
Normally I would not want to talk about advocacy here but it seems like Flibanserin is marketed with a non-evidence based campaign mostly branded as a women's rights issue and mostly not raising the results of the available clinical trials. Experts have said this much. This might be of interest to Wikipedia because of recent talk about paid editing to influence medical policy.
Almost certainly, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Flibanserin&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=368480378&amp;oldid=367583898 this is a paid editor] tasked with raising the profile of this drug in public opinion.

I don't think it's quite that simple. The drug has legitimate effects and the debate surrounded if these were strong enough that it outweighs the risks. There is a grassroots movement, but it is possible outside funding makes it seem bigger than it is. As always I think we should stick to the evidence (quiet a lot available) and display the FDAs position clearly and without promotion. How do we know this is a paid editor? I suggest we start by filing an AN/I report. -- ser:CFCF|CFCF ser talk:CFCF|üçå (pecial:EmailUser/CFCF|email) 22:03, 19 August 2015 (UTC)

 Citations in lead - new tools - propose again 
I just described the new translation tool in a post above.

This tool has not been tested much, but I think it would be fun for non-Wikipedians who speak two languages to use this tool to do translations for their first edits. It avoids the technical problems of Wikipedia editing and moves citations neatly from the language that uses them to the new text which needs them.

In response to this tool I would like to re-raise the issue of WikiProject Medicine recommending citations for all sentences in the lead. This issue has come up repeatedly. There has been resistance to the idea, especially from people who say they clutter the lead and are redundant. In my opinion, endorsing this new tool gives new support to the idea of requiring that all statements everywhere need citations.

More background is that Wikipedia currently does not consistently recommend citations in the lead. This is left to editorial judgment. P:LEADCITE See previous discussion.

*There was some discussion in which people from outside this project complained that WikiProject Medicine was encroaching on the rest of Wikipedia by using citations in the lead when that is not a site-wide policy - who knows where this is?
*A lot of previous discussion has been around the P:TTF|Translation Task Force, which prioritizes the translation of article leads and has established that having citations there is necessary for quality.

Medical articles have a particular need to be high quality and be translated into every language. Because of the translation tool, and because of other trends in wiki-development, I think it is a good time to insist on citations for every sentence in the lead of every article overseen by WikiProject Medicine. After some time, I think it would be good to advocate that all leads need citations following the example of medicine. Thoughts from others? ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 14:11, 11 August 2015 (UTC)
* obviously, this is a very good idea, insist on citations for every sentence in the lead of every article overseen by WikiProject Medicine...IMO--ser:Ozzie10aaaa|Ozzie10aaaa (ser talk:Ozzie10aaaa|talk) 14:20, 11 August 2015 (UTC)
* Clearly this is overkill. The jist of the previous discussions was that citations after every sentence should be allowed and including citations in the lead is not prohibited.  This has now been morphed into the proposition that every sentence in the lead requires a citation. Apart from definitions, information should not appear in the lead if it is not covered in more depth in the remainder of the article.  Since medical claims in the remainder of the article should be supported by reliable sources, citations in the lead become redundant.  At the same time, if in doubt, it is better to include citations in the lead than not.  Furthermore if there are a few critical citations, it might be appropriate to include these in the lead.  Finally as pointed out in the previous discussions, over overzealous editors may tag statements in the lead without reading the rest of the article. Hence including references in the lead may be preemptive.  If these are duplicate citations, it might be appropriate to comment out the citation in the lead so that they are not displayed in the rendered version but still visible in the raw wiki text. In short, use common sense. ser:Boghog|Boghog (ser talk:Boghog|talk) 20:39, 11 August 2015 (UTC)
* I frankly don't think that we can do this.  WikiProjects simply cannot declare that articles that they want to work on are exempt from community-wide rules like the one that says, &quot;The presence of citations in the introduction is neither required in every article nor prohibited in any article&quot;.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 20:58, 11 August 2015 (UTC)

Yes, such a local consensus would not override the established consensus of the wider community. ser:Matthew Ferguson 57|Matthew Ferguson (ser talk:Matthew Ferguson 57|talk) 22:32, 11 August 2015 (UTC)
I am happy as long as people do not remove the citations I add to the lead. I think the best we can do is go around and make sure the leads of articles we deem medical are appropriately references. I agree we cannot force others to add references and do not think we should remove content from the lead that is referenced in the body of the text. We should just move the ref to the lead. ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk ¬∑ pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs ¬∑ pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 06:35, 12 August 2015 (UTC)
|Boghog - This might be excessive for English Wikipedia considered alone, but having citations in the lead right now since the software change greatly increases the possibility of quickly doing translations into other languages. These translations are almost impracticable if citations are not in the lead. The new issue is deciding the extent to which this other need matters.
|WhatamIdoing |Matthew Ferguson 57 I would never suggest fast unilateral policy change, but the policies are there for editing as needed. None of the policies have existed for more than a few years and Wikipedia might be around for a long time, so there is time to think. Lots of WikiProjects have their own policies. WP:MILHIST, for example, makes lots of pages like ewis Locke in which biographies are written based on primary data from government databases, which is disallowed in I think every other context. If there were change for medical articles, this is how it would happen: some people test the change in a small set of articles, years pass, more people adopt the trend, then it is proposed to the broader community. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 13:54, 12 August 2015 (UTC)
Primary data from government databases is only prohibited for living people.  It has nothing to do with MILHIST as a group, and everything to do with the fact that your example is about a man who died 95 years ago. 
What's possible:  Editors can make an optional choice in favor of including leads for articles that they're creating or improving.  What's not possible:  The group &quot;insisting&quot; (your word) that it happen.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 22:24, 12 August 2015 (UTC)

Other unilateral proposal
|WhatamIdoing |Matthew Ferguson 57 Both of you objected to WP:MED overruling site wide consensus. Elsewhere on Wikipedia, if content is P:Verifiable, it can remain without a citation, correct? But because WP:MED says that all health information needs to be verified, then policy is that health information without a reference is automatically inappropriate if it is added without a source, right? There is never a good time to add l|Citation needed to any health information, right? Health information that needs a citation should be deleted, right?

I am not going anywhere with this, and this does not relate to citations in the lead. I was just thinking more about whether WP:MED makes rules which are contrary to general Wikipedia rules. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 18:29, 18 August 2015 (UTC)
Don't really object, just this is the reality of the situation. ser:Matthew Ferguson 57|Matthew Ferguson (ser talk:Matthew Ferguson 57|talk) 20:18, 18 August 2015 (UTC)
WP:MED has no standing to declare that &quot;all health information needs to be verified&quot; (and in fact WP:MED says no such thing).  The community's policy is that all material needs to be verifiable, and that only a P:MINREF|relatively small proportion must be provided with a citation.  &quot;Health information&quot; is not included in that short list.  The policies are the policies; the preferences or opinions of a few editors are not policies.  Editors at a WikiProject cannot declare that material in &quot;their&quot; articles is a special exception that requires material to be verified instead.  
And in case anyone's tempted to say &quot;I hereby P:CHALLENGE all uncited health information from here to infinity&quot;, then you should consider both P:POINT and the fact that MEDRS applies only biomedical information, which is a much smaller set of information than &quot;health&quot; information.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 01:41, 19 August 2015 (UTC)
|WhatamIdoing Excuse me - I misspoke, but yes you understand exactly what I asking. Could you give an opinion? Does WikiProject Medicine &quot;challenge all uncited (biomedical, human medical) information from here to infinity&quot;? I thought this is what we do here, and I know it is against site-wide policy, but I thought everyone here supported this, and even site-wide people support this even only for medicine though it is against policy.
I am not trying to force any changes to policy, or oppose the policies, or advocate for doing things contrary to the policies. But if we really all say that human biomedical information needs to be verified, then maybe we could agree to that here, and then bring that discussion to a site wide RfC to see what others think. It seems me to me that this might be an idea which everyone supports. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 13:53, 20 August 2015 (UTC)
WPMED does not challenge all uncited biomedical material.  WPMED works together to improve medicine-related articles.  Sometimes that work involves challenging information (cited or uncited); sometimes that involves providing better sources; sometimes that involves creating content.  We do not agree that all human health information needs to be verified; at minimum, some of it is in the sky-is-blue territory and doesn't require a citation anyway (&quot;Influenza is caused by a virus&quot;:  did anybody here not know that by the age of 12 or so?).  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:03, 20 August 2015 (UTC)

However, we only have a single paper using the neologism &quot;oleogustus&quot;. So I think either incorporate leogustus into aste#Fattiness or, better to my mind, create an article called attiness based on the material at leogustus and at aste#Fattiness (and make leogustus re-direct to attiness, at least until such time as &quot;oleogustus&quot; attracts wider usage). ser:Bondegezou|Bondegezou (ser talk:Bondegezou|talk) 15:16, 24 August 2015 (UTC)

 Explanation of arbitrary access, Wikidata, templates on Wikipedia 

Some people explained Wikidata's upcoming updates to me. I wanted to share here, for anyone else who wanted to know. It is likely that Wikipedia will begin big changes in September.

I have had trouble understanding how Wikidata is relevant. An expectation that I had was that information in Wikidata could update Wikipedia articles, like for noncontroversial information like updates on a country's population or GDP. It remains difficult to make connections between Wikipedia and Wikidata.

There are two kinds of data in Wikidata - items and properties. An example of an item is the subject of any Wikipedia article; all articles are items. A property is a single characteristic of an item. So if Seattle is an item, its population and a range of other traits about it are properties in Wikidata.

Until now, there was no way to bring information about properties from Wikidata into Wikipedia without asking for that property relating to a specific item. So if there were a city infobox, one could not say &quot;put the population here&quot; and expect that all infoboxes would do this for every city where the population was known in Wikidata. Instead, for every city, one had to ask &quot;tell me the population for this specific city&quot;.

Wikidata has a concept called d:Wikidata:Arbitrary access. There is hardly an explanation on that page, but it means the ability to get property information for an arbitrary item. As of those month, arbitrary access is available for most language Wikipedias. It was coming to English Wikipedia last week, but was delayed, and today it was posted that [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T100788 it would be coming in early September].

This is relevant for WikiProject Medicine because the field of medicine has a lot of databases and a lot of good information. The infoboxes on Wikipedia are already fantastic. Connecting them with Wikidata has the potential to make them much better. Also, this means that information in English Wikipedia by way of Wikidata can also propagate to other languages - all of the other languages. Starting with numbers is easy, like saying &quot;molecular mass = 337.346 g/mol&quot;, or &quot;CAS Registry number = 165800-03-3&quot;. A next step will be translating single words, like for a drug &quot;excretion = Nonrenal, renal, and fecal&quot; or &quot;pregnancy category = contraindicated&quot;. Even without translation, this system is likely to lead to high or perfect matching between English Wikipedia and what the best available medical databases say, at least to the extent that the Wikipedia community agrees to publish those databases somehow in Wikipedia.

Wikidata will impact infobox first and most prominently, because those are the places where data fields already appear.

People in WikiProject Medicine may wish to think about this now, for the sake of upcoming attention which will come to Wikipedia's medical content. Sorry - I have nothing to provide for anyone to read. This seems really big to me, but there is little documentation of arbitrary access or its potential to change Wikipedia in big ways. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 19:42, 25 August 2015 (UTC)

The mechanism sounds great, but the issue over ICD10 vs. ICD11 illustrates the problem: which ontologies (structures of knowledge) should we use? Standards, as has been said, are like toothbrushes: everyone thinks they're good, but no-one wants to use somebody else's. We have a multiplicity of standardised ontologies, each optimised for a different context, each necessarily making compromises in its description of reality. nnemarie Mol talks of the &quot;multiple ontologies&quot; of the body, the way that different parts of the healthcare system use different ontologies for their own purposes.

What you explained isn't really accurate. It is already possible to connect infoboxes to Wikidata, and some fields on l|Infobox medical condition already use this. The way to get data from Wikidata to Wikipedia isn't well documented (at least not that I've checked recently), but this has nothing to do with the upcoming change. Currently, you can only access Wikidata property data on the Wikipedia item that matches. So currently, for example, on iabetes mellitus, you can only access the properties of d:Q12206. By placing an infobox on an article, the infobox is able to access the property data of the item it is placed on. What you can't do is get properties from a different item on a page. So if I want to put properties of iabetology (d:Q1207969) or ndocrinology (d:Q162606) on iabetes mellitus (d:Q12206), that is currently not possible. Unfortunately, because of this limitation, it is hard to even give examples of the problem.

What d:Wikidata:Arbitrary access will do is allow someone to specify what item they want to access a property of. So on any Wikipedia article, one could specify any item for which to obtain an property. Currently, there is no way to specify what item to get the Wikidata from. It is assumed (and forced) that you want, and you will get, the property data from the current item (page) that you are on. The way to get property data is property:P36. What Arbitrary data does is allow one to specify a different item by adding a new parameter: property:P36|from=Q183.

There is no reason not to start using more Wikidata on the infoboxes now. I created a mostly [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Infobox_medical_condition/sandbox&amp;oldid=633187870 Wikidata-based] l|Infobox medical condition a while back, but it is a complicated thing to do. Trying to maintain backwards compatibility and allow overriding with values specified directly on the Wikipedia articles and not in Wikidata makes this difficult. A lot of articles contain ranges of information in the infoboxes in non-standardized formatting. It would be relatively easy to simply ignore all of the parameters specified when the infobox is placed on articles, and only use Wikidata. I think a goal should be to eliminate all of this redundant data from the individual Wikipedias and only use Wikidata, but I dont know if people are willing to do this all in one step. Something to consider. Hope this helps. --ser:Scottalter|Scott Alter (ser talk:Scottalter|talk) 16:10, 26 August 2015 (UTC)

As I already explained on Matthew Ferguson 57's ser talk:Matthew Ferguson 57#Stomatitis hatnote|talk page, when first encountered by everyday readers not very familiar with medical terms, &quot;stomatitis&quot; can be easily confused with &quot;gastritis&quot;, since in layman's terms, the organ is referred to as &quot;stomach&quot;.

Probably, although not every reader would think to search for &quot;stomach inflammation&quot; or &quot;gastritis&quot; when they find that &quot;stomatitis&quot; is not that topic.  Which is why the hatnote, the first line of text on the article, would redirect the reader to the intended page.

Now back to your regularly scheduled discussion
I've neglected to comment here because I wanted to hear out the different parties. I understand where the confusion is coming from, and while I very much dislike detest unnecessary hatnotes I'm willing to allow for this one. Enough readers searching for &quot;tomachitis&quot; will find themselves on the wrong article to justify the hatnote.
The inflammation template resides at the bottom of the article, and in my experience very few readers use these. I can't think of any other decent way to convey that gastritis is the article they're looking for. -- ser:CFCF|CFCF ser talk:CFCF|üçå (pecial:EmailUser/CFCF|email) 06:40, 25 August 2015 (UTC)
ing|Doc James.  What is needed on that article is the hatnote to explain to readers that what they might be looking for is elsewhere.  Technically, the hatnote is not even part of the article and the first sentence of the article still describes what &quot;stomatitis&quot; is.  A hatnote is indeed used to list some things that the article could be confused with and if that list becomes too long, a disambiguation page is made.  However, in this case, there is only one term confused with this one.ser:Raykyogrou0|Raykyogrou0 (ser talk:Raykyogrou0|Talk) 08:06, 25 August 2015 (UTC)

Everybody wants their little misconception to occur before all other content in the article. People want all minor spelling differences listed. They want similar words listed. Similar disease listed. Etc. We could have literally pages of about what X is not. What we need to do is describe what X actually is first. There is nothing wrong having what X is not at the end of the article. If there are refs for tomachitis and how it is confused with different terms we can create a disambig page their. What we also do is have a section called &quot;differential diagnosis&quot; under the diagnosis section where we describe similar diseases with references of course. ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk ¬∑ pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs ¬∑ pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 19:40, 25 August 2015 (UTC)
ing|Ozzie10aaaa: Could you perhaps state your reasoning?
ing|Doc James: One purpose we strive for with disambiguation, hatnotes, etc. is to get readers to the intended article in the least amount of steps.  Exactly what other misconceptions are there?  I'm only talking about this one. There are no others, as far as I know.  A hatnote is used to distinguish one article from the other, not differentiate this condition from another one with similar manifestations.  We're not talking about what X is not, but rather that X is commonly mistaken for what Y is.ser:Raykyogrou0|Raykyogrou0 (ser talk:Raykyogrou0|Talk) 08:22, 26 August 2015 (UTC)

True not for this case. The first sentence that says &quot;stomatitis is inflammation of the mouth&quot; and &quot;Stomatitis is inflammation of the mouth and lips&quot; does a great job of that.

 Health information 

(ser:Bluerasberry|pinging a ser:CFCF|couple, but open to anybody:)

ealth information is currently a [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Health_information&amp;action=history redirect] to ealth informatics.  This is wrong:  health information has nothing to do with computing power.  What I want is a way to easily contrast ealth information (&quot;The common cold is caused by a virus&quot;) with edical advice (&quot;You have a cold, and you should take this drug for it&quot;) for MEDMOS and MEDRS.  This distinction is hugely important for editors.

I agree that the current redirect is inaccurate/misleading. However, might I be so bold as to suggest the narrower title edical information instead? 
To me, health information is a broader topic than clinical statements of truth. A future article on health information could touch upon, and link to, topics such as ealth, edical advice, ental hygiene, nformed consent and ealth informatics (to name a few). As such, I'd put the article you're suggesting at medical information, but also change the target of the health information redirect to that new article. That will allow anyone, that does write a broad health information article, the opportunity to P:BOLD|be a little bolder in turning the health information redirect into a new article. I think that's more favourable than an editor broadening the scope of an article on medical information without consensus; +/- copyediting an existing, stable article to a different title.

As I understand it, &quot;health informatics&quot; is the correct term in academia and medical terminology for everything to do with health information, in the broadest sense.

*I also would like an article for this. I know of no sources which define this topic. I looked at this some time ago from a slightly different angle - I wanted to make an article for &quot;health science&quot;. I found no sources that I liked which explained the concept of health science, so it ended up as a redirect to utline of healthcare science which is a way of presenting the idea as a list without explaining what it is. See these talk pages to defunct articles -
**alk:Health science
**alk:Health sciences
I feel like if there were a health science article, then it would be easier to have a health information article, or that the sources which explained one concept might also explain the other. The sources I found which explained these things were college textbooks written for people who were not going to study them, like &quot;Health science for accountants&quot;. I do not know how to find the background philosophy of the nature of health information, but increasingly a lot of organizations are having to explain their limits. Pharma ads give one kind of information, but have some limit; lobbyist recommend some health laws, but have limits; non-physician health professionals give certain kinds of health advice but not others; and Wikipedia does something with health information but the limit might not merely be &quot;no advice&quot;. I wish there were sources to articulate this. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 18:18, 22 August 2015 (UTC)

&quot;Health informatics&quot; is a term that has long been contested and misunderstood. It frequently expands and contracts so as to suit the speaker's needs. So you can argue this different ways and there isn't a right answer. I guess the distinction I would make is that health informatics is a field of study about (among other things) health information, therefore it is possible to have two distinct articles, just like one does for ycology/ungi or ardiology/eart. Ergo, I would be happy to see ealth information as a separate article.

The question then is what goes in an article on ealth information (or edical information): is it something more ntology|ontological about the nature of clinical information? Or is it, as ser:Johnbod|Johnbod suggests, more like atient information? (I can see how one could develop an article on atient information discussing how one should present information for patients etc. and then make edical advice a re-direct to that.) Or indeed both? ser:Bondegezou|Bondegezou (ser talk:Bondegezou|talk) 10:46, 24 August 2015 (UTC)
We have an article about atient information leaflets, and I see this as something completely different.  Perhaps this would be a useful distinction:  patient information is what a patient needs to learn for his or her personal benefit; health information is what you would teach a student in a health class, regardless of the student's personal health situation. 
I'd like us to have articles that expand on the key words in this quotation:
uotation|Some patrons expect things that librarians cannot ethically deliver, such as medical advice.  When providing health and medical information, it's important to remember librarians are not licensed to practice medicine and should not do so, even when patrons persist.  The caveat here is offer information, not counsel.[https://books.google.com/books?idXWSLAwAAQBAJ&amp;pgPA122]
The article at ealth informatics, even if it were perfectly written, isn't going to help someone figure out what a librarian can or cannot legally and ethically say.  Which leads me to a new approach:  We've got some librarians around, and they might have some good resources on the distinction between medical advice and medical or health information.  ser:Hildabast seems to be out at the moment.  ser:DGG?

 Thanks for the ping! The problem with patient information is that it's so often confused with information on a patient, as it means both things - and information you give to a patient such as when there appointment is, discharge information and the like. Medical information is problematic, because that implies restriction to the practice of medicine and it's literally a medicalizing term for health. Consumer health information is often used as a way out of this dilemma.

Short answer:  No, you should never remove cited sources solely because they're old.  Sometimes century-old sources are appropriate.

Paid editing
**Clarification. I have created a draft here ikipedia_talk:Conflicts_of_interest_(medicine)#Moved_here|talk
Our P:TOU do not allow undisclosed paid editing. Our P:COI guideline states &quot;Editors with a financial conflict of interest, including paid editors, are advised not to edit affected articles; they may suggest changes on the talk page and should disclose their COI.&quot;

Healthcare is however somewhat different. Nearly all countries have specific rules when it comes to advertising of medications. Only two countries allow irect-to-consumer advertising and most specifically do not. Even in the US they are not allowed to advertise without proper disclosure (and we do not have means for disclosure per the FDA requirements within Wikipedia)

I would like to propose a P:COI/MED were we clarify that those with a financial conflict of interest are &quot;not&quot; allowed to directly edit affected articles.

*Not sure People on Wikipedia sometimes go bonkers when talking about COI. I am comfortable imposing an explicit ban on the worst kind of conflict of interest, which accounts for 90% of the problems, and is usually why anyone would invoke this policy. At the same time, I would like to make space for the 10% grey area to engage with Wikipedia more deeply, and to avoid scaring experts away or making them feel unwelcome. I want more experts at more organizations contributing to Wikipedia.
One easy way to support what I want to encourage would be to say something like &quot;staff from nonprofit organizations, schools, and government offices are encouraged to identify themselves and contribute to articles in their field of expertise so long as they identify themselves and avoid editing the article about their organization&quot;. A statement like that would not mesh with Wikipedia's general COI policy, because there are too many loopholes and because there is illogical unfairness in the statement, but I think in medicine it is a practical statement of what I wish could happen.
Also, I am a paid editor and I directly edit Wikipedia articles, so I have a COI in talking about this policy. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 20:44, 27 August 2015 (UTC)

Well, not quite. The thread as a whole is about pharma reps et al (or is trying to be). Bluerasberry's comment here, which you approvingly quoted, is about the staff of various non-profit organizations, who are to be encouraged to contribute to articles &quot;so long as they identify themselves&quot;. Thinking of these two categories of contributors as closely related is a problem. ser:Opabinia regalis|Opabinia regalis (ser talk:Opabinia regalis|talk) 05:17, 28 August 2015 (UTC)
Yes I agree that thinking of &quot;these two categories of contributors as closely related is a problem&quot;.

 Common? While researchers who self-cite a lot sometimes get some over-aggressive corrections, I can't think of an example where academic scientists and marketing reps were mentioned in the same breath this way, other than by fringey types who won't care what the policy says anyway because it was obviously written in cahoots with Big Pharma. ser:Opabinia regalis|Opabinia regalis (ser talk:Opabinia regalis|talk) 08:43, 29 August 2015 (UTC)
*I object to the original formulation of this thread: we are not &quot;direct-to-consumer advertising&quot; and shouldn't be trying to police ourselves as such. We may be a channel through which to attempt it, but we cannot be thinking about encyclopedia articles on drugs - which are primarily articles about chemicals, not about specific branded products - as so narrowly oriented toward a consumer audience. Every time I look in on what this project is up to, it's centering the idea of the reader as a patient - not, say, as a student taking a biochemistry class - and the approach to article content consistently reflects that model in a way that may weaken coverage of other relevant material.  I am very concerned about scope creep here. This thread is titled &quot;paid editing&quot; but is in fact about FCOI, which is a much broader category and not at all the same thing. It comes off as moral-panic-y. Bluerasberry's comments in this thread about FCOI then generalize to the purported COI of educational staff, which is not at all the same thing again. To go anywhere with this kind of proposal, you need to be much, much more specific about the intended scope. ser:Opabinia regalis|Opabinia regalis (ser talk:Opabinia regalis|talk) 01:44, 28 August 2015 (UTC)
Should we try to dissuade pharmaceutical companies from attempting to do &quot;direct-to-consumer advertising&quot; through Wikipedia that is the question. 
This has nothing to do with centering our content around &quot;patients&quot; ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk ¬∑ pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs ¬∑ pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 02:18, 28 August 2015 (UTC)

Yes, it's clear that you're trying to refer to pharma reps and so forth, but that's not what you wrote. The third paragraph of your first post starts off with &quot;those with a financial conflict of interest&quot; but then slides into global norms about DTC: so do you mean marketing reps, or anyone with an FCOI? As for patient information, your second paragraph, providing the reasoning behind this proposed policy, is entirely about the legalities of DTC advertising of medication. That is a category that is meaningful only in the context of patient information. 
Thanks for the draft. That is better than what's in this thread, but I doubt it's within our scope to determine that some identifiable individual is attempting to DTC; that's a very specific legal claim. Outside of that attempted connection it's not clear why this needs to be a separate policy or policy subsection at all. ser:Opabinia regalis|Opabinia regalis (ser talk:Opabinia regalis|talk) 05:17, 28 August 2015 (UTC)
You know, I'm not trying to filibuster this, but on further consideration I really really think you need to get a legal opinion before pushing any further with this idea that FCOI with pharma = DTC. As written it's practically a legal threat. ser:Opabinia regalis|Opabinia regalis (ser talk:Opabinia regalis|talk) 19:20, 28 August 2015 (UTC)
Yes thus the &quot;may&quot; in &quot;may also be viewed as undisclosed advertising&quot;. But this bit is not needed really in the proposal. I have removed it. I agree that the pharmaceutical companies attempting to become involved in paid editing know the law and we do not need to tell it to them as they have entire staffs of lawyers. ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk ¬∑ pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs ¬∑ pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 19:24, 28 August 2015 (UTC)
Thanks. That is an improvement. I would remove the first two bullets - they are not specific to medical content and invite P:BEANS among the fringe elements. The third bullet for pharma reps needs worthsmithing. (&quot;Health content&quot; or &quot;health care content&quot;? Are you sure you don't mean &quot;content related to their business or products&quot;, just like anyone in any other industry?) It's also a little strange that research scientists apparently get their own bullet in the proposed &quot;medical COI&quot; policy, but not clinicians. ser:Opabinia regalis|Opabinia regalis (ser talk:Opabinia regalis|talk) 08:43, 29 August 2015 (UTC)

Doc James, were you aware that P:MEDCOI already exists?  

Also, why should staff of a non-profit or government agency need to identify themselves to improve medical articles?  In some countries, that amounts to nearly all physicians in certain specialties, and large fractions of others.  &quot;Being a healthcare professional&quot; is not a COI, even if you are employed by a non-profit.  80% of American hospital staff would fall under your proposed identification rule.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 03:31, 30 August 2015 (UTC)

Question arises from [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_cocaine_analogues&amp;curid=14638076&amp;diff=675802329&amp;oldid=675801294 this edit] at ist of cocaine analogues.  I haven't seen that invoked before, and I don't think it is a good thing. Before I seek to change that at T:TM I wanted to check my head here. Have also pinged the WP:PHARM talk page.  ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 19:50, 12 August 2015 (UTC) (fix ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 20:11, 12 August 2015 (UTC))

I should have teed up the question I have clearly - can anybody think of cases where it is &quot;unavoidably necessary&quot; to distinguish between a generic and brand name for a drug?  Since we always use the INN I don't see much of a need, ever.  &quot;Aspirin&quot; could have been one but Bayer lost its trademark on that. ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 20:06, 12 August 2015 (UTC)

There are formulations which have different bioavailabilities which occasionally may be relevant to WP. We are encouraged to prescribe generically with the INN but pharma companies will try to make the case to use their formulation as preferable to a generic form.  It may be relevant occasionally for slow-release/colonic release GI drugs such as Asacol/Mezavant -- forms of esalazine. See here MID|12755834.  I would recommend limited use of TM if necessary to explain these differences. ser:Jrfw51|Jrfw51 (ser talk:Jrfw51|talk) 20:41, 12 August 2015 (UTC)
I don't think that we should use ‚Ñ¢ or ¬Æ (and these would be ¬Æ, as they are specifically registered trademarks).  I also don't think MOS:TM intends to say that trademarks ought to be noted as such.  
I think that the case that they're considering is more like &quot;Tylenol is a commonly used drug.  The Tylenol¬Æ brand of that drug was targeted by a murderer‚Äìextortionist some years ago&quot;.  We avoid that by using generic names whenever possible.  It's not possible with vaccines and some other biologics, because there is no true generic version.  I have left a note at MOS:TM to ask them to clarify.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 23:06, 12 August 2015 (UTC)
In spoken English, there is no distinction between Tylenol and Tylenol¬Æ. One would always clarify whether one is talking about a generic or the brand. For the sake of clarity, we should be explicit in writing, rather than relying in the reader to understand the code of omitting the ¬Æ to indicate generics. I'm not in the pharmaceutical industry. I would have assumed the &quot; Tylenol&quot; only refers to the Tylenol brand product. It would not have occurred to me that it was being used to refer to anything else.ser:Ground Zero|Ground Zero | ser talk:Ground Zero|t 00:20, 13 August 2015 (UTC)
Tylenol is like Kleenex:  people who can't pronounce (or spell) paracetamol or acetaminophen use the brand name.  
When giving both names, e.g., Herceptin is the brand name for trastuzumab, how would you write it?  &quot;Trastuzumab (Herceptin)&quot;?  Or &quot;Trastuzumab (Herceptin¬Æ)&quot; or &quot;Trastuzumab (brand name:  Herceptin)&quot;?  Something else?  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 00:51, 13 August 2015 (UTC)
&quot;Trastuzumab (brand name:  Herceptin)&quot; seems perfectly clear. If &quot;Tylenol&quot; doesn't mean &quot;Tylenol brand&quot; to everyone, then we should write &quot;Tylenol brand acetaminophen&quot;. ser:Ground Zero|Ground Zero | ser talk:Ground Zero|t 01:28, 13 August 2015 (UTC)
And in the UK, &quot;Tylenol&quot; is baffling (we say paracetamol). ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 03:30, 13 August 2015 (UTC)
Worse, the brand is applied to a whole line of products containing different drugs, strengths, form factors, and indications. Brand articles really should not be addressing technical  characteristics of drugs, it just begs problems such as paid editing without any compensating benefit to the reader..ser:LeadSongDog|LeadSongDog ser talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl! 04:56, 13 August 2015 (UTC)
We should generally use generics. When we use brands we do not need either &quot;TM&quot; or &quot;R&quot;. Personally their use raises red flags for me. ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk ¬∑ pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs ¬∑ pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 11:50, 13 August 2015 (UTC)
d this has all been interesting... I think who ever added that to OS:TM didn't understand that it is rare in medicine/pharmacology for the brand name of a drug to become genericized so that confusion is rarely an issue (we don't get the &quot;kleenex&quot; or &quot;xerox&quot; issue happening much).  At the article that prompted this, |RexxS weighed in [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:List_of_cocaine_analogues&amp;curid=14638178&amp;diff=675890520&amp;oldid=675806788 here], who also is discussing at T:MOSTM  Also, I think in our standard way of naming drugs {&quot;Celecoxib (Celebrex)&quot;} we don't need to use the TM or R marks, as there is no confusion as to what we are talking about when we name the brand.     ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 12:38, 13 August 2015 (UTC)
I don't think &quot;TM&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, etc. should be needed either. I come from a somewhat parallel discipline, but when it comes to insecticides, we often refer to products by their active ingredient (e.g., ambda-cyhalothrin, similar to generic), and the trade name from a specific company (e.g., Warrior II from Syngenta) that has a specific formulation with additives other than the active ingredient for keeping the product in solution better. It's a similar setup in formal pharmacology, so if a trade/brand name needs to be mentioned specifically, just somehow indicating it's not the generic by mentioning it's a specific formulation produced by company X should be the most attribution needed if at all. It might be a few more words than a single symbol, but it should be more informative to readers. ser:Kingofaces43|Kingofaces43 (ser talk:Kingofaces43|talk) 12:59, 13 August 2015 (UTC)
 The other issue is accessibility. Many screen readers on their default settings simply won't speak glyphs like ‚Ñ¢ and ¬Æ, so any attempt to use them to distinguish between brand and generic is doomed to failure for some visitors using assistive technology. We're always going to better off, as |Kingofaces43 says, conveying meaning by using words, even if it takes a few more. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 14:12, 13 August 2015 (UTC)

 alk:Adderall #Changing Title Back to &quot;Amphetamine Mixed Salts&quot;. There are sufficiently diverse opinions to mean that using the brand name, Adderall, is no more than a majority view. There is a preference not to use &quot;amphetamine mixed salts&quot;, but that's not the same as an unavoidable necessity. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 22:52, 16 August 2015 (UTC)

&quot;Amphetamine mixed salts&quot; is not a nonproprietary name.  It's a term that describes the formulation; it is not a generic drug name per any government, pharmaceutical, or chemical organization which assigns nonproprietary names to drugs. ser:Seppi333|Seppi333¬†(ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert¬†2¬¢) 04:25, 31 August 2015 (UTC)
 That simply means that we don't even need a non-proprietary name to unambiguously identify the formulation. It's just one more example of a context where it is not &quot;unavoidably necessary&quot; to use the brand name with a trademark glyph. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 23:18, 2 September 2015 (UTC)
 Given that this issue came up at FA when listing &quot;Adderall&quot; next to nonproprietary names, that note was written per a consensus at the FA nom, so yes it is. ser:Seppi333|Seppi333¬†(ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert¬†2¬¢) 00:14, 3 September 2015 (UTC)

Hello everyone,

IOSH is pleased to partner with Wikimedia DC for an upcoming conference, Wikipedia for Health/Safety Research and Data, to be held in Washington, DC, on November 12-13, 2015. The goal of the conference is to make the case to government agencies in the United States that helping in the development of Wikimedia content is worth the time and money. Given the conference's focus on health research, I believe this WikiProject would be interested in participating.

d&quot;Beta adrenoceptor antagonist&quot; is technically a broader topic than &quot;beta blocker&quot;, but based upon their current content I think the (incorrectly titled) drenergic beta-antagonist article should just be merged into beta-blocker instead of restructuring it. &quot;Beta blockers&quot; wouldn't include unconventional antagonists of these receptors - ones that don't act by &quot;blocking&quot; an agonist ligand binding site (e.g., some trace amines like henethylamine are llosteric modulator|allosteric antagonists of beta adrenoceptors: MID|22073124) - but this topic isn't covered in either article at the moment. ser:Seppi333|Seppi333¬†(ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert¬†2¬¢) 00:49, 5 September 2015 (UTC)

 Concern about deprecation of template:Cite doi by user:Dexbot 

I am posting to draw attention to a concern expressed by |Ashill. He noticed that ser:Dexbot is replacing instances of template:Cite doi with template:Cite journal and expanding the references. This means that references which only use the doi (a code) are replaced with full references listing author, title, etc.

This replacement is asserted to be based on consensus at emplate_talk:Cite_doi#RfC:_Should_Template:cite_doi_cease_creating_a_separate_subpage_for_each_DOI.3F. Ashill suggests that the close of the discussion was in haste and that there was no clear consensus.

I agree with Ashill that the changes are significant. They affect not less than 10,000 articles. They are happening suddenly, now, with many articles every day changing. Since WikiProject Medicine members advocated for this change, and because I want good communication between members of WikiProject Medicine and the larger Wikipedia community, I think it would be good to reply to this person and watch for additional comments which may arise as people wonder what is happening with the bot replacing so much so quickly. Would someone comment at emplate_talk:Cite_doi#Removal_of_useful_template? ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 18:35, 4 September 2015 (UTC)

Human-centric articles
I've noticed that diseases that are common to both man and beast are nevertheless 1) segregated by article, or the 2) treatment of animals is offhand. This seems too Human-centric for an encyclopedia, where the causes and results are much the same. In category 1) iebaldism and iebald. In category 2 is eprosy. Is there a policy on this? ser:Student7|Student7 (ser talk:Student7|talk) 17:55, 5 September 2015 (UTC)
Unity is desirable, but we have to realize that Wikipedia articles are written by volunteers, who write best when they write about things they understand that interest them.  The result of a policy would most likely be to make it less likely that people would want to write articles.  But if you see a way to make our articles better, you are absolutely more than welcome to step in and improve them.

Per our P:MEDMOS our articles typically concentrate on humans as this is what most of our readers are looking for. We then have a section at the lower part of the article occasionally on &quot;Other animals&quot;. And sometimes we have articles called &quot;Disease X in other animals&quot;

d I think the focus of disease articles should be on humans, but other animals (if relevant) should be covered by simply discussing the topic in generality and including human-specific coverage of the topic in cases where there are differences between species.  E.g., ransmissible spongiform encephalopathy (i.e., prion diseases) does this.  I can't imagine using this approach in drug articles though. ser:Seppi333|Seppi333¬†(ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert¬†2¬¢) 12:42, 6 September 2015 (UTC)
I don't think there can be a universal rule.  Most disease articles should focus on humans, but for example the article on abies would be incomplete if it didn't discuss how the disease affects animals.  And for articles on body parts it often makes more sense to have a base article that describes the cross-species situation, and a second article specific to humans.  In neuroscience for example we have rain and uman brain.  I would favor treating the stomach the same way. ser:Looie496|Looie496 (ser talk:Looie496|talk) 16:12, 6 September 2015 (UTC)

The hatnote at the top of the brain article would be a good model to follow for other anatomy articles and other topics where there are both human and general articles: 
bout|the brains of all types of animals, including humans|information specific to the human brain|Human brain|other uses

rain is one of very few articles where there is consensus that the main topic should not be human brains. According to P:ANATMOS including a section called Other animals is the apposite treatment.
That means no hatnote is needed, just a l|main under the correction section. -- ser:CFCF|CFCF ser talk:CFCF|üçå (pecial:EmailUser/CFCF|email)
 The guideline you refer to, P:ANATMOS, never had general consensus from a representative community. It should certainly not be used to buttress arguments in this thread. It is a guideline agreed to by a group of medical editors who hijacked anatomy as a medical project and confined its scope to human anatomy. --ser:Epipelagic|Epipelagic (ser talk:Epipelagic|talk) 22:54, 6 September 2015 (UTC)
 You may care to note that this is part of the &quot;manual of style&quot; that underwent a length discussion. As you know Epipelagic, we and many other editors have had a number of discussions on this point, and the consensus has always been to have articles as human centric, the main reason being that there is simply not enough content about animals on most anatomical subjects. You are welcome to propose this point for discussion (again) but I propose (again) that instead you focus on creating more content that would actually justify these splits. --ser:LT910001|Tom (LT) (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 08:56, 8 September 2015 (UTC)
Last year we discussed eterinary oncology|Animal cancer here a bit - I suspect that this is rather typical in that very little is known about it compared to human cancer, and that little is confined very largely to the main pet &amp; farm species vets see a lot. Generally, and I think appropriately, there is little attempt at treatment. Animals do figure prominently in nfectious cancer though. ser:Johnbod|Johnbod (ser talk:Johnbod|talk) 19:52, 6 September 2015 (UTC)

 Work of Breathing 

I have started a new article on ork of breathing which has significance in underwater diving and which I expect is also within the scope of Wikiproject Medicine. Please feel free to contribute, reference, copyedit, check and all the rest of the constructive things we do here. I will be concentrating on aspects relevant to diving, and will only add content outside of that scope if I serendipitously come across good material during my research.

 Errors in oliomyelitis article 

As of September 7, 2015, polio had been recently found in Guinea, Mali, and Ukraine.

http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/07/health-polio-idUSL5N11D1X220150907

The Wikipedia article does not reflect this and incorrectly implies that a person could travel safely to those countries without fear of infection and without needing to get the vaccine first.  It is imperative to fix this immediately.

In the Africa section, the sentence &quot;Africa has had no confirmed cases polio since Aug. 11, 2014&quot; is false.

In the lead, the sentence &quot;In 2014 the disease was only spreading between people in Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan&quot; may be a technically true statement about the situation in 2014, but it needs to be followed with information about the current information in Guinea and Mali.
 
In the Europe section, the sentence &quot;Europe was declared polio-free in 2002.&quot; may be a technically true statement about the situation in 2012, but it needs to be followed with information about the current information in Ukraine.

Okay, I have been offline for the weekend, but now I have finished rewriting the page to be more understandable (to me, at least). I hope that someone will look it over to make sure I haven't misrepresented anything.  I moved it to mainspace, and, ser:Johnbod|Johnbod, I moved your comment to the talk page.

There's an issue involving dosing information on equivalent potencies of amphetamine pharmaceuticals in the template l|Amphetamine base in marketed amphetamine medications and current revision extroamphetamine where this is transcluded; the thread where this discussion is taking place is at alk:Amphetamine/Archive 6#Add table of potency of marketed amphetamines / &quot;substituted amphetamine&quot; term.  An identical issue was previously raised at ikipedia talk:WikiProject Medicine/Archive 68#List of benzodiazepines dose equivalence; an entire column of data in the ist of benzodiazepines was removed as a result of that discussion.

Thanks for responding Ozzie; due to the lack of response by others in this project, I opted to simply change the guideline in OS:PHARM and the OS:MED drug section so that I don't have to deal with the problem. Given the lack of input from this request, I knew this wouldn't be a controversial change to the guideline. ser:Seppi333|Seppi333¬†(ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert¬†2¬¢) 00:15, 5 September 2015 (UTC)
