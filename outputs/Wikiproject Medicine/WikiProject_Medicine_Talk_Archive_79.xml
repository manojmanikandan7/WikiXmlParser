 MEDRS required to support claim that something is placebo? 

I thought this has might have been discussed by this project before and maybe there's a precedent someone could point me to... Does repeating a claim that something, like CAM, is a placebo require MEDRS? I know that in general FRINGE does not, but there's a debate about using the word placebo without MEDRS at alk:Deepak Chopra#Treatment of controversy in lead.  ser:Permstrump|Permstrump (ser talk:Permstrump|talk) 21:15, 9 March 2016 (UTC)
yes. any specific statement about health very much should be supported by an ideal source per MEDRS. we want high quality content, and that means well-supported.  Following this consistently allows us to keep all kinds of low-quality content out - whether it is added by a shill for X or a &quot;believer&quot; in Y.  ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 21:21, 9 March 2016 (UTC)
Something to consider:  if you 'gold-plated MEDRS' sources don't address a point, then trying using the best you can realistically get.  If &quot;the best&quot; is not a very good source, then the it's possible that a statement is P:UNDUE or that a different description would better comply with NPOV.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 21:30, 9 March 2016 (UTC)
q|If &quot;the best&quot; is not a very good source, then the it's possible that a statement is WP:UNDUE or that a different description would better comply with NPOV-- Good point, |WhatamIdoing. I don't know when or who added it, but the source was definitely an odd choice. It's a literary magazine called he Antioch Review published by ntioch College, neither of which mean anything to me. The author is a medical doctor and professor at University of Louisville Medical School though, FWIW. I haven't looked for an alternate, so I honestly have no idea if that's the only or best source. A few editors thought there was basically a blanket rule that FRINGE never requires MEDRS and others thought the reference to placebo made it a different story. But I think the bottom line is, like you said, if it's DUE there should be a couple of options for sources to choose from, which would apply regardless of MEDRS. ser:Permstrump|Permstrump (ser talk:Permstrump|talk) 22:35, 9 March 2016 (UTC)
Definition of CAM
The question misrepresents the situation. We're dealing with CAM, which by it's very nature is nothing better than placebo. A claim that CAM has effects other than placebo requires exceptionally high quality MEDRS sources per FRINGE. The reverse, that CAM as no effects beyond placebo, is exactly what it means to be CAM. --ser:Ronz|Ronz (ser talk:Ronz|talk) 17:27, 10 March 2016 (UTC)
We are dealing with a BLP article and  charges related to the medical competence of the subject  of the article. This at the least requires that the source be verifiable and reliable for those charges and that the charges are repeated in multiple sources indicating mainstream acceptance. Suggestion that this is entirely a CAM situation, that all of CAM is placebo, is not correct and further suggests that we have the right to judge a entire and complex field in view of our own opinions, and that we can extend that position to a man's life whoever he may be. This is a BLP we must treat it as such exercising the kind judgement in editing that does not damage whatever our opinions might be.

While the credentials of the writer of this piece might be what we could consider reliable the publication is not, especially in  a BLP where extra care must be taken.(ser:Littleolive oil|Littleolive oil (ser talk:Littleolive oil|talk) 17:52, 10 March 2016 (UTC))
It is entirely a CAM situation. All of CAM is no better than placebo by definition. These aren't simply opinions, nor are they opinions that require balancing. Rather, they are viewpoints that get special prominence so we can create a respected encyclopedia when it comes to scientific thought. --ser:Ronz|Ronz (ser talk:Ronz|talk) 23:53, 10 March 2016 (UTC)
I've never yet seen a definition of CAM that says &quot;CAM is stuff that's no better than placebo&quot; – not even from the most strident critics.  For one thing, that definition of CAM would have to include things like arthroscopic knee surgery, which is &quot;mainstream&quot;, and exclude chiropractors treating a ursemaid's elbow|subluxated elbow.  It also wouldn't be possible for something to stop being CAM and start being mainstream, which is exactly what happened to the amaze technique. 
Additionally, BLP covers every living human, including criminals and &quot;SCAM artists&quot;.  When the article has a living human's name at the top, you must respect BLP throughout the page.  You can't declare any part of a biography of a living person to be exempt from the policy about biographies of living persons.  If the information isn't about that person, then it shouldn't be on that page.  If it is about that person, then it must comply with BLP.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 08:07, 11 March 2016 (UTC)
 ack, |Ronz. While i hear you, you are going a step too far when you say &quot;all CAM is placebo&quot;.  It is just too broad a brush and too definitive a statement. I agree with everything else you wrote; the same is true to say &quot;medical device X is safe and effective to treat Y&quot; - we also get people like company reps who want to over-emphasize how good their products are; but we do have to be extra careful to raise source quality with CAM stuff because we run into so much diffuse advocacy and so often there is no known biological mechanism by which the intervention could work.  yes.    ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 14:25, 11 March 2016 (UTC)
I'm not saying all CAM is a placebo. I'm saying by definition it's no better than placebo.[citation needed] That's the defining point between evidence-based medicine and everything else. If it is found to be better than placebo, it's no longer CAM. Maybe I'm wrong. If editors disagree, we can look at sources. This is a topic where expertise is required, and we should not be making decisions without the necessary expertise guiding us. --ser:Ronz|Ronz (ser talk:Ronz|talk) 17:02, 11 March 2016 (UTC)
 e|Ronz I'm on the same page, but WhatamIdoing still made a good in one of the first responses that if it's DUE, it should be available in other sources, so I decided to drop the MEDRS part of the debate for now. At one point I was hoping to squash it once and for all, but then I snapped out of it. That was silly of me. I found a couple of sources that say something similar even if they don't use the word placebo. I'll post on alk:Deepak Chopra later today as soon as I have a chance. ser:Permstrump|PermStrumpser:Permstrump|(talk) 17:24, 11 March 2016 (UTC)
In the case of Chopra, the article - MID|12846118 - by Hans Baer (a medical anthropologist) which is already used in the article refers to Chopra as &quot;a multi-millionaire thoroughly seduced by the placebo effect&quot;. That would seem pertinent to this discussion. Edit: Sorry this is in the Gamel piece the article cites, and not the Baer one. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 17:35, 11 March 2016 (UTC); amended 03:31, 12 March 2016 (UTC)
Ronz, do you have a source for this alleged definition, or are you just repeating your personal POV?  I'd love to be able to edit the lead for rthroscopic knee surgery (rthroscopy#Knee) to say that it's &quot;alternative medicine&quot; rather than conventional Western surgery, and I'm sure that there are people who would like to say that ansema is &quot;evidence-based medicine&quot; according to your definition – because, you know, it does actually work &quot;better than placebo&quot; for superficial skin cancers ...just, unfortunately, at about one-tenth the rate of modern medicine, and with about ten times the side effects.  You'd be better off wielding a kitchen knife than with herbal escharotics, but you're better off with Cansema than with a placebo.  The reason that it's alternative is because there are options that are much, much, much better than placebo, not because it is no more effective than placebo.  As for the knee surgery, you would probably be better off with a charismatic aith healer than with the surgery; both have been studied and neither are better than placebo – but the risks of sitting through a faith healing session are lower than the risks of anesthesia, infection, etc. 
The precise antonym of &quot;alternative&quot; is &quot;conventional&quot;.  Words that contrast with &quot;evidence-based&quot; include &quot;experimental&quot;, &quot;unproven&quot;, and &quot;disproven&quot;.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 07:02, 12 March 2016 (UTC)
The words on the lternative medicine side (&quot;alternative&quot;, &quot;complementary&quot;, &quot;integrative&quot;, &quot;holistic&quot;, etc) are all simply marketing to make it seem something other than quackery, snake oil, etc. vidence-based medicine is not marketing. Read the articles. As I said, expertise is needed. --ser:Ronz|Ronz (ser talk:Ronz|talk) 17:25, 12 March 2016 (UTC)
I've already read multiple sources, all of which have the advantage of not being skewed by the POV of Wikipedia editors who are out to right great wrongs (on both sides), and none of which claim that &quot;stuff that works no better than placebo&quot; is an adequate or even relevant definition of altmed.  There's quite a lot of marketing behind arthroscopic knee surgery for osteoarthritis, which is (a) no better than placebo, (b) not altmed, and (c) not evidence-based medicine.  There's also some marketing (far, far less than for knee surgery!) for Cansema, which is (a) better than placebo, (b) much, much worse than conventional treatment, (c) very much altmed.  Evidence-based medicine is (unfortunately) heavily affected by marketing – because marketing determines what gets researched and what gets reported – although not necessarily as much as, say, direct-to-consumer advertisements of those knee surgeries. 
I believe that it is important as Wikipedia editors to be very precise.  When something is known to be no better than placebo, we should say exactly that.  We should not say &quot;it's altmed&quot; to mean &quot;no more effective than placebo&quot;, and we should certainly not delude ourselves into thinking that conventional medical treatments are better than placebo – or even that &quot;better than placebo&quot; means &quot;better than the other options&quot;.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 04:26, 13 March 2016 (UTC)
See ite journal|last1=Bland|first1=J|title=Does complementary and alternative medicine represent only placebo therapies?|journal=Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine|date=2008|volume=14|issue=2|pages=16–8|pmid=18383985|url=http://www.jeffreybland.com/uploads/Altern%20Ther%20Health%20Med.2008.Mar-Apr.pdf .ser:BlueStove|BlueStove (ser talk:BlueStove|talk) 17:10, 13 March 2016 (UTC)
WhatamIdoing, I'm afraid I don't see any relevant arguments in your comments. My concerns are on the nature of CAM, evidence-based medicine, the relationship between the two, and how our policies and guidelines are relevant to them. You appear to be arguing a false equivalence of some sort: that because evidence-based medicine includes some treatments of poor effectiveness that this somehow reflects on something relevant somehow. It's not clear what point you're trying to make in all of it.
I am trying to be precise in my wording, without going into irrelevant detail. CAM is by definition no better than placebo.
Re Bland 2008: What's the point of the in-world editorial, other than pointing out how CAM practitioners promote their viewpoint? --ser:Ronz|Ronz (ser talk:Ronz|talk) 17:36, 13 March 2016 (UTC)
utdent
Once again, Ronz:  Citation needed.  Seriously.  There are some excellent definitions of altmed available in reliable sources, and I've never yet seen one that says &quot;CAM is whatever's no better than placebo&quot;.  I've seen quite a few skeptics say that CAM is a socially constructed category that ought to be ignored by scientists (i.e., &quot;There is no alternative medicine. There is only medicine that works [e.g., Cansema, labeled &quot;alternative&quot; but [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24150196 scientifically proven to permanently cure some superficial skin cancers] and possessed of a hemical burn|very plausible scientific rationale] and medicine that doesn't work [e.g., knee arthroscopy, &quot;mainstream&quot; but proven to be exactly &quot;no better than placebo]&quot;), but I've never yet seen one that says if it's &quot;no better than placebo&quot; is a complete, or even accurate, definition of CAM.

So here's the challenge:  Quit simply repeating your personal POV as if it were The Truth™, and start providing reliable sources.  Can you produce even one proper reliable source (not an pinion piece or a website) that defines CAM as &quot;anything that's no better than placebo&quot;, with no further qualifiers?  Can you find any expert who would seriously accept black salve as &quot;modern, evidence-based medicine&quot;, and reject knee arthroscopy as &quot;alternative&quot;?  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 03:11, 14 March 2016 (UTC)
Again, you're asserting a false balance, not making yourself any clearer, and straying from the topic. Is this intentional?
You appear to be familiar with the pov, &quot;There is no alternative medicine. There is only medicine that works&quot;. Good enough for me. --ser:Ronz|Ronz (ser talk:Ronz|talk) 15:37, 14 March 2016 (UTC)
That POV means that the socially constructed distinction should be ignored.  It does not mean that 100% of treatments that are usually labeled as &quot;alternative medicine&quot; work no better than placebo.  It also doesn't mean that 100% of treatments that are labeled as &quot;not alternative&quot; do work better than placebo.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:31, 14 March 2016 (UTC)
You'll note I repeatedly pointed out a false balance in my previous comments. &quot;It also doesn't mean that 100% of treatments that are labeled as &quot;not alternative&quot; do work better than placebo.&quot; I'm not arguing this and it's irrelevant. --ser:Ronz|Ronz (ser talk:Ronz|talk) 17:27, 15 March 2016 (UTC)
It's not irrelevant if you say that &quot;no better than placebo&quot; is the definition of altmed.  If that were actually the definition, then knee arthroscopy would be pure altmed.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 15:23, 16 March 2016 (UTC)

The claim is &quot;His treatments rely on the placebo effect.[8]&quot; There is no reviews for treatments Deepak Chopra uses that mention him. I don't think MEDRS covers BLP issues about claims referring to people. ser:QuackGuru|QuackGuru (ser talk:QuackGuru|talk) 17:32, 11 March 2016 (UTC)
Huh? You appear to just be repeating the initial concerns. --ser:Ronz|Ronz (ser talk:Ronz|talk) 17:41, 11 March 2016 (UTC)
It appears both sides of the above discussion seem to have fallen for the idea that better-than-placebo is good enough. If that was the case, willow bark could be the gold standard analgesic. We have to instead ask what works best: to identify the most efficacious option that is safe to use, with sufficiently trivial side-effects. It doesn't help that the FDA still plays along with patent &quot;vergreening&quot;: new variants on old drugs should have to be shown as significantly better than the old ones (at least for some indications) in order to gain a new drug approval, not just better than placebo. It's far too low a bar to set. ser:LeadSongDog|LeadSongDog ser talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl! 17:00, 14 March 2016 (UTC)
^ This.  &quot;Better than placebo&quot; is not the same thing as &quot;best&quot; or &quot;conventional&quot; or any number of other desirable things.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:31, 14 March 2016 (UTC)
Another irrelevant comparison.
@LeadSongDog: &quot;Better than placebo&quot; demonstrates that it's worth scientific investigation. (Perhaps you're pointing out that CAM would simply sit with willow bark and not bother to investigate what is effective about it?) Yes, there's the whole safety issue that I'm ignoring. Probably better had I said &quot;Better than placebo, or safe&quot;, but the focus here is on placebo effects. Meanwhile, I think editors have moved on from the relevant dispute. --ser:Ronz|Ronz (ser talk:Ronz|talk) 17:43, 15 March 2016 (UTC)
No, &quot;better than placebo&quot; does not demonstrate that it's worth scientific investigation, including for black salve and willow root, which (a) have already been investigated, (b) proven to work better than placebo, and (c) proven to be much less effective than conventional treatment. 
The problem I have is that you keep saying that the &quot;altmed  no better than placebo by definition&quot;, which is simply not true.  There is no such definition.  It's true that altmed treatments are frequently no better than placebo, but that category also includes a non-trivial number of treatments that are &quot;better than placebo but worse than (excellent) conventional care&quot; and even a few that are &quot;better than placebo and about as good as our current (largely ineffective) conventional care&quot;.  If you'd stop repeating this canard about the definition being that they're no better than placebo, then I'd be satisfied.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 15:23, 16 March 2016 (UTC)
d @ Commenters above |Ronz, |WhatamIdoing, |LeadSongDog, |BlueStove, |Littleolive oil, |Jytdog, |Permstrump, |Alexbrn -- Late to the party but I think this is important:  The simple fact is that there is no single accepted definition of lternative medicine, nor one that clearly outweighs the others.  See lternative medicine|the article's well-referenced first sentence.  There are multiple definitions from excellent MEDRS --  Harrison's, IOM, NSF, Angell in NEJM, WebMD, NCCIH at NIH -- some of which overlap, and a couple of which are mutually exclusive (Harrison's rebuts NSF's &amp; Angell's).  While some weigh more than others (IOM's the biggest), choosing just one of them would violate NPOV, VER and OR all at the same time.  Since there is no single accepted definition, perhaps best to wikilink to the article and where necessary quote or summarize its first sentence. --ser:Middle 8|Middle 8 (ser talk:Middle 8|t • pecial:Contributions/Middle_8|c | ser:Middle_8/Privacy|privacy • ser:Middle_8/COI|COI) 06:01, 25 March 2016 (UTC)

Attempting to nail down a complex idea, or term with one-overarching definition will never work. What does work is if and when we respect BLP as policy and guide respecting and protecting anyone we are writing about. We don't  have the dubious luxury of inserting or using our opinions on anyone no matter who they are to color the articles or their content.

 Fire needle acupuncture  

There are several claims being thrown around ikipedia:Articles for deletion/Fire needle acupuncture with regard to P:MEDRS's application to that article.

(The AfD has closed as a keep.) It's pretty straightforward.  The 3rd para of P:MEDRS indicates that biomedical content (in any article, medical or not) must meet MEDRS, but that non-medical content (even in medical articles) must meet only RS standards.  Articles about traditional/alt-meds by definition will include much non-medical content.  Some editors at the AfD mentioned above argued that all material in a traditional/alt-med article must meet MEDRS standards, and (per MEDRS's lede) they were mistaken. --ser:Middle 8|Middle 8 (ser talk:Middle 8|t • pecial:Contributions/Middle_8|c | ser:Middle_8/Privacy|privacy • ser:Middle_8/COI|COI) 12:49, 24 March 2016 (UTC)
And no, pace Rhododendrites's comments in that AfD, we don't need a medical textbook (MEDRS) to describe e.g. an yurveda practice.  We'd need something like a legitimate, traditional ayurvedic text, which would rock for ayurveda but suck as a MEDRS.

P:Biomedical information isn't PAG, but it does (properly imo) disclude beliefs.

P:FRIND has: &quot;Points that are not discussed in independent sources should not be given any space in articles&quot;. I meant that.

&quot;Independent&quot; and &quot;holds a mainstream scientific view&quot; are completely unrelated concepts.

|WhatamIdoing Moreover, &quot;independent&quot; has to do with vested interest, not specialty or ideological alignment (cf. the lede of P:INDY, to which WP:FRIND links).

|Alexbrn I see your point regarding mainstream coverage and OR, but we already have sources describing TCM from the mainstream POV; there is no reason to demand such sources for every notable aspect of TCM.

If there are mainstream sources then there's no problem.

Notability is not the same as mainstream acceptance, as ikipedia:Fringe_theories#Notability_versus_acceptance|WP:FRINGE indicates.  What matters is that the topic at hand has been touched by RS for TCM theory.  The RS in the article are enough for a topic-literate person to write from.

Nothing to do with &quot;acceptance&quot;, but coverage. There is loads of fringe &quot;topic-specific&quot; literature going into (e.g) the typology of rey aliens, the precise purpose of the hemtrail conspiracy theory, and various rituals of woo in acupuncture, homeopathy, crystal healing and other magicks. If this stuff is just &quot;in-universe&quot; we don't bother with it.

P:N applies to whether an article should exist or not, the issues here fall under our need for neutrality when writing the article. P:NPOV and P:FRINGE are the on-point PAGs. To quote from the former:uotation|Conspiracy theories, pseudoscience, speculative history, or plausible but currently unaccepted theories should not be legitimized through comparison to accepted academic scholarship. We do not take a stand on these issues as encyclopedia writers, for or against; we merely omit this information where including it would unduly legitimize it, and otherwise include and describe these ideas in their proper context with respect to established scholarship and the beliefs of the wider world. [my bold] If the only sources that exist are &quot;in-universe&quot; ones it would be impossible to present fringe ideas within &quot;proper context with respect to established scholarship&quot;, so we omit it. We need mainstream sources for that. That is policy and not negotiable. Otherwise we'd be having to use ufologist texts for describing what might have happened at Roswell, TCM texts for altmed woo, psychic texts for outlining psychic abilities and so on.

&quot;Neutral&quot; is defined as&quot;All encyclopedic content on Wikipedia must be written from a neutral point of view (NPOV), which means representing fairly, proportionately, and, as far as possible, without editorial bias, all of the significant views that have been published by reliable sources on a topic.&quot; fairly and proportionately representing what the published reliable sources say.  If absolutely all of the published reliable sources represent the &quot;in-universe POV&quot;, then the &quot;neutral POV&quot; is the &quot;in-universe POV&quot;.  From your POV, this definition works brilliantly when all the reliable sources are mainstream scientific sources, and it works abysmally when all the reliable sources are from altmed proponents – but the definition of NPOV doesn't change with the subject.  The proposal to have a P:Scientific point of view was rejected years ago.
P:Notability is the on-point ikipedia:Policies and guidelines|&quot;PAG&quot; for deciding whether there's going to be a separate article about this subject, and the ability to find sources that represent &quot;mainstream POV&quot; or &quot;scientific POV&quot; is not one of its requirements.I have tried to change this, with very little success, but we're still working on even more basic things, such as &quot;if your neighbor writes two articles about your little gas station in his small-town newspaper, you still don't get a Wikipedia article&quot;.  The NPOV policy does not tell editors whether or not a subject has received enough attention to qualify for a separate article.  It only tells you what to write if you've decided to have one.  And it's probably important to note here that, for better or worse, NPOV says to write what's actually in the sources, not what skeptical editors believe to be The Scientific Truth about the subject.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:05, 25 March 2016 (UTC)

If all the treatment of a topic is &quot;in-universe&quot; then it doesn't have &quot;significant&quot; coverage in my view since it's not broken out from its information ghetto. That is why NPOV requires us to contextualize fringe views within the view of the &quot;wider world&quot;. If we don't have sources to do that, we cannot be neutral. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 16:49, 25 March 2016 (UTC)
* SIGCOV is all about the number of facts supported by any independent reliable source, including &quot;in-universe&quot; or &quot;drank the Kool-aid&quot; ones.  If you've got multiple independent sources that list enough facts to write ten or more decent sentences, then you've got &quot;significant coverage&quot;.  
* NPOV problems aren't a reason for deletion; that's a reason for editing.
* Your best bet is a straight-up P:Notability argument based on the nutshell's wording of &quot;attention from the world at large&quot;.  It's (unfortunately) not a very popular hook to hang deletion on, but it's an accurate description of what your complaint is.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 23:07, 25 March 2016 (UTC) 
There seems to be some idea that I've been arguing for deletion (I didn't vote to delete). What I am addressing is the application of NPOV policy to sourcing when writing the article. What we've had going on is editors removing definitions from Cochrane sources and using TCM sources instead. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 04:27, 26 March 2016 (UTC)



@|Alexbrn Per Whatamidoing, there's no reason to delete an article just because it might be controversial.  There's been plenty of sci commentary on acupuncture and no good reason to think scientists would think any differently about fire needling.  Any attempt to argue otherwise, and slant the article, would be cut off pretty quickly.  --ser:Middle 8|Middle 8 (ser talk:Middle 8|t • pecial:Contributions/Middle_8|c | ser:Middle_8/Privacy|privacy • ser:Middle_8/COI|COI) 04:06, 26 March 2016 (UTC)
&quot;Whatamidoing&quot; is not a policy, you may be surprised to learn. I wasn't talking about &quot;deleting the article&quot;. In the past however I have seen AfD's pass because the nature of the existing sourcing meant it would be impossible to construct a neutral article. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 04:23, 26 March 2016 (UTC)
Don't be disingenuous about my reference to Whatamidoing's arguments from PAG.  My point is that existing sci commentary of acu allows us to address its child topics neutrally. If an editor made a &quot;pro-woo&quot; argument that, based on NOR, we can't generalize scientific skepticism about acupuncture to fire needle acupuncture, I would reply that such a narrow reading of OR is fatuous, and I suspect you'd agree with me.
Additionally, it's mistaken to base coverage on degree of &quot;woo-ness&quot;.  Some &quot;woo's&quot; have been around a very long time and are widely known.  If we have adequate mainstream perspective on the mother topic, then we should usually be able to cover child topics neutrally.  --ser:Middle 8|Middle 8 (ser talk:Middle 8|t • pecial:Contributions/Middle_8|c | ser:Middle_8/Privacy|privacy • ser:Middle_8/COI|COI) 06:20, 26 March 2016 (UTC)
Yes, so long as we have mainstream sources for the fringe topic, whether it's a &quot;child topic&quot; of another fringe topic, or not. If your favoured woo is really &quot;widely known&quot; then it should be easy to find a source from the &quot;wider world&quot; discussing it. But we no more rely on manuals of fringe medical practices for descriptions of those practices, than we do on UFO books for accounts of aliens abuductions, or on esoteric texts for an account of what is located on the stral plane. Basically, Wikipedia is not a venue for the exposition of bollocks. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 06:38, 26 March 2016 (UTC)
No, you're wrong.  The threshold for WP:N is not a &quot;mainstream&quot; source.

I don't disagree, but I was never talking about P:N so how is that relevant? I am talking about what it is the article (per P:NPOV) once it exists. &quot;Child topics&quot; is your novel concept.  ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 07:37, 26 March 2016 (UTC)

I have never used the words &quot;sci commentary&quot;. I am just pointing out that NPOV requires us to use non-fringe sources to give a mainstream context, and that if that can't be done for any particular idea, then it is so fringe it needs to be omitted. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 08:59, 26 March 2016 (UTC)
Several points
*We have scientific commentary and other mainstream context coming out of our ears for cupuncture and raditional Chinese Medicine|TCM, as evidenced in those articles. We don't need to recap that in every child article.  Sci skepticism on fringe X extrapolates to variations on X (P:FRINGE/PS).
*There is no basis in PAG for the assertion that we need &quot;mainstream commentary&quot; on each and every such topic, as opposed to on a mother topic.  You've hung your argument on P:GEVAL, from NPOV, but you're taking it out of context.  (Referring to your post at 13:24, 25 March 2016.)  GEVAL says not to present fringe ideas as if on par with mainstream scholarship.  It's silent on what you are arguing re articles specifically about fringe topics.  
*You also misread P:FRIND above (18:29, 24 March 2016), as WhatamIdoing pointed out.  TCM textbooks are INDY sources, and while fringe and non-RS for biomedicine they are fine RS for TCM principles &amp; practices.
Your argument seems, in effect, like an attempted end run around WP:N to omit topics you dislike.  All based on your misreading of FRIND and GEVAL.  I'm feeling more like evalt.  --ser:Middle 8|Middle 8 (ser talk:Middle 8|t • pecial:Contributions/Middle_8|c | ser:Middle_8/Privacy|privacy • ser:Middle_8/COI|COI) 14:35, 26 March 2016 (UTC) add clarification 20:46, 26 March 2016 (UTC)

 MEDRS for &quot;controversy&quot; articles? 

I found myself reading ttention deficit hyperactivity disorder controversies|ADHD controversies earlier today. It's a mess and I've been trying to clean it up, but I'm getting a little stuck on what statements require MEDRS since it's a &quot;controversy&quot; article, for example, this statement: &quot;q|Some believe that many of the traits of those diagnosed with ADHD are personality traits and are not indicative of a disorder. These traits may be undesirable in modern society, leading to difficulty functioning in society, and thus have been labeled as a disorder.&quot;[http://www.adhdtexas.com/add-children-and-adults-personality-trait-or-disorder/] Is this a medical claim? The author is disagreeing the medical establishment's view of ADHD. Almost the whole article would be deleted if I removed every instance of non-MEDRS sources disagreeing with the medical establishment and that doesn't feel quite &quot;right.&quot; There probably is notable controversy that exists, but I don't know that it's supported by MEDRS. According to this [https://books.google.com/books?id=mRGr_B4Y1CEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=percent%20who%20consider%20ADHD%20controversial&amp;pg=PT107#v=onepage&amp;q=adhd%20controversial&amp;f=false source], the debate is mainly coming from parents and educators.

ser:Permstrump|Your instincts are exactly right.  Perhaps the most pointful reply is this:  That is not a biomedical claim.  Therefore, it is not subject to P:MEDRS.  
It should be relatively easy to find a much better source for this view than one doctor's self-published website.  A book from a generally reputable (including non-medical/non-scientific) publishing house should do nicely.

If care and good maintenance are absent, &quot;controversy&quot; articles can become dumping grounds for stuff not fit for the main article.  &quot;Controversy&quot; articles are really about social phenomena, and less so the best-quality accepted evidence.  However it takes work to avoid having them degrade into a collection of &quot;Some say...&quot; statements, which fail P:WEASEL and often P:GEVAL.  Individual self-published websites may be perfectly valid sources for the opinions cited but often yield P:UNDUE content.  Independent high-quality secondary sourcing is needed to identify the highest-impact outside opinions and voices.  ser:Zad68|Zadser_Talk:Zad68|68 13:24, 8 April 2016 (UTC)

 Please comment on my Individual Engagement Grant talk page about my proposal for Guided Checklist for Health Topic Experts 

Hello everyone,

I created a new Individual Engagement grant to try and fix a problem. :Grants:IdeaLab/Effective Engagement with Health Topic Experts using Guided Checklists

From my work with Cochrane as a Wikipedian in Residence and my observations of other attempts to engage health topic experts in editing, I've come to the conclusion that the quality of the contributions of new health topic expert recruits does not match their level of expertise and effort the we as Wikipedians put into training new medical editors. So, I decided to create a new project to develop a Guided Checklist that would assist a health topic expert in assessing the quality of a health articles on Wikipedia, and then guide their contributions toward making edits to correct the lack of quality. 

My individual engagement grant would involve interviewing health topic experts and active medical editors, as well as a community consultation on Wikipedia English WikiProject Med. Please add yourself as a volunteer if you would like to participate. Or leave suggestions on the talk page. Or endorse if you support the idea.

 opiramate could use some eyes 

I came across the topiramate article while going through the cluster fuck that is ddiction#Medication (still working on it - haven't committed my edits) and noticed the article claimed it was an effective treatment for methamphetamine addiction.  For context, as of right now, there is no effective treatment for a psychostimulant addiction - the relapse rate following conventional behavioral therapy is around 90% for an addiction to methamphetamine.  So when I saw this and looked at the ref - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3736141/pdf/nihms483167.pdf - I was a bit disturbed to find that not only is topiramate NOT effective, it EXACERBATES methamphetamine addiction by enhancing the drug's rewarding effects.  The same is true with nicotine per the same review, but the article still said it was used as an &quot;effective treatment&quot; for smoking cessation, citing a clinical trial.

 BallenaBlanca‎ and some gluten POV-pushing, in my view 
ile:Gluten Sources.png|thumb|Gluten Sources
In my view ser:BallenaBlanca‎ is steadily pushing content about gluten into articles across the medical space. There is a lot of faddishness around gluten these days, and I am concerned that BallenaBlanca's gluten-related editing is skewing our articles. 

Here are the top articles from BallenaBlanca's [https://tools.wmflabs.org/xtools-ec/?user=BallenaBlanca&amp;project=en.wikipedia.org edit count]:
* 135  on-celiac gluten sensitivity
* 108 luten-free diet
* 81 oeliac disease
* 45	luten
* 39	luten-related disorders
* 29	luten challenge test
* 22 ructose malabsorption
* edits to things like liadin, heat allergy, read, asta, lour, and see [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Torta_caprese&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=696027358 this edit note] on orta caprese....

There are also gluten-related edits to the following that would appear to be reasonably possibly related..
* rritable bowel syndrome

That is what it is and I am not going to wade into those for fear of what I will find.  What is bringing me here is BallenaBlanca's editing in other articles, where this editor is consistently making claims that gluten sensitivity may be co-occurring or &quot;may be&quot; causative and so a gluten-elimination diet may be helpful in all kinds of other conditions.

Some of it is kind of digestive/metabolic which one can kind of see how a digestive disorder like celiac could be related maybe... like :
* rthritis - [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arthritis&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=701412509&amp;oldid=700871851 here]
* steoporosis - see [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Osteoporosis&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=704916297&amp;oldid=704881389 here]

or clear immmune reaction like
* rticaria - see [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Urticaria&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=701743363&amp;oldid=701615219 here]

but a whole bunch of tooth stuff (?)
* uman tooth development - see [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Human_tooth_development&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=702579597 here]
* ental fluorosis - see [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dental_fluorosis&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=702770276 here]
* namel hypoplasia - see  [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Enamel_hypoplasia&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=702812317&amp;oldid=690495729 here]
* ental caries - [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dental_caries&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=708694561&amp;oldid=708415157 here]

But there is a whole slew of stuff that is really pushing it, in my view, like

fertility stuff:
* nfertility#Other_causes (see the  citations 34ff, especially with crazy long quotes)
* emale_infertility#Other_acquired_factors as above
* reterm birth as [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intrauterine_growth_restriction&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=697269325&amp;oldid=664058597 here]; i am concerned there may be some P:SELFCITE going on as well here. 

These are the ones that are really bothering me, however:
* pilepsy (perfect examples of it: In pilepsy#Acquired we find &quot;Some evidence links epilepsy and oeliac disease and on-celiac gluten sensitivity, while other evidence does not. There appears to be a specific syndrome which includes coeliac disease, epilepsy and calcifications in the brain. A 2012 review estimates that between 1% and 6% of people with epilepsy have CD while 1% of the general population has the condition.&quot; and in pilepsy#Diet we find:  &quot;In people with oeliac disease or on-celiac gluten sensitivity and occipital calcifications, a luten-free diet may improve seizures.&quot;)
* chizophrenia#Environment  - see : &quot;It has been hypothesised that in some people, development of schizophrenia is related to uman gastrointestinal tract|intestinal tract dysfunction such as seen with on-celiac gluten sensitivity or abnormalities in the ntestinal flora.  A subgroup of persons with schizophrenia present an immune response to luten, different from that found in people with oeliac disease|celiac, with elevated levels of certain serum biomarkers of gluten sensitivity such as nti-gliadin antibodies#Anti-gliadin IgG|anti-gliadin IgG or nti-gliadin antibodies#Anti-gliadin IgA|anti-gliadin IgA antibodies.&quot;
* hronic fatigue syndrome where BallenaBlanca‎ [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chronic_fatigue_syndrome&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=690329196&amp;oldid=690323148 tried to push] a bunch of content in, that got reduced down to a few words
* jögren's syndrome - see [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sj%C3%B6gren%27s_syndrome&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=705066024&amp;oldid=704708072 here]
* norexia nervosa - see [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anorexia_nervosa&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=707575472&amp;oldid=707557375 here]
* DHD - see [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=712204696&amp;oldid=712183985 here].  i got fed up and walked away.  
* ibromyalgia see [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fibromyalgia&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=713980785&amp;oldid=713952662 here] - this is the current dispute

To me this last set is really reaching into advocacy and POV pushing. 

There is other stuff BallenaBlanca does like [https://tools.wmflabs.org/sigma/usersearch.py?name=BallenaBlanca&amp;page=Varicocele&amp;max=500&amp;server=enwiki all these] on aricocele which are great and fighting off crazy people like [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=prev&amp;oldid=705497164 this reversion] of content that claimed that circumcision causes autism (lord knows those people never stop pushing).  

But the whole &quot;may or may not be co-morbid and a gluten-free diet may treat it&quot; stuff should stop already, in my view. Maybe folks here find the above to be just fine.  If so I will back off.   ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 00:16, 7 April 2016 (UTC)

First, I want to say that almost all information included in the articles mentioned by |Jytdog have prepared by me and reviewed by |Doc James. Most of the texts are the results of his corrections. I have worked with him in several pages, as for example on coeliac disease page [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Coeliac_disease#Update see all this sections] and I let myself always guided by his experience in Wikipedia. I am very happy to work with him and grateful for his help and kindness.

As I explained to |Jytdog, I'm trying to improve and update Medicine articles. I edit on issues in which I can be useful and in which I have knowledge. Regarding gluten intolerance, they were very outdated. The information I include is supported by current scientific evidence, is not a gluten hypotheses nor &quot;my point of view&quot;. I am not trying to give it prominence far beyond its place in the literature, I'm adjusting to the current knowledge. But it's not all I do. Currently I have 175 pages on my watchlist and I patrol them undoing vandalism, etc. Nevertheless, language limits me to do more work. Each of us contribute within our means. It is not incorrect.

I do not know how to say this without sounding bad. I apologize if it does not fit, I do not have enough level of English to express correctly that I want to say. People are surprised and shocked when we talk about the multiple affectations of CD, but it is only a problem of lack of information.

Some of these ones that are &quot;really bothering&quot; Jytdog (epilepsy, schizophrenia, anorexia nervosa, ADHD...) have been under discussion on the talk pages and reviewed by Doc James and other users. For example, schizophrenia: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Schizophrenia&amp;oldid=689919257#The_gut.E2.80.93brain_axis The gut–brain axis]

Jytdog is insistently saying to me things as &quot;imposing your view&quot;, &quot;promoting a minority view in the field&quot;, &quot;enthusiasm for the gluten hypotheses&quot;, &quot;advocacy&quot;, &quot; pet theories&quot; etc. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:BallenaBlanca#Medical_advocacy] [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:BallenaBlanca#Yet_more_UNDUE_on_gluten] and when I tried to be nice to him thanking one edition, this was his reaction: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABallenaBlanca&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=712239486&amp;oldid=711931636 I stopped watching the ADHD article because I find your POV-pushing to be reprehensible and I do not want to edit anywhere near you in Wikipedia. In my view you are harming Wikipedia with your advocacy but I am not going to waste my time arguing with you. Your &quot;thanks&quot; was very unwelcome.] ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 22:37, 27 March 2016 (UTC), and after, he removed this message [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:BallenaBlanca&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=712239486]

But this is not a &quot;minority view&quot;, nor a &quot;gluten hypothesis&quot; nor &quot;my view&quot;, nor a &quot;pet theory&quot;... Is the current knwoledge about gluten-related disorders:

alkquote|Associated autoimmune diseases. The abnormal immunological response elicited by gluten-derived proteins can lead to the production of several different autoantibodies, which affect different systems. The most prominent autoantibodies target members of the TG family, notably IgA-class antibodies against TG2 in coeliac disease,29 TG2 and TG3 in dermatitis herpetiformis and TG6 in gluten ataxia.29–31 The levels of these antibodies are influenced by the gluten intake of patients with coeliac disease.32,33 Antibodies against coagulation factor XIII, another member of the TG family, have also been described.34 Whether this finding implicates an underlying autoimmune aspect of bleeding disorders is unclear. Antibodies to a range of other autoantigens have been reported, particularly actin, calreticulin, gangliosides, collagens, synapsin, zonulin, cardiolipin, ATP synthase subunit β and enolase.35 Interestingly, autoantibodies typically seen in general autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematous are rarely seen in coeliac disease.35 A number of organ-specific autoimmune disorders and conditions are influenced by and associated with coeliac disease (Figure 1), but only a selection is discussed in this Review.3,36,37 Moreover, accurate, unbiased population-based data on disease prevalence are generally lacking and the published results are mainly derived from studies performed on patients who have been referred to secondary or tertiary care.

The list of possible extra-intestinal manifestations of untreated CD is immense. For example [http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/digestive-diseases/celiac-disease/Pages/facts.aspx#dermatitis National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), part of the National Institutes of Health. Celiac Disease]: 

What are the signs and symptoms of celiac disease?
A person may experience digestive signs and symptoms, or symptoms in other parts of the body. Digestive signs and symptoms are more common in children and can include
•	abdominal bloating
•	chronic diarrhea
•	constipation
•	gas
•	pale, foul-smelling, or fatty stool
•	stomach pain
•	nausea
•	vomiting
Being unable to absorb nutrients during the years when nutrition is critical to a child's normal growth and development can lead to other health problems, such as
•	failure to thrive in infants
•	slowed growth and short stature
•	weight loss
•	irritability or change in mood
•	delayed puberty
•	dental enamel defects of permanent teeth
Adults are less likely to have digestive signs and symptoms and may instead have one or more of the following:
•	anemia
•	bone or joint pain
•	canker sores inside the mouth
•	depression or anxiety
•	dermatitis herpetiformis, an itchy, blistering skin rash
•	fatigue, or feeling tired
•	infertility or recurrent miscarriage
•	missed menstrual periods
•	seizures
•	tingling numbness in the hands and feet
•	weak and brittle bones, or osteoporosis
•	headaches
Intestinal inflammation can cause other symptoms, such as
•	feeling tired for long periods of time
•	abdominal pain and bloating
•	ulcers
•	blockages in the intestine
Celiac disease can produce an autoimmune reaction, or a self-directed immune reaction, in which a person's immune system attacks healthy cells in the body. This reaction can spread outside of the gastrointestinal tract to affect other areas of the body, including the
•	spleen
•	skin
•	nervous system
•	bones
•	joints
Recognizing celiac disease can be difficult because some of its symptoms are similar to those of other diseases and conditions. :Celiac disease can be confused with
•	irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
•	iron-deficiency anemia caused by menstrual blood loss
•	lactose intolerance
•	inflammatory bowel disease
•	diverticulitis
•	intestinal infections
•	chronic fatigue syndrome
As a result, celiac disease has long been underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed. As health care providers become more aware of the many varied symptoms of the disease and reliable blood tests become more available, diagnosis rates are increasing, particularly for adults.

And since 2010, non-celiac gluten sensitivity has been included in the spectrum of gluten-related disorders. The definition and diagnostic criteria of non-celiac gluten sensitivity was debated and established by three consensus conferences.

alkquote|As understanding of CD has advanced, new disease associations have been regularly found and populations tested for CD have changed in response.(...) This review was based on PubMed literature searches and expert meetings. We aimed to define key concepts relevant to CD and related disorders. The character of the current paper implies that we did not pool any data or use any statistical tools. Instead, we assembled an international team of recognised experts in CD research, discussed definitions and tried to reach a consensus. This approach is similar to that of previous papers on definitions of CD.2e4 As opposed to previous studies,2e4 however, we did not limit ourselves to ‘CD only’ but defined a large number of concepts. In addition, we provide guidance to the scientific and clinical community as to which terms should be used and which should be abandoned. Overall, we evaluated more than 300 papers in detail and all authors participated in the discussion leading to consensus definitions. (...) Our research team was multidisciplinary and was composed of specialists from gastroenterology, pathology, paediatrics, neurology and dermatology. (...) Gluten-related disorders. Gluten-related disorders is a term used to describe all conditions related to gluten. We recommend that this term is used to describe all conditions related to gluten. This may include disorders such as gluten ataxia, DH, non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) and CD (...) Non-coeliac gluten sensitivity. The term NCGS relates to one or more of a variety of immunological, morphological or symptomatic manifestations that are precipitated by the ingestion of gluten in people in whom CD has been excluded. NCGS is a condition in which gluten ingestion leads to morphological or symptomatic manifestations despite the absence of CD.172e176 As opposed to CD, NCGS may show signs of an activated innate immune response but without the enteropathy, elevations in tTG, EMA or DGP antibodies, and increased mucosal permeability characteristic of CD.173 Recently, in a double-blind randomised trial, Biesiekierski et al showed that patients with NCGS truly develop symptoms when eating gluten.156 It is unclear at this time what components of grains trigger symptoms in people with NCGS and whether some populations of patients with NCGS have subtle small intestinal morphological changes. While there is currently no standard diagnostic approach to NCGS, systematic evaluation should be conducted, including exclusion of CD and other inflammatory disorders.

How can someone learn if does not read? It is good to read, there is much to read about celiac to understand the disease and update knowledge.

Actually, from the lists above, it looks like celiac disease can be simplified quite dramatically.  The lists of &quot;signs and symptoms&quot; appears to be nothing more than a typical list of the manifestations of malnutrition.  
My concern isn't whether this is The Truth™.  My concern with this is that it's not P:DUE.  For example, I've finally remembered to go back to nflammatory bowel disease and remove the instructions on how to diagnose rritable bowel syndrome as well as celiac disease.  It might be true, but the fact is that it's irrelevant to that page.  If you want to know about how to diagnose IBS or CD, then you should not be reading the page about IBD.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 06:16, 7 April 2016 (UTC)
I suppose my worry is that while, say, the NHS says (this year) that apart from for people with oeliac disease, there is no evidence a gluten-free diet has any benefit and that it may cause harm,[http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Allergies/Pages/Foodallergy.aspx] Wikipiedia is, in contrast, and for a range of medical conditions, now saying that gluten might be a root cause. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 06:44, 7 April 2016 (UTC)

I have helped edit details on oeliac disease and some of the other gluten-related issues. I may be considered an expert on this in real life so I am careful not to push my POV. Coeliac disease is still 70-80% unrecognised (the &quot;iceberg&quot;) because symptoms often are mild.  |BallenaBlanca has brought a new enthusiasm to update these pages and should be congratulated for her efforts.  NCGS (and other related problems) is clearly recognised condition by experts as BB in her characteristic style points out yet again above.  
However, like IBS or fibromyalgia, there are many other factors contributing to this picture and it is crucial to have P:balance and to adhere to P:MEDRS and not have P:UNDUE weight.  BB needs to be more careful how she expresses this balance (I guess English may not be her first language).  I think only excellent sources such as Systematic review and Guidelines in high impact journals should be cited and that we need to be careful not to pull out isolated quotations from parts of the text that have some balance elsewhere and to overload the article with multiple citations. This is particularly important in the articles that are more remote from the core issues of gluten-sensitivity and a gluten-free diet such as epilepsy, schizophrenia, anorexia nervosa, ADHD etc which UK NICE did not include (mostly) in their recent 2015 review [https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng20/chapter/Recommendations#referral-of-people-with-suspected-coeliac-disease]. This should be the standard of &quot;accepted knowledge&quot; at present.  Some sharp and incisive editing, as |jytdog is so expert at, will help! ser:Jrfw51|Jrfw51 (ser talk:Jrfw51|talk)

Thank you very much, |Jrfw51, you are very kind and balanced. Yes, I have started editing to update Wikipedia articles, because there was information as &quot;wonderful&quot; as this: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pasta&amp;oldid=694160530#Ingredients In modern times to meet the demands of coeliac sufferers and similar diets, the use of rice, maize and whole durum wheat has become commercially significant]. It was present without anyone touching it from 24 March 2012 until may revision on 14 December 2015. This is only a little example of harmful and/or outdated information on Wikipedia.

|WhatamIdoing, you said: The lists of &quot;signs and symptoms&quot; appears to be nothing more than a typical list of the manifestations of malnutrition.  mmmm... I think clearer I can not write. Possibly you have not read this written above:

[http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/digestive-diseases/celiac-disease/Pages/facts.aspx#dermatitis National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), part of the National Institutes of Health. Celiac Disease]: &quot;Celiac disease can produce an autoimmune reaction, or a self-directed immune reaction, in which a person's immune system attacks healthy cells in the body. This reaction can spread outside of the gastrointestinal tract to affect other areas of the body, including the • spleen • skin • nervous system • bones • joints&quot; 

[http://www.espghan.org/fileadmin/user_upload/guidelines_pdf/Guidelines_2404/European_Society_for_Pediatric_Gastroenterology_.28__1_.pdf European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition Guidelines for the Diagnosis of Coeliac Disease]: &quot;ESPGHAN  guidelines  for  the  diagnosis  of  CD  were  last published  in  1990  (1)  and  at  that  time  represented  a  significant improvement in both the diagnosis and management of CD. Since 1990, the understanding of the pathological processes of CD has increased enormously, leading to a change in the clinical paradigm of CD from a chronic, gluten-dependent enteropathy of childhood to a systemic disease with chronic immune features affecting different organ  systems&quot;

Another source, [http://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085%2806%2902227-X/fulltext American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Technical Review on the Diagnosis and Management of Celiac Disease]: &quot;Celiac disease appears to be more prevalent in several autoimmune disorders than in the general population. Additionally, some evidence suggests that the longer the exposure to gluten, the higher the risk of autoimmune disorders in patients with celiac disease.&quot;

(and there is a long list of autoimmune diseases caused by and/or associated with celiac disease, which may affect any organ or tissue of the body, many of them I was written above...)

|Alexbrn, NCGS is recognized since 2010 (Oslo definitions). For example, it is included on differential diagnosis of CD on [http://www.bsg.org.uk/images/stories/docs/clinical/guidelines/sbn/bsg_coeliac_14.pdf Diagnosis and management of adult coeliac disease: guidelines from the British Society of Gastroenterology (table 2, page 4)] Doubts about NCGS are not if it exists or not exists, are its pathophysiology: if is caused by gluten or also other proteins (ATIs, amylase trypsin inhibitors) and FODMAPS present in gluten-containing cereals. And because there is no diagnostic tests for the moment. Anyway, this situation does not differ much from that of many other diseases, as for example IBS.

The systemic nature of CD, which can affect any organ or tissue of the body, is the most important issue on which progress has been made,([http://www.espghan.org/fileadmin/user_upload/guidelines_pdf/Guidelines_2404/European_Society_for_Pediatric_Gastroenterology_.28__1_.pdf e.g. ESPGHAN  guidelines]) after years of hard work of worldwide specialists in the field. It should not be allowed losing on what has been achieved, it's too important! It is very difficult to move forward and expand knowledge. If you look at the dates of the guidelines mentioned above, you'll see that they are published for many years and nevertheless, currently the lack of knowledge has not been corrected. We should not put us even more barriers.

BB, I realize that &quot;true&quot; celiac is an autoimmune disease, and that any autoimmune disease can have secondary effects (AFAICT, all of them do, in at least some patients).  I'm looking at this list:
* failure to thrive in infants – The first question there is whether the baby is being fed enough calories, not whether the baby is being exposed to gluten through breastmilk or (gluten-free) infant formula.
* slowed growth and hort stature – Classic sign of under-nutrition, seen among poor families over the world
* weight loss – Classic sign of recent-onset under-nutrition
* irritability or change in mood – Such a on-specific symptom that it's worthless.  It appears in all forms of malnutrition.  Poor sleep, intestinal parasites, and abuse are (many times) more likely than celiac disease. 
* delayed puberty – Classic sign of under-nutrition
* dental enamel defects of permanent teeth – Classic sign of under-nutrition.  Also acid reflux.
The adult list is similar:
*  anemia – Dietary deficiency of iron, vitamins, and/or protein.
*  bone or joint pain – Another on-specific symptom that appears in every type of malnutrition (even over-nutrition, as any obese person with bad knees can tell you).
*  canker sores inside the mouth – Classic sign of curvy; can be caused by ematinic|malnutrition that results in anemia.
*  depression or anxiety – Another on-specific symptom that appears in under-nutrition (even temporary:  think about how many grumpy dieters you know).
*  dermatitis herpetiformis, an itchy, blistering skin rash – 
*  fatigue, or feeling tired –Another on-specific symptom that appears in under-nutrition; typical result of anemia (regardless of the cause of the anemia).
*  infertility or recurrent miscarriage – Classic (and evolutionarily sound) sign of under-nutrition.
*  missed menstrual periods  – Classic sign of under-nutrition, e.g., due to norexia nervosa.
*  seizures – Known to be caused by severe general malnutrition, especially if it results in low levels of Magnesium; a poorly planned gluten-free/corn-based diet increases the risk of seizures (MID|8641237).
*  tingling numbness in the hands and feet – Typical of 12 deficiency (also poorly controlled diabetes)
*  weak and brittle bones, or osteoporosis – Long-term result of under-nutrition, especially malabsorption of vitamins and minerals.
*  headaches – Common result of anemia.
And as you can see, every single one of them is associated with malnutrition, and in no case is celiac disease the most likely cause of that malnutrition.  This is why I say that it's quite simple:  If you have untreated celiac disease (=not &quot;a predisposition to&quot; or &quot;a subclinical, symptom-free case of&quot;), then you will have symptoms of malnutrition.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 15:28, 7 April 2016 (UTC)

* I looked through a bunch of the CD-related edits and followed them through to the sourcing.  And in pretty much the order |Jytdog presented them, my concern moves from low to high.  Many edits adding CD-related content seem fine, citing sources that look good and authoritative and not adding undue weight--many of those edits are just adding one more item to an existing list, or adding one content sentence.  The list Jyt provides at the bottom do look more concerning.

Thank you very much for your extensive explanation, |WhatamIdoing, now I understand your confusion!
No, no, it is not as easy, not explained by simple malabsorption. This is the main problem in understanding CD: still in the minds of most people that the cause of the symptoms is malabsorption, but malabsorption occurs only in a minority of patients. Also, when we talk about symptoms, we must be clear that not all occur in all patients, the range is very wide. Not all children have growth delayed or short stature, it occurs only in a minority of them (and it is not only caused by malabsorption), not all have anaemia (nor anaemia is only explained by malabsorPtion), etc. For example, dental enamel defects might be the only clinical manifestation of coeliac disease, in absence of any other symptom. Defects in dental enamel occur when coeliac disease affects children during dental development; generally before they are 7 years of age. The aetiology is multifactorial owing to immune mediated damage and nutritional disturbances. Recently, some authors suggest the existence of an autoimmune process, with antiesmalte antibodies.
As we see in the WGO guidelines [http://journals.lww.com/jcge/Fulltext/2013/02000/World_Gastroenterology_Organisation_Global.9.aspx World Gastroenterology Organisation Global Guidelines on Celiac Disease] &quot;Many patients with CD have few symptoms or present atypically, whereas a minority of patients have malabsorption (classical CD).&quot; &quot;Atypically&quot; means with mild or absent gastrointestinal symptoms and extraintestinal manifestations unrelated to malabsorption but mainly with autoimmune or inflammatory processes. 

Let's take a look at this table, which contains the main extraintestinal manifestations of CD and their pathophysiology (ature Reviews Gastroenterology &amp; Hepatology , 2015), without forget that there are also a large number of associated autoimmune diseases and other complications resulting from lack of treatment, such as cancers of various types (intestinal and extraintestinal):

MID|19394538 We can read: Autoimmune and immune-mediated diseases often reported in association with coeliac disease are type 1 diabetes, autoimmune hyroiditis, autoimmune myocarditis, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, Sjogren’s syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune hepatitis, autoimmune cholangitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, IgA deficiency, Addison’s disease, IgA mesangial nephropathy, alopecia areata, neurological abnormalities, atopy, inflammatory bowel disease, systemic and cutaneous vasculitis, psoriasis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and polymyositis. A wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders such as ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, epilepsy (mainly with occipital calcifi cations), headache, dementia, depression, autism, and schizophrenia has been reported in association with coeliac disease.82 However, pathology studies and diet trials have not confirmed the existence of a link between autism and schizophrenia and coeliac disease. Furthermore, women with coeliac disease more frequently experience recurrent spontaneous miscarriage, delayed menarche, early menopause, and amenorrhoea. Fertility problems and loss of libido can also be present in male patients.83

The fact that these symptoms could be explained by other causes does not automatically mean that they cannot all be explained through malnutrition (=a bigger subject than malabsorption, by the way). 
Furthermore, I think you are tending to somewhat over-state and over-emphasize the current state of evidence regarding the &quot;associated&quot; autoimmune diseases.  The fact that two autoimmune diseases co-occur does not mean that celiac caused the other one, or that treating celiac will solve the other.  
For that matter, if someone goes on a gluten-free diet and feels better, that doesn't mean that avoiding gluten had anything to do with it.  Quite a few people go from a diet of gluten-filled beer and junk food to a carefully planned, vegetable-oriented, gluten-free diet.  If you feel better on a diet that has more vegetables and lean protein, and no cakes or deep-fried foods, then that could mean that your blood sugar is happier with the removal of sugary food, or that your liver and gall bladder are happier with the removal of fatty foods, or that your intestines like the fiber – or even that the placebo effect, or egression to the mean, or the desire to find some benefit that justified all of that effort, is keeping you from discovering whether you are actually sensitive to gluten.  These effects probably explain why various studies show that 65% to 85% of people who claim to have gluten problems have no problems when they start eating gluten or wheat again.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 01:45, 8 April 2016 (UTC)

They suggest that &quot;non-celiac wheat sensitivity&quot; is a more appropriate term, without forgetting  that other gluten-containing cereals are implicated in the development of symptoms: &quot;One of the most controversial and highly debated discussions concerns the role of gluten in causing NCGS (...) there is growing evidence that other proteins that are unique to gluten-containing cereals can elicit an innate immune response that leads to NCGS, raising a nomenclature issue. For this reason, wheat sensitivity, rather than gluten sensitivity, seems to be a more appropriate term, keeping in mind that other gluten-containing grains such as barley and rye also can trigger the symptoms.&quot;ite journal|vauthors=Fasano A, Sapone A, Zevallos V, Schuppan D| title=Nonceliac gluten sensitivity|journal=Gastroenterology|volume=148| issue=6| pages=1195–204| date=May 2015| pmid=25583468|doi=10.1053/j.gastro.2014.12.049|type=Reviewite journal|vauthors=Schuppan D, Pickert G, Ashfaq-Khan M, Zevallos V|title=Non-celiac wheat sensitivity: differential diagnosis, triggers and implications|journal=Best Pract Res Clin Gastroenterol|volume=29| issue=3| pages=469–76| date=Jun 2015| pmid=26060111|doi=10.1016/j.bpg.2015.04.002|type=Review

I've been watching BallenaBlanca's for awhile now without saying much, but that coupled with the comments above show textbook P:ADVOCACY on the subject of gluten. At quick glance, it looks like we're dealing with an P:SPA in that regard too as everything comes back to controversial topics on gluten or wheat. I think the writing has been on the wall for awhile that a topic-ban would likely be needed. The comments here seem to be indicate a lack of recognition of why their behavior (even if it's civil POV-pushing) is problematic and violating policy. 

Editors at other venues typically don't have the background needed for ferreting out advocacy within subject matter. Probably best for this community to establish we've got an advocacy problem on this board first before ANI or considering how admin discretionary sanctions may apply. ser:Kingofaces43|Kingofaces43 (ser talk:Kingofaces43|talk) 18:40, 8 April 2016 (UTC)

Thanks, |Kingofaces43. I work not only on this issue, I do what I can to contribute to general Wikipedia project, but language limits me. I always thought I was working well, because I do in collaboration with other users. Editing on gastroenterology issues, autoimmune disease and other ones related with gluten-related disorders is not like editing only on art, or literature, or cooking...? What is the difference? Each one of us work in what dominates. And I have no trouble following all these advices, I will consider what other users tell me, I've been doing it so far.
Sorry, but I do not understand what means ANI.

* on-celiac gluten sensitivity does show the issues here pretty well. Our article treats this as a mostly very well-defined thing, despite a nod to some controversy in the lead. The diagnostic section is way too definitive in parts, as I noted on its talk page alk:Non-celiac_gluten_sensitivity#Too_definitive|here and voices concerned about how this diagnosis is made and deployed are pretty much excluded, and there is no content about the hyping of this condition in the media.  I would ask folks here to glance at the Talk page of that article, where you see the kinds of walls of text that I have been talking about. We keep ending up with flawed content about gluten like what is in this article, as a result of compromising with BB, who continues to advocate relentlessly (in a civil manner, but relentlessly).

* ser|Jytdog, I looked at a few of your diffs at the top and didn't see the issues. Please be extremely specific and provide specific quotes of issues. I must say, however, that I find your (as well as ser|Alexbrn) tone distressingly hostile at times. As you may be aware, the number of editors remains in a long-term decline and Wikipedia is infamous for its unpleasant vibes. It's also respectful to not speak in terms of black and white when you are talking about things that are rather gray, such as approaches to how detailed we can be in describing facts. In these cases, it seems mostly these facts are broadly covered in review articles.... ser:ImperfectlyInformed|II | (ser_talk:ImperfectlyInformed|t - pecial:Contributions/ImperfectlyInformed|c) 05:28, 9 April 2016 (UTC)
 &quot;gray&quot; is what is wanted: the problem is heavily leaning on sources with one kind of POV while dismissing other sources (or parts of the sources used) which complicate that. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 06:07, 9 April 2016 (UTC)
Well, yes, but it's perhaps not very surprising that a gastroenterologist, who presumably deals with people who are truly sick (rather than friends or neighbors who decide to go gluten-free because of what they heard on the television last week), has more definite ideas about this subject than a couple of lay Wikipedia editors.  For example, it's important for a specialist to know how fallible some medical tests are:  a clean mammogram does not definitely rule out breast cancer, and a positive food allergy test result in adults probably doesn't indicate an actual food allergy.  Most people in low-risk groups who test positive for HIV on a single test do not have HIV.  Maybe instead of talking about POV pushing, we should start looking for information about the egative predictive value for gluten-related tests – or talking about whether something is too detailed for an encyclopedic summary.  Whether it's P:The Truth (at least in a minority of cases) might not be the most productive approach.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 06:15, 10 April 2016 (UTC)

|BallenaBlanca, it seems to me you've done a great job finding sources on gluten's relation to X, Y, Z (etc.) conditions -- that's the first part.  The second part, to address P:WEIGHT issues, is this:  find sources reviewing the factors involved in the etiology and pathology of X, Y and Z conditions and see to what degree those sources mention gluten as a factor.  Then weight the discussion of gluten in X, Y &amp; Z articles accordingly.  Does that make sense?  BTW, it's paradoxical but true that on WP noticeboards, the less one says (and the less one repeats one's self), the more persuasive one is.  To communicate more effectively here, I suggest this: try to summarize as briefly as possible here, then wikilink to longer discussions on particular talk pages.

The usual setup is a scheduled video chat via Google Hangout on Air (or maybe Skype?) for 30 to 60 minutes, in English.  To run the visual editor, you'll need to have a reasonably modern web browser (&gt;95% of you already do) and to have Javascript turned on.  

I think that they're hoping to find about a dozen editors for this.  The responses from editors in small studies like these have a significant effect on the product direction.  If anyone's interested, please let me know.  ser:Whatamidoing (WMF)|Whatamidoing (WMF) (ser talk:Whatamidoing (WMF)|talk) 17:13, 12 April 2016 (UTC)

 PDT: Activated Cancer Therapy as an Alternative Cancer Treatment 

What should be done with this new article?  Aside from the obvious problems of unencyclopedic tone, etc., it seems to overlap in content with onodynamic therapy and hotodynamic therapy.  Is there anything worth keeping and/or merging into one of those articles?  ser:Deli nk|Deli nk (ser talk:Deli nk|talk) 14:43, 14 April 2016 (UTC)

It looks like some of the content has been blanked, and very little of what's left is actually P:Biomedical information.  MEDRS doesn't apply to non-biomedical information (e.g., the name of the guy who invented it, which is BLP; the various names it's been marketed under, which requires the same kinds of sources you'd use for any business product; etc.).  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 02:41, 30 March 2016 (UTC)

&quot;Because of lack of evidence of efficacy,[not in citation given][unreliable medical source?] KST is considered experimental by insurers who cover other chiropractic techniques.[4][3][5]&quot;

The part &quot;Because of lack of evidence of efficacy,[unreliable medical source?] requires a MEDRS source. ser:QuackGuru|QuackGuru (ser talk:QuackGuru|talk) 17:11, 30 March 2016 (UTC)
No, it doesn't.  First of all, if this is really P:FRINGE, then any source that's equal or better than the promoters' website is good enough.  Secondly, this isn't a biomedical statement (read the whole sentence); it's a business statement about which excuse the insurance companies are giving for refusing to pay for it.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 03:36, 31 March 2016 (UTC)
 ser:WhatamIdoing|WAID fwiw i kind of like the use of insurance company evaluations for alt med topics.  insurance companies have a strong financial interest in only paying for stuff that works (their money is on the line) and they often review interventions where there are few or no reviews in the biomedical literature nor statements by major health authorities.  So in the absence of those two kinds of high quality sources, insurance company evaluations are, in my view, useful for P:INDY|independent discussion of the intervention.  [http://www.aetna.com/cpb/medical/data/100_199/0107.html The Aetna source] has two separate statements.  One is the overall evaluation: &quot;Aetna considers the following chiropractic procedures experimental and investigational&quot; and heads a list.  The other is specific and provides an independent description (pretty neutral, as they have no desire to additionally upset people) and then their evaluation: &quot;The Koren Specific Technique (KST) appears to be a new system of analysis in chiropractic.  With the KST method, the adjustment is generally made with an instrument called the &quot;Arthrostim&quot; although finger pressure can also be used.  The KST allegedly opens up a new horizon on the analysis and correction of health problems by accessing the binary information of the holographic body, which supposedly enables a trained practitioner to access information about a patient's physiology that otherwise would not be available. http://www.headbacktohealth.com/Koren_Specific_Technique.html.  However, there is a lack of evidence regarding the effectiveness of this approach.&quot;   I think that is a very useful source and as I said this is what I generally find, when there are not better independent sources. ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 03:47, 31 March 2016 (UTC)
Within reasonable limits, I tend to agree with you.  In particular, I think it's a reasonable source for &quot;not covered, due to experimental status/no evidence&quot;.  I doubt that I'd accept &quot;this insurance company pays for it, so there must be good evidence&quot;.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 19:10, 31 March 2016 (UTC)

 Sadly PLOS can't use material from Wikipedia, ironically because they use a less restrictive licence (CC-BY) than we do (CC-BY-SA). I did some work with them when they set up a wiki and I ran into lots of problems when I couldn't import templates, etc. from here. At some point WPMED editors may want to consider retrospectively licensing all of our Wikipedia contributions under the least restrictive licence that's in common use, with the aim of making our medical content as freely available as possible. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 21:40, 18 April 2016 (UTC)
PLOS Medicine has indicated that they may be willing to go with CC BY SA on specific articles. But yes that is indeed one of the barriers. ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk · pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 10:53, 19 April 2016 (UTC)</segment>
