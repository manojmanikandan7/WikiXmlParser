 Review AI-generated articles 

Hi there! While reviewing at AfC, I recently came across several AI-generated medical articles, some of which are still in draftspace and some of which have been accepted and moved to mainspace. These articles do not immediately come across as AI-generated, but when run through [https://wikipedia.gptzero.me/ Wikipedia GPTzero], they have high AI-generation scores. 
* -Aminoadipic-2-oxoadipic aciduria
* lpha-2-plasmin inhibitor deficiency
* osma arhinia microphthalmia syndrome
* ile acid synthesis disorders
* raft:Colchicine poisoning
* raft:Al-Kaissi Syndrome
I would really appreciate it someone over here could help go through the articles to ensure accuracy. Thank you! ser:Significa liberdade|Significa liberdade (she/her) (ser talk:Significa liberdade|talk) 16:42, 22 December 2024 (UTC)

@ser:Significa liberdade|Significa liberdade, I looked at ile acid synthesis disorders.  It was created in multiple edits over the space of several hours.  All the refs are real.  (I know nothing about the subject matter.)  Do you have any reason except for the tool to believe that this is LLM content?  
I am suspicious of &quot;detector&quot; tools, because they ikipedia talk:Large language models/Archive 5#c-WhatamIdoing-20230702084600-Talpedia-20230702082600|sometimes declare content that I wrote to be generated by an LLM. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 22:55, 22 December 2024 (UTC)
Hi, ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing! I ran it through [https://wikipedia.gptzero.me/ Wikipedia GPTzero]. That particular article shows a 99.8% AI-generation score. ser:Significa liberdade|Significa liberdade (she/her) (ser talk:Significa liberdade|talk) 03:01, 23 December 2024 (UTC)
@ser:Significa liberdade|Significa liberdade, I ran some of [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bile_acid_synthesis_disorders&amp;oldid=1262854169 the early revisions] through the same tool, and it said human: 0.983, ai: 0.017, and mixed: 0.0.  Try putting [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bile_acid_synthesis_disorders&amp;oldid=1264325631 the version just before your own edits] in the tool and see what you get. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 05:48, 23 December 2024 (UTC)
ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing: Interesting... I'll have to bring this up to the individual who created the tool. I initially ran the edit before mine through the tool, and it told me 90-100% AI-generated. ser:Significa liberdade|Significa liberdade (she/her) (ser talk:Significa liberdade|talk) 01:15, 24 December 2024 (UTC)
Although the tool may be wrong, I do find it telling that when I ask ChatGPT to write a Wikipedia article about Bile acid synthesis disorders, it basically writes the exact article currently published. 
Chat's lead reads, &quot;Bile acid synthesis disorders (BASDs) are a group of rare, inherited metabolic conditions caused by defects in the enzymes involved in the production of bile acids. Bile acids are essential for the digestion and absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins, as well as for the regulation of cholesterol levels. BASDs can lead to a variety of symptoms, including liver dysfunction, malabsorption, and developmental delays.&quot; 
Aside from a few slight wording adjustments, this is exactly what is written in the article. The classification section is the same way. The other sections have similar starts. Chat's sections are just about a sentence each, so it's quite possible each section was started and then asked something along the lines of &quot;Could you expand on that&quot;? When I asked GPT to expand on classification, it started adding similar information as to what is in the article. ser:Significa liberdade|Significa liberdade (she/her) (ser talk:Significa liberdade|talk) 01:26, 24 December 2024 (UTC)

 New drug names 

Lists of new generic drug names under consideration or recommended as nternational Nonproprietary Names can be found at https://www.who.int/teams/health-product-and-policy-standards/inn/inn-lists Similarly, drug names under consideration as nited States Adopted Names can be seen at https://www.ama-assn.org/about/united-states-adopted-names/usan-drug-names-under-consideration In the case of some new drugs, there may not be enough published information to allow an article to be written, but for others, creating an article may be possible. ser:Eastmain|Eastmain (ser talk:Eastmain|talk • pecial:Contributions/Eastmain|contribs) 00:12, 27 December 2024 (UTC)

@ser:Eastmain|Eastmain, in my experience, by the time a drug candidate has reached Phase 3 clinical trials, there's plenty of sources for it, and there are frequently enough sources by Phase 2. One of the challenges has been figuring out which names are the same.  We'll find a paper about &quot;ABC-1234&quot;, and then the little biotech company gets bought, and it becomes &quot;BIG-1234&quot;, and then it gets a brand name and a generic name, and now we have to search under multiple names.
For example, the first one in [https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/inn-rl-92 the recent Recommended list] is https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Abenacianine, aka abenacianinum, aka VGT-309.[https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/other/vergent-concludes-enrolment-for-lung-cancer-study-of-vgt-309/ar-AA1u5LQQ]  Wikipedia should have an article on benacianinum, or at least an article on ergent Bioscience with redirects from all the names.  Since the biomedical sources for pre-approval drugs tend to be ikipedia:MEDPRI|primary, and almost always affiliated with the company ([https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38823756/ one example for this drug]), the Wikipedia articles are often written more from the &quot;business&quot; than the &quot;medical&quot; side:  They had these activities, they got this much money invested.
Just collecting all the names into a list could be helpful.  I wonder if you'd like to talk to ikipedia talk:WikiProject Pharmacology about this, as they are more specialized. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 01:37, 28 December 2024 (UTC)
eply to|Eastmain Thanks sir. I am working on these suggestions. I will get back to you again, if I have any problems. I am overwhelmed at the amount of help I am getting from completely unknown persons. The only common thread between all of us appears to be &quot;love of knowledge&quot;, and a &quot;genuine desire to contribute&quot;. Thank you sir once again. ser:Neotaruntius|Neotaruntius (ser talk:Neotaruntius|talk) 06:35, 28 December 2024 (UTC)
I'm &quot;ma'am&quot;, rather than sir, though most of the regulars on this page are men.  
You have given me a good excuse to remind everyone how to find out.  First, if you go to pecial:Preferences#mw-prefsection-personal-i18n then you can set your own gender.  Remember that changing your prefs requires ticking/unticking the box plus scrolling down to click the blue Save button.  (Actually changing your settings is optional, but I've done it, and if you look at the page, then the next step will make a little more sense.  Whatever you choose for gender settings will be publicly visible.)
Second, go to pecial:Preferences#mw-prefsection-gadgets-gadget-section-browsing and find &quot;Navigation Popups&quot;.  This replaces the usual box when you hover over a link with a more feature-filled one.  If you turn on P:NAVPOPS and ►reload this page (don't just use the back button on your browser for the first try), then when you hover over anyone's user name, you'll see the person's gender (if any is set in preferences; blank is the default of ingular they), user rights/whether they're an admin, how long they've been editing, and how many edits they've made total.  
There are other ways to find out this pref setting, but I usually find that this one is the most convenient for me. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 23:03, 30 December 2024 (UTC)
 Good catch WAID.  I missed that benacianine is the same as GT-309.  Abenacianine is the English INN, abenacianinum is Latin, and Wikipedia drug articles should be named after the English INN. I renamed VGT-309 as Abenacianine and added VGT-309 as a synonym to the drug infobox.  ser:Boghog|Boghog (ser talk:Boghog|talk) 10:50, 29 December 2024 (UTC)

Does WP:MEDRS apply for pet studies?

See talk-page discussion at egetarian and vegan dog diet, a user added a trial and it was removed by another editor. My understanding is that MEDRS does also apply for biomedical claims made about pets and that we shouldn't use primary sources such as a single feeding trial. I could be wrong though; it's been a while since I edited anything related to pets. Seeking clarification on this. ser:Psychologist Guy|Psychologist Guy (ser talk:Psychologist Guy|talk) 22:33, 30 December 2024 (UTC)

As pet foods and medications are regulated by the FDA under an almost identical pathway as human drug approvals and indications, I’d agree that WP:MEDRS applies.
Could you find somebody in a veterinary Project to get their impression (since that’s more into their speciality)? Thnx, again, I agree it should apply! ser:Gobucks821|Gobucks821 (ser talk:Gobucks821|talk) 22:36, 30 December 2024 (UTC)
VETMED was always a small group, and I'm not sure who's around these days.
Historically, the community has been more tolerant of primary sources being cited for content that could not possibly have any human medical application.  Also, P:ECREE (&quot;Extraordinary Claims Require Extraordinary Evidence&quot;) applies to all content.  If the results are surprising (&quot;e.g., bligate carnivores are healthy on a long-term vegan diet&quot;), then I'd want more than a primary source.  If the results are P:SKYBLUE (&quot;Mammals need to eat food&quot;), then a peer-reviewed primary journal article (especially its background/overview section) might be a strong enough source.  In between those two extremes, you'll have to use your judgment.
Sometimes the fastest solution is to find another source. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 22:50, 30 December 2024 (UTC)
Thanks for the suggestions and I agree. Unfortunately there are hardly any studies that have been done on vegan dog diets and no good reviews. The feeding trial in question was this one [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38625934/]. There is a serious lack of secondary sources discussing this kind of topic. I think it would be best to wait until more research has been published. I disagree with citing just one trial. We need better secondary sourcing. ser:Psychologist Guy|Psychologist Guy (ser talk:Psychologist Guy|talk) 22:58, 30 December 2024 (UTC)
And it's recent, so we're unlikely to find it in textbooks yet.  It's possible that there is some sort of popular press comment on it.  Those tend to be lousy sources in a different way, though, even the ones that are technically secondary sources. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 23:36, 30 December 2024 (UTC)

 rT3 and T3 testing 

Hi all,

Does anyone know where I’d find a MEDRS source that documents whether high rT3 levels can interfere with Free T3 immunoassay and/or ultrafiltration LC-MSMS tests? 

All I can find is information that Free T3 immunoassays are prone to interference and that Free T3 affects rT3 radioimmunoassay tests, but no information about vice-versa.  

Edit: This primary source seems concerned that rT3 and T3 could interfere with tests of each other because they are isobars of each other, but satisfied that there are methods to separate them in LC-MS/MS tests. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00216-019-01724-2

I'll keep looking for more info about current immunoassays and for secondary sources.

ser:Daphne Morrow|Daphne Morrow (ser talk:Daphne Morrow|talk) 02:57, 5 January 2025 (UTC)

rT3 is rarely tested in clinical practice, and the utility of it outside of the context of central hypothyroidism vs euthyroid syndrome is highly debated in research.

 Clean up of Thyroid hormone articles 

Hi Wikiproject Medicine, seeking a little bit of preliminary input here. 

I'm looking at how WP presents information around Thyroxine, Levothyroxine, Levothyroxine Sodium; and Tri-iodothyronine, Liothyronine and Liothyronine Sodium. Thinking a bit about the best way to present the info, because I know how interchangably some of these terms get used even in literature (eg liothyronine used to refer to endogenous tri-iodothyronine, or levothyroxine sodium being commonly referred to as levothyroxine), even though they technically refer to different things. 

At the moment:

For T3, there's a page for Liothyronine the drug, and one for Tri-iodothyronine the hormone.

For T4, there's one page called Levothyroxine which is for the drug, and another page called Thyroid Hormones for Thyroxine the hormone (but this page covers both T4 and T3).

For consistency, I'm trying to decide if it would be of benefit to:

A) propose a merger of Tri-iodothyronine into Thyroid Hormones (with the result being three pages -- one for thyroid hormones, one for liothyronine the drug, one for levothyroxine the drug)

B) propose that Thyroxine the hormone gets its own article and the Levothyroxine page becomes more exclusively about the drug (with the result being five pages, one overview of thyroid hormones, one for thyroxine the hormone, one for levothyroxine the drug, one for tri-iodothyronine the hormone, one for liothyronine the drug). 

Thoughts? ser:Daphne Morrow|Daphne Morrow (ser talk:Daphne Morrow|talk) 00:55, 26 December 2024 (UTC)
thank you for post--ser:Ozzie10aaaa|Ozzie10aaaa (ser talk:Ozzie10aaaa|talk) 00:23, 31 December 2024 (UTC)
 When a substance is both a natural hormone and a drug, generally there are separate articles. For example nsulin vs. nsulin (medication), estosterone vs. estosterone (drug).  So I would support having separate hormone and drug articles for T3 and T4.
 hyroxine (T4; the natural hormone) was once a standalone article that was turned into a redirect to evothyroxine (the synthetic drug). Thyroxine (and also levothyroxine) refers specifically to T4. hyroid hormones refers to thyroxine and its active metabolites (T3, rT3, etc.)
 There are three somewhat overlapping topics here: the chemical substances, the hormone(s), and the drug that fall under the scope of P:Chemistry, P:MCB, and P:Pharmacology respectively.  The is a general rule in P:Chemistry, one article for each chemical substance.  Hence we should have separate articles for T4, T3, rT3, etc. that transclude l|Chembox.  Finally within the scope of P:MCB, a single article about the hyroid hormones makes sense.  ser:Boghog|Boghog (ser talk:Boghog|talk) 11:19, 31 December 2024 (UTC)

Amazing, I would support this for the new thyroxine page. 
I have a further question, do you think we need to be clearer on the pages about Levothyroxine and Liothyronine about the  difference between plain levothyroxine and levothyroxine] sodium, plain liothyronine and liothyronine sodium?   ser:Daphne Morrow|Daphne Morrow (ser talk:Daphne Morrow|talk) 21:29, 31 December 2024 (UTC)
 It appears commercial formulations of both iothyronine and evothyroxine almost always contain the sodium salt.  This could be mentioned in an &quot;available forms&quot; section under &quot;medical uses&quot; (see P:PHARMOS).  In addition, it could be mentioned that available forms include oral tablets, oral capsules, oral solution, and injectable forms. ser:Boghog|Boghog (ser talk:Boghog|talk) 12:54, 1 January 2025 (UTC)
I'm not sure that these details (e.g., tablets vs capsules) are important.  I'd only include available forms if it's a bit unusual (e.g., IV-only antibiotics, since people expect those to be pills, or oral chemotherapy drugs, since people expect those to be infusions) or if there is something special to be said about a particular formulation. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 00:45, 2 January 2025 (UTC)
Did a quick look at sources and this is what I found: 
For levothyroxine sodium: 
IV is used for extreme thyroid hormone deficiency: https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2000/1201/p2485.html
Oral solution is proposed to have benefits for children and people who find it difficult to swallow tablets (https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/levothyroxine/), may be taken with some substances that usually interfere with levothyroxine in tablet form (https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/endocrinology/articles/10.3389/fendo.2022.1080108/full), and may allow more precise dosing (Seen this multiple times in unreliable sources but need to find a reliable source that says it).
For liothyronine sodium: 
IV is sometimes used for extreme thyroid hormone deficiency (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214624521000186) 
Oral solution is presumably useful for children and people who have difficulty swallowing, but I didn’t find sources that back that up, so I will leave that out pending future info. Liquid may allow more precise dosing: (https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/endocrj/63/6/63_EJ16-0040/_article).
I think it would be good to note slow-release and regular release formulations as regular release creates peaks of T3 that make it difficult to monitor and are unlike the stability of endogenous T3 levels. “slow-release oral form of liothyronine showed a delayed, smaller serum T3 peak when compared with levothyroxine plus the standard liothyronine preparation.” (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(22)00004-3/abstract)
I'd like some guidance on whether details like this are good to include.  ser:Daphne Morrow|Daphne Morrow (ser talk:Daphne Morrow|talk) 05:32, 2 January 2025 (UTC)
 If a pharmaceutical company took the trouble of developing and distributing a new dosage form, this implies there is a medical need for it.  As long as there is a reliable source that documents a use case for a particular dosage form, I think it is fair game for an &quot;available forms&quot; section.  This is precisely what this section is for.  ser:Boghog|Boghog (ser talk:Boghog|talk) 10:26, 2 January 2025 (UTC)
Thank you again for your help. 
Further to the question about the regular vs salt forms of levothyroxine and liothyronine, the information in the drugbox is inconsistent (eg. the image for levothyroxine shows the regular form, the image for liothyronine shows the salt form; the CAS for liothyronine goes to C15H12I3NO4, the pubchem link goes to C15H13I3NNaO5). Should I try to standardise these and if so, should I try to make all the information about the regular form or the salt form? ser:Daphne Morrow|Daphne Morrow (ser talk:Daphne Morrow|talk) 11:07, 2 January 2025 (UTC)
 My preference would be to standardize structures in l|Infobox drug on the parent and not salt forms.  Per P:MEDTITLE, drug articles should be named after the INN. In turn: lockquote

If the information from 2004, that the ASA “spent the second-largest sum of money on lobbying of all professional physician associations in the United States.” is true for the long term, then I would expect lobbying to take up a greater portion of their page than other pages about professional medical organisations.

&quot;In the 2000s, the ASA lobbied to force anesthesiologists to be in the hospital room whenever an anesthesia drug was administered to patients during colonoscopies &quot; is unreferenced.  NYT article does not mention it. ser:T g7|T g7 (ser talk:T g7|talk) 21:20, 1 January 2025 (UTC)
NYT article does not mention propofol either. ser:T g7|T g7 (ser talk:T g7|talk) 21:22, 1 January 2025 (UTC)
This is a topic that is outside my normal area of knowledge but the new material, made the article shift from what seemed like kind of a high level, boiler plate description to something that looked like an attack article trying to pass as encyclopedic.  Like I said, some level of content may make sense but not 50% of the article.  I will note that a recent search for articles that mentioned the organization didn't say anything about these controversies.  This suggests the material is getting too much weight.  Still, I think getting more eyes on the topic would be best. ser:Springee|Springee (ser talk:Springee|talk) 21:42, 1 January 2025 (UTC)
Also there is lack of context, as the Tampa Bay Times article points out that the Nurse Anesthetist society spent a lot of money lobbying in opposition to the ASA. And the NYT article points out that the *third* highest spender in lobbying was the nurse anesthetist society. And there is no attention paid to the ASA's contention that their lobbying effort is to ensure patient safety. In my opinion, it reads more like an advocacy piece than an encyclopedic piece. That being said, there are some good points here- for example, pointing out the role of money and lobbying in health care in the US is very important. I think the battle between the nurse anesthetists and the anesthesiologists is noteworthy but it would need more context. ser:T g7|T g7 (ser talk:T g7|talk) 21:43, 1 January 2025 (UTC)

As far as I understand, cancer of the mandible would not be classified as a type of ral cancer or even ead and neck cancer. ral cancer generally refers to squamous cell carcinoma (a soft tissue cancer arising in the epithelial layer). As for cancer arising in the hard tissue of the jaw, I don't know exactly how they would be classified... maybe redirect to one tumor is best for now.
As the current article for ral cancer states: &quot;Other cancers can occur in the mouth (such as steosarcoma|bone cancer, ymphoma, or etastasis|metastatic cancers from distant sites) but are also considered separately from oral cancers.&quot;
Also I don't know if there is a need for a dedicated article for each bone in terms of cancer. That is because I guess each article would be quite similar when it comes to the list of possible cancers which may originate or spread to that bone. The mandible is however possibly an exception because of the existence of that group of cancers related to the tissues which form the teeth (see dontogenic tumor). ser:Moribundum|Moribundum (ser talk:Moribundum|talk) 10:18, 7 January 2025 (UTC)
Another quick note: as far as I am aware, cancer originating in the hard tissues of the jaw is significantly less prominent compared to quamous cell carcinoma of the soft tissues. I don't think it is the case that the encyclopedia is missing some very important category of cancer here. ser:Moribundum|Moribundum (ser talk:Moribundum|talk) 10:22, 7 January 2025 (UTC)

 DSM copyright warnings 

I have created l|DSM copyright.  It's a message for talk pages, to warn editors that they can't copy the full criteria out of the iagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders for copyright reasons.  

We've known about this problem alk:Narcissistic personality disorder/Archive 4#c-Moonriddengirl-2010-03-11T13:57:00.000Z-Copyright problems with diagnostic criteria|for years, but there are always new editors joining, and occasionally someone will replace a description with the copyrighted text of the DSM entry.  Even though they're really just trying to help, the fact is that the copyright holder could actually sue them (and would win).  I'd like to give these editors the information they need to do the right thing.

To save time and fingers, I'd like to ask someone at ikipedia:Bot requests or ikipedia:AutoWikiBrowser/Tasks to spam this warning onto the talk pages of all the conditions listed in ist of mental disorders.  (Anyone can add it manually to other pages, and if there's an item in that list that doesn't have a DSM entry, then it could be manually removed as irrelevant and unnecessary in that case.)

At the moment, we can't give real-time warnings, and since not all books are digitized, it'll never be perfect.  But we do have a system that runs after you've added some text, to check for probable copyvios.  Because the copyvio systems are really matching to &quot;matches this website&quot; – and some websites aren't copyrighted – it requires manual review after that, but we think we're catching at least most of it that way. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 07:14, 30 December 2024 (UTC)

Update:  The nice folks at ikipedia:AutoWikiBrowser/Tasks#Spam a template to 300 talk pages|Wikipedia:AutoWikiBrowser/Tasks have added the template to the talk pages on ~200 articles about mental health.  From here, expect two things:
* To need to add it yourself, manually, to other articles.  Generally speaking, if the DSM has diagnostic criteria for the article's subject, then this template belongs on the article's talk page.  
* For editors to slowly notice this.  P:Nobody reads the directions, especially not right away, so spreading the word will take some time.  But over time, we should see fewer potential copyvios being added, and more of them being quickly removed.  Remember:  If you have to revert someone adding the DSM diagnostic criteria (or anything else that's copyrighted), the link for how to report this is in the template.  (The admins P:REVDEL the copyvio edit so nobody will accidentally restore it later.)

 New editor using only primary sources and telling me to not &quot;interfere&quot; in his edits

Wow, this I think is a new one. On alk:Mpox and elsewhere, this brand new editor is saying repeatedly [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Mpox&amp;diff=1270379226][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Mpox&amp;diff=1270473488][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mycophenolic_acid&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1270479696] that I q| should not interefere...because [I am] q|biased toward [my] q|interest in vaccines and antibody therapeutics and that q|the viruses [I] q|studied (Zika, Ebola, and Hantaviruses) are not related to poxviridae.

But let alone that this is completely irrelevant to the matter at hand of whether or not my input is warranted, and whether this user is following the P:PAGs...

The main issue is that they are proceeding to add claims about the use of certain off-label drugs and small molecule inhibitors to different poxviridae-adjacent and other related articles (ycophenolic acid, pox, accinia), using only primary sources and WebMD/the FDA page for &quot;off-label drugs&quot;. Despite the local (and global consensus) that such primary sources and irrelevant WebMD/etc are not suitable for such claims. They are also starting (and hugely expanding) a few articles with mainly primary sources elenirstat, MP-1088, -myristoyltransferase inhibitors.

For TLDR editors, my general feeling is that because research on anal sex and fecal incontinence remains limited, mention of this should be kept relatively brief on the article. In contrast, Moribundum has proposed a rather large body of text with detailed explanations of individual studies.

 !!! Destructive editing of rohn's disease !!! 

Please take a look at this page. It (previously a GA) was rewritten in full by a single person several months ago, and the current version has severe problems. Most of the page is reliant on only two citations, and spot checks of these citations fail. Major discussions of the topic, such as the medication that was generally considered first-line until recently, are completely missing. 

This is a major medical topic with well over 100,000 page views per month, so I think speed should be a priority here. I personally think a reversion to the article revision before the destructive editing began, if possible, would be best. ser:Just-a-can-of-beans|Just-a-can-of-beans (ser talk:Just-a-can-of-beans|talk) 15:57, 27 January 2025 (UTC)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Crohn%27s_disease&amp;diff=1272228747&amp;oldid=1251397700 Here's the diff]. The previous version was significantly out of date (e.g., sources from 20+ years ago).  There's also been a ikipedia:Peer review/Crohn's disease/archive2 of the new content.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 01:22, 29 January 2025 (UTC)
Went ahead and did the reversion after comparing. Despite a large chunk of cites being out of date, the newer version was too unbalanced and left more gaps in the page. Given concerns raised in that peer review and on the talk page, without the contributor (or anyone else) actually arguing to retain the page, I interpreted most people as neutral or supporting the revert. @ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing

agree with reverting to long standing version, and agree current version can-of-beans did is the long standing version.
honest question (and i think ive seen it brought up before around village pump), how long does a version of an article have to stick around to become the long-standing version? apparently the other version was up for 4 months without anyone noticing. ser:Bluethricecreamman|Bluethricecreamman (ser talk:Bluethricecreamman|talk) 01:40, 5 February 2025 (UTC)

Blue, the more relevant question would be:  What makes you think that matters?  P:QUO isn't a policy or guideline, and it doesn't say what most editors think it says.  Fights over which version is The True™ Long-Standing Version are usually just a way to say that the version I prefer is the one that ought to be kept, and the version that you prefer is Not It.

You are correct:  We do talk this way.  
QUO's goal is just to avoid an edit war while discussions are going on.  For the most part, if an article was &quot;like that&quot; for the weeks/months/years before the attempt to improve it, then having it be :The_Wrong_Version|wrong for a few more days is less damaging than having an edit war.
It should also not be taken as an absolute.  Once upon a time, I was one of several editors involved in a dispute with a relative newcomer.  The newcomer only participated in the discussion when we reverted to the disputed version.  So for perhaps a week, the daily process was to see what they said yesterday, reply to what they said yesterday, and revert the article to the version they disliked.  Then they would revert back and post a comment in the discussion.  If we didn't revert, they didn't discuss.  Our slow-motion edit war was necessary to make the discussion happen.  (These days, we'd probably seek a partial block instead.) ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 21:19, 6 February 2025 (UTC)

 ex and intelligence and P:MEDRS 

Would any editors like to clarify if statements relating iological sex and ntelligence should be supported by P:MEDRS-compliant sources, in-line with what is currently expected at alk:Intelligence quotient?

I would like to remove current primary sources and other non-P:MEDRS-compliant sources from ex and intelligence (at least when they are being used to back claims about sex and intelligence), while another users believes it would be more neutral to for us to consider the body of literature as a whole ourselves, including primary research articles, and to summarize them here on Wikipedia. ser talk:Photos of Japan|Photos of Japan (ser talk:Photos of Japan|talk) 18:55, 28 January 2025 (UTC)

If a primary source hasn't been considered interesting or important enough to get picked up by any secondary source, then the ikipedia:Neutral point of view is best achieved by omitting it.  There are occasional exceptions (e.g., a study too recent to be reported), but as a general rule, neutrality is achieved by having reliable sources do the part about &quot;considering the body of literature as a whole&quot;.  It might be better to look for a graduate-level textbook chapter instead of trying to pick a review article.
With a brief glance over there, it looks like editors need to correct P:MEDSAY violations as well.   ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 01:12, 29 January 2025 (UTC)

I think that's a case of &quot;it depends&quot;.  It's typically accepted as P:PARITY for fringe theories, and as reliable for comments with P:INTEXT attribution on a journal.

No, you're right; it's just that when it wasn't in the first sentence, I used ⌘F to search, and searching for therapy doesn't find therapies on the page.  
People sometimes use the word modalities in such cases.  It's short for treatment modalities.  More generally, I question whether calling something therapy really implies medical benefit (rather than medical intent), and whether these have no medical benefit.  Yoga has the medical benefit of physical exercise; ayurvedic diets tend to be plant-forward, which has medical benefits; laxatives and enemas are medical treatments; meditation is a mainstream medical recommendation for people with ADHD, etc.   ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:57, 16 January 2025 (UTC)

 List of your articles that are in Category:Harv and Sfn no-target errors, 2025 

Currently, this project has about ~59 articles in need of some reference cleanup. Basically, some short references created via l|sfn and l|harvnb and similar templates have missing full citations or have some other problems. This is usually caused by templates misuse or by copy-pasting a short reference from another article without adding the full reference, or because a full reference is not making use of citation templates like l|cite book (see elp:CS1) or l|citation (see elp:CS2). To easily see which citation is in need of cleanup, you can check Category:Harv and Sfn no-target errors#Displaying error messages|these instructions to enable error messages (Svick's script is the simplest to use, but Trappist the monk's script is a bit more refined if you're interested in doing deeper cleanup). See also Category:Harv and Sfn template errors#Resolving errors|how to resolve issues.

Again, the easiest way to deal with those is to install Svick's script per Category:Harv and Sfn no-target errors#Displaying error messages|these instructions.

 Cytotron 

The ytotron, a device made by a company hreis Scalene Sciences has been in the news recently because of a fictionalised Netflix film, ucca's World. Depending on who you listen to, the Cytotron, and its near-namesake the eurocytotron from a Mexican company called eurocytonix, both of which seem to be based on &quot;Rotational Field Quantum Magnetic Resonance&quot;, are either a revolutionary new treatment for a variety of conditions including cancer, cerebral palsy and even autism... or just pseudoscience.[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/11/netflix-film-disabled-lives-feelgood-child-cerebral-palsy-families]

 Autism and biomedical vs neurodiversity views 

More medical editors are likely needed at utism. As seen in alk:Autism#Updates,_2025-01-19|this talk page section, an editor is arguing that the article should be tagged &quot;unbalanced&quot; for giving too much weight to medical views based on, among other things, a survey they ran. There's also an ongoing Dispute Resolution Noticeboard discussion (linked therein). This same editor wrote ser:Oolong/injustice|a lengthy userpage essay, also published elsewhere, against Wikipedia's coverage of this topic, so there seems to be a concerted push to alter coverage in this area. ser:Crossroads|Crossroads ser talk:Crossroads|-talk- 02:09, 13 February 2025 (UTC)

An RFC is already being planned.
My impression is that the existing article is outdated (e.g., it cites some sources from the previous century) and generally in poor shape.  The suggested change is partly updates, partly the addition of viewpoints (e.g., autism as a personal identity and a source of positive experiences), and partly to use more positive-sounding language.[1]
I can image three basic categories of responses:  The article is a mess now, and it should be updated and remain rooted in the biomedical model; the article is a mess now, and it should be converted primarily to a social model of disability and an identity orientation when it gets update; and it's such a mess now that any improvement would be welcome, regardless of POV.
If you are even slightly interested in this subject, please skim over the article and put the page on your elp:Watchlist|watchlist so you can see when the RFC appears.   
[1]  Examples of wording options:
* Lots of people have both autism and generalized anxiety disorder; are these conditions &quot;comorbid&quot; or &quot;co-occurring&quot;?
* Does autism have medical-sounding &quot;symptoms&quot; or non-medical-sounding &quot;characteristics&quot; and &quot;features&quot;?
* Do autistic people have a &quot;risk&quot; of developing epilepsy, or do that have a higher &quot;likelihood&quot; of developing epilepsy?

 Once a Featured article, with the entire suite of autism-related content cleaned up by ser:Eubulides, those articles were taken over by advocacy editing over a decade ago and are unlikely to be salvageable.  I long ago unwatched the lot; like some other areas of Wikipedia, the consensus model does not work in this suite of articles because the number of advocates editing in that area overruns the number of editors who strive for MEDRS compliance.  Almost everything in that suite of articles should be tagged with more than unbalanced.  If an RFC happens, please ping me. ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  13:40, 16 February 2025 (UTC)
Thanks all for the responses. I'll keep an eye out for an RfC, at least. I wish I could think of some way to make it easier for a broader set of editors to work on these sorts of controversial topics, which would probably help alleviate the balance issues.
Something to watch out for is preventing the privileging of the experiences of those with milder symptoms, as though their experiences are representative of the entire condition, just because they are more likely to be heard from. ser:Crossroads|Crossroads ser talk:Crossroads|-talk- 22:54, 18 February 2025 (UTC)

 Chronic inflammatory response syndrome 

hronic inflammatory response syndrome (CIRS) was created as a redirect to ick building syndrome by @ser:Joel Amos|Joel Amos, but is not currently mentioned in the article.

Annals of Medicine &amp; Surgery describes it as a &quot;multisymptom, multisystem illness acquired following respiratory exposure to water-damaged buildings.&quot;
*ite journal |last1=Dooley |first1=Ming |last2=Vukelic |first2=April |last3=Jim |first3=Lysander |title=Chronic inflammatory response syndrome: a review of the evidence of clinical efficacy of treatment |journal=Annals of Medicine &amp; Surgery |date=8 November 2024 |volume=86 |issue=12 |pages=7248–7254 |doi=10.1097/MS9.0000000000002718 |url=https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11623837/ |language=en |issn=2049-0801
ystemic inflammatory response syndrome is similarly named, but CIRS is not mentioned there either. Would anyone happen to know to which it should be redirected, or a new article be created altogether? ser:93|93 (ser talk:93|talk) 16:47, 21 February 2025 (UTC)

It's not actually necessary for every redirect to be mentioned in an article; P:RFD#DELETE only worries about them if they're &quot;novel&quot; or &quot;very obscure&quot; (i.e., nobody can figure out why they might be related).
The journal is middling (not bad).[https://www.scopus.com/sourceid/21100283772]  The redirect to ick building syndrome is not unreasonable.  I suspect that this is another &quot;chronic fatigue&quot; problem:  Do you have ME/CFS, or are you only tired all the time?  This article appears to be about &quot;the&quot; chronic inflammatory response syndrome, and not just a syndrome that happens to be associated with a long-term inflammatory response.  Overall, I'd suggest leaving it alone, but if you decide to mention it in the SBS article, I would carefully avoid any wording that implies that CIRS is a recognized or accepted thing.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 00:24, 24 February 2025 (UTC)

If you happen to like adding ikipedia:Manual of Style/Infoboxes|infoboxes, please consider looking at the suggestions in Category:Medicine articles needing infoboxes.  

There is no requirement that any article have an infobox, but these have been tagged by an editor.

I reverted [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Diff/1278253675/next this edit] because I could only find the source on preprint and it isn't listed in the TOC for the issue of the journal that it claims to be published in. My question here though is whether the type of information (association between excess deaths and COVID vaccination rate) falls under MEDRS?

 tertor vs noring 

What exactly is the difference between these terms? The first may occur while awake, the second only during sleep?

 Pesticides and Autism 

Regarding ealth effects of pesticides|&quot;Health effects of pesticides&quot;, we have some issues:

1) The first issue is an argument with @ser:Bon courage|Bon courage about wording, regarding the [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343145375_Association_Between_Exposure_to_Pesticides_and_ADHD_or_Autism_Spectrum_Disorder_A_Systematic_Review_of_the_Literature Tessari et al. (2020) paper]:

Option A: &quot;There is some suggestive research, but no good evidence, potentially linking pesticide exposure with utism and DHD.&quot;

Option B: &quot;A review found that there is some evidence linking pesticide exposure and utism (12 out of 16 studies showed a positive association); however the authors did not draw any firm conclusions due to heterogeneity across studies.&quot;

2) The second issue is whether we should include information from review studies to explain the link between pesticides and autism:

[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652620347016 Rani et al. (2020)]: &quot;Other studies also showed that maternal or prenatal and post-natal exposure of organochlorines developed cognitive, motor and autism disorder in children.&quot;

[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343145375_Association_Between_Exposure_to_Pesticides_and_ADHD_or_Autism_Spectrum_Disorder_A_Systematic_Review_of_the_Literature Tessari et al. (2020)]: &quot;The majority of the studies retrieved in our systematic review point to a significant association between levels of organochlorine pesticides/PCB and ASD symptoms.&quot;

&quot;Evidence from animal studies does suggest possible causal role of pesticides in ADHD and/or ASD.&quot;

[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147651323005833 Yang et al. (2023)]: &quot;Although several studies have identified potential pathways by which dysbiosis of the gut microbiota may be directly involved in triggering pesticide-induced ASD-like behaviours (including alterations in SCFAs, lipids, retinol, and amino acids derived from gut microbiota metabolism, Fig. 2), further studies are warranted to identify the role of specific intestinal bacterial strains and their mechanisms of action.&quot; ser:Diligent researcher|Diligent researcher (ser talk:Diligent researcher|talk) 10:10, 23 March 2025 (UTC)
Do you have the PMIDs for &quot;Rani et al.&quot; and &quot;Yang et al.&quot; ? The &quot;Tessari et al.&quot; paper is MID: 32697136, is dated 2022 not 2020, and is a solid and recent source. ser:Bon courage|Bon courage (ser talk:Bon courage|talk) 10:14, 23 March 2025 (UTC)
Rani et al. (2020) does not appear to have a PMID.
Yang et al.(2023) does have a PMID: 37262968.
You can get PMIDs by searching [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ PUBMED]. ser:Diligent researcher|Diligent researcher (ser talk:Diligent researcher|talk) 10:27, 23 March 2025 (UTC)
q|You can get PMIDs by searching PUBMED ← yes, though sometimes the free text search fails and it's good practice to do it when talking about sources, rather than expecting many editors who read the post to perform the same searches themselves.As to the sources, I think &quot;Rani et al&quot; is too weak to be used at all, especially with the editorial OR &quot;Most significantly .. &quot; flourish used to introduce it.MID:37262968 seems rather nothing-y amounting to little more than &quot;there have been animal studies&quot;. I don't think it's good for the text &quot;it is thought that early disruptions to the gut microbiome caused by pesticides can lead to symptoms of autism&quot; which implies a level of consensus and causality way beyond what the source can support. ser:Bon courage|Bon courage (ser talk:Bon courage|talk) 10:42, 23 March 2025 (UTC)
1) USE OF PMIDs 
Noted, thanks.
2) SUITABILITY OF SOURCES
a) Is Rani et al. (2020) considered weak because it's not on PubMed? It doesn't add much so can be removed without a problem; however it actually agrees with Tessari et al. (2020/ 2022)/ MID: 32697136, regarding organochlorines being linked with autism. 
b) Instead of &quot;most significantly&quot;, maybe &quot;specifically&quot; can be used instead.
c) Yang et al. (2023)/ MID:37262968 seems to be a good source. 
For consensus to be an issue there would have to be negative studies on the link between gut microbiome disruption by pesticides and autism. 
The source seems to do a good job at establishing causality:
&quot;Indeed, emerging evidence supports the hypothesis that exposure to environmental pesticides may alter the composition of the gut microbiome,&quot;
&quot;By altering the gut microbiota, exposure to pesticides has been shown in numerous studies to alter brain function, which may be associated with pesticide-induced neurologic disorders&quot;
&quot;Dysbiosis has also been linked to neurological diseases, including ASD&quot;
&quot;The possibility that gut microbiota may be involved in the gastrointestinal pathophysiology of ASD is suggested by the prevalence of GI symptoms in autistic individuals (Strati et al., 2017). Meanwhile, a recent analysis raises the possibility that gut microorganisms may be crucial in social behaviour disorders, one of the typical symptoms of ASD (Cowan et al., 2020).&quot; ser:Diligent researcher|Diligent researcher (ser talk:Diligent researcher|talk) 11:59, 23 March 2025 (UTC)
Regarding the date confusion of Tessari et al. (2020/ 2022):
The article was first published online on July 22, 2020; and the journal issue including the article was published in January 2022.

 WP:MEDDATE question 
I have a list in FL review, but it is at a bit of a stagnant point because of questions over P:MEDDATE. The list is ist of commercially available insulins. The main thing is, as the reviewer said in a post he made a while ago on here, he did bring up concerns over my use of older sources in certain places. However, I pointed out q|&quot;They may be older, but they have all the same info as new sources. This is becuase insulin analogues do not change. Once they are released, people adjust to them, so they can never be modified.&quot; There are more recent references that I could use, but none of them are as valid as the ones I'm already using, and many already cite the original studies anyway.

Thanks, ser:MallardTV|MallardTV  ser talk:MallardTV|Talk to me!  12:41, 25 March 2025 (UTC)

Hello, why are the older sources more valid? You mean they are more authoritative because they are from WHO or similar health body? ser:Moribundum|Moribundum (ser talk:Moribundum|talk) 13:09, 25 March 2025 (UTC)
The authorative bodies don't generally have the best information, even though I still do cite them. This article is more of a pharmaceutical list, so the original studies often do have best possible information about the analogues. The older sources come directly from the people who tested and formulated said analogues, so they will have the most accurate info about the pharmacokinetics etc. ser:MallardTV|MallardTV  ser talk:MallardTV|Talk to me!  20:19, 25 March 2025 (UTC)
In general, MEDDATE is often the hardest aspect of MEDRS to meet. Some experienced editor advised me if you can't find suitable sources within the last 5 years, then it can be pushed to last 10 years. In this respect, maybe reviewers of your article can consider MEDDATE to be ideal, but apply some flexibility to this. ser:Moribundum|Moribundum (ser talk:Moribundum|talk) 13:15, 25 March 2025 (UTC)

Very roughly speaking (as there are exceptions), the reputation of &quot;child&quot; publications should mirror the reputation of the &quot;brand name&quot; publications. Nature, Science, Cell, BMJ, and a few others. These brand names have a strong incentive not to tarnish the image of the top journal, which would happen if the child publications were perceived as junk. Also consider that the journal alone does not define a good publication. There is plenty of junk published in NEJM, for example. TL/DR: yes, BMJ Medicine is a fine journal in which to find references for a Wikipedia article. Particularly if the content cited is also supported by other references in other places (even if those not cited in the Wikipedia article). ser:Jaredroach|Jaredroach (ser talk:Jaredroach|talk) 17:48, 26 March 2025 (UTC)
Nature doesn't use the Nature name for Scientific Reports, which is little more than a dumpster. BMJ Group used to publish Acupuncture in Medicine. Overall (having worked with journal publishers for large portions of my life) I'd say it would be optimistic to suppose publishers really grok the knowledge-worthiness of what their journals contain. ser:Bon courage|Bon courage (ser talk:Bon courage|talk) 18:00, 26 March 2025 (UTC)

 Szondi test 
* rticle|Szondi test
ser|Tatiana Zhdanova has gone about it wholly the wrong way, but challenges the medical accuracy of the n AFD|Szondi test article for being based upon the source that it is for the claim of the mainstream medical view on this test.
See pecial:Permalink/1281674312 for some proposed content.

I think that it is a very good idea if other editors help review this subject, to save us a whole load of entirely predictable wrangling down the line if ser:Tatiana Zhdanova|Tatiana Zhdanova obeys the very unwise instructions some people are thoughtlessly giving at AFD to just plough right in and edit the article xyrself.
Let's try to make what the procedures say to do actually work for someone, and take the suggested edit and the claimed problem with the article and have other editors review it.

What does the high quality medical literature in fact say about this subject?

Thoughts? ser:Moribundum|Moribundum (ser talk:Moribundum|talk) 18:46, 24 March 2025 (UTC)

Per P:MEDDATE q|Cochrane Library reviews and NICE guidelines are generally of high quality and are periodically re-examined even if their initial publication dates fall outside the 5-year window. 20 years old may be pushing it a bit but the reason why these are accepted outside of the usual 5 year window is because of the quality of the source. If you have ever read a Cochrane review they are like mind numbingly long and thorough. I'm sure you can look into more about the process on their page but typically a lot of research and hours go into making these publications, hence why they are considered so valuable. It may be helpful to also find some newer studies backing up the claims from the 2005 source. As for the protocol vs review, protocol is the plan they use to approach the reviews they conduct, according to their website [https://www.cochranelibrary.com/about/about-cochrane-reviews]. The reason they are not as frequently updated varies from funding, to man hours, to lack of advancements in the field. ser:IntentionallyDense|Intentionallyser talk:IntentionallyDense|Dense (pecial:Contributions/IntentionallyDense|Contribs) 21:24, 24 March 2025 (UTC)
Hello, so in this case it seems the protocol was withdrawn twice (2017 and 2021) for the reason &quot;The protocol was withdrawn because the review was not completed.&quot; ser:Moribundum|Moribundum (ser talk:Moribundum|talk) 09:08, 25 March 2025 (UTC)
I wouldn't suggest using a 20-year-old source for this type of content. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 04:17, 1 April 2025 (UTC)
These are great points. A Cochrane protocol is not a secondary source (as ID mentioned above), while peer reviewed, it is only sharing the research question, inclusion criteria, and data analysis plan that the authors intend to follow when performing the systematic review. P:MEDDATE has some useful tips for dates on all sources. ser:JenOttawa|JenOttawa (ser talk:JenOttawa|talk) 04:31, 1 April 2025 (UTC)

The main question here is about whether &quot;alcohol and other drugs&quot; is a desirable/acceptable synonym for &quot;drugs and alcohol&quot;.  A few more quick !votes might be helpful. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 04:37, 1 April 2025 (UTC)</segment>
