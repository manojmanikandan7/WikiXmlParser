 Missing articles 

ikipedia:WikiProject Missing encyclopedic articles/Missing diseases|This page, probably from the now-merged ClinMed project, seems to have a list of some thousands of articles about diseases that need started.  Is there some reasonable place to link it on our project page?  (We seem to have only started about one in six of the requested articles... I'm wondering how many of them are alternate names that should be simple redirects.)  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:17, 19 March 2008 (UTC)
 Yes this is need of attention. I brought this up ages ago (see archive somewhere) and a lot of the names seem to be sub types of the major diseases. When I had more time on my hands I began to do such a task of redirecting and such, and attempting to create articles for diseases that seem like they deserve their own article, but it requires quite a bit of work and and with my current occupation outside of wikipedia, I am unable to do so :(. Note that a lot of the diseases and syndromes on that list are very very rare, so finding information about them is a bit difficult. Also in terms of redirecting, I try to first find information on the term and so I don't just blindly redirect a term that has the same name (look at mental retardation for example here: ttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Missing_encyclopedic_articles/Missing_diseases/7 (from 392 to 451...) Would all those need to be simply redirected to ental retardation or just removed? ser:Calaka|Calaka (ser talk:Calaka|talk) 04:45, 21 March 2008 (UTC)

 natalizumab 

The atalizumab article has received recent attention and discussion, most well-meaning, but the &quot;design-by-committee&quot; result is an overall content with gross bias towards its media-sensationalized history and which has subordinated the therapeutic benefits to a single down-the-page paragraph. This is a travesty as it conveys an inescapable impresssion of &quot;russian-roulette&quot; to reading patients, their families, and even practicioners. See also alk:Natalizumab. New eyes are desperately needed, preferably qualified and preferably with experience in MS treatment.....ser:Io io editor|io-io (ser talk:Io io editor|talk) 16:06, 15 March 2008 (UTC)

Wikipedia drug articles are not written for patients  We ikipedia:Medical_disclaimer|officially and ikipedia:MEDMOS#Audience|consistently don't care what effect an article has on patients, family members and/or practitioners.  We are not in the business of helping a patient make the &quot;right&quot; choice about his treatment.  If a scandal related to drug side effects meets the criteria for inclusion, then it certainly should be included appropriately.  Certainly having a drug formally withdrawn from market for (potentially) killing people is something that should be mentioned -- repeatedly, even.  Patients who trust Wikipedia to present more accurate, complete, balanced, unbiased and personalized information than their neurologist urgently need to find a new physician.  
Additionally, I've seen this content dispute mentioned on a number of pages, although I am not an normal editor on that page or any related pages.  I see from your edit history that you've invested a lot of time, including posting at ANI, in recruiting additional editors into this dispute in, I assume, the increasingly forlorn hope that someone will agree with your opinion about mentioning unexpected fatal side effects in the lead.  Are you familiar with the P:PARENT page?  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 21:13, 15 March 2008 (UTC)
Look - I reported this here in the hope of getting specific Medical input - which in my opinion the incumbent editors have been unable to provide - and not input about me personally. But I would answer the issues you echo like this - first of all, you refer to &quot;scandal&quot; - doesn't &quot;scandal&quot; belong somewhere else ? Second, in reference to the merits of the PML history, now many years old, ccam's razor - which is used in medicine - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor#Medicine - would by now demote PML to something less than the primary message of the page. Finally, I have demanded for close on 2 weeks now, and continue to demand, a comparable Wiki drug page in a serious progressive disease - and no-one has shown me any, not even one.......for good reason, as this is the de-facto opinion of hundreds of other Wiki writers. And so - its an extreme case of P:Undue weight ....ser:Io io editor|io-io (ser talk:Io io editor|talk) 14:15, 17 March 2008 (UTC)

If you are looking for specific input from someone involved in this project, then you've got it:  This does not seem like undue weight to me.  In fact, I believe that including the fact that the drug was withdrawn from market to be entirely appropriate information for the lead.

Fine. I am an expert. The information is correct. The paragraph which begins &quot;Natalizumab was approved in 2004...&quot; should begin under a different section, not because the information is untrue but because it is a sign of a poorly-written piece.

 Article needed: lood product / lood products 

I suggest that we create a central article on lood product  /  lood products.

This is obviously a basic concept in modern medicine.

We apparently have over 170 articles that mention the phrase &quot;Blood product&quot; or &quot;Blood products&quot;, though in only a few of them is it actually a P:REDLINK|redlink. (We can linkify the phrase in the others as desired.)

 Allopathic 

Wikipedia fairly often uses the word allopathic to describe physicians who are not osteopaths or homeopaths.  This usage sounds a little dated to me.  I think most MDs these days would describe their practice as evidence based instead of allopathic.  However, DOs presumably would use the same term.  Do you think it would be reasonable, when we are distinguishing between DOs and MDs, to refer to osteopathic physicians and non-osteopathic physicians as a somewhat more accurate alternative to osteopathic physicians and allopathic physicians?  Or do you think that would be interpreted as DOs on the one hand, and MDs and homeopaths on the other?  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:27, 19 March 2008 (UTC)

&quot;Allopathic&quot; is not an NPOV term. Ideally it should only be used in contrast with &quot;homeopathic&quot;, but it needs clarification for the reader on first use to avoid misunderstanding. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 06:51, 20 March 2008 (UTC)

Sure... right up until we say that &quot;osteopathic physicians and physicians&quot; do something, and someone removes the &quot;and physicians&quot; part because it looks redundant.  Or, to give another example, how would you change this sentence, from steopathic medicine in the United States:
&quot;Physicians who graduate from osteopathic medical schools are sometimes known as osteopathic physicians and hold a doctorate in osteopathic medicine (D.O.), while holders of a similar, but far more common M.D. degree are known as allopathic physicians.&quot;
Making a distinction here is appropriate, but labeling an MD as allopathic is not entirely accurate.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:33, 20 March 2008 (UTC)
Instead of &quot;osteopathic physicians and physicians&quot;, how about just &quot;physicians&quot; (the term being inclusive of both) or &quot;all physicians&quot; (the term being explicitly inclusive of both)? Also, the sentence you pointed out can be reworded as follows: &quot;Graduates of M.D. and D.O. granting institutions are known as physicians; those with a D.O. are sometimes known as osteopathic physicians.&quot; This is probably more true (i.e., they're probably more commonly called &quot;physicians&quot; than &quot;osteopathic physicians&quot;) and it's simpler, but conveys the one real distinction in nomenclature. What do you think? ser:Antelan|Anteser:Antelan|lan ser_talk:Antelan|talk 18:39, 20 March 2008 (UTC)
Er... since the article is about osteopaths, why not just say: &quot;Physicians who graduate from osteopathic medical schools are sometimes known as osteopathic physicians and hold a doctorate in osteopathic medicine (D.O.).&quot; Period.

Current Usage of Allopathic in the United States
It is true that M.D.s and D.O.s would refer to themselves as evidence based.  However, they are certain situations related to physician education, training, and licensure where the term &quot;allopathic&quot; is commonly used in the United States to make a distinction.  In the U.S., the term is used to make a distinction not only between two types of degrees (MD &amp; DO), but two types of exams (COMLEX &amp; USMLE), two types of residency programs (ACGME &amp; AOA), two matching programs (NRMP &amp; NMS), two medical traditions/cultures, etc.

This is a scattered exuberance of sources that, by happenstance, use the term 'allopathic' to describe MDs. None of these is a major policy document of the relevant societies or institutions embracing the term, none addresses the concerns raised above about the POV of the term, and none change the fact that the term &quot;allopathic&quot; is jargon in exceedingly uncommon usage in the general public. &quot;Allopathic&quot; physicians make up the vast majority of physicians in the United States; however, nobody searches for &quot;allopathic&quot; - whereas many search for &quot;osteopathic&quot; [http://www.google.com/trends?q=allopathic%2C+osteopathic&amp;ctab=0 as you can see here]. Even one of the sources above, the venerable New York Times, clarifies for its reader what it means when it says allopathic: &quot;Nationwide, there are 125 allopathic (traditional medicine) medical schools,&quot; because it is not otherwise obvious or common. There are plenty of better synonyms that more accurately describe the medicine practiced by MDs. ser:Antelan|Antelanser_talk:Antelan|talk 22:00, 20 March 2008 (UTC)
Antelan, I am not, nor are most of those sources suggest that the term &quot;allopathic&quot; describes the &quot;type of medicine practiced by M.D.s&quot;  Much in the same way that the names of the &quot;Democratic&quot; and &quot;Republican&quot; parties do not describe the political platforms those parties promote.  &quot;Osteopathic&quot; and &quot;allopathic&quot; medicine are names, not descriptions, for a collection of agencies, examinations, processes, traditions, and licensing requirements.  They are largely overlapping and interrelated.  Though this is confusing, we can't avoid explaining this distinction within discussions about physician education and training in the United States. ser:Hopping|Bryan Hopping ser talk:Hopping|T  22:35, 20 March 2008 (UTC)   
Bryan, I'm not saying that the term isn't used:  I'm saying that because its use offends some of the members of a group that it purports to describe, I'd like to find an appropriate and less potentially offensive term per the normal rules of P:ID.  I freely admit that I'm stumped and that a less objectionable term may not be as helpful as the traditional one in some instances.  I do not have any plans for wholesale replacement.  But I'd at least like to be able to offer an alternative when it's appropriate.  Do you have any ideas what that alternative might be?  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 22:06, 20 March 2008 (UTC)
I sincerely don't believe there is an alternative.  In the United States, those who object to its usage are an extreme minority.  Their point of view should be included, but the objections of a small number of people should not preclude us from properly explaining a set of concepts related to physician education and training.  Within U.S. medicine, the word is in free circulation.  Again, as the sources show, the word does not describe a &quot;type of medicine,&quot; rather it refers to a network of related agencies, processes, education and training traditions and licensing requirements.ser:Hopping|Bryan Hopping ser talk:Hopping|T  22:35, 20 March 2008 (UTC)

When you say that you don't believe there is an alternative, does this mean you've looked for alternatives and not found them? There are always alternatives, and I can suggest some for specific phrases if you'd like: MD-granting schools instead of allopathic schools; all physicians instead of allopathic and osteopathic physicians. MastCell had a nice formulation above, for example. ser:Antelan|Antelanser_talk:Antelan|talk 01:16, 21 March 2008 (UTC)
Antelan, to answer your first question, I sincerely don't believe there is an equivalent alternative, in certain circumstances.  In response to your second suggestion, whereas MastCell's suggestion may be perfectly reasonable in some circumstances, in others it may not reflect the sources used to verify the information.  My concern in that we are not representing the sources used to verify the article, even though they may otherwise meet the criteria of P:RS. To clarify, consider a statement from a source such as the following: &quot;There are two types of physicians: M.D.—Doctor of Medicine—and D.O.—Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine. M.D.s also are known as allopathic physicians.&quot;  How else would I present this information without using the term &quot;allopathic?&quot;  In essence, you can't present an alternative, you can only decide to omit a piece of information, namely that M.D.s (in the U.S) are also known as allopathic physicians. Is this piece of information not worthy of inclusion in Wikipedia?  Does it not meet P:NOTE? If not, why?ser:Hopping|Bryan Hopping ser talk:Hopping|T  02:10, 21 March 2008 (UTC)

But no such things as D.O. recognised in UK, and hence &quot;doctors&quot; here would take offense at being labelled as allopathic as if this implies some equal standing with some other type of medicine. Clear example of naming in conflict would be with abortion topics, where each side is called by their preferred term (hence &quot;pro-life&quot; not &quot;anti-abortionists&quot;, and &quot;pro-choice&quot; not &quot;abortionist&quot;). Given that English Wikipedia generally is relavent to what would be seen as Western Civilisation (or whatever the current PC term is to include Australia/NZ/S.Africa etc), then the medicine generally practised is &quot;conventional medicine&quot; or &quot;western medicine&quot; and this can be an assumed reasonable assumption (likewise we do not prefix topics in the manner of &quot;human pneumonia&quot;, &quot;human pharyngitis&quot; - the assumption is that &quot;pneumonia&quot; and &quot;pharyngitis&quot; will apply to humans given that this is the only target audience).
Now if US has DOs, which just quaintly mystifies us across the pond, then sure explain what US system is and make mention of how some refer to conventional medicine as allopathic, but then do not the use &quot;allopathic medicine&quot; further in articles. ser:Davidruben|David Ruben  ser talk:Davidruben|Talk  04:36, 21 March 2008 (UTC)
ser:Davidruben|David Ruben, I entirely agree with your concern, and support that no article should label any UK doctor as &quot;allopathic.&quot;  Points to consider, in the United States, both osteopathic and allopathic physicians practice Western, conventional, evidence-based medicine.  Again, the words &quot;osteopathic&quot; and &quot;allopathic&quot; refer to a sets of organizations, licensure policies, accredidation bodies, and medical schools.  Both of these parallel, largely overlapping systems lead to the same place - the legal right to practice as a conventional, medical physician or surgeon.  This parallelism does not exist in other countries, and indeed is mostly unknown outside of the physician community, even within the United States.  I am suggesting that the word &quot;allopathic&quot; should only appear in articles explicitly related to US physician training, the legal governance of US physician training, the associations that regulate and accredit US physician education and training.  Roughly, these articles are included in emplate:Physician education and training in the United States.  Nearly every article here in exclusively US-specific, or includes a US specific section. It is only in these limited cases that the allopathic/osteopathic distinction needs to be made.  (Additional note, US-trained D.O.s are eligible to be licensed as physicians in the UK.  While, UK-trained D.O.s are not eligible to be physicians in the UK.  Confusing as hell!)ser:Hopping|Bryan Hopping ser talk:Hopping|T  18:30, 21 March 2008 (UTC) 
This sounds like a reasonable compromise. Is this an issue where we should work towards and explicitly state a consensus, or is a general consensus already clear and present in the posts above? ser:Antelan|Antelanser_talk:Antelan|talk 11:59, 21 March 2008 (UTC)
I don't know.  I think the term is overused (just like I think that &quot;doctor&quot; is overused when the writer means &quot;physician&quot;), but I'm not sure that an official pronouncement will be nearly as effective as quietly making appropriate changes whenever we happen to come across them.  Assuming that we expect no particular opposition, then perhaps we'll leave it as a &quot;mental note to self&quot; and skip the overhead involved in an official pronouncement in (e.g.) MEDMOS that using &quot;allopathic&quot; to refer to modern medical practice (as opposed to US training or historical works) is deprecated.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 19:14, 21 March 2008 (UTC)
Concur with this general principle that using &quot;allopathic&quot; as a substitute term for &quot;conventional&quot; medicine should be discouraged.  Its usage within US physician training/education/licensing articles, articles about US medical degrees, or history of medicine articles should not be impaired by this principle. ser:Hopping|Bryan Hopping ser talk:Hopping|T  19:23, 21 March 2008 (UTC)
For the reasons I and others have raised above (obscurity and POV being chief among them), we should strive for using preferred phrasing (not allopathic) even in US-centric articles. David Ruben's point about calling groups by their preferred nomenclature should be well noted, and allopathic is certainly not preferred by MDs in the US. DOs may embrace the term osteopathic physician, but that does not mean that MDs embrace the term allopathic physician, though that would be a nice parallel. We should not sacrifice common usage and POV for parallelism. In this case, common usage and NPOV align in a way that should make us hesitant to use the term more than a few times outside of the llopathic medicine main article. Certainly there are a handful of US medical training articles that should use the term to clarify, but the term is overused on Wikipedia even in this arena. ser:Antelan|Antelanser_talk:Antelan|talk 20:00, 21 March 2008 (UTC)
 We seem to be coming to a consensus that is, in general, all pejorative in meaning.  Allopathic is just not a word I've ever heard (except in the links provided by Bryan) in standard medical terminology.  Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles is not called Cedars-Sinai Allopathic Hospital.  &quot;Western Medicine&quot; implies that &quot;Eastern Medicine&quot; is either better or worse.  &quot;Conventional medicine&quot; implies that physicians are so conservative, we'd never try sticking a small balloon in an occluded coronary artery to open it up.  One of my favorite quotes is below:

arcia Angell, former editor-in-chief of the ew England Journal of Medicine, states that &quot;...since many alternative remedies have recently found their way into the medical mainstream [there] cannot be two kinds of medicine - conventional and alternative. There is only medicine that has been adequately tested and medicine that has not, medicine that works and medicine that may or may not work. Once a treatment has been tested rigorously, it no longer matters whether it was considered alternative at the outset. If it is found to be reasonably safe and effective, it will be accepted.&quot;[http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/extract/339/12/839 Alternative medicine--the risks of untested and unregulated remedies.] Angell M, Kassirer JP. N Engl J Med 1998;339:839.

There is really only medicine, and the other stuff that is untested by rigorous scientific analysis.

I agree, there is only one medicine.  Your quote is a good one, and reminds me of a similar quote regarding osteopathic medicine quote|If osteopathy has become the functional equivalent of allopathy, what is the justification for its continued existence? And if there is value in therapy that is uniquely osteopathic, why should its use be limited to osteopaths?JD Howell, MD PhD.

My point of view is that medicine is not purely science.  It is practiced by people, who do what people do, behave unscientifically.  They form sects, and groups, and clubs, and insist that they are doing things better than some other group.  The situation with allopathic, osteopathic, homeopathic, chiropractic, etc is reminiscent to me of the kind of sectarianism one sees in religion.  Groups form around some charismatic individual.  They organize around some collective dogma.  And eventually they splinter over some internal policy debate. (Eastern orthodox, Catholics, Lutheran, Baptists, Southern Baptists, National Baptists, etc.) Of course, each group insists they are the one true church.
Although allopathic medicine seems to be the group that is the most committed to the scientific method, it too has [http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2008/03/pfor1-0803.html its biases], that often promote its brand of practices over others.
What do people think about a change in the noun following these adjectives?  This would mean accepting phrases like &quot;the allopathic profession&quot; or &quot;osteopathic associations,&quot; but avoiding &quot;allopathic medicine&quot; or &quot;osteopathic medicine&quot;? This would necessitate changing the names of several articles.  ser:Hopping|Bryan Hopping ser talk:Hopping|T  22:54, 22 March 2008 (UTC)
I and many other editors categorically reject the idea of allopathic as modifier to medicine.  Moreover, medicine is an applied science, meaning it does not do scientific research but makes use of the products, technologies and ideas from science (and there are medical practitioners that engage in basic scientific research).  Medicine is medicine, based on scientific principles.  if a physician chooses to use leaches, Ginkgo bilboa, or a pharmaceutical product that underwent 15 years of testing before approval to treat any disease, they should do it with with scientific methods and reasoning.  If chanting to the moon causes a cure, because someone was going to be cure irrespective of that chanting, then that's not science.  Allopathy is absolutely pejorative.  I do not agree with your one-man push to get this word used everywhere.  ser:Orangemarlin|OrangeMarlin ser talk:Orangemarlin|Talk• pecial:Contributions/Orangemarlin|Contributions 19:09, 23 March 2008 (UTC)

Again, I'd be the first one to agree that medicine is medicine, period.  There's really no such thing as osteopathic or allopathic medicine, since they both practice scientific, evidence-based medicine.  This is why I have offered the suggestion multiple times that &quot;allopathic&quot; be used to describe a branch of the U.S. medical profession, and not a &quot;type of medicine.&quot;  I'd say this is rather generous, since everyone knows that the term allopathic is llopathic_medicine#In_the_United_States|widely accepted by physicians in the United States, so much so that even critics of this usage note how common it has become at U.S. medical schools.Whorton, James.

Parrot an academic?  Persistent references to one article?  Hmmmm . . . that's not really fair. We would be wise to use Mr Gevitz as a source, given that he's an expert on the topic.  I would like to point out, that it's hard to source the fact that a commonly used word is commonly used, whether that word be &quot;osteopathic,&quot; &quot;eosinophilic&quot; or &quot;outrageous.&quot;  I assume many would find the numerous examples of its usage to be enough evidence that it is commonly used.  Nevertheless, these are the 3 sources I've found:
*&quot;&quot;Allopathic medicine&quot; has been revived and come into common use in recent years as a synonym for mainstream medicine, and many MDs today accept the designation uncomplainingly.&quot; (Whorton, James. [http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/altmed/clash/history.html Counterculture Healing: A Brief History of Alternative Medicine in America]. 4 Nov 2003. WGBH Educational Foundation)
*&quot;Despite its ongoing use in unconventional medical circles, the term allopathy did not enter the general lexicon of modern American medical schools until recently. . . . there is a clear trend of increased use of the term among mainstream physicians. . . . The increasing popularity of allopathy today is likely related to the surge of interest in complementary and alternative medical therapies. . . . The term has even caught on with our physicians in training.&quot; (Gundling, KE.

Subquestion
Does anyone here think that the canonical average reader, on seeing the unadorned term &quot;physicians,&quot; would assume that it includes omeopaths (many of whom styled themselves as physicians in past centuries)?   Assume please that the article is not related to homeopathy or history, but instead is something like neumonia or ntibiotics.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 04:52, 21 March 2008 (UTC)
In the US, I would say that the answer to that question would be a &quot;no.&quot; However, I understand that in other parts of the world, particularly in India, homeopathy has a broader following. I don't know if there would be more likelihood of confusion in that setting. ser:Antelan|Antelanser_talk:Antelan|talk 05:24, 21 March 2008 (UTC)
I wouldn't.  But then again, I'm a physician, and omeopathy is no different than other pseudoscientific thoughts like reation science.  Oh yeah, we're talking about the lay reader.  We don't give P:WEIGHT|undue weight to P:VERIFY|unverified P:FRINGE|fringe theories in most medical articles.  If someone thought it might include homeopaths, the text would give no weight to those theories, so I guess it doesn't matter.  ser:Orangemarlin|OrangeMarlin ser talk:Orangemarlin|Talk• pecial:Contributions/Orangemarlin|Contributions 20:09, 21 March 2008 (UTC)
So it might be reasonable, then, to change a sentence about &quot;osteopathic and allopathic physicians&quot; to &quot;all physicians.&quot;  (I don't have any particular examples in mind:  I just want a detailed enough grasp now that I don't need to bring this up over and over again.)  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 21:34, 21 March 2008 (UTC)

By law, Osteopathic and Medical doctors are just physicians.  They are licensed to prescribe drugs, they can get internships, residencies and fellowships in almost any field of practice; they're one in the same.  Allopathic is a strange term to use to describe one subset of physicians.  ser:Orangemarlin|OrangeMarlin ser talk:Orangemarlin|Talk• pecial:Contributions/Orangemarlin|Contributions 08:12, 22 March 2008 (UTC)

Commentary on Allopathic

Quackademic medicine, that is the failure of US medical schools to promote treatments that are based on science and to &quot;allow&quot; the teaching of treatments that have no basis in science and rigorous clinical study has allowed Allopathy to be used as a term to define real medicine vs woo.  In this world of political correctness, a word invented by Hahnemann (the founder of Homeopathy) to describe medicine during the early 1800's.  And honestly, Hahnemann probably understood medicine better than his &quot;allopathic&quot; contemporaries.  But that word is historical in meaning.  The Oxford English Dictionary clearly states that the word was in typical use in the 1840's, but now is archaic.

The political correctness of certain medical institutions, let's say the American Medical Association, in an attempt to be all things to all people, has allowed allopathy to enter the vernacular.  However, I did an unscientific poll of physicians at a recent poker game (with cigars being smoked and scotch whiskey flowing in abundance, and I lost some cash)--no one ever heard of themselves being referred to as &quot;allopaths&quot; or the such.  In fact, to quote one  of them--oh never mind, someone will just whine about the crass language.

My point is that should we use a term to distinguish medical doctors that appears to be used in popular culture to separate so-called, evidence based medicine (a term of such pejorative nature, that it makes me laugh) from the wonderful beauty of so-called Complementary or Alternative medicine (sarcasm intended)?  I find it insulting to read things like &quot;Western Medicine&quot;, because most Japanese, Indian and Chinese doctors practice the same medicine that we do in this country (I love urban myths that somehow Indian physicians utilize a special elixir to treat cardiovascular disease).  I find it insulting that I'm called a &quot;skeptic&quot; about Homeopathy, when I contend, I'm not a skeptic, that the Homeopathic promoters are skeptical of science.

Yes, I'm reading the dozens of weblinks and citations from Mr. Hopping that utilize allopathy to describe non-CAM medicine. But I could pull literally a million articles that don't use that word.  It's difficult to prove a negative, but the fact is that the vast weight of literature does not call real medicine (or let's use that pejorative evidence-based) allopathy.  ser:Orangemarlin|OrangeMarlin ser talk:Orangemarlin|Talk• pecial:Contributions/Orangemarlin|Contributions 21:47, 23 March 2008 (UTC)
I'm not suggesting that &quot;allopathic&quot; describes a type of medicine or medical philosophy (though some would disagree with me), in the sense that &quot;evidence-based&quot; does.  I'm suggesting that there are two clubs within the US-physician profession, the allopathic and the osteopathic.  Of course the OED says the term is archaic, in the UK &amp; Australia, these two camps do not exist.  In the UK and Australia, there are not two type of physicians, while in the United States, both allopathic and osteopathic physicians are granted the right to prescribe drugs and perform surgery - by U.S. law. [http://www.ilga.gov/LEGISLATION/ILCS/ilcs3.asp?ActID=1310&amp;ChapAct=225%26nbsp%3BILCS%26nbsp%3B62%2F&amp;ChapterID=24&amp;ChapterName=PROFESSIONS+AND+OCCUPATIONS&amp;ActName=Osteopathic+and+Allopathic+Healthcare+Discrimination+Act.][http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos074.htm]  If you're offended by the use of the term &quot;Western medicine,&quot; than I'm not surprised you would find this discussion offensive as well, it is of course your prerogative.  However, I adduce from this offense that your response to this topic is deeply personal, highly biased, and charged with emotion.  If you truly object to laws that recognize two types of fully licensed medical doctors in United States, allopathic and osteopathic, write to your senator, but don't pretend like I am somehow inventing and single-handedly promoting some profane untruth. Quite honestly, I would sign a petition to end this silly division, and recognize all physicians as practicing one medicine.

If &quot;osteopathic&quot; were uncommonly used and distasteful, we'd avoid it when possible; why not so with &quot;allopathic&quot;?
Allopathic is a term that has met with resistance here and on other parts of Wikipedia by the very people that are being labeled with it. The term is uncommon and has never been accepted by the bulk of the people that it purports to label. It is virtually unknown to the general public. However, when we say that &quot;allopathic&quot; is not the best word for the job here, Hopping throws up a wall of references that happen to use the term (they aren't even about the term, they just use it, making them just as much an exercise in original research as are the opinions given here). And I have never seen &quot;allopathic&quot; used in isolation - it is only used, and even then uncommonly, when discussing MDs in the same breath as DOs or alternative medicine practitioners. As Atwood says, To label modern medicine as Western in the postmodern “group narrative” sense — witness Dr. Katz's use of the terms “native preferences” and “allopathic philosophy” — is akin to calling what Einstein did “Jewish physics.” [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1140750] I'm concerned here; let's say the tables were turned, and if someone told the me that osteopathic was pejorative but had more common, widely accepted synonyms, I wouldn't find a wall of sources that incidentally use the term; I would work to integrate this functional alternative into articles. We don't call minority medical/sexual/racial/etc. groups by names that they find distasteful; why should we do so with the majority group of physicians? I am sincerely confused here. ser:Antelan|Antelanser_talk:Antelan|talk 01:49, 24 March 2008 (UTC)
Actually, many people hate the term osteopathic, mostly D.O.s.  They just want to go on practicing medicine.  Such people, like myself, likewise despise the American Osteopathic Association for their constant POV push to promote the wonders of some osteopathic philosophy that they feel simply doesn't exist.  But you and I can no more wave our magic wands and erase this distinction, or re-work it so it is more &quot;tasteful&quot; than I can heal a sick patient with OMM.  Not only do I understand your frustration, in ways that I wonder if you appreciate, I share it.  Yet, I value telling the truth, the whole truth, in plain language that reflects the reality of the laws and establishments that govern this province.  We cannot tell some selected, manipulated version of the story, its intellectually dishonest.  This is my opinion of course, and you are free disagree.

I gathered from your post above that &quot;allopathic medicine&quot; was more odious to you than &quot;allopathic physician.&quot;  So I changed it to the lesser offense.  After all, while it may be ridiculous to say &quot;Jewish physics,&quot;  I think you'd have to agree that to say Einstein was a &quot;Jewish physicist&quot; or that he was a &quot;physicist who was Jewish&quot; is significantly less offensive.  Apparently, that's not the case?  What exactly do you want me to &quot;leave alone&quot;? I'm still operating under the assumption that the goal is to make these articles better. ser:Hopping|Bryan Hopping ser talk:Hopping|T  13:37, 24 March 2008 (UTC)

Bryan, I think you are needlessly promoting an American-centric use of the word allopathic.  I've chatted up a few non-USA people about this, and I have come to the conclusion that while American MDs tend to ignore it, many European physicians are actually insulted by being described as allopaths.  In Germany, for example, allopathic treatments are actually classically allopathic (that is, they are things like dramatic dilutions of onion juice to treat dry eyes) and they are sold by the same stores that sell homeopathic treatments.  Allopaths there are very much considered &quot;alternative&quot; instead of &quot;conventional.&quot;  

I understand the utility of using this word when discussing uniquely American issues in professional training (for example).  However, an article on (for example) MDs is not about uniquely American perspectives (or, if it is, somebody needs to slap a l|globalize/US tag on it while that's being fixed).  Based on what I have learned in the last week, I no more support the use allopathic to describe conventional medicine worldwide(!) than I would support someone replacing the word gay with male homosexual all over the encyclopedia.  There are times and places, certainly, but overall I think we need to minimize its use.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:08, 24 March 2008 (UTC)

----
Here's my view overall:

Summary:  There are a range of opinions, with only Bryan Hopping really supporting the use of allopathic, and many people, including all non-Americans, strongly or weakly opposed.  Positions appear to have alciphylaxis|calcified and are unlikely to change by further discussion.  

Conclusion:  Given that further discussion will not produce total agreement, I'm sure that my time would be much better spent by working on any of the twelve thousand identified medicine project (or tagging the thousands of unidentified ones) than continuing a discussion that affects maybe a couple of dozen.  I suspect that many members have reached a similar conclusion. 

Request:  Can we just stop this discussion?  (I mean really stop, not just move it to other talk pages.)  I hadn't expected such verbose or time-consuming discussions.  If we stop now, I won't entirely regret having asked the question in the first place.  

Suggestion:  If you feel particularly strongly (either way) on this issue, perhaps you would consider the advantages of working on other articles for a while.  This is purely a suggestion and entirely your own choice, but I, for one, don't really want the WPMED project to get a reputation as the people who bicker about obscure terminology while critical articles like nfection and edication are seriously incomplete.  I can also recommend 110 Category:Medicine articles needing expert attention|requests for expert assistance to your attention.

I completely agree that the phrases &quot;allopathic physician&quot; and &quot;osteopathic physician&quot; should only be used exclusively in U.S.-specific contexts that discuss physician training and education, never in general medicine articles.  I have tried to emphasize this repeatedly.  Outside of an article that discusses the unique aspects of physician training in the United States, the term should not be used.  In the case of the specific example you give, an article about &quot;MDs,&quot; the terms allopathic and osteopathic should only appear in a section devoted exclusively to the unique features of M.D.s in the United States. ser:Hopping|Bryan Hopping ser talk:Hopping|T  23:49, 24 March 2008 (UTC)
Yes, and then, very rarely. The term is not in frequent use, it is still insulting to American MDs, and it has not been adopted by any American institution (there is no allopathic institution), and no discussion here is going to change that. So sure, we'll use it sparingly when talking about the US. ser:Antelan|Antelanser_talk:Antelan|talk 00:05, 25 March 2008 (UTC)

Let me be clear: I'm not interested in having a personal discussion with you here. Since I apparently have to defend myself, however, I'll address those 2 links you've provided: (1) I refactored my previous comment because it made assumptions based on limited information. There are other issues going on; for example, one editor to allopathic medicine raised concerns that a section he was adding kept getting reverted. That would be unrelated to our discussion, but still censorship. So I decided that instead of egging the question, I'd skip the question entirely and ask for independent eyes.

Now, I'm asking for outside eyes to determine if those tags are necessary and appropriate.

 prod:  Emergency Medical Care 

mergency Medical Care has been proposed for deletion.  If you have an opinion on this subject, please read the proposer's explanation in the prod notice.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 02:06, 25 March 2008 (UTC)
 It's not medical, its paramedical, it's written in emotive terms by someone who seems to have some kind of academic inferiority complex, and it doesn't add anything to existing EMS and paramedical articles.  Let it go. ser:Mattopaedia|Mattopaedia (ser talk:Mattopaedia|talk) 03:28, 27 March 2008 (UTC)

As the person who proposed the deletion, I agree completely. First, I think mentioning emergency medical care without even considering emergency physicians is blatantly false (if emergency medical physicians don't provide emergency medical care, then what do they do again?). Second, and the biggest for me, is that only one or two of the references even use the term &quot;Emergency Medical Care.&quot; One of those references even separates medical care from extraction (a salient part of the article). Finally, as have been pointed out, it really adds nothing. The only way I think the article might be improved is by making it into a disambiguation page linking to emergency medicine (hospital based emergency care) and Emergency Medical System (prehospital emergency care). Outside of that it's just a waste of bandwidth. ser:JPINFV|JPINFV (ser talk:JPINFV|talk) 04:45, 27 March 2008 (UTC)

Actually, I am fully prepared to see the article go to the great it bucket in the sky.  It just seemed slightly less POV to point interested parties at the cogent rationale for its deletion in the prod notice than to rejoice in advance over the possibility of a sensible outcome.  My primary goal was to give interested editors a chance to move any useful sources from the EMC article to the EMS article cluster, if it needs any additional sources.  But any further discussions should probably take place on the article's talk page, not here.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 06:20, 27 March 2008 (UTC)

 Coley's Toxins 

oley's Toxins was deleted from nproven cancer therapy recently.

It's an interesting topic - Coley was one of the first to systematically look at what we would call adoptive immunotherapy today. The article had a bit of the usual FDA-bashing, but it wasn't too bad (though every time edical Hypotheses is cited, the encyclopedia dies a little). There are a couple of biotech companies looking into producing and testing the stuff, though the recent published data has been negative and the promising results seem to remain unpublished. The proposed rationales summarize a decade or two of hot topics in cancer research: It works through TNF! No, it's antiangiogenic! Still, there is at least some ongoing interest in the toxins themselves, and certainly their role as an early form of cancer immunotherapy is relevant. ser:MastCell|MastCell ser Talk:MastCell|Talk 22:30, 26 March 2008 (UTC)

 Watching for Psuedoscience/Fringe Theories 

Is there a way to request help from Project members when an article is overrun by fringe theories? Has the project considered creating a list of articles prone to hijacking?

I've recently run into this with the unscreen article. For about five months, the article was hijacked by a person who feels that all sunscreens cause cancer. I found it a couple of weeks ago and added the disputed tag. After a while it got enough attention that we've been able to revert this back to a version from October. 

My experience left me with two thoughts:
*I wish there had been a tag way for me to add this to the Med Project's collaboration list, highlighting it as a hijacked/fringe article. (I didn't feel the peer review was the right place to add the item.)
*I wish there was a way for the Project to track articles likely to be highjacked.

Working together, project members could watch these pages and help keep the articles in balance. If multiple project members helped with reverts/edits, the hijackers would get discouraged or get blocked for 3rr.

Is there a way to do this inside the project? Thanks! ser:Wshallwshall|Wshallwshall (ser talk:Wshallwshall|talk) 13:32, 27 March 2008 (UTC)

Easily accessible sources are remarkably limited (of course, it did shut down around 1970).

I think that pp 240-241 of this book (SBN|0520210093) might be the most useful source:  It claims that the original ACA was a (temporary) spinoff of the ASA.  The page could become a redirect to the ASA page, with a sentence about its quarter-century existence added to the ASA page, although I'm still slightly inclined to l|prod.

 Viruses and diseases 

I know there's a conversation somewhere (I just couldn't find it), about how to separate the article about the disease from the article about the virus.  I think that's logically easy to do, but we really need to come to a consensus about hickenpox, erpes zoster and aricella zoster virus.  One article is GA, Herpes zoster.  Chickenpox is a bit of a mess.  VZV only slightly less so.  Really, Herpes zoster and Chickenpox can be combined, because they're just different (albeit significantly different) manifestations of the same viral infection from VZV.  Any ideas?  ser:Orangemarlin|OrangeMarlin ser talk:Orangemarlin|Talk• pecial:Contributions/Orangemarlin|Contributions 22:11, 28 March 2008 (UTC)

I would suggest keeping these separate, as they're clinically very different syndromes. Obviously there should be a clear interlinkage between the articles, but I think there's more than enough material to create featured-quality articles on both shingles and chickenpox. The virus article should remain separate, of course. ser:MastCell|MastCell ser Talk:MastCell|Talk 22:48, 28 March 2008 (UTC)

I guess we need to match the edits between all three.  I guess I agree, although my lazy self would think that merging the article would be more fun.  ser:Orangemarlin|OrangeMarlin ser talk:Orangemarlin|Talk• pecial:Contributions/Orangemarlin|Contributions 22:49, 28 March 2008 (UTC)

Just had an edit conflict, this is/was my response:
OM; yes, I would like to see hickenpox, aricella zoster virus and erpes zoster combined  because it would be easier, (for me at least), to write. The article could be structured  along the lines of; you get chickenpox, (unless you have been fortunate enough to have been vaccinated), then you get Shingles, (if you are old or have been unfortunate and have not had the vaccine or a booster); and at the end of the article; the virology, i.e. it's a herpes virus, it reactivates, it exhibits latency, it has one host, many genes, (for a virus), replicates in the cytoplasm etc., etc., the latter being for the benefit of the medical/university students.

P.S. these infections are not syndromes. --ser:GrahamColm|GrahamColmser talk:GrahamColm|Talk 23:12, 28 March 2008 (UTC)
Tell that to the physician/male model above re: Syndromes.  Anyways, I like your idea, because really, we're wasting space using all three.  It's one story.  But I guess, because we're so effing bureaucratic here at Wikipedia, that'll take a month to get WP:MEDMOS in line.  A month to go through 2 RfC's and maybe an ArbComm ruling.  And then MC will revert out of spite.  So, despite my pessimism, how do we proceed?  If there's one article to test it on, it's this one.  But I'm also thinking about HIV/AIDS.  AIDS is pretty good (but going through a FAR), but HIV is rather pathetic.  They should be combined, especially with all those strange fringe theories out there about AIDS. ser:Orangemarlin|OrangeMarlin ser talk:Orangemarlin|Talk• pecial:Contributions/Orangemarlin|Contributions 23:24, 28 March 2008 (UTC)

In the case of VZV/chickenpox/shingles, I don't care about one article or three articles.  But, if there are three articles, then I want to prevent each article from repeating the content of the other two articles.  Given that all three articles tend to accumulate peripheral content more relevant to the others, I lean toward merging them. --ser:Una Smith|Una Smith (ser talk:Una Smith|talk) 00:59, 29 March 2008 (UTC)

Although I'm new to the scene, I've been staring at the Zoster article for the last few days. The line between the two is not clear to me, so for example no mention is made of the Varicella vaccine (reasonably so) but varicella is discussed in the epidemiology section in a little detail. If maintaining separation is difficult, it suggests to me that a merger would be a good idea. On the other hand, Zoster is a GA but Chickenpox is a work in progress, so it would be a shame to dilute something that is currently a well-constructed piece of writing.ser:Pdrowemd|Sisyphus (ser talk:Pdrowemd|talk) 03:28, 29 March 2008 (UTC)

You must be looking looking at a different article than I, because the zoster article has a whole paragraph on vaccines in the Prevention section.  ser:Orangemarlin|OrangeMarlin ser talk:Orangemarlin|Talk• pecial:Contributions/Orangemarlin|Contributions 03:32, 29 March 2008 (UTC)

True, but that is predominantly a discussion about Zoster vaccination, and not about Varicella vaccination to prevent chickenpox. It's another good example of the difficulty separating the two topics. The first paragraph discusses Zoster vaccination, and then there is a transition to discussing briefly the varicella vaccination in the second paragraph without explicitly stating the difference or mentioning the name of the Varicella vaccine.ser:Pdrowemd|Sisyphus (ser talk:Pdrowemd|talk) 05:14, 29 March 2008 (UTC)

Firstly: hickenpox/hicken pox and erpes zoster/hingles each get over 3000 hits a day. This makes it important to try out radical restructuring in a sandbox, which also lets folk get an idea of the result.

I don't really understand the logic in merging chickenpox and shingles. There's no one obvious name for the combined article. Look at all the links in the InfoBox and the ICD classifications: these are handled separately by everyone else. Although it is fairly common knowledge that they have the same viral cause, they are quite separate diseases and have their own symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, pathophysiology, prognosis, epidemiology and history. Looking at erpes zoster, I can't find much text that I'd want to read in an article on chickenpox. Sure, I'd want to learn that shingles is a reactivation of the latent virus but I'll go to that article if I want to read about it in detail.

Merging the articles will exchange one problem (duplication) with another (separation). You will spend your time clarifying which symptoms, treatment, etc. applies to which disease. So I agree with MastCell: there's enough material for two FAs and the virus needs to remain separate and will probably remain short. I'm slightly concerned there may be a desire to merge material so that it is big enough to be an FA. If keeping the material separate means you end up with two GAs and a happier reader, then that's better IMO. ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 08:47, 29 March 2008 (UTC)

There're actually four articles, when you include ostherpetic neuralgia. Having had two of the three diseases caused by the virus (and being Wikipedia's poster boy for one of them), I can say that I think the articles are best left separate. The symptoms are quite distinct, as are the treatment options. Unnaturally combining them all into one article would be clumsy. ser:Gentgeen|Gentgeen (ser talk:Gentgeen|talk) 08:07, 29 March 2008 (UTC)

Graham has asked previously what to do with pathogen-disease article groups. My immediate reaction was that if a pathogen has only one associated disease, it makes sense to merge the articles, while if there are multiple associated clinical syndromes the articles would be better off remaining separate.

I would therefore prefer to keep the virology data in aricella zoster virus, with hicken pox and erpes zoster dealing purely with the different manifestations. ox party needs to merged with hicken pox.

The ikipedia:WikiProject Medicine/Participants page has a cell for editors to insert their qualification (if any) and one for their special interests. Hmm, looks like the last review of active/inactive participants was six months ago. Time to trim the list. When I last did this, I moved names to an inactive table. I'm tempted to just remove all the inactive participants based on some threshold. If the point of the list is to have a set of names you can ask for help, I'd say that anyone who hasn't edited in the last three months isn't worth being on the list. So I propose removing names if there have been no edits in 2008. Are people happy with that? ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 11:05, 30 March 2008 (UTC)

ser|Una Smith felt that I was overheating, so I will leave it to others to see what they think of this situation. Generally, I find newspaper/magazine articles very poor sources of information on such complex issues; they tend to oversimplify matters to an &quot;expert vs expert&quot; level, which is entertaining but has little to do with evidence-based medicine. In this case, the NNT=100 claim is not actually supported with a direct reference to the data on which it is based; it also presumes that everyone taking atorvastatin for primary prevention has a risk of 3%, which is not necessarily correct. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 17:37, 31 March 2008 (UTC)

 Possible vandalism to articles 

The articles estosterone and ypogonadism have some dubious edits [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/82.42.171.4 inserted 21st and 22nd October].  The user was given a ser talk:82.42.171.4|string of warnings for vandalism and then blocked at this time.  However, the edits to these articles are half plausible and I do not have the knowledge to sort this out.  The claim that testosterone is not associated with increased aggression is what got me looking at this after it came up on the reference desk.  The users other edits are fairly obvious vandalism but I am reluctant to undo these ones as conceivably (but statistically unlikely), it is a different person using the same IP. ser:Spinningspark|SpinningSpark 09:16, 22 March 2008 (UTC)
Am not an authority in the field of ypogonadism, but after reviewing the User:82.42.171.4 changes I know enough to make certain comments. First, the first change appears to be generally correct, it is complex to define. Then the connections made here - http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hypogonadism&amp;diff=166169657&amp;oldid=166167979 - including to obesity, type II diabetes and even to increased mortality, appear correct - specifically there was a well-known and eye-opening study produced last year which proved the increased mortality - you could probably find some kind of cite if you want to link it; he probably should have done so. I know nothing about it increasing the risk of AD; nor do I know anything about estradiol, etc as a complicating factor.

 Template styles and color schemes 

The choice of styles and color schemes used in various medicine templates appears to be a choice of the original author, with no apparent rationale or consistency.  For example, review of just a few disease templates with &quot;Pathology&quot; in the template title shows a number of schemes in use, thus:

emplate:Pathology
 none

emplate:Circulatory system pathology
 titlestyle = background:Silver
 groupstyle = background:MistyRose; 

emplate:Endocrine pathology
 titlestyle = background:Silver
 groupstyle = background:#efefef; 

emplate:Eye pathology
 titlestyle = background:Silver
 groupstyle = background-color: LightYellow

emplate:Metabolic pathology
 titlestyle = background:Silver

emplate:Nutritional pathology
 titlestyle = background:Silver

emplate:Oral pathology
 titlestyle = background:Silver
 groupstyle = background:#fd6;

emplate:Respiratory pathology
 titlestyle = background:Silver
 groupstyle = background:MistyRose; 
 belowstyle = font-variant:italic

I have no idea how templates work, but I see no documentation that suggests color schemes can be automated (as can color schemes of taxoboxes). Lack of documentation implies (to me, at least) that maintaining a standard color scheme will require manual work on the part of whoever wishes to take on the effort. Absent useful guidelines or general consensus, I suggest that we adopt the convention of using the default styles and color schemes for all medicinal templates.

Regards —ser:G716|G716 T·pecial:Contributions/G716|C&gt; 04:01, 1 April 2008 (UTC)
For over a century, in medical contexts, there has been a consensus that yellow has meant nervous system, red has meant the cardiovascular system, green has meant lymph, and green has meant lymph. (If you don't believe me, open up any anatomy textbook.) For over two years, silver has been used as the color for the disease/disorder infobox. I support additional documentation, but the absence of documentation does not mean that the colors are arbitrary.  --ser:Arcadian|Arcadian (ser talk:Arcadian|talk) 04:17, 1 April 2008 (UTC)
Agree entirely, but your comments do not seem (to me) to support the colors used in the examples above. I agree that the use of silver in the background of the titles is consistent across most templates I have seen. I look forward to others' opinions and comments. Regards—ser:G716|G716 T·pecial:Contributions/G716|C&gt; 04:41, 1 April 2008 (UTC)
I'd say standardization and guidance of some sort is a good idea, it's frustrating to build templates without guidance.  This might be something to seek input on at P:WPT.  I'd also like to keep in mind the guidance at ikipedia:Colours#Using_colours_in_articles.  
If I'm reading this correctly, then the suggestion would be (stolen from l|Taxobox colour scheme and with a couple extras thrown in for fun): 
color scheme
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! style=&quot;background:#FFFF00&quot; | ervous system || #FFFF00

Looks like the colour palatte of a play-do starter kit, but a starting point.  I don't do so well with the abstract so this'll help at least me concentrate.  Is this a discussion just about headers?  What about the group backgrounds, a lighter shade of the header perhaps?  I realize the innabar for CV isn't a great shade, but I couldn't read it when I tried straight up red or maroon.  And I refuse to budge on the GI system being brown :P  

Disease infoboxes can't be different shades depending on system affected 'cause of multisystemic diseases I guess.  I'm not a doctor, so I don't know how much help I can be in providing a comprehensive list of what systems need to be covered.

 An edit war on benzo articles 

Can we have some informed and experienced WP editors look in on the trouble at various benzo articles. Specifically hlordiazepoxide, lobazam, iazepam, itrazepam (locked), emazepam. An anon seranon|70.137.178.160 has started to take exception to the content added to those articles (over a long period) by ser|Literaturegeek (who also edited under a number of other usernames, now retired). There are problems with Literaturegeek's edits in that although they appear sourced to medical journals it is fairly clear he has only read the abstract (some are also foreign language) and they are mostly basic science, animal studies, case reports, etc. The use of solid review articles or medical/pharmacy books would have helped. Therefore a lot of the material is of quite doubtful value though he clearly means well and there's some useful material too. The anon has been dealing this by removing it. Literaturegeek has responded badly, with numerous personal attacks. Recently ser|Thegoodson has become involved as he's seen his edits removed too. Involved admins include ser|Fvasconcellos and ser|Jossi.  It would be very useful if WP Med editors could help explain to all sides (a) how to behave on wikipedia and (b) how to source and select material for medical articles.  I have tried to explain some of this to Literaturegeek but he appears too wound-up by the whole situation to take notice. ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 13:54, 5 April 2008 (UTC)
At a glance (most, not all, pages), I believe it is the Anon who knows what he is talking about. Good luck to him. All of these articles repeat 30-40 lines from a UK drug-safety committee, in some cases ahead of, and dwarking, the Indications section. I added the following 2 entries to the hlordiazepoxide talk page, which explain my overall view:
*&quot;I dont know much about this drug, but those vast amounts of deleted data [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chlordiazepoxide&amp;diff=202396924&amp;oldid=202220474 here] are not clinical data but laboratory data - always trumped in the clinic. Also, I think the Anon is also right about the p:undue on the abuse issue, why do the findings of that UK committee take up half the page?

 Terminology of pain 

Hi - anyone here just great with language?

#Or how to, in one, (hopefully accurate and non-misleading sentence that in no way violates IASP definition), disambiguate ain and uffering?
#Or a source for taxonomy of pain in the 20th centuary covering physiology, psychology, neurology and general medicine?

 Editors requested on cervical cap article 

I never expected to find myself in an irreconcilable dispute over a rare medical device.  But this has indeed occurred at ervical cap, starting with whether to merge ea's shield into the article (under the same name or a new article title), continuing onto whether devices still available for sale should be covered in the article, with further issues still to be brought up on the talk page such as content of the effectiveness and external links sections.

The dispute is currently myself and a single anonymous editor, and we unfortunately seem to be talking past each other on the discussion page, with neither really understanding the other's point of view after over a week of discussion.  I'm hoping to get two or three other editors to weigh in on these multiple issues and develop a consensus-based article. ser:Lyrl|Lyrlser talk:Lyrl|Talk     pecial:Contributions/Lyrl|C   00:07, 12 April 2008 (UTC)

The &quot;devices&quot; to which Lyrl is referring are several brands of cervical cap which were first produced between the 1920s and 1940s.  For these brands, neither current manufacturer information nor current legal approval documents have been found.  The only place that either of us has found these &quot;devices still available for sale&quot; are on the websites Lyrl mentioned: they are what I consider to be questionable internet sites which appear to sell medical devices and medication.  It is possible that the web pages are out of date, or that they are selling a stock of devices which are no longer in production (or possibly no longer even legal for sale).  Lyrl not produced any proof that the cervical cap manufacturers are still in existence, or that it is currently legal to sell or buy these devices.  In my own searches for this information, I was unable to find anything.  Therefore, I find Lyrl's description of these devices as &quot;available for sale&quot; to be incredibly misleading, as it remains unproven whether it is even legal to do so.  pecial:Contributions/98.217.44.153|98.217.44.153 (ser talk:98.217.44.153|talk) 03:33, 12 April 2008 (UTC)

 Triglycerides 

The article on triglycerides was really good. I just got the results of a recent blooed test that showed my triglycerides were at 350. High according to the sheet I got in the mail but I had no understanding of what this meant, the risks and what I could do about it. Cholesterol is very mainstream but little is said about triglcerides.

But, there were a few sections that I really could not understand.

Like this one:

&quot;Unlike Japan, it is generally admitted that most populations in western countries are lacking omega-3 nutritional sources. As a result ingesting of excessively high levels of saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids in order to assimilate enough omega-6 fatty acids is common. The ideal ratio ω_6/ω_3 = 5 is almost never met and is most often too high (about 12 in France, up to 80 in the caucasian population of the US and Canada), and unused high levels of saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids accumulate in the body in the form of triglycerides that do not participate in the needed syntheses in the body.&quot;

This sentence in particular is difficult to understand: &quot;As a result ingesting of excessively high levels of saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids in order to assimilate enough omega-6 fatty acids is common. &quot; This makes it sound as though people are aware that they do not have enough omega-3 in their diets and make a conscious effort to eat more monosaurated fatty acids to make up for it - this makes no sense.

Could someone with some background in this field please help in clarifying this?

As for the rest of the section, I have taken a crack at rewriting it baed on what I *think* the author means, but would like someone who knows what they are doing to have a look - if it looks correct, perhaps post it?

&quot;Poeple in most Western countries do not get enough omega-3 in their diets, and as a result end up with high levels of saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids in their blood as this is needed to assimilate enough omega-6 fatty acids. The ideal ratio would be to divide omega-6 by the omega-3 and arrive at 5, but the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 is usually much higher than that, as high as 12 in France, and up to 80 among the Caucasian population of the US and Canada. As a result, unused high levels of saturated or monounsaturated fatty acids accumulate in the body in the form of triglycerides.&quot;

Thanks for your help with this, from a layperson.

Actually, it's not directly related.  I did some external link reviews recently, and I found a couple of UK charities whose name includes &quot;support group&quot; but they don't seem to do any kind of normal support group activities:  no obvious meetings, no obvious internet discussion forums.  So the &quot;support group&quot; is really just an informative website -- &quot;support&quot; but no &quot;group&quot;.  So I wondered whether we had an ENGVAR issue, or if these particular websites (I should have saved the links) were just oddities (perhaps &quot;under construction&quot;).  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:38, 14 April 2008 (UTC)

Links to a Korean medical website, the MLE Medical Dictionary, were widely spammed last year, resulting in the site being blacklisted:

The site-owner has requested we remove the domain from the blacklist, promising not to do this anymore:
*ediaWiki talk:Spam-blacklist#Request unlisting of kmle.com

Normally we don't remove sites from the blacklist in response to site-owners requests but rather based on requests from trusted, established editors.

I invite medically knowledgeable editors to check out www.kmle.com. Does this site's material offer benefits to readers and editors beyond what we already have in our articles or that we link to with our existing links to other sites? Please express your opinions at:

Sorry that you're in the middle of that mess.  The relevant editor is highly unlikely to accept me as a neutral addition to the mess.

I sympathize, but don't feel like I can do anything for you that will have the net effect of being helpful. 
In the bigger picture, the editor seems determined that the content of the MS-related drug articles will reflect his/her personal perspective to satisfy his/her personal/emotional reasons.

Una Smith, I just checked in to see if anyone had improved the article, and confess I don't understand your edits.  You eliminated the lead entirely, created two Prognosis sections (not in MEDMOS order, one at the top, one at the bottom), and created duplicate incidence and epidemiology sections (not in Medmos order, one at the top, one at the bottom).  Perhaps your work got interrupted and you're not finished?  It looked to me like the information you sectioned out of the lead was a correct summary of information included later in the article, per P:LEAD, with perhaps the exception of Classification, where a section does need to be created.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 17:50, 17 April 2008 (UTC)

!?  I just started working on it again, I checked the history first and I was the last editor, and I don't see what you describe.  When an article needs a huge amount of work, I find it helpful to cut the lead back to the bare minimum and re-add summaries of key content after working on the content sections.  That helps to focus the lead on the scope of the article.  Okay?  --ser:Una Smith|Una Smith (ser talk:Una Smith|talk) 21:02, 17 April 2008 (UTC)
May I add, this is especially important in a long article, because to edit the lead it is necessary to edit the entire article and that increases the rate of edit conflicts. --ser:Una Smith|Una Smith (ser talk:Una Smith|talk) 21:16, 17 April 2008 (UTC)
 [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atypical_teratoid_rhabdoid_tumor&amp;oldid=206264237 This is the version] I was referring to, before I moved some of the text back to the lead.  It has a one-sentence lead (please see P:LEAD, two prognosis sections (out of MEDMOS order) and two incidence sections (out of MEDMOS order).  Because it was left in that state for many hours, I wasn't sure if you'd finished or been distracted, so I went ahead and eliminated the duplicate sections, by restoring the text to the lead. Cutting back the lead and re-building it is a reasonable way to edit, but the duplicate sections were certainly strange, and I wouldn't recommend leaving an article in that state while working.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 21:54, 17 April 2008 (UTC)

 Pain 

I think we could use extra eyes at ain.  So for those who haven't been along for the ride the last couple of weeks, ain and nociception was split to ain and ociception.  I don't have Nociception on my watchlist and don't know what's going on there.  Pain has had an incredible number of circular conversations.

Recently, Robert Daoust wanted to exclude all uses of the word pain from the main ain article except what we might call &quot;physical pain&quot;.  ain would lead with a hatnote saying something to the effect that unless you meant physical pain, then you needed to go somewhere else.  I opposed that:  Pain is the main topic and should include all its parts, including metaphorical uses.  However, the general feeling was that the article is a bit unwieldy, so the notion is to split Pain again.  The question is how to split.  

Two overlapping proposals turned up today (neither of us knowing what the other was doing):  ain (physical) and ser_talk:WhatamIdoing/Sandbox|Pain (medical).  These are just quick drafts, but they give the general outlines.  I can't say that one is more expansive than the other:  'physical' proposes many more topics than just the physical nature of pain, and in fact appears to be an expansive version of the existing ain article minus references to uffering; 'medical' would include non-physical pain as appropriate to a medical setting, but not as much physiology, which could be left to ain.  We need to pick one approach or the other, or we'll have an undesirable content fork. 

Until this gets settled, the main article really can't make any progress (because we won't know what's left in it, much less what it needs to link to).  I think at this point that having some less-involved editors give an opinion might be helpful.

Only the &quot;patient information&quot; pages meet WP:EL since the professional pages require a subscription. I agree the pages seem to be written and edited by good quality authors and the material looks OK too. However, I've yet to find a page that doesn't stumble on the EL &quot;Links normally to be avoided&quot; of &quot;Any site that does not provide a unique resource beyond what the article would contain if it became a Featured article.&quot; Comparing our featured articles with their patient articles, I either didn't find a free equivalent, or it was much less comprehensive. Looking beyond the a single article, the site's usefulness as a &quot;resource&quot; is limited because the internal links mostly lead off to subscription-only material (which is too advanced for the general reader anyway).
Does anyone here have access to the subscription material? How does it compare to a review article in a medical journal? The material is written by professionals and reviewed by an editorial system. I don't see anything that would cause those pages to fail WP:V or WP:RS. That's not to say there aren't better or more accessible sources. ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 19:15, 22 April 2008 (UTC)
UpToDate has become an indispensible resource for many physicians, at least in the US. It's extremely widely used as an informational resource by physicians. Basically, they have experts describe and summarize the primary evidence in an area into a concise, clinically useful page or two. They're quite well-established - I think they're much better and more useful than eMedicine - and they get real, nationally or internationally known experts to write and edit the pages, which is good. I find it difficult to live without UpToDate, as I suspect do many physicians of my geographical and generational niche.I currently have access, though I'm not sure how long I will continue to since the price is becoming exorbitant. It's not quite like a review article in a journal - it's not peer-reviewed, and the content is constantly updated and not static - but it's a very reliable source of useful medical information and expert summary of medical evidence. For Wikipedia, I'd suggest that we should be mining it for citations rather than citing UpToDate directly, particularly as it's subscriber-only. I think this is a reasonable source in terms of P:V and P:RS, but probably not a great external link, largely because of the need for subscription. ser:MastCell|MastCell ser Talk:MastCell|Talk 19:23, 22 April 2008 (UTC)

That's an important point - they're reviewed in the same sense that letters to the editor published in a reputable newspaper are reviewed. An editor thought they made an interesting or debatable point. They are not vetted extensively for scientific accuracy, and they naturally tend to reflect the specific opinion of the letter writer. They are potentially citable, but we should be careful not to put them on the same level of reliability/weight as actual journal articles. BTW, &quot;Rapid Responses&quot; from the BMJ seem to make frequent appearances when there's a minoritarian POV to be pushed - these are a special case and are no more reliable than lightly-moderated blog commentary. ser:MastCell|MastCell ser Talk:MastCell|Talk 22:13, 25 April 2008 (UTC)

 Celiac ganglia 

Hello Residents of the Mess:

I just stumbled on the article eliac ganglia, while using the &quot;Random Article&quot; &quot;button&quot;.

I realize this is a technical matter but could there be a sentence or two or three in the article devoted to an indication in laymen's terms of what this Celiac ganglia thing is.

Perhaps, to be more specific, could there be a small section entitled: &quot;To put that more simply&quot; or &quot;If you did not follow that&quot; or &quot;In other words&quot; or &quot;In plain English&quot; or some such thing.

This section might have a sentence on the function of this body part, one on how big it is, where it is (just below the lungs and at the front), what it looks like, what would happen if a person did not have these (but only if that can be expressed simply).

Just an idea.  ser:Wanderer57|Wanderer57 (ser talk:Wanderer57|talk) 01:04, 1 May 2008 (UTC)

You must really be more specific about the articles you are concerned about. Some of our better articles have very little jargon indeed, or do a great job at clarifying it. Would you expect any less jargon from other technical fields like engineering or mathematics? ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 21:34, 12 April 2008 (UTC)

I think these scores are great.  Wikipedia is supposed to be written for adults, right?  That means that anything around age 18-20 is right on target.  
Also, the whole article doesn't have to be accessible to children or young teens -- or even to nonexperts.  I fully expect a young teen to skip some parts of an article.  My eyes glaze over on some paragraphs.  That doesn't mean that I want them removed.  We just need to have a simple paragraph at the beginning of a technical section that summarizes it, or a simple sentence at the beginning of a complicated paragraph. 
I wonder whether it's possible to perform the same search on the less technical sections.  I'd also like to know whether the algorithm fusses about vocabulary.  habdomyolysis is probably a &quot;college-age or beyond&quot; vocabulary word according to most lists, but you can hardly write the article without mentioning its name.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 02:19, 13 April 2008 (UTC)

One problem I see is that it needs to be readable to the editors themselves. Sure, we can go through an article and change a bunch of complex sentences into simple sentences by removing conjunctions. The result would be less words/sentence which would increase the Flesch Reading Ease score. Unfortunately, by doing so we would decrease access to the article because people don't want to sit around reading a bunch of 5 word sentences that could be combined into a single sentence.

Would you rather read that, or this:

translation of above: I see a problem. Editors need to be able to read their work too. Sure, we can edit an article. We can remove complex sentences. The result would be less words/sentence. This would increase the Flesch Reading Ease score. Unfortunately, less people would be able to read it. No one wants to read sentences like this. These sentences can be combined into fewer sentences.

The first paragraph has a score of 62.4 while the second one, which has the exact same information, has a score of 81. Personally, if I had a choice, I'd rather read the first paragraph. -ser:JPINFV|JPINFV (ser talk:JPINFV|talk) 17:17, 14 April 2008 (UTC)

There is of course the P:Simple English Wikipedia (see Simple:Main Page|Main Page and Simple:Wikipedia:Simple English Wikipedia|Simple English Wikipedia expanded description) for a younger reading-age audience, although relatively few articles have been stripped down for this project. Finally we generally write articles to the level of secondary-education/undergraduate level (i.e. the finer nuances of views and opinions in post-doctorial circles generally are not included in our articles, but neither do we litter articles with warnings to younger children &quot;don't do this at home&quot; or &quot;ask an adult to supervise you&quot;) :-) ser:Davidruben|David Ruben  ser talk:Davidruben|Talk  20:13, 14 April 2008 (UTC)

 Hmm, a thorny issue. To become featured, an article must be comprehensive. With medical articles, this invariably requires a significant amount of technical and specialist information. I'm inclined to agree with JPINFV. I'm not convinced that the automated assessment is a fair representation of readability. 

 Another criterion for FA is &quot;brilliant prose&quot;. The FAC reviewers assess this at candidacy. Sandy, if you think that too many featured medical articles lack this quality, perhaps the problem lies with the FAC procedure?

A few suggestions and opinions
Readability scores depend mainly upon the number of characters per word, the number of words per sentence, and the use of passive voice. The greater these numbers, more difficult the passage becomes, and lower the scores. Now, the medical parlance is such that &quot;by default&quot; the words are lengthy (sample echocardiography or electroencephalography)--how does one shorten them? Moreover, if a certain concept is difficult to explain, automatically the sentences tend to become lengthy. I faced the same problem in writing the article on olyclonal response. No doubt, to understand such concepts one on an average does require higher intelligence. May be what can be attempted is that the important core facts expressed in simpler language can be highlighted (olyclonal response#Significance|my attempt, whereas the elaboration that follows can take its own linguistic course. Of course, I firmly believe that the explanation that could be provided by such a platform as Wikipedia should not be limited to only keep the readability scores favorable.

I have one more idea, but that might require sweeping changes in the goals and policies of Wikipedia--same topics could be covered in (two) separate articles, one for the laypersons (amateur), and the other for advanced concepts (professional).

Would love to know what you all feel.

Regards.

PS: Most of the ideas I'd formed on readability scores are based on the concepts given in the &quot;Help&quot; section of Microsoft Word.

The medical jargon issue is one that is difficult to get around. In practice we have the good old Three-Letter-Acronyms (TLA's) and will often make use of these (even though they may have more than three letters) as well as other shortened notations. Can we do this with the wikipedia MOS (I shall have to go look it up)?

 A doubt 

Why the contraction of pronator quadratus produces pronation, and not supination? Think of it, unlike pronator teres, it is not attached to a more proximal fixed point like the medial border of the humerus. This muscle runs absolutely perpendicular to the radius and the ulna.

I have thought about it, and feel that when the forearm is supine, there's no further margin for supination, so the muscle acts to bring the radius closer to the ulna, and not vice versa. And, when the forearm is pronated fully, the muscle must be getting so much relaxed (consequently, also shortened) that its contraction cannot further shorten the fibers, hence no movement occurs in this position.

Well, this is just a guess. It'd be nice if someone approves of it, or corrects my ideas. Regards.

PS: I have posted the same comment on the alk:Pronator quadratus#A doubt|talk page of the concerned article.

Last section is not about other countries, but (I think) the American orgianisations recognising doctors in foreign countries. In UK specialisation is via training time as a Registrar and relevant Royal College examinations - pass the examinations and one is a specialist and able to have that recorded in the eneral Medical Council register (list of doctors). However the threshold for passing the revelant college exams is, as far as I know, fixed each year to allow a set number through supposedly to maintain standards, but the cynic in me thinks just to get resit examination fee income for the colleges - my year of sitting the MCQ paper (many years ago) of some 200 questions, just 13 questions discriminated between distinction and a &quot;poor fail&quot;... not that I'm bitter... not :-) - anyway thats my perspective as a GP - but would need hospital doctor to give actual current details. ser:Davidruben|David Ruben  ser talk:Davidruben|Talk  04:27, 25 April 2008 (UTC)

In the UK entry to the specialist register by the GMC is by certification of the completion of training (CCT), which is awarded after registrar work for a set duration and meeting a set curriculum. Contrary to David, the exams are typically required prior to entry into a specialist training programme (apart from MRCPath, which is an exit exam). Some specialties are now introducing a knowledge-based exam prior to CCT. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 07:01, 25 April 2008 (UTC)
(I stand corrected) So Part 1 embership of the Royal College of Physicians (assuming that is what it is still called) is nowdays done when? and what about completing MRCP - previously done around SHO to Registrar step up, but now that SHO/Registrar post are merged, how has this changed ?

Part 1 is done from 18 months after qualifying, and Part 2 (Written) and PACES soon afterwards. In the past PACES could only be done after 18 months of unselected acute medical take (some people tell me this has changed). But PACES is not a prerequisite (more a desiderata) for entry into the ST3 (formerly specialist registrar) grade. In practice, one is still expected to hold PACES (i.e. full membership) by the end of ST3 as it is a marker of career progression too. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 10:27, 29 April 2008 (UTC)

 pidural Article: name change suggested 

Dear Doctors' Mess inhabitants,

Please take a look at the article entitled pidural. This article is currently up for a name change. I've taken a fair bit of ownership of this article. I estimate that &gt;75% of the text as it stands was written by me.

The points of the argument to change seem to be:
(1) The word &quot;Epidural&quot; is an adjective and therefore should not be a title in and of itself. Instead &quot;Epidural&quot; should be a disambig page which links on to other topics, such as pidural space, pidural blood patch, and so on.
(2) The main body of the text, such as it is, is concerned with epidural anaesthesia and analgesia. Some suggest we should have an article entitled &quot;Epidural anaesthesia&quot; which should contain much of the text as it currently stands. (Some even seem to suggest we tease apart epidural anaesthesia and analgesia for separate articles).
(3) We should only have &quot;correct&quot; medical terms as titles of articles, and &quot;epidural&quot; isn't a correct medical term.

I oppose the name change because:
(1) &quot;Epidural&quot; is a convenient shorthand term, used widely inside and outside the medical community. WP is not a medical textbook, and exists to provide accessibility and clarity.
(2) I believe that almost everybody who wants to know more about epidural anaesthesia and analgesia will look for it using the term &quot;Epidural&quot;. If they do, they will find every other reasonable associated term included within the article in an appropriate context, and can read further if they choose. Those who have more knowledge can search for articles by title, e.g. pidural haematoma. To make &quot;Epidural&quot; a disambig page (IMHO) makes the article less helpful than it currently is.
(3) I believe it is unhelpful and arbitrary to attempt to separate epidural anaesthesia and analgesia into two articles. There is considerable overlap between these two techniques.

Anyway, please take a look. I would be grateful for any suggestions for changes or improvements to the article. ser:Preacherdoc|Preacherdoc (ser talk:Preacherdoc|talk) 16:43, 12 May 2008 (UTC)

I'd say, at least, that there should be dablinks at the top of the page, linking to the other epidural topics. Might it satisfy both sides in this disagreement? See immedately below for an example.ser:Antelan|Antelanser_talk:Antelan|talk 16:46, 12 May 2008 (UTC)

The article and, foot and mouth disease could use more content. It says that the disease is &quot;quite common&quot;, and in the discussion of signs, symptoms, and treatment mentions almost nothing about it being potentially serious. However, the section &quot;Recorded outbreaks&quot; mentions dozens of fatalities from this cause.
An epidemic of this disease in China is currently in the news.
- &quot;The death toll in China's outbreak of hand-foot-mouth disease has risen to 42 children, with the capital Beijing reporting its first case Wednesday, state media said.&quot; - http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/05/14/china.virus/

Thoughts? ser:Ged3000|Ged3000 (ser talk:Ged3000|talk) 14:35, 18 May 2008 (UTC)

I think we could have a brief separate page discussing the term: what they are, who invented the term, how common these conditions are, with links to the respective articles. Should it be eriatric giants (without the capital)? Note that we have all prevention but not alls in older adults. --ser:Stevenfruitsmaak|Steven Fruitsmaak (ser_talk:Stevenfruitsmaak|Reply) 14:47, 18 May 2008 (UTC)

Sounds good! And yes, eriatric giants is probably correct.
As falls are such a major part of geriatric medicine, I feel that there should be some information about falls, as well as how to avoid them. Possibly working together with all prevention could end with the best result.

On another note, I just noticed that eriatrics#History refers to upport surface for it's links to immobility. Again, immobility is about a lot more than just bed sores, so I feel it could do with a dedicated article.ser:Ged3000|Ged3000 (ser talk:Ged3000|talk) 14:55, 18 May 2008 (UTC)

I think &quot;geriatric giants&quot; is such a central concept to geriatrics that it needs to be discussed on eriatrics itself, rather than in a subarticle. Is it known who coined the term?

 Blood on the brain 

Together with ser|Delldot I've been steadily hacking away at ubarachnoid hemorrhage. This article has the potential of making GA fairly soon, but there is a small list of current problems on the talk page that could perhaps benefit from a few eyeballs.

The biggest problem is the section on the prevention of rebleeding. This section was populated last year by a transient user who seems to have neurosurgical qualifications. This user flatly contradicted many of the conclusions of the Lancet article that I used to support most of the interventions. Does anyone: (1) have a grip on the recent consensus on &quot;coiling vs clipping&quot; of cerebral aneurysms, (2) know a neurosurgeon who could point us in the right direction? Much appreciated. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 11:54, 22 May 2008 (UTC)

I doubt there's a consensus. After all, neurosurgery generally obeys the principles of onfidence-based medicine. But I digress. Interesting: MID|12907814 - better outcomes were associated with hospitals that offered endovascular therapy. If you want to push the envelope, you could talk about the role of gene therapy as an adjunct to coiling: MID|14963270. Certain aneursyms, particularly those with broad necks, are unsuitable for coiling (MID|0008059647). An evidence-based comparison of methods, from Lancet Neurology in 2007: MID|17706565. One-year neuropsychological outcomes were similar in a prospective RCT: MID|11022066. (Apologies if some of these are already cited in the article).
The main issue is the duration of follow-up with coiling, as its widespread use is relatively new. The short-term results (1-2 years) appear good, but there's still some concern as to whether the long-term results will equal those of surgery, though the ISAT followup (MID|16139655) is pretty convincing. The problem is that the ISAT patients were a fairly selected subgroup:  88% had &quot;good clinical status&quot;, 90% of the target aneurysms were smaller than 10 mm in diameter, and 95% of aneurysms were in the anterior circulation. Generalizability is an issue, since most unselected patients don't fit those criteria.
I think the most definitive thing you can say is that it's an area of controversy; that outcomes are better in high-volume centers; that selected patients appear to do as well or better with coiling compared to surgical clipping; and that MSIN (more study is needed). ser:MastCell|MastCell ser Talk:MastCell|Talk 18:57, 22 May 2008 (UTC)

Thankfully the ISAT follow-up study touches on the controversy itself. I will not discuss gene therapy, because none of the recent reviews mention it (Van Gijn 2007, the most recent BMJ review - haven't seen the latest NEJM review).

In the german Wikipedia I've found an article with the lemma of smooth tongue it's an atrophy of the tongue in liver disease (e.g. liverchirrhosis or pernicious anemia). do you have any article for it, I didn't find anything, thanks and best regards--ser:Cestoda|Cestoda (ser talk:Cestoda|talk) 18:05, 26 May 2008 (UTC)

Many of those physical signs have not been studied systematically and some are legendary but are never seen (or always missed). MID|13548819 seems to have established it as a sign of chronic liver disease in the German literature. Pernicious anaemia, by the way, is not a liver disease. I think the main finding in smooth tongue is B12 deficiency. If we are to believe MC|2201441, the tongue was examined much more closely in 1924. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 18:17, 26 May 2008 (UTC)

 Peer review request 

I have practically finished work on ubarachnoid hemorrage. It offers a comprehensive perspective on an absolutely catastrophic condition, from diagnostic conundrums to quality of life in survivors. All statements are now sourced, and I have even tried to give a fair representation of the &quot;clipping vs coiling&quot; debate that continues to rage.

Before I submit this for P:GAC|good article candidacy I would very much like anyone to see what I've overlooked or misrepresented, and offer advice on improvements. Images, too, are welcome. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 12:22, 25 May 2008 (UTC)

 atchful waiting 

The above article has been moved to edical Observation, without discussion, for the second time in two weeks. I am of the opinion that &quot;medical observation&quot; is waaay too broad a term to be considered synonymous with watchful waiting, not to mention far less established. Any thoughts before I revert the move—again? ser:Fvasconcellos|Fvasconcellos (ser talk:Fvasconcellos|t·pecial:Contributions/Fvasconcellos|c) 21:55, 26 May 2008 (UTC)

&quot;Watchful waiting&quot; doesn't necessarily imply medical, though all of the first page of google hits are on that term and cancer and I've never heard it any other context.  Medical observation implies inpatient to me, whereas watchful waiting sounds more like the outpatient experience.  Sounds like there very well could be two articles, or one article that includes both concepts.  I don't see a burning need to have the main article be at either location.ser:Somedumbyankee|Somedumbyankee (ser talk:Somedumbyankee|talk) 22:11, 26 May 2008 (UTC)

Historically, medical observation was a very broad concept.  The modern concept is quite narrow and refers to close monitoring in an attempt to &quot;capture&quot; a fleeting sign or symptom.  Neither of those concepts has much in common with watchful waiting.  Re the historical concept, see Lectures on the Principles and Methods of Medical Observation and Research, published in 1857.[http://books.google.com/books?id=Rm_uNOFy0scC] --ser:Una Smith|Una Smith (ser talk:Una Smith|talk) 02:49, 27 May 2008 (UTC)

 Naturopathic medicine 

Hello, docs.  Anyone familiar with naturopathic medicine?  There are four accredited 4-year naturopathic medical schools with equivalent prerequisites and preclinical training to that of allopathic and osteopathic medical schools.  Right now, naturopathic medicine is listed as a &quot;complementary and alternative medicine,&quot; but when you follow the wikipedia definitions for those terms, you find that they define alternatives to &quot;medicine&quot;, or &quot;the science and art of maintaining and restoring human health through the study, diagnosis, and treatment of patients.&quot;  NDs (Naturopathic Doctors) are licensed to study, diagnose, and treat patients in about 15 U.S. jurisdictions, so I propose that &quot;naturopathic medicine&quot; actually be under the &quot;medicine&quot; category, instead of &quot;complementary and alternative medicine.&quot;  I look forward to some lively conversation on the topic!
ser:Lamaybe|Lamaybe (ser talk:Lamaybe|talk) 22:16, 20 May 2008 (UTC)
Just to be clear, NDs are trained to use modern diagnostic tests, prescribe pharmaceuticals, do minor surgery, and also to safely use herbs, physical medicine, nutrition, and other non-pharmaceutical therapies.  They are licensed to do all of those things in many states, and are legally considered &quot;primary care providers&quot; in most states where they are licensed.
ser:Lamaybe|Lamaybe (ser talk:Lamaybe|talk) 22:23, 20 May 2008 (UTC)

Hi ser:Lamaybe|Lamaybe, I see the majority of naturopathic therapies as having failed any scrutiny using the cientific method of investigation. ser:Nk.sheridan|Nk.sheridan   ser Talk:Nk.sheridan|Talk 23:56, 20 May 2008 (UTC)

Hi Nk.sheridan, NDs are trained and licensed to prescribe pharmaceuticals; in some states the identical formulary that MDs and DOs use (Washington and Arizona).  Those therapies are based in the scientific method, right?  NDs are trained and licensed to use botanical medicine (herbs) as well.  To find therapeutic uses of herbs, you can just search the latin names of many herbs in pubmed, and find uses for herbs that have been confirmed using the scientific method.  For example, silybum, urtica, vaccinium, withania.  They are also trained and licensed to use nutritional therapies, and various forms of physical medicine, which have certainly been found to have therapeutic benefit in peer reviewed journals.  If you are referring to homeopathy, I will admit that is a hot topic--many scientists feel that scientific scrutiny has shown it to be overall inefficacious, and there are others (including the authors of peer-reviewed meta-analyses) who feel the opposite.  Certainly not a clear-cut failure of scrutiny, but a hotbed of controversy!  I'd love to know any other thoughts you have on the matter, thanks! ser:Lamaybe|Lamaybe (ser talk:Lamaybe|talk) 02:58, 21 May 2008 (UTC)

In UK aturopathy|Naturopaths are not normally medically trained, and would advocate dietary &amp; supplement therapy be taken by their customers rather than seeking conventional doctors and receiving conventional medications - as such very definitely seen as alternative rather than even complementary. So, from a non US-centric perspective, definitely should not come under the &quot;medicine&quot; category (that US has &quot;quaint&quot; multiple routes to being a doctor, as per osteopathy, does not alter more global perspective of practices being very different to US). ser:Davidruben|David Ruben  ser talk:Davidruben|Talk  03:05, 21 May 2008 (UTC)

I agree with NK and David that we cannot let the remarkable situation in the USA dominate the classification of naturopathic medicine. It is CAM by generally agreed standards. The fact that they do some mainstream stuff as well does not make it mainstream. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 05:44, 21 May 2008 (UTC)

I will admit to U.S.-centrism here, but I think &quot;complementary&quot; is the operative term. Many naturopaths (at least those I've interacted with, which is an admittedly skewed sample) view &quot;mainstream&quot; medicine as indispensible in dealing with things like appendicitis, HIV/AIDS, operable cancer, and so forth, and view naturopathic remedies more in terms of a complementary modality aimed at maintaining optimal health rather than an alternative to proven medical treatments. I think &quot;complementary&quot; is appropriate, if not &quot;alternative&quot;. ser:MastCell|MastCell ser Talk:MastCell|Talk 19:54, 21 May 2008 (UTC)

Right, thanks for the global perspective NK and David.  After considering your comments, I think maybe the best thing to do is follow the model of the &quot;osteopathy&quot; and &quot;osteopathic medicine&quot; entries, which both refer to one another and cover both the global and US definitions of those terms.  Just as DOs in the US practice medicine, and are trained in a CAM therapy as well, NDs in the US practice medicine and are trained in CAM therapies.  However, there are non-medically trained osteopaths and naturopaths worldwide who are not licensed to diagnose and treat patients.  In fact, editors on the talk page of the &quot;naturopathic medicine&quot; entry have recently been discussing splitting the article.  Any insight from this camp?  Thanks!  ser:Lamaybe|Lamaybe (ser talk:Lamaybe|talk) 20:09, 21 May 2008 (UTC)

Even if &quot;naturopathic medicine&quot; and &quot;naturopathy&quot; were two separate articles, I still do not think naturopathic medicine would belong in the medicine category for the reasons mentioned above.  Yes, the CAM roots of naturopathic medicine are similar to osteopathic medicine, but naturopathic medicine is still considered non-conventional medicine.  Currently, practitioners of naturopathic medicine do not have the same education (no internship/residence requirement) or practice rights as MDs and DOs.  Once US state licensure is identical for ND and MD/DO nationwide (and there are no places where it is illegal), then naturopathic medicine would belong in the medicine category.  Additionally, I would not add the ND schools to ist of medical schools in the United States, even if the preclinical years are similar.  Having an ND degree leads to a very different career than a MD or DO degree, and it would be misleading to group ND schools with MD/DO schools together in one list.  --ser:Scottalter|Scott Alter 21:44, 21 May 2008 (UTC)

In most states where NDs are licensed, they can practice as primary-care physicians after passing their clinical boards, without completing a residency.  A residency is required before being licensed in Utah, and has been written into proposed (but not yet passed) licensing bills in states like New York.  In some states (Arizona, Washington), NDs have the same practice rights as MDs and DOs.  In other states, the practice rights are different, but in all states where naturopathic doctors are licensed, they are licensed to diagnose and treat patients.  I think that is the key to why naturopathic physicians are practicing medicine; as wikipedia's &quot;medicine&quot; article leads: &quot;Medicine is the science and art of maintaining and restoring human health through the study, diagnosis, and treatment of patients&quot; which is clearly what NDs are trained and licensed to do.  I think the ND schools could be included in the ist of medical schools in the United States, if the lead of the article clearly distinguishes what the difference in the potential careers are.  Or, the lead of that article could direct to a separate &quot;List of naturopathic medical schools in the US&quot; article. ser:Lamaybe|Lamaybe (ser talk:Lamaybe|talk) 21:04, 22 May 2008 (UTC)

I don't see a huge problem with a separate or clearly separated list of recognized naturopathic schools, some of which probably also have their own articles by now.  As far as what schools to list, [http://www.obne.state.or.us/OBNE/FiveShools.shtml] is a good place to start.  Naturopathy is a different approach and isn't broadly recognized, but a licensed ND (at least in Oregon) still has substantial recognized medical training.  The problem is that there are a lot of quacks and dubious correspondence schools.  Adding a list will invite substandard schools (and/or iploma mills) and their students to add themselves in order to get some sort of legitimacy (or publicity) and the list would have to be watched.ser:Somedumbyankee|Somedumbyankee (ser talk:Somedumbyankee|talk) 00:20, 24 May 2008 (UTC)

 I created an article; aturopathic medical schools in North America, and linked to it from edical schools in the United States.  If anyone thinks it should be linked to from ist of medical schools in the United States, please do so.  I think that there might be a touch of controversy about linking from that entry, so I probably shouldn't be the one to do it.  In writing the entry, I discovered that there already is an article entitled ist of accredited naturopathic medical schools in North America.  ser:Lamaybe|Lamaybe (ser talk:Lamaybe|talk) 07:51, 28 May 2008 (UTC)

 WP:Notability#Medical topics? 

How I wish there was a page called that.  I found he Walid-Robinson Opioid-Dependence (WROD) Questionnaire|this page, created by pecial:Contributions/Mswalid|Mswalid, which is orphaned and virtually untouched except Mswalid and an pecial:Contributions/70.185.185.214|anon account who is almost certainly the same person.  There are two references, both to the same authors.  So, is it P:N|notable?  Should it be deleted?  WP:N can't really apply to most medical topics since the popular press isn't going to write articles on most medical topics.  As a rule of thumb for any symptom scales I'd probably use a validation study as a cut-off (but that's just me).  Thoughts?  Pubmed turns up a link to one of the references that uses, but does not validate the scale.  ser:WLU|WLU (ser talk:WLU|talk) 16:59, 26 May 2008 (UTC)

Drug treatment programs are pretty secretive by necessity, and that sounds like something they would use, so a lot of the information may not be out on the web.  Is there any indication who Walid and Robinson are and if they are notable and/or reliable?ser:Somedumbyankee|Somedumbyankee (ser talk:Somedumbyankee|talk) 18:13, 26 May 2008 (UTC)
Walid turns up [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&amp;Cmd=Search&amp;Term=%22Walid%20MS%22%5BAuthor%5D&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DiscoveryPanel.Pubmed_RVAbstractPlus 4] publications of fairly diverse topics, Robinson [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&amp;Cmd=Search&amp;Term=%22Robinson%20JS%20Jr%22%5BAuthor%5D&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DiscoveryPanel.Pubmed_RVAbstractPlus 27] (pubmed being of course unreliable for names since it doesn't distinguish Mark from Michael).  Looks like Robinson does a lot of spine work, with a lot of gaps in publication (first is in [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4554861?ordinalpos=27&amp;itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum 1972]).  From what I can guess it looks like a mixed bag of journals - some good, some minor.  It might be reliable, but is it notable?  I've no idea.  Based on the two publications that exist, what can be said about it?  Google scholar turns up only the [http://scholar.google.ca/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;q=Walid-Robinson+Opioid-Dependence one] hit that's already in the page.  A near complete lack of sources makes for a very limited article.  ser:WLU|WLU (ser talk:WLU|talk) 18:29, 26 May 2008 (UTC)

Failing some sort of stronger indication who the creators are, the history of the scale, or some other external source, I'd probably fold it into a list or an article on pain management.  I don't recognize the journal, but I'm no expert (when I see OD I think EIA testing).  My guess for notability is to use things like established medical dictionaries, WHO criteria, as well as the Lancet and JAMA and such as surrogates for the &quot;popular press&quot;.ser:Somedumbyankee|Somedumbyankee (ser talk:Somedumbyankee|talk) 18:04, 28 May 2008 (UTC)

 Two articles needing attention 

A new stub that would love some TLC - enetrating atherosclerotic ulcer - and an expanded and equivocal page on a new-ish topic, that could use an expert - cute aortic syndrome.  First WP:MED contributor to expand gets a barnasterisk (the next level below the minor barnstar)!  They're also both orphans, and I'm not sure about where to link.  ser:WLU|WLU (ser talk:WLU|talk) 01:02, 28 May 2008 (UTC)

I'm not sure whether cute aortic syndrome shouldn't be merged with ortic dissection. Because that's basically what it is. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 05:31, 28 May 2008 (UTC)

 Respectfully, I disagree. &quot;Acute aortic dissection&quot; refers to a group of diseases that have some similarities in symptoms. Only one of the relevant diseases is aortic dissection. I have added a reference to the AAS article and clarified the lead. ser:Axl|Axl (ser talk:Axl|talk) 16:47, 28 May 2008 (UTC)

It is an attempt to push cute coronary syndrome into the aorta. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 16:59, 28 May 2008 (UTC)

 To &quot;push ACS into the aorta&quot;? Er, I don't understand. ser:Axl|Axl (ser talk:Axl|talk) 17:05, 28 May 2008 (UTC)
Since there's a variety of articles on pubmed (admittedly they seem to be middling-low quality), I'm inclined to leave it separate.  A reference discussing the two being the same would go a long way towards convincing me at least, can't speak for others.  I've not looked into references that are critical of it as a separate entity, and any critical articles would be good integration even if it stays separate.  ser:WLU|WLU (ser talk:WLU|talk) 22:32, 28 May 2008 (UTC)
