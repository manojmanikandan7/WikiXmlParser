Every wiki thinks that it needs more editors.  I don't think that we actually want to turn into a recruiting forum for any of them.

 orposcindosis 

This new article seems very problematic.  It defines a syndrome that gets no hits on Google Scholar or Pubmed.  A reference is given in the article which I can't check; the real source of the term seems to be an online petition at http : //www.petitiononline.com/consent/petition.html (address munged to get around blacklist).  I'm inclined to think the article should go where the woodbine twineth, and wonder if others have an opinion. ser:Looie496|Looie496 (ser talk:Looie496|talk) 04:09, 7 July 2009 (UTC)

Well, &quot;general paresis&quot; is one of the manifestations of late-stage eurosyphilis, although I think it's a rather outdated term (or maybe it's just become a rare entity).

 Redesign of FDA's website 

Dear all!

Since mid-2008 FDA is redesigning their website. As of June 2009 practically all document names and paths were altered without automatic redirects. I would estimate that hundreds of reference links in WP are affected and lead to an HTTP-404 error page. Unfortunatelly if in the linked reference the title of the document is not given, any attempt to find the resource at FDA's site is futile. Sometimes even giving the exact title of the document FDA's search page lead to electronic nirvana. :-(

Accessibility of the site is poor, since previously many documents existed in two versions: HTML and PDF - HTML-versions were removed in the majority of cases. Documents' titles often contained information whether the version was a draft (XXXXdft.pdf) or final (XXXXfnl.pdf). Such an information is lost in the new system, where all documents are of the type ucmXXXXXX.yyy or UCMXXXXXX.yyy. XXXXXX is a six digit number, yyy is the file extension (pdf, rarely htm). Cave: ucm and UCM are case-sensitive.

Some (funny?) examples (no links, only to show differences):

Document title:

ANDA CHECKLIST FOR CTD or eCTD FORMAT FOR COMPLETENESS and ACCEPTABILITY of an APPLICATION FOR FILING

old URL:

http://www.fda.gov/cder/ogd/anda_checklist.pdf

new URL:
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/ApprovalApplications/AbbreviatedNewDrugApplicationANDAGenerics/UCM154150.pdf

Formatting of Bioequivalence Summary Tables

old URLs:

DBE_tables.pdf
DBE_tables.doc

new URLs:
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/ApprovalApplications/AbbreviatedNewDrugApplicationANDAGenerics/UCM120957.pdf
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/ApprovalApplications/AbbreviatedNewDrugApplicationANDAGenerics/ucm120960.doc
(notice the different XXXXXX and ucm vs. UCM)

It would be nice if we could start to update these references before a deadlink-bot removes them (would be terribly bad, because without the old title you have no chance locating the new one at FDA). Please see this as an invitation, but don't expect too much help from myself - I'm quite busy cleaning up articles at my home-wiki (German WP).

Heads up! -- ser:Alfie66|Alfieser Talk:Alfie66|±Talk 15:43, 9 July 2009 (UTC)

First a query - is ucm reserved for .doc format and UCM for .pdf as seems case in examples given above, or is it random ?
The pattern ucmXXXXX.yyy applies to virtually all files regardless the type (though there are some exceptions, especially in the dockets-area of the site). I guess the lower/upper cases are random (pros at work).
As a quick test, this did not seem case-sensitive to me.
SUPAC-IR: Immediate-Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms: Scale-Up and Post-Approval Changes: Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls, In Vitro Dissolution Testing, and In Vivo Bioequivalence Documentation [http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm070636.pdf ucm070636.pdf] (small letters), SUPAC-MR: Modified Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms [http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM070640.pdf UCM070640.pdf] (capital letters). I used the links ‘as-is’ from FDA's site. But you are right, the call to the URL is not case-sensitive.
Perhaps a good moment to set up a l|FDAlink template to help with this and at least if in the future the FDA website folders are rearranged, then we can apply a quick fix (ie. apply single change to part of the template, but not if article XXXXXX numbers change).
I have no idea how the old 4-digit numbers relate to the new 6-digit numbers (I even tried to find a function whithout avail). Mainly older documents have lower numbers, but maybe they used a random generator in other cases. Example: the ood laboratory practice|GLP-rules from Sept 1987 exist in two formats: UCM133730.pdf and ucm072706.htm… See the system?
I envisage l|FDAlink might take following 4/5 parameters:
* Area - ie  &quot;Drug application&quot; in above examples
* Target - to specify ucm vs UCM if we must
* Article - the XXXXXX bit
* Display - for the article name we wish to show 
* accessdate - optional parameter
 Hence in last example: /nowiki&gt;FDAlink|Drug application|UCM|120957|DBE tables|2009-07-09
 might be shown as: ood and Drug Administration (United States)|FDA [http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/ApprovalApplications/AbbreviatedNewDrugApplicationANDAGenerics/UCM120957.pdf DBE tables]. Drug application. Accessed on ate|2009-07-09

Good idea. I'm only afraid if nobody starts editing the references, they will be removed. I think there's a bot for such cases, but since EN:WP is not my main wiki, I'm not sure.

This is probably a good job for a bot. [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Weblinkchecker.py The weblinkchecker script] could probably be tweaked to check all of the article-space links to *.fda.gov and collect the dead ones. From there, they'd probably need to be replaced or redirected by hand, which would be faster than trying to code the logic necessary to find the new link.

Actually, I think I can make headway on this tonight, hopefully without destroying Wikipedia via an accidental enial-of-service attack. It should be easy to pull all of the mainspace external links to *.fda.gov, check them for 04 errors, and throw the results into a tab-delimited text file or some sort of useful format.

Let me know how many different areas of the FDA website we're looking at - if a limited number then I can make that FDAlink template, but if folder/subfolder names are of a huge number then this will be one for hand coding/mrking up the links (which risks this all happening again at the next FDA website revamp) ser:Davidruben|David Ruben  ser talk:Davidruben|Talk  00:23, 10 July 2009 (UTC)

Got a response of the type “Thank you for your inquiry to the Division of Drug Information in Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug Administration. We are aware of the problem and will forward your inquiry blabla”. I don't think they will change anything in the near future (the old system was in place for 15 years). Funny enough that all PDFs I've came across at the FDA were not updated, i.e. embedded links end up in Nirvana as well.

 Update: list of broken links 
OK, I've put together a list of broken links to *.fda.gov from articlespace. See ser:MastCell/FDA links. There are a lot. Please feel free to jump in and fix or remove any (just cross them out and sign when you fix or verify them, so that your work isn't duplicated). Note that I wrote an automated tool to collect the links from Wikipedia and then test them - I haven't done it by hand - so it may be that some of the &quot;broken&quot; links actually &quot;work&quot;. They may have been too complex for my Python script, but parse-able by the average browser. Most these seem well and truly broken, though. I also included a list of all of FDA weblinks that returned redirects - these probably don't need &quot;fixing&quot;, because browsers handle them pretty seamlessly, but it may be worth verifying them as well. The broken links seem like the highest priority, though. ser:MastCell|MastCell ser Talk:MastCell|Talk 00:04, 12 July 2009 (UTC)
What a great job! I checked some 301-redirects and quite often they lead to the wrong place. Examples are mainly deep links to the old filestructure, where the redirect leads to the top level category. So we have to check them also.
A funny story from the front-line. [http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/AboutThisWebsite/WebsitePolicies/default.htm#linking FDA's policies] states: “FDA's preference is that people link to the material on the FDA site (rather than copying it to their personal Web sites) because the agency continuously updates the information on the Web site as better information becomes available.” I wanted to update a link on my site, but could not locate it in the file structure. I have the document on my HD, so had a lot of keywords available to feed the search page - but without success. On June 10th I asked for the new location. Yesterday I received an e-mail with the new resource and “As you may know, the agency is redesigning the website.  We apologize for the inconvenience. The center is deligently working to fix and restore the broken and problem links, etc. etc.” Sneeking into the source code I found out that the entire section [http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/NewsEvents/ucm167011.htm CDER Forum for International Drug Regulatory Authorities] was created on June 16th (six days after my request). Only documents from the [http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/NewsEvents/ucm167082.htm CDER Forum for International Drug Regulatory Authorities, April 14 - 18, 2008] are linked (I was asking for one of them). I have presentations from other years as well. Maybe FDA waits for other requests to fill up pages with content from their pile in the backyard. ;-) -- ser:Alfie66|Alfieser Talk:Alfie66|±Talk 15:03, 12 July 2009 (UTC) 
 Suggestion: template / bot 
What do you think about creating a (small!) template to be placed in affected articles inviting users to check links and note the change at ser:MastCell/FDA_links|FDA links? I would guess that many users don't even know about the problems yet, since they don't read T:MED. Though we could crate the template, we should leave the job of placing it in the articles to a silicon-based lifeform. ;-) -- ser:Alfie66|Alfieser Talk:Alfie66|±Talk 15:03, 12 July 2009 (UTC)

Let me start off by saying that I think there are so many editors doing a great job here at WikiProject Medicine.  However, IMHO, I would rate the overall comprehensiveness of medicine-related content as poor.  Taking my specific interest of skin conditions as an example, we are probably still missing articles on ~10% of the rarer cutaneous diseases, and of the articles we do have, many are merely stubs. ---ser:Kilbad|kilbad (ser talk:Kilbad|talk) 23:35, 12 July 2009 (UTC)

 azo compound CA risk removed

i don't really agree with this edit.  just because something isn't made doesnt mean that patients have not been exposed previously - also seems like historic info.  Anyone else getting my monitored by drug companies suspicion? I mean, monitor the tylenol article's history... sigh - wp is far from perfect...  —Preceding ikipedia:Signatures|unsigned comment added by pecial:Contributions/99.22.220.61|99.22.220.61 (ser talk:99.22.220.61|talk) 07:36, 9 July 2009 (UTC) 

Not really, but I'm starting to suspect that you don't quite grasp the fact that there are different types of azo dyes.  Just because &quot;this&quot; azo dye is associated with cancer doesn't mean that &quot;all&quot; azo dyes are.  It's like saying that &quot;drugs are bad, so I'll refuse everything to aspirin to anesthesia with the same vehemence that I would reject heroin and LSD.&quot;   ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:44, 9 July 2009 (UTC)
surely one should at least state that some azo compounds have historically been not only associated but have been proven to cause cancer - to go further would be to specify which ones those are, state them, and state if they are still in use (off market in usa doesnt mean off market everywhere.  —Preceding ikipedia:Signatures|unsigned comment added by pecial:Contributions/99.22.220.61|99.22.220.61 (ser talk:99.22.220.61|talk) 00:43, 10 July 2009 (UTC)

 Changes to popular pages lists 

There are a few important changes to the popular pages system. A quick summary:
* The &quot;importance&quot; ranking (for projects that use it) will be included in the lists along with assessment.
* The default list size has been lowered to 500 entries (from 1000)
* I've set up a project on the Toolserver for the popular pages - ools:~alexz/pop/.
** This includes a page to view the results for projects, including the in-progress results from the current month. Currently this can only show the results from a single project in one month. Features to see multiple projects or multiple months may be added later.
** This includes a new interface for making requests to add a new project to the list.
** There is also a form to request a change to the configuration for a project. Currently the configurable options are the size of the on-wiki list and the project subpage used for the list.
* The on-wiki list should be generated and posted in a more timely and consistent manner than before.
* The data is now retained indefinitely.
* The script used to generate the pages has changed. The output should be the same. Please report any apparent inconsistencies (see below).
* Bugs and feature requests should be reported using the Toolserver's bug tracker for &quot;alexz's tools&quot; - [https://jira.toolserver.org/browse/alexz]

 ibromyalgia 

Yes, I can hear the groans.  No, Guido isn't back.  However, this rather controversial article has been getting a lot of edits that could use educated oversight.  ser|RetroS1mone, a strong-willed editor with a strong point of view and limited English skills, has been making massive edits to the article with minimal discussion, and trampling over doubts expressed on the talk page.  In particular he is greatly increasing the weight given to the belief that FM is frequently faked.  He has shortened the article by over 10% today alone, and massively rearranged what is left, making it impossible for me to figure out what he has changed.  I hasten to admit that my knowledge of this syndrome is limited, and I'm probably going to bow out after bringing the issue here. ser:Looie496|Looie496 (ser talk:Looie496|talk) 02:46, 10 July 2009 (UTC)

While heavy-handed edits to controversial articles are likely to cause trouble, I think RetroS1mone could do with some assistance. This user does indeed have a strong POV but represents an important school of thought that is often delegitimised. On hronic fatigue syndrome it is apparently not politically correct to suggest that psychological factors predispose to the development of this condition. Clearly, the FM article is not being watched by the clutch of editors that do battle on CFS. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 16:51, 10 July 2009 (UTC)

I am happy for explaining my POV and it may be is not what people think. My POV is, syndromes of medically unexplained symptoms like in CFS, FM, GWI, IBS, Morgellons, chronic Lyme, they are medically unexplained!! My position, may be psychological factors are part of some, or not. May be, enterovirus infection causes one or some, or not. I do not know and the people that write medical literature do not know today. My number one POV is, Wiki should explain major view points like, some good doctors, scientists say psychological factors, other good doctors, scientists say enterovirus or what ever and there needs be MEDRS for all. The articles for these conditions, are very controversial and i think it is sad, more people with knowledge about the topics are not there but i understand why, patients and advocates can be uncivil when a person does not agree with there narrative of illness. My problem is, Wikipedia should show all from the significant medical view points about these conditions, also when patients and activists do not like. The view point of psychological factors is not much in these articles and do not say &quot;somatization&quot; or &quot;conversion disorder&quot; or o god &quot;hypochondriasis&quot; or &quot;malingering&quot; also when you have twenty MEDRS reviews or you need have armor on your head!! These terms have just so many MEDRS that they are part of the syndromes or in some people with the syndromes, like &quot;acceptable&quot; hypotheses now in the articles.
My other POV is, i like MEDRS for project medicine articles. Articles in project medicine w half of there sources primary literature, case studies, peoples blogs, they need be shortened more then 10% some times. ser:RetroS1mone|RetroS1mone ser talk:RetroS1mone|talk 02:07, 15 July 2009 (UTC)

Over the last year (mostly the CFS related pages), a significant proportion of RetroS1mone's edits have been successfully challenged on grounds of being original research and/or not properly presenting the sources. While RetroS1mone is indeed capable of good editing, their &quot;strong will&quot; and etiquette issues (which has at times bordered on rejudice), such editorial challenges have usually taken a disproportionate amount of time and effort just to have simple often trivial points conceded. All this has created a lot of work for other editors who struggle to keep up with all the drama. So yes, those who edit the fibromyalgia article should probably be concerned. JFW says psychological factors on the CFS article aren't &quot;politically correct&quot;. However, the reverse also seems true when the same skepticism displayed towards biological factors is directed towards psychological factors and the cognitive behavioural model. - ser: Tekaphor|Tekaphor (ser_talk: Tekaphor|TALK) 14:06, 20 July 2009 (UTC)

MR vaccine and MRV vaccine are good places to talk about administration and history of these combinations, but the individual vaccine components are developed independently, and are of interest to distinct audiences.

 Online Bolognia 

I had an idea, and wanted to know what the rest of the community thought.  I already own the following source, both in the paper and online form:

* ite book |author=Bolognia, Jean L.; et al. |title=Dermatology |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=1-4160-2999-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=

However, today the publisher gave me an activation code for a complimentary year of access to the online version of this source.  Therefore, I was thinking, since I already have online access, perhaps I could set up a general account that any of us could use for the next year.  All I would need is an e-mail and password to create the login, after which we could all share.  What do you all think of this idea?  I just figured it would be nice for all of us to have access to this awesome $400 text.  However, of course, the overall goal would be to improve the dermatology-related content on wikipedia. ---ser:Kilbad|kilbad (ser talk:Kilbad|talk) 22:55, 22 July 2009 (UTC)
*It would be useful, but alas is probably against the rules / law. I had some brief thought's a while back - I suspect most editors without access to papers and journals have. There was a slight possibility wikipedia could create an account as an institution, which normally costs thousands - this would require funding and probably be on a yearly basis so unless wikipedia becomes rich enough to afford this in perpetuity. Whether a journal would grant wikipedia enstatement as an institute would be another issue - I'm not sure how their business model operates , but if wikipedians had access, then there's nothingstopping anyone wanting a paper creating a WP account and getting it that way. On the flip side the gains to a journal of being referenced must be having some effects on their value - so it might be in their interests to give us access. Maybe we should ask one of them their position ...ser:leevanjackson|L∴V 23:29, 22 July 2009 (UTC)

Wikidoc is under license GNU Free Documentation License 1.2.  The cardiologist who runs it is interested in becoming a sister project.  Have asked him about the possibility of changing his license.

One method of collaboration I was thinking might work is creating pages on topics directed towards the general public and pages directed towards physicians.  Editing of the pages for physicians could be protected from edits by IPs thus decreasing vandalism and hopefully attracting more editing by physicians from other wikis such as wikidocs and medpedia.

Have invited both project to come and comment here on other ways we can collaborate.  Wikidocs by the way has changed their license to CC/SA 3.0.  --ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) 14:02, 20 July 2009 (UTC)

Hi. Mike Gibson the Editor in Chief of WikiDoc here. We are eager to collaborate! We have adapted the same license (still working on changing the logo). We have people working on patient based pages at WikiPatient and docs working on physician level content at WikiDoc. We have others working on a differential diagnosis project where the wiki has searched itself to generate a list of causes of different signs and symptoms.  This appears as a box on an expanding number of pages. We have also begun a clinical trial component to the site. Mike Gibson ser:C. Michael Gibson|C. Michael Gibson (ser talk:C. Michael Gibson|talk) 14:42, 20 July 2009 (UTC)

Hi Mike, and welcome to Wikipedia.
Doc James, I don't think that Wikipedia will agree to semi-protect a whole class of pages just to keep anon IPs from editing them.  Furthermore, it's likely to reduce the willingness of some desirable editors from trying out Wikipedia.  Nearly all editors started off as an anon before bothering with setting up an account.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 20:01, 20 July 2009 (UTC)

We have not restricted anon IPs at WikiDoc and we have encountered only very mild vandalism.ser:C. Michael Gibson|C. Michael Gibson (ser talk:C. Michael Gibson|talk) 22:16, 20 July 2009 (UTC) I therefore agree that restricting anon IPs would not be a good idea. We would need a group of dedicated editors to monitor any vandalism.

Dr Gibson, I'm not sure if the aims of Wikipedia and WikiDoc are quite compatible. Wikipedia's medical articles are aimed at the layperson but aim to cover enough information to satisfy the needs of professionals to an extent. WikiDoc deliberately introduces a dichotomy. Are you sure that a differential diagnosis engine won't be looking a bit like what Wrongdiagnosis.com is trying to sell to the public? ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 22:55, 20 July 2009 (UTC)

 treatment of panic disorder - regional difference in guidelines 

It seems that the US guidelines (APA) recommend benzodiazepines for the treatment of anic disorder while the UK guidelines from NICE state that they are not recommended and are best avoided.  See the discussion alk:Panic disorder#Medications section on panic disorder copied from talk page and edits of anic disorder.  This might be a regional variation in clinical practice.

 Medical illustrations at Wikimedia 

I just stumbled on some excellent creative commons medical illustrations on wikimedia, by an illustrator/cardiologist team 
[http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ASearch&amp;redirs=1&amp;search=Patrick+J.+Lynch%2C+medical+illustrator&amp;fulltext=Search&amp;ns0=1&amp;ns6=1&amp;ns12=1&amp;ns14=1 Patrick J. Lynch, medical illustrator; C. Carl Jaffe, MD, cardiologist.]

These are far better than the muddy Gray's Anatomy scans that illustrate many WP articles. It looks like Frank Netter raised the bar for medical illustrations. They're mostly cardiology, but a few others. Does anybody know how to find other especially good medical illustrations on Wikimedia?  

There are two problems with Gray's Anatomy, IMO: (1) While the original plates are beautiful, they don't scan too well on ordinary equipment, and I haven't seen a reproduction on the Internet where I could even read the captions clearly. In fact, even the best printed reproductions aren't too good. They weren't designed to be screened for dots. (2) Gray's Anatomy was descriptive, in a commendable 19th century style, and what you got was what you saw on the dissecting table, but a good medical illustration for didactic purposes should show you the medical point of what you're explaining. A good example is the eft atrial appendage (recently in the news). I couldn't even see it in Gray's (understandable, since there's so much to see in the heart). Lynch drew a picture of the left atrial appendage which showed you what was going on. (And back in Gray's day, the coronary arteries were of theoretical interest, since there wasn't anything you could do about them, so they didn't deserve that much attention.) --ser:Nbauman|Nbauman (ser talk:Nbauman|talk) 16:29, 24 July 2009 (UTC)
A large portion of Frank Netters stuff was published in 1948 which means that its copyright expires in 2043.

Using non-disabling language is certainly important to me, it is inappropriate to refer to someone who has an ASD as someone who &quot;suffers from autism&quot;, or similar. See [http://www.nas.org.uk/nas/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=243&amp;a=4293 What to say (and not to say) about autism]; from the ational Autistic Society, and this NYT article: [http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/20/health/20autism.html?_r=1 How About Not 'Curing' Us, Some Autistics Are Pleading]. ser:Whatever404|Whatever404 (ser talk:Whatever404|talk) 18:23, 26 July 2009 (UTC)
I don't think it makes sense to call the article Obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorder.  The article refers to a proposal that various existing conditions can be described as existing on an obsessive-compulsive spectrum, with individual disorders identified as candidates for the proposed spectrum being referred to as obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders.  There is no one &quot;obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorder&quot;.  Therefore, I think it makes more sense for the article to be titled obsessive-compulsive spectrum, just as utism spectrum and ipolar spectrum are. 
As I was writing this, I saw that Eubulides has moved the page to bsessive–compulsive spectrum.  Good.  As far as I can see, the matter is resolved. ser:Whatever404|Whatever404 (ser talk:Whatever404|talk) 18:48, 26 July 2009 (UTC)
 Since the literature far more commonly uses the term &quot;Obsessive–compulsive spectrum disorder&quot;, with the trailing &quot;disorder&quot; (often pluralized), it appears that we still have a problem. Let's discuss this at alk:Obsessive–compulsive spectrum #Article title|Talk:Obsessive–compulsive spectrum #Move to unrecognized name before doing further renaming. ser:Eubulides|Eubulides (ser talk:Eubulides|talk) 19:00, 26 July 2009 (UTC)

I independently ran into this problem before seeing the above discussion. I found zero hits at Google scholar on the phrase &quot;Obsessive compulsive spectrum proposal&quot;. The word &quot;proposal&quot; is clear editorializing and has to be removed from the title as per P:NPOV, so I renamed the article accordingly. I also fixed the hyphen to be an endash, as per P:ENDASH. I followed up at alk:Obsessive–compulsive spectrum #Article title|Talk:Obsessive–compulsive spectrum #Move to unrecognized name.

 Report on broken FDA links 

Just an update to say that we've fixed almost 200 of the dead FDA links, representing about 10% of what needs to be done.

Yes, it's tedious and unglamorous work, but many hands make light work, and I really appreciate the couple of people that are still plugging away at it.  

Links to the FDA and similar websites are a really important component of WPMED's efforts to promote verifiable, mainstream medical information.  If you're willing to invest two minutes in this goal, please go to ser:MastCell/FDA_links and pick any item.  Click the link to the article (to find out what the link supposedly says) and the link to the old FDA page.  

* Some of the links are dead and gone, in which case, you may want to change the link to the backup on http://web.archive.org/ (use |archiveurl= and |archivedate= for P:CITET|citation templates; otherwise, just change the URL).
* Some of the links are 'dead', but the FDA's search engine will &quot;suggest&quot; a page.  So far, the suggestions have always been precisely the page I'm looking for.  Change the old URL to the new one. 
* Some of the links, particularly in the &quot;permanently moved&quot; list, are 'live' (they take you directly to the page you wanted), and all you have to do is paste the updated URL into the new article.

After you fix a URL, please use strikeout to let everyone know which link has been fixed.

Please also consider putting MastCell's list on your watchlist, setting it as your default browser page, or doing whatever it would take to keep this page in your mind for the next few weeks.  Even if you're willing and able to fix just one link a day, your help is both good for the encyclopedia and a big morale booster for everyone else involved.

Hi MastCell and all!I'm not that optimistic about FDA's 301-redirects. In many (most?) of cases the redirect does not lead to the original document, but to a website somewhere up in the file structure. Example: the original link http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/comp/guidance/938.pdf in the article erification and validation redirects to [http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/default.htm Guidance Documents (Medical Devices)], whereas the [http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm085371.pdf correct document] can only be found after searching at the redirected page (there's no direct reference given)… The worst I've experienced until now was three levels above the target document.

Thanks, WhatamIdoing. In fact, James already did a pretty good peer review.

The only other major contribution from a Good Article review would be to remove any leaps of thought that would be perfectly logical for a working medic but possibly test the understanding of the uninitiated (e.g. the concept of osmotic dehydration, which a medic applies without a second thought). ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 13:03, 2 August 2009 (UTC)

 ECA stack 

I'd like to ask for a few eyes on CA stack. One account has made dozens of edits that have moved the article in a direction which I think is iffy. Specifically, I think the article selectively cites primary literature to claim that ephedrine, caffeine, and aspirin are safe and effective for weight loss, while downplaying the well-known adverse effects and deaths that led ephedra to be banned in many countries. But I may be oversensitive, or just wrong, and I won't be editing much in the near future.

 ünchausen by Internet 

I have found this at the psychology project and good article nomination.

To clarify, the literature on it and the article states that it is a manifestation of factitious disorder and factitious disorder by proxy, communicated online instead of in person. I've not written a med article, but I welcome suggestions on making this adhere to MEDMOS. Garrondo proposed this on my talk page, and I went to see the MEDMOS style guidelines, but I'm not sure what to change based on what little info the sources provide.

 Idiopathy in all its forms 

As the result of a recent discussion on the edically unexplained physical symptoms article, I've come to the realization that we have at least three articles on Wikipedia that deal in some manner with conditions or illnesses of unknown origin:

*tiology
*diopathic
*edically unexplained physical symptoms

I'm thinking that these articles should be merged into one (though &quot;Etiology&quot; covers a broader definition, so only the appropriate section should be merged).  Does anybody have any opinions on this? --ser:RobinHood70|RobinHood70 (ser talk:RobinHood70|talk) 17:30, 3 August 2009 (UTC)

The MUPS article is really a very specific entity that cannot easily be merged. There's a large body of research into this specific field, with its epistemological difficulties (lumpers vs splitters, mind vs body).
tiology and diopathic are essentially dictionary definitions with lots of extra luggage. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 18:51, 3 August 2009 (UTC)

Idiopathic does not mean &quot;of unknown origin&quot; despite what you may have read countless times; that is what &quot;cryptogenic&quot; means. Idiopathic means &quot;of its own disease&quot;. The distinction is important in the classification of epilepsy syndromes, for example, but the confusion these words carry with them mean that the ILAE is apparently phasing them out wrt epilepsy classification. Most idiopathic epilepsy syndromes are genetic and  some have a known defect. Even if/when we discover all the defects that cause these syndromes, they will remain idiopathic. The point is that the defect causes epilepsy alone, and not some other syndrome with epilepsy as a component. ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 19:21, 3 August 2009 (UTC)

Interesting distinction in the terminology.  As far as the MUPS article goes, I'm inclined to agree that it seems to be a field of study of its own, but we're having the issue right now on the article that it's being used in a number of articles to replace the term &quot;unknown cause&quot; or similar wording, and it's hard to define when that's a reasonable substitution and when it isn't.  I think that was what lead me to suggest that they be merged, to perhaps address the ambiguity by (as an example) having an Idiopathy (or Cryptogeny/Cryptogenic) article, with MUPS as a section within it.  I'm not sure that's necessarily the best approach, but it was what I was thinking at the time, given my lack of understanding of the terminology. --ser:RobinHood70|RobinHood70 (ser talk:RobinHood70|talk) 19:36, 3 August 2009 (UTC)

These look like P:BLP to me. We had a long discussion about case histories wrt rown-Sequard Syndrome a while back and ending moving them all to wikibooks [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Neurology_and_Neurosurgery/Incomplete_Spinal_Cord_Injuries/Brown-Séquard_syndrome] .-ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) 00:08, 7 August 2009 (UTC)

Well, Summer Stiers died a little while ago, so BLP no longer applies in that instance.  
But my (thoroughly undeveloped) thought is that individual cases of inexplicable (probably undescribed) diseases certainly exist, and that it might be good to have a label and an article (or section of an article) for them.  
We don't want to classify them as MUPS, because they aren't MUPS, even though they are &quot;medically unexplained&quot; (so far) and involve &quot;physical symptoms&quot;.  We don't seem to have an ndiagnosed disease article (and I'm not sure what the right name for it would be, anyway).  I thought that it might be useful to contrast MUPS (which seems to be turning into a term of the art that isn't just plain &quot;unexplained symptoms&quot;) with this sort of idea.  Perhaps a new section, ymptoms#Unexplained, or are disease#Undescribed?  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 03:32, 7 August 2009 (UTC)

If possible, I lean toward using terms already in use over terms that may be unique to Wikipedia.  The NIH program is called &quot;undiagnosed diseases&quot;.

I always like using a term that can be sourced to something, so that's a good suggestion.  [http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/Resources.aspx?PageID=31 The NIH program's webiste] is a plausible source.

What do you (or anyone else) think about that?  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 19:35, 7 August 2009 (UTC)

Just as a general, non-medical opinion, I would say that a section in are diseases sounds like the place to start, perhaps with a redirect from &quot;Undiagnosed diseases&quot;, and then if the section gets unwieldy, it can always be expanded into an article of its own later on. --ser:RobinHood70|RobinHood70 (ser talk:RobinHood70|talk) 19:37, 7 August 2009 (UTC)
   There are many conditions which, while formally not-all-that rare, can go undiagnosed for decades.  I just read are diseases (of which the last sentence doesn't make sense, BTW) and was happy to see that the term is defined very widely in the article at present.  Therefore I agree that the proposed section can be a part of that article. - ser:Hordaland|Hordaland (ser talk:Hordaland|talk) 23:27, 7 August 2009 (UTC)

This is now more than just the Rorschach.  Several editors are starting to put test materials on other psychological tests, such as Rey Complex Figures, and Wisconsin Card Sort.  The norms for these tests will be invalidated by this, as although some of the material is out on the net, nothing is quite as accessible as Wikipedia.  This is going to mean that Neuropsych departments have to allocate more budget money to different tests, or that services will be reduced and patient care will suffer.  The argument is that people deserve access to information, but I think the comparison is to medications. We put information about medications out there, but we keep the medications in a locked cabinet. Discussing the test is one thing - putting the test materials on is another. It is not necessary for the purpose of the discussion. These tests are used to help with patient care.

 &quot;Dermatomes&quot; in ngina pectoris 

ngina pectoris currently says: Apart from chest discomfort, anginal pains may also be experienced in the pigastrium (upper central abdomen), back, neck, jaw, or shoulders, following skin ermatomes.

ermatomes redirects to ermatome (anatomy), which says:A dermatome is an area of kin that is mainly supplied by a single pinal nerve. There are eight ervical nerves, twelve horacic nerves, five umbar nerves and five acral nerves. Each of these nerves relays sensation (including pain) from a particular region of skin to the rain. ... Dermatomes are useful in neurology for finding the site of damage to the spine. Because painful dermatomes are symptoms, not causes, of the underlying problem, surgery should never be determined by a pain. Aching in a dermatomic area indicates a lack of oxygen to the nerve as occurs in inflammation somewhere along the path of the nerve. 
(ermatome (anatomy) also gives a &quot;see also&quot; to the disamb page ermatome, which lists ermatome (instrument), ermatome (anatomy), and utis plate)


I assume that the intended meaning is not &quot;anginal pains may be experienced following areas of skin&quot;.I can make a guess or two what's meant, but am not really be sure.Can this please be clarified in ngina pectoris and ermatome (anatomy) as appropriate?

 Montmorillonite clay - medicinal use 

There's an unusual situation now with the article ontmorillonite. If one looks at the Talk Page there, almost all of the discussion and interest is about the medicinal use of this clay. And yet, the article, itself, has no mention of medicinal use! The ser:Vsmith keeps deleting anything in reference to this (such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Montmorillonite&amp;curid=1501608&amp;diff=306876584&amp;oldid=306827212 here]).

Wikipedia is supposed, at least in some way, to reflect the interests of users and editors. So why is this not happening with this article?

Also, a quick search of PubMed shows 2256 results for 'Montmorillonite' -- so this clay is obviously widely used in medicine and pharmacology. Thus, it looks like the behaviour of user Vsmith goes both against science and popular opinion.

Does anyone have any suggestion how this situation may be remedied? ser:Dyuku|Dyuku (ser talk:Dyuku|talk) 21:43, 10 August 2009 (UTC)

 Medical cannabis 

Dear all!
More than 50 edits of the article edical cannabis within the last three days were close to an edit war. I think the article needs a general overhaul. IMHO the article is far from P:NPOV and contains a lot of unproven assertions, speculations, etc. The article currently is 93kB long, which also calls for some chimney sweeping. I added some quality-templates and hope for assistance. -- ser:Alfie66|Alfieser Talk:Alfie66|±Talk 22:42, 10 August 2009 (UTC)

It looks like the big question at the moment is whether &quot;formally regulated pharamaceutical products derived from cannabis&quot; should be covered in the same article as &quot;go smoke some pot, if you've got a problem with nausea&quot;.  Perhaps some editors here will have an opinion.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 20:11, 17 August 2009 (UTC)

 Bot to tag deadlinks? 

About ser:MastCell/FDA links (I know, you were just on your way to do your bit, but now I've distracted you ;-)

Is there a bot that we could send off to find and tag deadlinks specifically within the FDA.gov website?  It might get some extra hands involved, as editors at individual articles might search for the updated links.  

Ideally, the bot would leave an explanatory note on the article's talk page as well, so that the editors realize that nearly all of the pages are still on the website, just at a different URL.   ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:05, 17 August 2009 (UTC)

 Wonderful idea! Whoever creates a silicon based-lifeform, a suggestion: the note should also include as message to also  delete the link after the update from ser:MastCell/FDA links. Sometimes (OK, very rarely) I started off for an article and found the link already corrected, or even worse simply removed. That meant digging into the history page. ;-)For specialist only: see ser:MastCell/FDA_links#BBS|here how to deal with archived pages. —ser:Alfie66|Alfieser Talk:Alfie66|±Talk 18:51, 17 August 2009 (UTC)

I've formatted your list to make it a bit easier to read.
Your first task is to P:ORG|demonstrate 'notability' according to Wikipedia's notions, which means showing that a somebody outside the company noticed its existence.  The first handful of links are probably useless for this purpose (although they're P:RS|good for writing the article), since they're all either directly or indirectly written by the company/the owners/the marketing department's press releases.  
You've got a chance with the PubMed Central article, even though one of the four authors is with the company.  The CEO interview is a good, basic &quot;news&quot;(ish) piece, and that will also help quite a bit.  The NCCN and NQF stuff might help, but wouldn't be sufficient on their own.  
It's helpful (to the people that try to very quickly review every new article) if your first sentence or two has some sort of &quot;claim to fame&quot;, complete with a good P:RS|reliable source to support it.  For example, Zynx seems to make software that (by my calculation, and note that I'm not a reliable source ;-) is used by something like 30% of US hospitals.  
In developing the article, you'll definitely want to mention the research (invoking the PubMed Central article), and obviously a section on the company's history, including founding and ownership, is appropriate.  
There's also some general advice at ikipedia:Your first article that you might want to look over.  
If you want, you can start the article in your userspace (click here:  ser:JoeShmo3000/Zynx); generally, people won't speedy-delete userspace pages that are just getting started.  If you decide to take that route, then at some point you'll want to P:MOVE|move the page to its real name (which is very easy).  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 05:56, 19 August 2009 (UTC)

Hi WhatamIdoing, this is all very helpful. (Thanks for formatting!)I think I mentioned that I had already created the page and it was deleted. If I create the page again in my userspace and then move it to the real name wouldn't it just be deleted again? I was told not to try to recreate this page which is why I came here to see if this part of wiki would accept it--I feel like it belongs here. I know now not to use the company's web site as a reference but my previous attempt just got speedy deleted so I had no chance of making any corrections. 

There was one other citation I didn't add, it was the Outsell (an independent party) Market Research report that names Zynx as the market share leader, so wouldn't that show notability? The only problem is that although I can link to this article, no one can infact read it unless they pay the hefty price for it. I myself have read a copy of it which is why I know.

Apparently, the selection criteria are &quot;makes people stare (or wonder)&quot; and &quot;not too many people have it&quot;.  Discussions about formalizing the criteria have gone nowhere, and the most recent suggestion was to add pilepsy, on the grounds that watching some kinds of seizures is distressing to bystanders.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 21:48, 21 August 2009 (UTC)

To be fair to Hillpna, I've read some new sources and re-read some old ones, and I believe I was off in some of my original issues with the page.  It's a very confusing issue, not helped by the pharmacies advocating for BHRT and even peer-reviewed literature mixing bioidentical with compounding and a dash of pharmanoia.  There are still problems of coatracking and syntheses waiting in the background, but there is also a need to clarify a lot of what is already cited.  I would still dearly love some extra input, I still think Hillpna has jumped the gun and does not grasp the essence a lot of applicable policies, but I think I have a firmer grasp of some of his/her objections and there is some merit to them (though an overly aggressive protection of the old version doesn't help his/her case or any readers).  ser:WLU|WLU ser talk:WLU|(t) pecial:Contributions/WLU|(c) Wikipedia's rules:P:SIMPLE|simple/P:POL|complex 15:25, 26 August 2009 (UTC)

 Article suggestion: death's approach 

Hi all. I really appreciate your work here.

I looked through the topics related to death, and found there was a gap where I was hoping I'd find an article. I think it would be good to have an article on what happens to the body before death, for example, in terminal illness. There is a terminal-illness article, but it focusses more on the logistics than the physical/medical perspective; there's a stub about &quot;death rattle&quot;, which is one aspect of what I'm talking about, but it's specific, not exhaustive.

Maybe no one's thought to write one because as a society we just don't like to think or talk about the subject, but I think it is worthwhile information to have, and I know I'd appreciate the information.

Thanks!  —Preceding ikipedia:Signatures|unsigned comment added by pecial:Contributions/74.12.215.28|74.12.215.28 (ser talk:74.12.215.28|talk) 15:25, 23 August 2009 (UTC)

&quot;What happens to the body&quot; probably depends a lot on the specific cause of death.

Hi Pgallert,
Thanks for your note.  The &quot;two concerns&quot; appear to be a suggestion for a different name and a request for copyediting this grammatically correct article for greater concision.  Neither of these require the input of very many editors, and neither of them are really terribly important in the grand scheme of things.
IMO, if you don't get an active objection to moving the page, then you should simply P:BOLD|be bold and do it yourself.  As for copyediting, I'm not even sure that it deserves a l|Copyedit template:  it's really not that bad, despite one editor saying that parts of it are (or were) a bit repetitive.  I suspect that this comment can be safely ignored.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:20, 1 September 2009 (UTC)
 End of life care 

Prompted by a Daily Telegraph article [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/6127514/Sentenced-to-death-on-the-NHS.html] on the iverpool Care Pathway, I was surprised to find that we don't seem to have a general article on nd-of-life care.

Such an article might usefully cover some of the issues which can seem quite controversial - for example, removal of artificial hydration (cf [https://www.nursingtimes.net/clinical-archive/end-of-life-and-palliative-care/providing-hydration-at-the-end-of-life-ethics-and-practice-09-12-2008/]); as well as providing context and better framing for articles like erminal sedation; recommended reduced monitoring, medication and intervention; and general issues of best management and caring, such as those the LCP checklists try to prompt.

But, IMO as an uninformed layman, this is not an article to be created by an uninformed amateur; any such article would need to be created by professionals, that know their stuff.  ser:Jheald|Jheald (ser talk:Jheald|talk) 16:45, 3 September 2009 (UTC)

Wikipedia is written largely by amateurs, and you should feel free to find a couple of good P:RS|reliable sources and do whatever you can.  I suspect that you already know enough to start the article, and even a P:STUB|stub of just a couple of sentences and one good reference is a big help.  Please give it a try.  When you've done as much as you can, perhaps someone else will want to add their bit.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:02, 3 September 2009 (UTC)

End-of-life care and alliative care are effectively synonyms, although palliative care is spreading into the realm of symptom control in general. Perhaps we need a redirect to start with. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 20:04, 3 September 2009 (UTC)

 BDNF associated with many conditions ? 

can someone please have a look at all these edits from me [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Earlypsychosis] (the psychiatric conditions, not melbourne gangland war!) and then the undos [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Nutriveg].  I removed the DNF sentence added by ser|Beland on a number of articles (schizophrenia, dementia, anorexia, bulimia, etc ) - I first added act for some articles, but then read the article that ser|Beland directed me to and found no reference to all the conditions listed.  ser|Nutriveg has undone some of my changes [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Nutriveg].  Some of these are okay with a relevant sources - such as the one on Rett [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rett_syndrome&amp;action=history], but this scource for ulimia is simply a RCT with no mention of BDNF that I can see [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bulimia_nervosa&amp;action=history].  ser:Earlypsychosis|Earlypsychosis (ser talk:Earlypsychosis|talk) 20:46, 3 September 2009 (UTC)
I support removing those sentences as the first step -- Beland simply added the same vague sentence to eight articles, with no sourcing or discussion.  In cases like that, the only reasonable approach is to remove the material -- it can't be right for something that took one editor two minutes to do should force other editors to spend two hours fixing.

You're still left with a due-weight problem for the disease articles:  If you can't find a paper primarily about the disease that discusses BDNF (such as a review paper on bulimia, not a review paper on BDNF), then Wikipedia's article about the disease probably shouldn't refer to BDNF.  
The BDNF article itself doesn't suffer from this problem, as any good paper that is primarily about BDNF could obviously be useful in writing Wikipedia's article about BDNF.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 22:28, 4 September 2009 (UTC)

 Status of l|Infobox Medical Person? 

This template is rarely used, but I think it would be helpful for the usual reasons.  Perhaps the name of the template is too unwieldy?  Also, it isn't listed at ikipedia:WikiProject_Medicine#Templates or at ikipedia:Manual_of_Style_(medicine-related_articles)#Infoboxes. ser:Viriditas|Viriditas (ser talk:Viriditas|talk) 00:11, 3 September 2009 (UTC)
The template name is unwieldy.  However, the reason it has not come up here before is probably because this project tends not to include articles about medical people in its scope.  The current assessment guidelines state to tag a page with l|WPMED &quot;only if the person is notable for substantial contributions to medicine.&quot;  I would guess that most medical people are notable (and thus included in Wikipedia) for reasons other than substantially contributing to the field of medicine.  Instead, they are covered by ikipedia:WikiProject Biography/Science and academia and tagged with lx|WikiProject Biography |s&amp;a-work-group=yes. --ser:Scottalter|Scott Alter 01:57, 3 September 2009 (UTC)
That's the general theory, but in practice, the topical WikiProjects do the work.  In other words, the biography project doesn't exactly have it together.  In any case, I added this template to niru Conteh and just submitted a peer review.  I would appreciate an assessment of the article by this project, any corrections and criticism, or recommendations for expansion, or even major contributions.  Ideally, I would like to go into detail about Conteh's clinical approach to treating Lassa fever, and the status of the ward after his death, and the new role of the Mano River Union Lassa Fever Network.  There appears to be an update regarding the ward (and the network) in one or two journals that I don't have access to, particularly ntiviral Research 78 (1):103-115, and possibly a few others. Jessica Melone (I believe she is currently employed by the NIH) includes some of this information in a PPT presentation[http://distance.jhsph.edu/more/capstoneMaterials2009/winter/Melone_Jessica.ppt] with references at the end, but without footnotes, it's hard to tell where to find it.

Most of the references were about biology and glutathione but were made to talk about supplements when refs were not about supplements, hence misuse of refs.--ser:Literaturegeek|Literaturegeek | ser_talk:Literaturegeek |T@1k? 18:51, 9 September 2009 (UTC)
I wrote most of this article. I would support the consensus Wikipedia editors. I agree that definitions must be supported by consensus. The definition of &quot;glutathione supplement&quot; seems to be at issue. To have it include any supplement that might be used with the intention of increasing or supporting glutathione function may be too broad. (ser:Entropy7|Entropy7 (ser talk:Entropy7|talk) 19:55, 9 September 2009 (UTC))

I think Nutriveg is saying it is hard to discuss content that is not in the current version of the article.  Nutriveg, you can link to past versions of the article, link to diffs of the article, and copy chunks of text from any version of the article to the talk page.  I agree with Entropy7 that the heart of the problem is a mismatch between article title and content, not misuse of references.  I also agree with other editors that the content in the disputed article belongs in the other article.  Making lutathione supplements a redirect is a first step, but perhaps some content prior to the redirect does remain to be merged into the article lutathione. --ser:Una Smith|Una Smith (ser talk:Una Smith|talk) 20:27, 9 September 2009 (UTC)

Not all of the refs were misused and there is some content that is worth merging. There are relevant refs I thought that it had been or was going to be merged into the main glutathione article? Ref one,[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12818476] was cited 5 times to make statements about supplements but the ref was not talking about supplements. The main glutathione article is still a bit small and is quite a way off needing to be split, so would not oppose relevant info being merged into it.--ser:Literaturegeek|Literaturegeek | ser_talk:Literaturegeek |T@1k? 21:08, 9 September 2009 (UTC)

You made a very poor reading of that Wikipedia article introduction (&quot;either increase glutathione levels or increase effectiveness of glutathione mediated processes&quot;) since the reference you cited is clearly ontopic: &quot;an imbalance in expression of GSH and associated enzymes has been implicated in a variety of circumstances (...) Polymorphic expression of enzymes involved in GSH homeostasis  influences susceptibility and progression&quot;.--ser:Nutriveg|Nutriveg (ser talk:Nutriveg|talk) 22:03, 9 September 2009 (UTC)

I mean it's on topic because those enzymes fits the article topic by that article introduction. It's well known that glutathione is reduced by the onset of many diseases, so supplementation is likely to be effective in those conditions. I can't search for a source right now but it's clear you don't know the subject you're talking about.--ser:Nutriveg|Nutriveg (ser talk:Nutriveg|talk) 22:23, 9 September 2009 (UTC)

This statement is original research, &quot;so supplementation is likely to be effective in those conditions&quot;. I accept that glutathione is reduced in many diseases, however, correlation does not mean causation,,, meaning glutathione may be a symptom of a disease process but correction of glutathione levels may do nothing for the symptoms or disease. This is what I mean by speculation and original research. I admit I do not know much about the subject matter, but if you have references which say what you are saying then great. By the way, I am not your enemy, although it may seem that way and I am not rabidly anti-supplements, was just opposed to original research and what I perceived to be misuse of a couple of refs. If it is any consolation when I first joined wikipedia I made a lot of mistakes, using poor sources and even misinterpreting a few of them and even original research on some occasions. I am sure that a compromise can be found. :)--ser:Literaturegeek|Literaturegeek | ser_talk:Literaturegeek |T@1k? 22:43, 9 September 2009 (UTC)
&quot;So supplementation is likely to work&quot; is not just P:OR, but is well beyond any high-quality source I've seen in the last few years.  AFAIK, the most charitable interpretation of available data is that glutathione supplementation is at the &quot;plausible hypothesis that needs rigorous testing&quot; stage.  A less charitable reading is &quot;When we blind the trials properly, we're not seeing a benefit beyond placebo.&quot;
Supplementation is known not to be useful in other similar situations:  e.g., most Calcium deficiencies are not usefully treated by taking an oral Calcium supplement (even when the supplement includes Vitamin D).  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 06:11, 10 September 2009 (UTC)
&quot;So supplementation is likely to work&quot; was my comment about that phrase, (&quot;Glutathione supplementation has been shown to increase plasma glutathione levels in different diseases&quot;) since I couldn't pick a source at that time to use its own words. The phrase was specific about &quot;plasma glutathione levels&quot; which makes it even more plausible. Now I picked a [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11168457 source] that explicit says that in the abstract (I don't know if the previous one already did in its content) and we can all be happy. 
The problem here is that the ikipedia:Editing policy says one shouldn't delete content in that situation only if it's &quot;patent nonsense&quot; or after a act was used. It didn't sound as &quot;patent nonsense&quot; to me and those that deleted it (at least Literaturegeek by his own words) didn't know the subject. So you complete deleted that newcomer contribution soly by assuming bad faith, that all that text was about promoting some specific branded product.
PS: About calcium supplementation I've sources that support a different POV than yours, please inform me in which wikipedia article they are not well represented.--ser:Nutriveg|Nutriveg (ser talk:Nutriveg|talk) 15:22, 10 September 2009 (UTC)
The problem is whether you're looking at biomarkers or practical clinical outcomes.  Sure:  eating glutathione supplementation raises the amount of glutathione in the body.  
But does it improve practical outcomes?  No -- not as far as anyone can make out, at the moment.  For example, many women take Calcium to reduce the risk of hip fractures due to osteoporosis.  Eating Calcium increases the amount of Calcium in the body.  But does it work?  Not really:  Women who take Calcium supplements and women who do not either end up with basically the same number of hip fractures due to osteoporosis, or they prevent the hip fracture at the cost of a heart attack[http://www.nhs.uk/news/2007/january08/pages/calciumpillsandheartrisk.aspx].  There are various theories:  e.g., perhaps the extra Calcium blocks Phosphorus absorption.  (Both are needed for healthy bones.) 
Just improving the biomarker doesn't make people healthier.  We need to be careful about claiming that something &quot;works&quot;, because the average reader is going to interpret that as &quot;has a practical benefit to daily life&quot;, not &quot;improves some number on a lab test&quot;.  And, in case you weren't aware, on Tuesday, this article said &quot;Glutathione supplementation has been shown to affect the prograssion or treatment of Parkinsons disease[1], HIV[2][1], cystic fibrosis[3][1], liver disease[1] and cancer[4][5],&quot; which is a clear claim of practical benefit that isn't even slightly supported by the named sources, most of which explicitly disclaim any practical benefit.  For example, the HIV source says that GSH levels increased, but T4 counts, etc., all remained the same.  Based on this information, a reasonable person would conclude that GSH has zero effect on HIV disease.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 19:53, 10 September 2009 (UTC)
I won't discuss Calcium here since it's offtopic. By the way &quot;Calcium deficiencies&quot; is different than &quot;bone health&quot;, if someone has a bone disease when the cause is not low serum levels of calcium (which can be exam checked) it's unlikely that kind of supplementation will help the outcome of that disease.
As I said before that was a biology article not a medical one, so the kind of required rigor is not the same. That low access, unpopular term article had miminal or no impact to someone seeking information on &quot;treatment of Parkinsons disease&quot;. That person would find that article only by accident, specially during the time those weak points could be addressed. No comments on the quality of that Glutathione metabolism article made so far justify the way it was completed deleted and the way many people kept deleting it as whole while I was trying to improve that article content. --ser:Nutriveg|Nutriveg (ser talk:Nutriveg|talk) 20:42, 10 September 2009 (UTC)

I understand what you are saying, you are talking about correcting a deficiency. Do you have any references which show a therapeutic value of glutathione?

I must be misunderstanding something. Nutriveg, are you saying that it's OK to make unfounded claims that glutathione can treat Parkinson's, HIV, cancer, etc - as long as those claims are made in a &quot;biology&quot; article rather than a &quot;medical&quot; article? Even if this were not a ludicrous assertion on its face, doesn't the claim that a substance can cure a disease place an article squarely in the &quot;medical&quot; realm? ser:MastCell|MastCell ser Talk:MastCell|Talk 21:09, 10 September 2009 (UTC)
Literaturegeek, read the the article introduction to understand that article purpose. As I said before the content could be moved (later or at that time) but the only actions, by yourself included, were to delete the whole article and to stop another editor from improving/reviewing that text (before it could be  moved).
MastCell, No, I was saying that part of the article should be rewrited or deleted, not the article as whole, specially not several times while someone else was trying to improve it.--ser:Nutriveg|Nutriveg (ser talk:Nutriveg|talk) 21:16, 10 September 2009 (UTC)
I did read the intro. Here is the last version,[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glutathione_supplements&amp;oldid=312811059] for anyone who is interested of the article before it was deleted and redirected. There are some refs which are interesting factoids which should be merged into the main glutathione article. I am not opposed to some of the information being merged. I did read the introduction and I still feel that there is not enough good refs for a dedicated article to glutathione supplements. I also am of the opinion of correlation does not demonstrate causation or benefit from supplementation, it is speculative. I think instead of arguing about whether the page should be ressurected, which is unlikely due to lack of consensus, why not just move relevant refs to the main glutathione article, stick closely to what the refs say, then if anyone disagrees with some of the refs, we can take it from there?--ser:Literaturegeek|Literaturegeek | ser_talk:Literaturegeek |T@1k? 21:24, 10 September 2009 (UTC)
I pointed the introduction because that was what the article was about, not about &quot;therapeutic value of glutathione&quot; as you said above. Stop pushing the blame on me, you opposed any change in article before merge because you deleted it twice as I was doing so. Because of all that  more than ever I lost the motivation to continue editing it. If you want to end this discussion just end it, instead of implying it was a fault to separately edit (expand) the article prior to merging (what no one did) or start discussing the article as it was restricted to a specific phrase (that could be easily deleted instead of the &quot;whole content&quot;), using my comments in this discussion like they pertained to the article, ... --ser:Nutriveg|Nutriveg (ser talk:Nutriveg|talk) 22:38, 10 September 2009 (UTC)
Change to the article is irrelevant because you have been asked to provide refs which specifically talk about therapeutic benefit and have not provided any. It was not I who initially deleted the article but another editor. You reverted the deletion without discussion so I reverted your revert twice. I thought my compromise of merging content into the glutathione article was a good compromise, apparently not, oh well. :)--ser:Literaturegeek|Literaturegeek | ser_talk:Literaturegeek |T@1k? 22:58, 10 September 2009 (UTC)
There was discussion here and on that article talk page (the appropriate place), I only reverted the article deletion to add/remove/rewrite content, that was what I was doing while you were simpling reverting, part of those edits never came to that page because of edit conflicts (you deleting the article while I was editing) and an edit stall to respect of 3RR. I won't further continue this discussion.--ser:Nutriveg|Nutriveg (ser talk:Nutriveg|talk) 14:34, 11 September 2009 (UTC)
 Fever vs hyperthermia vs failure of thermoregulation 

I've been looking a bit at our articles on ever, yperthermia, and uman thermoregulation, and think that a differential diagnosis section would be appropriate.  Specifically, we have no information about how you would determine that a given elevated temperature is a &quot;fever&quot; (elevated set-point) instead of &quot;heat stroke&quot; or a failure of thermoregulation (which I understand could be caused by a stroke or other problem in just the right spot in the brain, but correct me if I'm wrong).

Does anyone know how to tell these apart?  More importantly, does anyone know of a reliable source that discusses the process of classifying &quot;39 C&quot; as one or the other of these three options? 

My guesses (definitely P:OR here) are that an elevated temperature that is responsive to aracetamol is probably a fever instead of the other two (converse probably not true?), and that if you had a case history of spending all day in miserably hot weather, you'd suspect heatstroke instead of the other two, but surely someone knows more than I do.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:57, 3 September 2009 (UTC)

Thanks, Fv.  Any advice on how I should handle Harrison's self-contradiction (that damage to the hypothalamus produces &quot;hypothalamic fever,&quot; in the &quot;fever&quot; section, and that it produces &quot;hyperthermia&quot; in the hyperthermia section?  
Also, I've found eat syndrome, which seems a bit fishy to me.  The term is occasionally used... but not like that, in my quick search.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 00:40, 13 September 2009 (UTC)
Where did you find the contradiction? The last paragraph of the &quot;Fever&quot; section is pretty clear to me, defining &quot;hypothalamic fever&quot; as an occasionally used term that doesn't jive with the typical effects of hypothalamic damage and noting that trauma to the hypothalamus may directly elevate the hypothalamic set point (which would make it &quot;fever&quot; in that the set point is changed and &quot;hyperthermia&quot; in that no pyrogens were involved). ser:Fvasconcellos|Fvasconcellos (ser talk:Fvasconcellos|t·pecial:Contributions/Fvasconcellos|c) 01:36, 13 September 2009 (UTC)
eat syndrome smacks of P:OR to me, especially when you check the earliest revisions of the page (mmm, vampires).

Table 17-1 lists &quot;hypothalamic injury&quot; as hyperthermia.  
Does anyone happen to know whether an elevated temperature due to hypothalamic injury (apparently a rare presentation of a rare condition) is responsive to antipyretics?  That seems to be the basic rule of thumb...  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 04:46, 13 September 2009 (UTC)
A couple of recent reviews (MID|18649158, MID|12742737) suggest that elevated temperature with hypothalamic injury = hyperthermia. Have a look at this [http://books.google.com/books?q=hypothalamic+fever&amp;btnG=Search+Books Google Books] search of &quot;hypothalamic fever&quot;: the term also appears in earlier editions of Cecil, with the exact same wording as in Harrison's. Bearing in mind that the only authors that seem to mention it in recent times call it a rarely and poorly used term, I'd safely say that &quot;hypothalamic fever&quot; does not merit a mention in Wikipedia. ser:Fvasconcellos|Fvasconcellos (ser talk:Fvasconcellos|t·pecial:Contributions/Fvasconcellos|c) 13:27, 13 September 2009 (UTC)

 Categories: Health informatics, Health care informatics, Medical informatics 

We currently have three categories, Category:Health informatics, Category:Health care informatics and Category:Medical informatics (plus further categories for specific software).

All three identify the same article, ealth informatics, as their &quot;lead&quot; article; and that article gives no differentiation between the three.

So: is there any thinking as to what distinction there should be between the three categories?  What articles ought to go into each one?  ser:Jheald|Jheald (ser talk:Jheald|talk) 16:53, 15 September 2009 (UTC)

 New category: Healthcare management 

I have created a new category Category:Healthcare management, which I was a bit surprised didn't exist before.

I've given it the provisional rubric,
&quot;A category for management and organisational (rather than purely economic or transactional) issues in health care, particularly those arising close to the front-line of healthcare delivery.&quot;
to try to suggest a focus on more real-world activity; rather than the managing of flows of pieces of paper, or the design of structures for such pieces of paper to flow through and between (though perhaps those activities deserve categories of their own too).

I've added a few articles with an operational management angle; but the category is probably still under-populated, so there are probably more that people feel should belong there.

The category &quot;lead&quot; article is identified as ealthcare administration.  However, at present the article really only contains information on some (U.S.-specific) qualifications, and some (U.S. specific) professional associations; but very little on anything that might be contained in those university courses, or any distinctive challenges that arise in healthcare management rather than any other kind of management.  So the article could use some expansion.  ser:Jheald|Jheald (ser talk:Jheald|talk) 17:17, 15 September 2009 (UTC)

 NOTICE. Request For Comment: Changes to Naming policies which may affect WikiProject naming conventions. 

Following recent changes by some editors to the ikipedia:Naming conventions policy page, a Request For Comment, (RFC) is now being held to debate the removal of the  passage specifying that individual WikiProject and other naming conventions are able to make exceptions to the standard policy of using Common Names as the titles of Wikipedia articles.   

This WikiProject is being notified since it operates such a specific naming convention. Editors are invited to comment on the proposed change at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Naming_conventions#RfC:_In_WP:Naming_Conventions.2C_should_the_specific_exceptions_to_.22Use_Common_Name.22_be_removed.3F this location].   ser:Xandar|Xanser talk:Xandar#top|dar  01:26, 16 September 2009 (UTC)
The above &quot;notification&quot; is a grossly biased misrepresentation of the changes under discussion. The old version of the naming conventions policy tried to lay down binding rules; we don't work that way, so it was necessary also to make explicit exceptions. The new version articulates principles, and allows for consensus to establish how they should be applied. Thus there is no longer any need for exceptions. In fact, making exceptions is nonsense, since there are no rules to make exceptions to. These changes are good for specific conventions. Xandar is trying to induce moral panic in those who stand to gain the most from this. Xandar is only opposed to the new version because he thinks the wording, not the general thrust, weakens his position in a dispute unrelated to this RfC. Don't be fooled. ser talk:Hesperian|Hesperian 02:43, 16 September 2009 (UTC)
No. Don't be fooled. The proposed wording change is shown at the RFC linked in my post above. The removal of the &quot;exceptions&quot; phrase is a very significant change. The policy never stated that it consisted of &quot;rules&quot; before, and it still doesn't. However it remains policy. Simply stating a personal view that titling a section &quot;principles&quot; changes the status of the policy page, is one not even accepted by many editors on Hesperians side. There is already an attempt to use the principle of no exceptions to the &quot;use common name&quot; policy to radically change the Naming conflict page, and one of the proposers of this change has indicated that the guidance on flora is also targetted. The change is in my view an attempt to impose a rigid, top-down policy on naming which ignores what wikipedia editors on the ground find most useful.  ser:Xandar|Xanser talk:Xandar#top|dar  03:09, 16 September 2009 (UTC)

The intent of P:BLP is quite clear. For otherwise non-notable individuals we should be very protective of their privacy. Given that biometric image-based search engines are already starting to appear on the web, we should assume that someone's image will eventually be tied to their personal identity. Omitting the name is not even close to being a sufficient long-term guard of the subject's privacy.

I have no objection to written consent -- far from it -- but [the psychologist] reasoning doesn't hold up.  Either she believes, without foundation, that the asserted verbal consent is fraudulent (you're a liar), uninformed (you withheld information), or incompetent (highly insulting to the participants) -- or it's really no better, in practice, than written consent.  For example:  your assertion of the existence of written consent relies just as much on your integrity as your assertion of the existence of verbal consent; people misunderstand written forms as easily as verbal ones; people can be pestered into signing documents just as easily as into verbally agreeing; a person incompetent to give consent verbally is also incompetent to give consent in writing (and so forth).  
I'm sorry that you've had to go to the trouble and expense of hiring an attorney, especially since it seems pretty silly for her to get worked up over the exact form of paperwork in the complete absence of complaints from the so-called vulnerable people.  As a judge once told me, based on his many years of amily court disputes, what really matters is whether people have a good understanding, not how they write it down.

Consent and privacy are two separate things, and they can be in conflict.  To protect the privacy of a patient who has given consent, may be better to not obtain a written consent.  Perhaps also to not even know the patient's name.  In Doc James' case, written consent would serve no purpose except to allow the people harassing him to do the same to patients.  Will he violate the privacy of his patients to defend himself?  --ser:Una Smith|Una Smith (ser talk:Una Smith|talk) 19:12, 17 September 2009 (UTC)

I think obtaining consent is the responsibility of the uploading physician. We shouldn't send forms to OTRS; that breaches confidentiality. Just keep the forms for when you need them, e.g. when you are harrassed by psychologists. --ser:Stevenfruitsmaak|Steven Fruitsmaak (ser_talk:Stevenfruitsmaak|Reply) 19:31, 17 September 2009 (UTC)

I was a bit slow on the uptake. For publication of such images in a medical journal you would need to obtain formal signed consent to publication, and send that consent to the editor as proof. You should definitely obtain signed consent for your own legal protection. ikipedia:IUP#Privacy_rights gives our policy on image us and privacy. A problem with the current situation is we have to take your word that you have consent; sending the forms to OTRS would be the equivalent of sending the forms to a medical editor, though I am unable to advise whether this would be a breach of HIPAA or other confidentiality laws. ser:Fences and windows|Fences&amp;ser talk:Fences and windows|Windows 02:08, 18 September 2009 (UTC)
A more sustainable solution may be to give the image to the patient (both legally and physically), and ask if the patient would be willing to upload the image through OTRS. --ser:Arcadian|Arcadian (ser talk:Arcadian|talk) 02:34, 18 September 2009 (UTC)
This has several downsides.  (1) Many patients are not computer savvy enough to do this, and the intersection set of those who are savvy enough and have a condition worth photographing for use here is really small.  (2) This requires the patient to reveal an e-mail address to anyone who can examine OTRS tickets now and in the future (the tickets are kept).  That is a lot of people.  Thus, this substantially diminishes the patients' privacy.  (3) When a patient supplies an image created in a medical setting it is not unusual for Commons editors to challenge the patient's claim of having the right to license the image.  --ser:Una Smith|Una Smith (ser talk:Una Smith|talk) 14:21, 21 September 2009 (UTC)

 Advice for new user on rewriting a medicine page 

I'm a new user looking at improving/rewriting the page on ymphangiomatosis.  I'd be grateful for advice on any particular considerations to be aware of beyond what is on the general wikipedia page for new users on creating new articles.  My plan is to draft the new page on my userpage and then move it across.

Apologies if this question should be asked somewhere else (I did search the archive but couldn't see anything)  Thanks.

ser:Wikigenevan|Wikigenevan (ser talk:Wikigenevan|talk) 20:16, 22 September 2009 (UTC)

Thanks for offering to help out!
The most important pages are P:MEDMOS and P:MEDRS. The former provides an outline and stylistic advice for medical articles, and the latter clarifies what kind of sources should ideally be used. The current version is not too bad but a bit jargonistic and devoid of proper sources.
Let me know if you need a hand, or ask her for support/advice. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 20:49, 22 September 2009 (UTC)

It's great to have another editor to help out with this.  This is a good page to ask for help, and I'm sure the article will benefit from some attention.  You should feel free to work directly on the article if you prefer  (in your userspace is also fine:  whatever you prefer).  Here are some ideas for you:
* P:MEDMOS#Sections has some ideas about what kinds of things should be included.  The top of that page also has some suggestions about how to write an article that sounds encyclopedic.  (That is, something that sounds like neither a patient-information pamphlet nor a medical manual for the treating physician.)  To avoid P:COPYVIO|copyright problems, you need to write everything in your own words. 
* We always appreciate really top-quality P:MEDRS|reliable sources for medicine-related articles.  Medical textbooks (if you don't have a relevant one, [http://books.google.com/books?q=lymphangiomatosis&amp;as_brr=3 try Google books], your local library, or other sources) are ideal, as are relatively recent iterature review papers, which you might be able to find through ubMed.  I know this is a rare condition, but ase reports and older publications (more than about 10 years for rare conditions) are not usually very good sources -- but use your judgment.  For example, you might like to look at MID|18840914, which is a case report, but which also (in the &quot;Discussion&quot; section) provides a good overview that might be useful to you.  
* Please make an effort to use P:CITE#Inline citations so that future editors will always know exactly where a given fact came from.  Citations don't have to be perfect as long as they're understandable.  That article is currently using P:Footnotes, so you should probably stick with that style.
I hope this is helpful.  Wikipedia's formatting system can be unduly complicated, but there are a number of experienced editors here.  Please feel free to ask more questions as you go along.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 21:00, 22 September 2009 (UTC)

A dispute is developing towards an edit war on the above page. On one side there is ser:Simonxag|myself, Simon Speed and ser:Zodon.  On the other side is ser:Nutriveg.  From my point of view, Nutriveg has been removing well sourced material and adding verifiably false information.

;Update
After a couple of days of following the article and a couple more on the talk page, here's my overview.  Y'all should plan to show up on the talk page after reading this:

* Fully protected.  Many thanks to the admin for putting a very firm, albeit temporary, stop to the edit warring.
* Page name.  One editor is pushing for a very fine distinction between safe sex and safeR sex.  That is, &quot;safe sex&quot; has an absolute, gold-plated guarantee that you won't get any kind of infection and/or (depending on the definition) suffer any sort of negative (including non-infectious) health effect.  (Sexual activities known to be in this last category:  None.)  SafeR sex, by contrast, reduces your risk of contracting an infection from another person.  The vast majority of sources, as well as this article (since 2001), use the two terms interchangeably.  A small minority of (very good) sources draw a distinction between the two terms -- always and only for the purpose of explaining their stylistic preference for the term safeR sex.  The article currently describes the fine distinction and then goes on to use the term interchangeably.  This matters because I'm about to lose patience with the endless P:IDIDNTHEARTHAT obstruction -- there's a lot of work that needs to be done that has absolutely no connection to this, but we can't get anything accomplished because of this fight -- and because one editor seems to think that the article's (current, not original) location at afe sex means that nothing about arm reduction (safeR sex) belongs in the article.  (No, don't bother asking me to pretend that I have any sympathy for this defining-the-article-out-of-existence argument:  I don't.)
* HIV or everything.  There's some question of whether anyone uses safeR sex outside of the context of HIV.  (Sure they do, as any quick trip to PubMed will tell you.  But this is not impinging on our consciousness.)  All of the sources that explain the nuances of the choices are AIDS-specific (e.g., NAIDS).
* Infecting yourself.  One version of the article says that you can transmit an STI to yourself (e.g., by spreading fecal bacteria to the urinary tract, and thus getting a UTI).  No sources support this notion of autoinfection as an STI.  It appears to be based on a literal interpretation of &quot;safe&quot;:  If you get a UTI from doing that, then it wasn't safe, was it?  (Well, no, but that doesn't mean that it's an STI, either.) 
* We're not writing the article; we're not even trying to.  We're trying to &quot;win&quot;.  This is dueling sources for the sake of having it reflect &quot;my&quot; personal vocabulary quirks instead of for the sake of producing a good product.

What you can do to help:  I've just started a straw poll that I hope will reduce the bickering about whether or not this or that practice is within the scope of the article.  It's at alk:Safe sex#Scope_of_the_article.  Please add your views, and then please watch the page for the next week or so.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 23:33, 22 September 2009 (UTC)

When asking  for other users to join a discussion do it in a neutral way, not suggesting they should assume any POV or presenting the facts in a distorted way.
You didn't &quot;followed the article&quot; but actively joined the discussion supporting a specific POV.
I asked the article to be protected because unaware editors that recently joined the discussion were reverting it to a intermediary version, after the earlier problematic version.
All definitions I used were from sources, the definitions of &quot;safe sex&quot; were weak because as well were the sources that defined that term. You are presenting then in a caricaturist way, making statements (most of all) I never did. For example you took harm reduction from nowhere since I never used or supported that term.
The very good sources that support the &quot;safer sex&quot; term, the WHO for instance, clearly do it because of the meaning, those sources don't present it as a aesthetic decision you're implying.
The article current description of &quot;the fine distinction&quot; is unreferenced text, P:OR|Original research that contradicts at least one of the sources provided (UK).
The HIV was the last step we reached, when you and the other editor refused to clearly state that conclusion: It's a recommended term (at least) for HIV, including by 2008 UN AIDS Terminology Guidelines. So we could move on from that point, discussing other STDs and HIV P:DUE|due balance. Instead, cornered by evidence you shortly decided to abandon that discussion, saying it was not important, but now is P:FORUMSHOP|forum shopping
Talking about &quot;infecting yourself&quot; you're going deep on the article discussion, raising a very recent discussion that started today but seens to be very important for you and you're the only one supporting that POV. The exact term is &quot;cross infection&quot;, there were [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10616355] sources supporting that and you never requested additional sources or gave time for them to be presented.
Don't include me in your quest for win, I said several times that I could change my opinion if reliable~ sources were provided. But you ignored those I presented so far.
We never rejected the reference of any preventive practice and you are starting that pool from nowhere. The discussion so far was what term definition (provided so far by reliable sources) better defined the article content, where I supported the &quot;safer sex&quot; definition brought so far.--ser:Nutriveg|Nutriveg (ser talk:Nutriveg|talk) 01:12, 23 September 2009 (UTC)

I'm astonished that you would pretend to know which articles I've read, and on what days.  I tell you, accurately and in good faith, that I watched the edit warring for a couple of days before my first edit, which was on 20 September.  If you can demonstrate that I'm a liar, then please do share your sources of information.
None of your other points, such as the possibility of non-sexual transmission of HPV (the article you link here) are worth responding to at this time.  Editors here are perfectly capable of giving their opinion about the general subject of the article -- whether it should be the general concept of reducing transmission of STIs between partners, or about the variety of definitions used for the words -- without knowing anything at all about the various definitions.  
Whether the article should focus on the &quot;concept&quot; or the &quot;vocabulary&quot; is a pretty basic question that any editor is capable of sharing an opinion on.  Sometimes it's important for Wikipedia to have an article about names:  See ay-related immune deficiency and ay bowel syndrome as examples.  Sometimes it's more important to have the article cover the idea behind the words:  See IDS and roctitis for the ideas that those two obsolete terms refer to.  This is the question for editors:  Should we focus on the idea, or on the terms?  It's this decision that determines the article content, not the definition of the words currently used for the page name.  After all, we can change the page name if we need to.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 05:42, 23 September 2009 (UTC)


* Current quick question.  Nutriveg has decided that the UK's National Health Service website, NHS Choices, is unreliable per P:MEDRS, on the grounds that it's targeted to consumers and is therefore likely to use &quot;lay&quot; language, like &quot;safe sex&quot; instead of supposedly &quot;medical terminology&quot; like &quot;safer sex&quot;, and on the grounds that MEDRS doesn't specifically name this website run by the NHS.  Nutriveg prefers the language preferred in UNAIDS's [http://data.unaids.org/pub/Manual/2008/JC1336_unaids_terminology_guide_en.pdf terminology guideline], which is essentially a ouse stylebook for the agency's marketing department.  If you have a view on this issue, I think a quick comment at the end of alk:Safe sex#New_article_title would be the place to share your thoughts.  The question:  Is the NHS Choices website a reliable source for medicine-related information that is compatible with MEDRS requirements?  (Many thanks to the editors who have taken time to comment on previous issues.)   ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 01:27, 25 September 2009 (UTC)
Hum, you again came back here presenting the issue in a non-neutral way using words that don't represent what I said.
NHS Choices, is a website of NHS, I didn't say it was directed to consumers, but the general public, by its own definition &quot;[http://www.nhs.uk/aboutNHSChoices/Pages/AboutNHSChoices.aspx The service is intended to help you make choices about your health]&quot;
That kind of source is clearly defined by P:MEDRS: &quot;public guides and service announcements, which (...) are generally less authoritative than the underlying medical literature.&quot;
And I pointed that the discussion about that website is useless, since the links of that website so far provided support more the &quot;safer sex&quot; term
To contextualize we are not discussing this term just to have a discussion, we are discussing the name of article title, where I'm trying to follow P:MEDMOS#Naming conventions specially where it says:
&quot;Where there is a dispute over a (article title) name, editors should cite recognised authorities and organisations&quot;
I've already cited such  for instance (AHO/orld Association for Sexual Health (WAS)|WAS/orld Health Organization|WHO)[http://www.paho.org/english/hcp/hca/promotionsexualhealth.pdf] and NAIDS[http://data.unaids.org/pub/Manual/2008/JC1336_unaids_terminology_guide_en.pdf]  supporting the &quot;safer sex&quot; term.
But ser:WhatamIdoing and Misch are strongly supporting the &quot;safe sex&quot; title, even though they don't have (equally) reliable sources, by P:MEDRS, to support that POV. 
One editor, Misch, say it's of little importance to follow P:MEDMOS and P:MEDRS as he sees that article as little related to the prevention and control of diseases, being more related to sexology in his opinion, and even stated that &quot;Safe sex is sexual practice, not medical practice (apart from when doctors and nurses have sex)&quot;
That discussion is happening in alk:Safe sex#New article title|this section of that article talk page.--ser:Nutriveg|Nutriveg (ser talk:Nutriveg|talk) 04:04, 25 September 2009 (UTC)

The UNAIDS document is a style guideline.  It tells its staff to use British spelling (p. 20) with the same authority that it tells them to use your preferred term.  It is not a scientific document.  Ditto for the PAHO document, whose title is &quot;Promotion of Sexual Health&quot; and repeatedly recommends  using the mass media for education and awareness.  These are not scientific documents. You have insisted for several days now that these two arketing plans are supposed to trump every other source, despite being nothing more than instructions to their marketing departments about how to promote their goals in public.  
You've also recently insisted that the NHS is not a &quot;recognised authority or organisation&quot;, despite the fact that the NHS is specifically listed, by name, as being a recognized authority in the very guideline that you're trying to (ab)use to exclude it.  Please look, again, at P:MEDRS#Medical and scientific organizations, and specifically the bit that says, &quot;Statements and information from reputable major medical and scientific bodies may be valuable encyclopedic sources. These bodies include...the British ational Health Service.&quot;  It does not say, &quot;Only certain information from the NHS that supports Nutriveg's preferred term,&quot; or &quot;Only certain parts of the NHS's websites&quot; or anything like that.  
Your complaints are beyond silly:  either you can't understand fairly simple English, or you're being willfully perverse.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 05:51, 25 September 2009 (UTC)
That's your view about those documents, where I see you qualifying those documents as marketing which Wikipedia defines as &quot;arketing#Definition|inform(ed) or persuade(d) that existing and newly-identified needs and wants may be satisfied by the products and services of others&quot; as nonsense.
Those documents weren't directed to the general public, nor even to mass media, but to other health authorities/organizations and health professionals.
I've never said that NHS was not reliable, but that website wasn't (equally) reliable by P:MEDRS and didn't fit the purpose described in P:MEDMOS since it is directed to inform the general public about health choices, so strict following of &quot;scientific and medical terminology&quot; is not expected. Beyond that the links so far provided for that source, as a whole, support the same term used in those two documents that support the &quot;safer sex&quot; term, so you're just making all this discussion to make a P:POINT, to disqualify myself. Which also evident when you change approaches, supporting the PAHO, WAS, WHO and UNAIDS  presented documents as &quot;marketing&quot; but the &quot;NHS Choices&quot; as reliable.
You're so much involved that couldn't even find the my citation of P:MEDRS qualifying websites like &quot;NHS Choices&quot;: &quot;public guides and service announcements (...) are generally less authoritative than the underlying medical literature.&quot;--ser:Nutriveg|Nutriveg (ser talk:Nutriveg|talk) 11:32, 25 September 2009 (UTC)

Another factor: On ikipedia:Fringe theories/Arbitration cases it is pointed out that &quot;matters that are of notable popular interest&quot; are included in Wikipedia articles even where there &quot;exists little scientific interest or analysis.&quot;  ADHD controversies may be in science and/or in popular culture.
