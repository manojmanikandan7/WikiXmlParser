Every wiki thinks that it needs more editors.  I don't think that we actually want to turn into a recruiting forum for any of them.  More time spent at another wiki usually means less time spent here.  I see no reason why Wikipedia would want to encourage its editor to do that.   () 18:40, 9 July 2009 (UTC)

Corposcindosis

This new article seems very problematic.  It defines a syndrome that gets no hits on Google Scholar or Pubmed.  A reference is given in the article which I can't check; the real source of the term seems to be an online petition at http : //www.petitiononline.com/consent/petition.html (address munged to get around blacklist).  I'm inclined to think the article should go where the woodbine twineth, and wonder if others have an opinion.  () 04:09, 7 July 2009 (UTC)

Cites editor's own wiki site and googling seems to provide just 2 doctors who mention term at all - fails even qualify as a trivial minority. I've tagged article and commented on talk page - I suspect it should be re-deleted (if I read the notes on  G4 should not be invoked twice and I'm unclear on the previous deletion process used) per  (on basis of lack &quot;Notability status has changed&quot; and &quot;Advertising, Self-promotion, Spam Pages intended to promote a person, company, organization, or cause&quot; per &quot;cause&quot; as set out in editor's own blog).    00:50, 8 July 2009 (UTC)

The term &quot;corposcindosis&quot; is [http://www.truthaboutets.com/Studies/ETS-Complication-PascalDumont.pdf mentioned in this ref].[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B7MF5-4S98MG3-B&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=948590172&amp;_rerunOrigin=google&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=8209c02f29affc466ff22a8170aa4d37].

Question re [[:File:Endocarditis ultrasound.gif]]


My echo-reading skills are pretty much nonexistent, what with my not being a doctor and all (or nurse, or radiology tech...). What am I seeing here—is this a parasternal short-axis view, as I presume? 
I haven't seen an annotated echo in years, and I'm having trouble correlating this to the anatomy. I could always Google &quot;atlas of echocardiography&quot; or something, but then what would be the use of having so many fine medical professionals on WP? :)  (·) 17:41, 10 July 2009 (UTC)

David, you jest in vain.  -- () 00:43, 12 July 2009 (UTC)

All joking aside, &quot;parasternal short-axis&quot; appears to mean simply that the sensor is above the sternum (&quot;parasternal&quot;) and the plane of view is a transverse section (&quot;short-axis&quot;).  (Anatomical terms of location could do with some expansion.)  In addition, the view is toward the head.  Imagine the patient lying before you face up with feet toward you. -- () 01:01, 12 July 2009 (UTC)

Translation please

&quot;Panic attack and anxiety can occur, also delusional behavior, including somatoform delusions, sometimes accompanied by a depersonalization or derealization syndrome similar to what was seen in the past in the prodromal or early stages of general paresis.&quot;

From the Lyme disease article in . I'd like to put this in lay-friendly language, but I can't understand it to do so!  () 20:05, 10 July 2009 (UTC)
Well, &quot;general paresis&quot; is one of the manifestations of late-stage neurosyphilis, although I think it's a rather outdated term (or maybe it's just become a rare entity). Our article seems to be at General paresis of the insane (not sure if it's the same thing). I don't have access to those references, so any translation I offer could be inaccurate! Perhaps &quot;depersonalization&quot; and &quot;derealization&quot; could be described as a feeling of detachment from self or reality?  can probably help with that :)  (·) 13:13, 11 July 2009 (UTC)
Redesign of FDA's website

Dear all!

Since mid-2008 FDA is redesigning their website. As of June 2009 practically all document names and paths were altered without automatic redirects. I would estimate that hundreds of reference links in WP are affected and lead to an HTTP-404 error page. Unfortunatelly if in the linked reference the title of the document is not given, any attempt to find the resource at FDA's site is futile. Sometimes even giving the exact title of the document FDA's search page lead to electronic nirvana. :-(

Accessibility of the site is poor, since previously many documents existed in two versions: HTML and PDF - HTML-versions were removed in the majority of cases. Documents' titles often contained information whether the version was a draft (XXXXdft.pdf) or final (XXXXfnl.pdf). Such an information is lost in the new system, where all documents are of the type ucmXXXXXX.yyy or UCMXXXXXX.yyy. XXXXXX is a six digit number, yyy is the file extension (pdf, rarely htm). Cave: ucm and UCM are case-sensitive.

Some (funny?) examples (no links, only to show differences):

Document title:

ANDA CHECKLIST FOR CTD or eCTD FORMAT FOR COMPLETENESS and ACCEPTABILITY of an APPLICATION FOR FILING

old URL:

http://www.fda.gov/cder/ogd/anda_checklist.pdf

new URL:
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/ApprovalApplications/AbbreviatedNewDrugApplicationANDAGenerics/UCM154150.pdf

Formatting of Bioequivalence Summary Tables

old URLs:

DBE_tables.pdf
DBE_tables.doc

new URLs:
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/ApprovalApplications/AbbreviatedNewDrugApplicationANDAGenerics/UCM120957.pdf
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/ApprovalApplications/AbbreviatedNewDrugApplicationANDAGenerics/ucm120960.doc
(notice the different XXXXXX and ucm vs. UCM)

It would be nice if we could start to update these references before a deadlink-bot removes them (would be terribly bad, because without the old title you have no chance locating the new one at FDA). Please see this as an invitation, but don't expect too much help from myself - I'm quite busy cleaning up articles at my home-wiki (German WP).

Heads up! --  15:43, 9 July 2009 (UTC)

First a query - is ucm reserved for .doc format and UCM for .pdf as seems case in examples given above, or is it random ?
The pattern ucmXXXXX.yyy applies to virtually all files regardless the type (though there are some exceptions, especially in the dockets-area of the site). I guess the lower/upper cases are random (pros at work).
As a quick test, this did not seem case-sensitive to me.
SUPAC-IR: Immediate-Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms: Scale-Up and Post-Approval Changes: Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls, In Vitro Dissolution Testing, and In Vivo Bioequivalence Documentation [http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm070636.pdf ucm070636.pdf] (small letters), SUPAC-MR: Modified Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms [http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM070640.pdf UCM070640.pdf] (capital letters). I used the links ‘as-is’ from FDA's site. But you are right, the call to the URL is not case-sensitive.
Perhaps a good moment to set up a  template to help with this and at least if in the future the FDA website folders are rearranged, then we can apply a quick fix (ie. apply single change to part of the template, but not if article XXXXXX numbers change).
I have no idea how the old 4-digit numbers relate to the new 6-digit numbers (I even tried to find a function whithout avail). Mainly older documents have lower numbers, but maybe they used a random generator in other cases. Example: the GLP-rules from Sept 1987 exist in two formats: UCM133730.pdf and ucm072706.htm… See the system?
I envisage  might take following 4/5 parameters:
* Area - ie  &quot;Drug application&quot; in above examples
* Target - to specify ucm vs UCM if we must
* Article - the XXXXXX bit
* Display - for the article name we wish to show 
* accessdate - optional parameter
 Hence in last example: 
 might be shown as: FDA [http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/ApprovalApplications/AbbreviatedNewDrugApplicationANDAGenerics/UCM120957.pdf DBE tables]. Drug application. Accessed on

Good idea. I'm only afraid if nobody starts editing the references, they will be removed. I think there's a bot for such cases, but since EN:WP is not my main wiki, I'm not sure. Right now there is still a chance for manual corrections. It will be a cumbersome job anyhow. - - 18:07, 9 July 2009 (UTC)

I'm not convinced that any &quot;dead-link bot&quot; removes references on the English Wikipedia.  I think it's more common to tag it with  instead.   () 18:48, 9 July 2009 (UTC)
 showed me about 3,400 links to  *.fda.gov.  My spot check of about 20 on the last page (i.e., not random) showed more than half were deadlinks.  I wish there were a way to make Linksearch list links only in the main namespace.   () 18:57, 9 July 2009 (UTC)
“about 3,400 links […] more than half were deadlinks.” Oh wow! Higher than my ‘guestimate’. I looked at the documentation of ; the original link-text stays intact. So we have time to search FDA's site. I'll correct links time allowing, but I think that need we need some volunteers. --  19:17, 9 July 2009 (UTC)
If it helps,  gives 139 pages result vice 19 pages for deadlink   19:23, 9 July 2009 (UTC)
It might take less time to write a petition to the FDA to revert back to their old network :-)  () 19:32, 9 July 2009 (UTC)
Anyone on speaking terms with a congresscritter?   20:30, 9 July 2009 (UTC)
This is probably a good job for a bot. [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Weblinkchecker.py The weblinkchecker script] could probably be tweaked to check all of the article-space links to *.fda.gov and collect the dead ones. From there, they'd probably need to be replaced or redirected by hand, which would be faster than trying to code the logic necessary to find the new link. I can give this a shot, but it might be worth enlisting someone handier with Python and the MediaWiki API.   21:49, 9 July 2009 (UTC)
Actually, I think I can make headway on this tonight, hopefully without destroying Wikipedia via an accidental denial-of-service attack. It should be easy to pull all of the mainspace external links to *.fda.gov, check them for 404 errors, and throw the results into a tab-delimited text file or some sort of useful format. Depending on how many we're talking about, they could be split up among us and fixed pretty quickly.   00:09, 10 July 2009 (UTC)
Let me know how many different areas of the FDA website we're looking at - if a limited number then I can make that FDAlink template, but if folder/subfolder names are of a huge number then this will be one for hand coding/mrking up the links (which risks this all happening again at the next FDA website revamp)    00:23, 10 July 2009 (UTC)
If you want to read some Newspeak see [http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/AboutThisWebsite/AbouttheWebsiteRedesign/default.htm FDA's statement about the redesign]. They started with some cosmetics in mid-2008, but pushed the button on June 1st. And yes, I have already send e-mails asking for documents I could not find any more. Got a response of the type “Thank you for your inquiry to the Division of Drug Information in Center for Drug Evaluation and Research at the Food and Drug Administration. We are aware of the problem and will forward your inquiry blabla”. I don't think they will change anything in the near future (the old system was in place for 15 years). Funny enough that all PDFs I've came across at the FDA were not updated, i.e. embedded links end up in Nirvana as well. For some further goodies see [http://forum.bebac.at/forum_entry.php?id=3835 this post]. --  01:34, 10 July 2009 (UTC)
I forgot: If you create a template , please include another optional parameter 'documentdate' since some documents are legally binding. --  10:57, 10 July 2009 (UTC)

Update: list of broken links
OK, I've put together a list of broken links to *.fda.gov from articlespace. See . There are a lot. Please feel free to jump in and fix or remove any (just cross them out and sign when you fix or verify them, so that your work isn't duplicated). Note that I wrote an automated tool to collect the links from Wikipedia and then test them - I haven't done it by hand - so it may be that some of the &quot;broken&quot; links actually &quot;work&quot;. They may have been too complex for my Python script, but parse-able by the average browser. Most these seem well and truly broken, though. I also included a list of all of FDA weblinks that returned redirects - these probably don't need &quot;fixing&quot;, because browsers handle them pretty seamlessly, but it may be worth verifying them as well. The broken links seem like the highest priority, though.   00:04, 12 July 2009 (UTC)
What a great job! I checked some 301-redirects and quite often they lead to the wrong place. Examples are mainly deep links to the old filestructure, where the redirect leads to the top level category. So we have to check them also.
A funny story from the front-line. [http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/AboutThisWebsite/WebsitePolicies/default.htm#linking FDA's policies] states: “FDA's preference is that people link to the material on the FDA site (rather than copying it to their personal Web sites) because the agency continuously updates the information on the Web site as better information becomes available.” I wanted to update a link on my site, but could not locate it in the file structure. I have the document on my HD, so had a lot of keywords available to feed the search page - but without success. On June 10th I asked for the new location. Yesterday I received an e-mail with the new resource and “As you may know, the agency is redesigning the website.  We apologize for the inconvenience. The center is deligently working to fix and restore the broken and problem links, etc. etc.” Sneeking into the source code I found out that the entire section [http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/NewsEvents/ucm167011.htm CDER Forum for International Drug Regulatory Authorities] was created on June 16th (six days after my request). Only documents from the [http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/NewsEvents/ucm167082.htm CDER Forum for International Drug Regulatory Authorities, April 14 - 18, 2008] are linked (I was asking for one of them). I have presentations from other years as well. Maybe FDA waits for other requests to fill up pages with content from their pile in the backyard. ;-) --  15:03, 12 July 2009 (UTC) 
Suggestion: template / bot
What do you think about creating a (small!) template to be placed in affected articles inviting users to check links and note the change at ? I would guess that many users don't even know about the problems yet, since they don't read . Though we could crate the template, we should leave the job of placing it in the articles to a silicon-based lifeform. ;-) --  15:03, 12 July 2009 (UTC)

WP:MED comprehensiveness

Hi there, I'll be mentioning your project at a talk I'll be giving next week. In terms of comprehensiveness, does Wikipedia have an article on all the diseases that have been classified by ICD? If not, how would you describe where you are at presently?  () 16:44, 12 July 2009 (UTC)
We are very close. If you click through the chapters linked at ICD-10#List, you will find very few redlinks and very few omitted codes. However, we can probably only approach comprehensiveness asymptotically, and there are some codes that will never align well with how we do things (for example, see how  requires two dimensions to code). -- () 18:55, 12 July 2009 (UTC)
Thanks, I'll say about 60-70% complete, based on eyeballing those pages.  () 20:39, 12 July 2009 (UTC)
I'd bet a rather large amount of these articles are, however, stub or start class in quality. We've got a long way to go before I'd consider this project's scope as actually comprehensive. We might have included most topics, but most are still significantly away from where we'd like them to be. Regards, --— |[[User_talk:Cyclonenim| Chat ]] 22:50, 12 July 2009 (UTC)

Let me start off by saying that I think there are so many editors doing a great job here at WikiProject Medicine.  However, IMHO, I would rate the overall comprehensiveness of medicine-related content as poor.  Taking my specific interest of skin conditions as an example, we are probably still missing articles on ~10% of the rarer cutaneous diseases, and of the articles we do have, many are merely stubs. --- () 23:35, 12 July 2009 (UTC)
All of which is to say:  We need more good editors!  There's no shortage of useful work to be done, and much of it is still in the &quot;low-hanging fruit&quot; range.   () 01:09, 13 July 2009 (UTC)
We definitely need more good editors. A lot of work goes into making an article comprehensive enough to be of actual use to the reader (not to mention making it accurate, using good references...) and many editors, myself included, are torn between making minor drive-by improvements to a bunch of (often random) content or choosing a particular article and developing it into maturity.  (·) 01:29, 13 July 2009 (UTC)

http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Azo_compound&amp;diff=300486336&amp;oldid=300482297

i don't really agree with this edit.  just because something isn't made doesnt mean that patients have not been exposed previously - also seems like historic info.  Anyone else getting my monitored by drug companies suspicion? I mean, monitor the tylenol article's history... sigh - wp is far from perfect...  —Preceding  comment added by  () 07:36, 9 July 2009 (UTC) 

Not really, but I'm starting to suspect that you don't quite grasp the fact that there are different types of azo dyes.  Just because &quot;this&quot; azo dye is associated with cancer doesn't mean that &quot;all&quot; azo dyes are.  It's like saying that &quot;drugs are bad, so I'll refuse everything to aspirin to anesthesia with the same vehemence that I would reject heroin and LSD.&quot;    () 18:44, 9 July 2009 (UTC)
surely one should at least state that some azo compounds have historically been not only associated but have been proven to cause cancer - to go further would be to specify which ones those are, state them, and state if they are still in use (off market in usa doesnt mean off market everywhere.  —Preceding  comment added by  () 00:43, 10 July 2009 (UTC) 
Well, the article does state &quot;Azo dyes derived from benzidine are carcinogens&quot;. I would support reintroducing an explicit mention of the risk of bladder cancer, which has been well established for decades.  (·) 00:51, 10 July 2009 (UTC)

Changes to popular pages lists

There are a few important changes to the popular pages system. A quick summary:
* The &quot;importance&quot; ranking (for projects that use it) will be included in the lists along with assessment.
* The default list size has been lowered to 500 entries (from 1000)
* I've set up a project on the Toolserver for the popular pages - .
** This includes a page to view the results for projects, including the in-progress results from the current month. Currently this can only show the results from a single project in one month. Features to see multiple projects or multiple months may be added later.
** This includes a new interface for making requests to add a new project to the list.
** There is also a form to request a change to the configuration for a project. Currently the configurable options are the size of the on-wiki list and the project subpage used for the list.
* The on-wiki list should be generated and posted in a more timely and consistent manner than before.
* The data is now retained indefinitely.
* The script used to generate the pages has changed. The output should be the same. Please report any apparent inconsistencies (see below).
* Bugs and feature requests should be reported using the Toolserver's bug tracker for &quot;alexz's tools&quot; - [https://jira.toolserver.org/browse/alexz]

New Proposed Policy

There is a proposed policy being discussed that concerns possible health consequences of Wikipedia articles.  Please come and add your views on it by clicking .   () 14:28, 15 July 2009 (UTC)
I have huge concerns with this policy.  To provide some backgroud to people this policies purpose is to lead to the removal of the images of the Rorschach inkblot.  see   Discussion of weather Wikipedia should be cencored are spreading over the internet.
Now the question is who is going to determine possible harm?  Shall we leave it up to the Chinese government, the American Pyscologist Association?  We are writing an encyclopedia.  It is used by professional aswell as the general population.  An encyclopedia is to provide information.  Calls for sensorship by certain people need to be questioned extensively.--[[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 17:55, 15 July 2009 (UTC)

I have also commented on the proposed policy (not even a guideline). I think it is misguided, reeks of instruction creep, and is best not implemented.  |  18:12, 15 July 2009 (UTC)

Looking for help styling tables

I am looking for some computer savvy editors to help me style some tables to make them more readable.  Basically, several of us editors are working to categorize pharmacology-related articles, and have created .  However, at this time, they need more stylization for readability sake, but we were unsure how to do a few things, like indenting ATC codes in the first column to illustrate the hierarchy.

Psychological associations take off Wiki access against editor of Wikipedia

Today I received a notice from my college of Physicians and Surgeons about complaints filled by a number of psychological associations about my linking of the 10 Rorschach test inkblots from Wikimedia commons to Wikipedia.  The Wikipedia community has supported the addition of this material by a large majority.  I have posted this here as this attempt by the psychological community to effect Wikipedia content is disturbing to say the least.[[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 04:03, 20 August 2009 (UTC)

To be fair to Hillpna, I've read some new sources and re-read some old ones, and I believe I was off in some of my original issues with the page.  It's a very confusing issue, not helped by the pharmacies advocating for BHRT and even peer-reviewed literature mixing bioidentical with compounding and a dash of pharmanoia.  There are still problems of coatracking and syntheses waiting in the background, but there is also a need to clarify a lot of what is already cited.  I would still dearly love some extra input, I still think Hillpna has jumped the gun and does not grasp the essence a lot of applicable policies, but I think I have a firmer grasp of some of his/her objections and there is some merit to them (though an overly aggressive protection of the old version doesn't help his/her case or any readers).

Article suggestion: death's approach

Hi all. I really appreciate your work here.

I looked through the topics related to death, and found there was a gap where I was hoping I'd find an article. I think it would be good to have an article on what happens to the body before death, for example, in terminal illness. There is a terminal-illness article, but it focusses more on the logistics than the physical/medical perspective; there's a stub about &quot;death rattle&quot;, which is one aspect of what I'm talking about, but it's specific, not exhaustive.

Maybe no one's thought to write one because as a society we just don't like to think or talk about the subject, but I think it is worthwhile information to have, and I know I'd appreciate the information.

Thanks!  —Preceding  comment added by  () 15:25, 23 August 2009 (UTC) 
Then  and write it :-) -- () 06:38, 24 August 2009 (UTC)

&quot;What happens to the body&quot; probably depends a lot on the specific cause of death.  Trauma will obviously differ from long-term disease processes, but COPD is going to differ in some respects from brain cancer, too.   () 19:30, 24 August 2009 (UTC)

Noninvasive Diagnosis of Fetal Aneuploidy Using Maternal Blood

Hi, can please someone have a look at the two concerns at ? Thanks,  () 13:19, 1 September 2009 (UTC)

Hi Pgallert,
Thanks for your note.  The &quot;two concerns&quot; appear to be a suggestion for a different name and a request for copyediting this grammatically correct article for greater concision.  Neither of these require the input of very many editors, and neither of them are really terribly important in the grand scheme of things.
IMO, if you don't get an active objection to moving the page, then you should simply  and do it yourself.  As for copyediting, I'm not even sure that it deserves a  template:  it's really not that bad, despite one editor saying that parts of it are (or were) a bit repetitive.  I suspect that this comment can be safely ignored.   () 18:20, 1 September 2009 (UTC)
End of life care

Prompted by a Daily Telegraph article [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/6127514/Sentenced-to-death-on-the-NHS.html] on the Liverpool Care Pathway, I was surprised to find that we don't seem to have a general article on end-of-life care.

Such an article might usefully cover some of the issues which can seem quite controversial - for example, removal of artificial hydration (cf [https://www.nursingtimes.net/clinical-archive/end-of-life-and-palliative-care/providing-hydration-at-the-end-of-life-ethics-and-practice-09-12-2008/]); as well as providing context and better framing for articles like terminal sedation; recommended reduced monitoring, medication and intervention; and general issues of best management and caring, such as those the LCP checklists try to prompt.

But, IMO as an uninformed layman, this is not an article to be created by an uninformed amateur; any such article would need to be created by professionals, that know their stuff.   () 16:45, 3 September 2009 (UTC)

Wikipedia is written largely by amateurs, and you should feel free to find a couple of good  and do whatever you can.  I suspect that you already know enough to start the article, and even a  of just a couple of sentences and one good reference is a big help.  Please give it a try.  When you've done as much as you can, perhaps someone else will want to add their bit.   () 17:02, 3 September 2009 (UTC)

End-of-life care and palliative care are effectively synonyms, although palliative care is spreading into the realm of symptom control in general. Perhaps we need a redirect to start with.  |  20:04, 3 September 2009 (UTC)

[[:Category:Types of cancer]]

This category currently contains several types of benign neoplasms, and should be renamed or split. Any suggestions?  (·) 17:57, 28 August 2009 (UTC)
I think the benign stuff should be removed.  An alternative is it should be renamed tumours.  
I've seen a lot of confusion on Wikipedia between cancer (malignant, i.e. can metastasize) and tumour (benign or malignant).  | 16:40, 29 August 2009 (UTC)
I'd support renaming, rather than trimming. (If we remove them, then we'll just have a neverending battle with other editors adding them back in.) -- () 18:01, 29 August 2009 (UTC)
It's possible that the never-ending nature could be helped along by providing a different category for benign tumors, with explanations and links at the top of the cat pages.   () 05:20, 1 September 2009 (UTC)
I'm just thinking there will be great fun in categorizing tumours that can be both malignant and benign, e.g. pheochromocytoma.  | 17:58, 7 September 2009 (UTC)

BDNF associated with many conditions ?

can someone please have a look at all these edits from me [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Earlypsychosis] (the psychiatric conditions, not melbourne gangland war!) and then the undos [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Nutriveg].  I removed the BDNF sentence added by  on a number of articles (schizophrenia, dementia, anorexia, bulimia, etc ) - I first added  for some articles, but then read the article that  directed me to and found no reference to all the conditions listed.   has undone some of my changes [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Nutriveg].  Some of these are okay with a relevant sources - such as the one on Rett [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rett_syndrome&amp;action=history], but this scource for bulimia is simply a RCT with no mention of BDNF that I can see [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bulimia_nervosa&amp;action=history].   () 20:46, 3 September 2009 (UTC)
I support removing those sentences as the first step -- Beland simply added the same vague sentence to eight articles, with no sourcing or discussion.  In cases like that, the only reasonable approach is to remove the material -- it can't be right for something that took one editor two minutes to do should force other editors to spend two hours fixing.  (Already dealing with this at schizophrenia).  () 21:02, 3 September 2009 (UTC)

this was the original article used to show that BDNF is associated with numerous conditions     () 22:38, 3 September 2009 (UTC)

This is just a report on some original experimental work in a transgenic mouse model.  To say that this substance is 'under investigation' is stretching the truth rather farther than supportable.  There's actually more justification for saying that several dozen herbal extracts are 'under investigation':  those, at least, have been tried in humans!   () 23:17, 3 September 2009 (UTC)
I didn't use that source and rewrote the text.  also [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brain-derived_neurotrophic_factor&amp;diff=311693225&amp;oldid=311689842 added] a lot of references as well. Please get yourself informed instead of relying solely on Earlypsychosis POV.-- () 14:45, 4 September 2009 (UTC)
You're still left with a due-weight problem for the disease articles:  If you can't find a paper primarily about the disease that discusses BDNF (such as a review paper on bulimia, not a review paper on BDNF), then Wikipedia's article about the disease probably shouldn't refer to BDNF.  
The BDNF article itself doesn't suffer from this problem, as any good paper that is primarily about BDNF could obviously be useful in writing Wikipedia's article about BDNF.   () 22:28, 4 September 2009 (UTC)

So in summary
BDNF now has more references as per here [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brain-derived_neurotrophic_factor&amp;diff=311897078&amp;oldid=311569104], not just the one inadequate Strand et al article cited to show a possible link with clinical depression, schizophrenia, Obsessive-compulsive disorder, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Rett syndrome, dementia, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa...that I removed (without any agenda).  So a good improvement!
the following articles also have new references as below to support the line There is an association between brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and
schizophrenia 
Causes of schizophrenia 
Biology of obsessive–compulsive disorder 
Alzheimer's disease 
Rett syndrome 
dementia - no evidence provided, so removed

Status of ?

This template is rarely used, but I think it would be helpful for the usual reasons.  Perhaps the name of the template is too unwieldy?  Also, it isn't listed at  or at .  () 00:11, 3 September 2009 (UTC)
The template name is unwieldy.  However, the reason it has not come up here before is probably because this project tends not to include articles about medical people in its scope.  The current assessment guidelines state to tag a page with  &quot;only if the person is notable for substantial contributions to medicine.&quot;  I would guess that most medical people are notable (and thus included in Wikipedia) for reasons other than substantially contributing to the field of medicine.  Instead, they are covered by  and tagged with . -- 01:57, 3 September 2009 (UTC)
That's the general theory, but in practice, the topical WikiProjects do the work.  In other words, the biography project doesn't exactly have it together.  In any case, I added this template to Aniru Conteh and just submitted a peer review.  I would appreciate an assessment of the article by this project, any corrections and criticism, or recommendations for expansion, or even major contributions.  Ideally, I would like to go into detail about Conteh's clinical approach to treating Lassa fever, and the status of the ward after his death, and the new role of the Mano River Union Lassa Fever Network.  There appears to be an update regarding the ward (and the network) in one or two journals that I don't have access to, particularly Antiviral Research 78 (1):103-115, and possibly a few others. Jessica Melone (I believe she is currently employed by the NIH) includes some of this information in a PPT presentation[http://distance.jhsph.edu/more/capstoneMaterials2009/winter/Melone_Jessica.ppt] with references at the end, but without footnotes, it's hard to tell where to find it.

It is indeed the en dash (the shorter one, so named because it is as wide as an en in whatever font it's set in). The guideline is , and the Dash article has all the information you need :)  (·) 19:10, 8 September 2009 (UTC)

There are 3 dashes, the hypen -, the en dash –, and the em dash —.  Em dash is used to separate chunks of text.  En dash is used in numeric ranges.  The dash used in hyphenated words is the hyphen: Ulnar-mammary syndrome. -- () 03:31, 9 September 2009 (UTC)
No, Una, the hyphen is not a dash. There are many other uses for the en dash, as detailed in the links I provided above; it was the correct character in this case. Wikipedia does not follow the Chicago style: see point 1(c) of  and .  (·) 11:15, 9 September 2009 (UTC)

Although the link  is blue, it has no anchor;   does.  Having now researched this syndrome on PubMed, I agree the en-dash is correct.  The syndrome shows abnormalities of the ulna and the breast.  The article, a stub, provides no clue.  -- () 15:40, 9 September 2009 (UTC)

Support merge. The problem with that article was encapsulated by the first sentence, which gave a broad and unreferenced definition of &quot;glutathione supplements&quot; that is at odds with the usual meaning of the term. When you say &quot;glutathione supplement&quot; that means &quot;a supplement containing glutathione&quot; - that content formed about two sentences of the entire article, the rest was a broad sweep of &quot;dietary compounds that might interact with glutathione metabolism&quot;.

Most of the references were about biology and glutathione but were made to talk about supplements when refs were not about supplements, hence misuse of refs.--[[User:Literaturegeek|Literaturegeek]] | [[User_talk:Literaturegeek |T@1k?]] 18:51, 9 September 2009 (UTC)
I wrote most of this article. I would support the consensus Wikipedia editors. I agree that definitions must be supported by consensus. The definition of &quot;glutathione supplement&quot; seems to be at issue. To have it include any supplement that might be used with the intention of increasing or supporting glutathione function may be too broad. ( () 19:55, 9 September 2009 (UTC))

I think Nutriveg is saying it is hard to discuss content that is not in the current version of the article.  Nutriveg, you can link to past versions of the article, link to diffs of the article, and copy chunks of text from any version of the article to the talk page.  I agree with Entropy7 that the heart of the problem is a mismatch between article title and content, not misuse of references.  I also agree with other editors that the content in the disputed article belongs in the other article.  Making Glutathione supplements a redirect is a first step, but perhaps some content prior to the redirect does remain to be merged into the article Glutathione. -- () 20:27, 9 September 2009 (UTC)

Not all of the refs were misused and there is some content that is worth merging. There are relevant refs I thought that it had been or was going to be merged into the main glutathione article? Ref one,[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12818476] was cited 5 times to make statements about supplements but the ref was not talking about supplements. The main glutathione article is still a bit small and is quite a way off needing to be split, so would not oppose relevant info being merged into it.--[[User:Literaturegeek|Literaturegeek]] | [[User_talk:Literaturegeek |T@1k?]] 21:08, 9 September 2009 (UTC)

You made a very poor reading of that Wikipedia article introduction (&quot;either increase glutathione levels or increase effectiveness of glutathione mediated processes&quot;) since the reference you cited is clearly ontopic: &quot;an imbalance in expression of GSH and associated enzymes has been implicated in a variety of circumstances (...) Polymorphic expression of enzymes involved in GSH homeostasis  influences susceptibility and progression&quot;.-- () 22:03, 9 September 2009 (UTC)
Ok, but where does it say that &quot;Glutathione supplementation has been shown to increase plasma glutathione levels in different diseases&quot; (then listing the diseases) which was stated in the article?--[[User:Literaturegeek|Literaturegeek]] | [[User_talk:Literaturegeek |T@1k?]] 22:11, 9 September 2009 (UTC)
I mean it's on topic because those enzymes fits the article topic by that article introduction. It's well known that glutathione is reduced by the onset of many diseases, so supplementation is likely to be effective in those conditions. I can't search for a source right now but it's clear you don't know the subject you're talking about.-- () 22:23, 9 September 2009 (UTC)

This statement is original research, &quot;so supplementation is likely to be effective in those conditions&quot;. I accept that glutathione is reduced in many diseases, however, correlation does not mean causation,,, meaning glutathione may be a symptom of a disease process but correction of glutathione levels may do nothing for the symptoms or disease. This is what I mean by speculation and original research. I admit I do not know much about the subject matter, but if you have references which say what you are saying then great. By the way, I am not your enemy, although it may seem that way and I am not rabidly anti-supplements, was just opposed to original research and what I perceived to be misuse of a couple of refs. If it is any consolation when I first joined wikipedia I made a lot of mistakes, using poor sources and even misinterpreting a few of them and even original research on some occasions. I am sure that a compromise can be found. :)--[[User:Literaturegeek|Literaturegeek]] | [[User_talk:Literaturegeek |T@1k?]] 22:43, 9 September 2009 (UTC)
&quot;So supplementation is likely to work&quot; is not just , but is well beyond any high-quality source I've seen in the last few years.  AFAIK, the most charitable interpretation of available data is that glutathione supplementation is at the &quot;plausible hypothesis that needs rigorous testing&quot; stage.  A less charitable reading is &quot;When we blind the trials properly, we're not seeing a benefit beyond placebo.&quot;
Supplementation is known not to be useful in other similar situations:  e.g., most Calcium deficiencies are not usefully treated by taking an oral Calcium supplement (even when the supplement includes Vitamin D).   () 06:11, 10 September 2009 (UTC)
&quot;So supplementation is likely to work&quot; was my comment about that phrase, (&quot;Glutathione supplementation has been shown to increase plasma glutathione levels in different diseases&quot;) since I couldn't pick a source at that time to use its own words. The phrase was specific about &quot;plasma glutathione levels&quot; which makes it even more plausible. Now I picked a [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11168457 source] that explicit says that in the abstract (I don't know if the previous one already did in its content) and we can all be happy. 
The problem here is that the  says one shouldn't delete content in that situation only if it's &quot;patent nonsense&quot; or after a  was used. It didn't sound as &quot;patent nonsense&quot; to me and those that deleted it (at least Literaturegeek by his own words) didn't know the subject. So you complete deleted that newcomer contribution soly by assuming bad faith, that all that text was about promoting some specific branded product.
PS: About calcium supplementation I've sources that support a different POV than yours, please inform me in which wikipedia article they are not well represented.-- () 15:22, 10 September 2009 (UTC)
The problem is whether you're looking at biomarkers or practical clinical outcomes.  Sure:  eating glutathione supplementation raises the amount of glutathione in the body.  
But does it improve practical outcomes?  No -- not as far as anyone can make out, at the moment.  For example, many women take Calcium to reduce the risk of hip fractures due to osteoporosis.  Eating Calcium increases the amount of Calcium in the body.  But does it work?  Not really:  Women who take Calcium supplements and women who do not either end up with basically the same number of hip fractures due to osteoporosis, or they prevent the hip fracture at the cost of a heart attack[http://www.nhs.uk/news/2007/january08/pages/calciumpillsandheartrisk.aspx].  There are various theories:  e.g., perhaps the extra Calcium blocks Phosphorus absorption.  (Both are needed for healthy bones.) 
Just improving the biomarker doesn't make people healthier.  We need to be careful about claiming that something &quot;works&quot;, because the average reader is going to interpret that as &quot;has a practical benefit to daily life&quot;, not &quot;improves some number on a lab test&quot;.  And, in case you weren't aware, on Tuesday, this article said &quot;Glutathione supplementation has been shown to affect the prograssion or treatment of Parkinsons disease[1], HIV[2][1], cystic fibrosis[3][1], liver disease[1] and cancer[4][5],&quot; which is a clear claim of practical benefit that isn't even slightly supported by the named sources, most of which explicitly disclaim any practical benefit.  For example, the HIV source says that GSH levels increased, but T4 counts, etc., all remained the same.  Based on this information, a reasonable person would conclude that GSH has zero effect on HIV disease.   () 19:53, 10 September 2009 (UTC)
I won't discuss Calcium here since it's offtopic. By the way &quot;Calcium deficiencies&quot; is different than &quot;bone health&quot;, if someone has a bone disease when the cause is not low serum levels of calcium (which can be exam checked) it's unlikely that kind of supplementation will help the outcome of that disease.
As I said before that was a biology article not a medical one, so the kind of required rigor is not the same. That low access, unpopular term article had miminal or no impact to someone seeking information on &quot;treatment of Parkinsons disease&quot;. That person would find that article only by accident, specially during the time those weak points could be addressed. No comments on the quality of that Glutathione metabolism article made so far justify the way it was completed deleted and the way many people kept deleting it as whole while I was trying to improve that article content. -- () 20:42, 10 September 2009 (UTC)

I understand what you are saying, you are talking about correcting a deficiency. Do you have any references which show a therapeutic value of glutathione? If not, then I am not sure a dedicated article is warranted. Why not expand this section, Glutathione#Supplementation sticking closely to what the refs say?--[[User:Literaturegeek|Literaturegeek]] | [[User_talk:Literaturegeek |T@1k?]] 21:00, 10 September 2009 (UTC)

I must be misunderstanding something. Nutriveg, are you saying that it's OK to make unfounded claims that glutathione can treat Parkinson's, HIV, cancer, etc - as long as those claims are made in a &quot;biology&quot; article rather than a &quot;medical&quot; article? Even if this were not a ludicrous assertion on its face, doesn't the claim that a substance can cure a disease place an article squarely in the &quot;medical&quot; realm?   21:09, 10 September 2009 (UTC)
Literaturegeek, read the the article introduction to understand that article purpose. As I said before the content could be moved (later or at that time) but the only actions, by yourself included, were to delete the whole article and to stop another editor from improving/reviewing that text (before it could be  moved).
MastCell, No, I was saying that part of the article should be rewrited or deleted, not the article as whole, specially not several times while someone else was trying to improve it.-- () 21:16, 10 September 2009 (UTC)
I did read the intro. Here is the last version,[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glutathione_supplements&amp;oldid=312811059] for anyone who is interested of the article before it was deleted and redirected. There are some refs which are interesting factoids which should be merged into the main glutathione article. I am not opposed to some of the information being merged. I did read the introduction and I still feel that there is not enough good refs for a dedicated article to glutathione supplements. I also am of the opinion of correlation does not demonstrate causation or benefit from supplementation, it is speculative. I think instead of arguing about whether the page should be ressurected, which is unlikely due to lack of consensus, why not just move relevant refs to the main glutathione article, stick closely to what the refs say, then if anyone disagrees with some of the refs, we can take it from there?--[[User:Literaturegeek|Literaturegeek]] | [[User_talk:Literaturegeek |T@1k?]] 21:24, 10 September 2009 (UTC)
I pointed the introduction because that was what the article was about, not about &quot;therapeutic value of glutathione&quot; as you said above. Stop pushing the blame on me, you opposed any change in article before merge because you deleted it twice as I was doing so. Because of all that  more than ever I lost the motivation to continue editing it. If you want to end this discussion just end it, instead of implying it was a fault to separately edit (expand) the article prior to merging (what no one did) or start discussing the article as it was restricted to a specific phrase (that could be easily deleted instead of the &quot;whole content&quot;), using my comments in this discussion like they pertained to the article, ... -- () 22:38, 10 September 2009 (UTC)
Change to the article is irrelevant because you have been asked to provide refs which specifically talk about therapeutic benefit and have not provided any. It was not I who initially deleted the article but another editor. You reverted the deletion without discussion so I reverted your revert twice. I thought my compromise of merging content into the glutathione article was a good compromise, apparently not, oh well. :)--[[User:Literaturegeek|Literaturegeek]] | [[User_talk:Literaturegeek |T@1k?]] 22:58, 10 September 2009 (UTC)
There was discussion here and on that article talk page (the appropriate place), I only reverted the article deletion to add/remove/rewrite content, that was what I was doing while you were simpling reverting, part of those edits never came to that page because of edit conflicts (you deleting the article while I was editing) and an edit stall to respect of 3RR. I won't further continue this discussion.-- () 14:34, 11 September 2009 (UTC)
Fever vs hyperthermia vs failure of thermoregulation

I've been looking a bit at our articles on fever, hyperthermia, and human thermoregulation, and think that a differential diagnosis section would be appropriate.  Specifically, we have no information about how you would determine that a given elevated temperature is a &quot;fever&quot; (elevated set-point) instead of &quot;heat stroke&quot; or a failure of thermoregulation (which I understand could be caused by a stroke or other problem in just the right spot in the brain, but correct me if I'm wrong).

Does anyone know how to tell these apart?  More importantly, does anyone know of a reliable source that discusses the process of classifying &quot;39 C&quot; as one or the other of these three options? 

My guesses (definitely  here) are that an elevated temperature that is responsive to paracetamol is probably a fever instead of the other two (converse probably not true?), and that if you had a case history of spending all day in miserably hot weather, you'd suspect heatstroke instead of the other two, but surely someone knows more than I do.   () 16:57, 3 September 2009 (UTC)
A good general medicine textbook will have everything you're looking for. Harrison's, for instance: [http://books.google.com/books?&amp;id=1XtHh8F6V_kC start on page 117] :)  (·) 19:15, 3 September 2009 (UTC)

Thanks, Fv.  Any advice on how I should handle Harrison's self-contradiction (that damage to the hypothalamus produces &quot;hypothalamic fever,&quot; in the &quot;fever&quot; section, and that it produces &quot;hyperthermia&quot; in the hyperthermia section?  
Also, I've found Heat syndrome, which seems a bit fishy to me.  The term is occasionally used... but not like that, in my quick search.   () 00:40, 13 September 2009 (UTC)
Where did you find the contradiction? The last paragraph of the &quot;Fever&quot; section is pretty clear to me, defining &quot;hypothalamic fever&quot; as an occasionally used term that doesn't jive with the typical effects of hypothalamic damage and noting that trauma to the hypothalamus may directly elevate the hypothalamic set point (which would make it &quot;fever&quot; in that the set point is changed and &quot;hyperthermia&quot; in that no pyrogens were involved).  (·) 01:36, 13 September 2009 (UTC)
Heat syndrome smacks of  to me, especially when you check the earliest revisions of the page (mmm, vampires). If there's no established definition in the literature to which the article can be rewritten to conform, it should be sent to AfD.  (·) 01:36, 13 September 2009 (UTC)
Table 17-1 lists &quot;hypothalamic injury&quot; as hyperthermia.  
Does anyone happen to know whether an elevated temperature due to hypothalamic injury (apparently a rare presentation of a rare condition) is responsive to antipyretics?  That seems to be the basic rule of thumb...   () 04:46, 13 September 2009 (UTC)
A couple of recent reviews (, ) suggest that elevated temperature with hypothalamic injury = hyperthermia. Have a look at this [http://books.google.com/books?q=hypothalamic+fever&amp;btnG=Search+Books Google Books] search of &quot;hypothalamic fever&quot;: the term also appears in earlier editions of Cecil, with the exact same wording as in Harrison's. Bearing in mind that the only authors that seem to mention it in recent times call it a rarely and poorly used term, I'd safely say that &quot;hypothalamic fever&quot; does not merit a mention in Wikipedia.  (·) 13:27, 13 September 2009 (UTC)

Categories: Health informatics, Health care informatics, Medical informatics

We currently have three categories, [[:Category:Health informatics]], [[:Category:Health care informatics]] and [[:Category:Medical informatics]] (plus further categories for specific software).

All three identify the same article, health informatics, as their &quot;lead&quot; article; and that article gives no differentiation between the three.

So: is there any thinking as to what distinction there should be between the three categories?  What articles ought to go into each one?   () 16:53, 15 September 2009 (UTC)

New category: Healthcare management

I have created a new category [[:Category:Healthcare management]], which I was a bit surprised didn't exist before.

I've given it the provisional rubric,
&quot;A category for management and organisational (rather than purely economic or transactional) issues in health care, particularly those arising close to the front-line of healthcare delivery.&quot;
to try to suggest a focus on more real-world activity; rather than the managing of flows of pieces of paper, or the design of structures for such pieces of paper to flow through and between (though perhaps those activities deserve categories of their own too).

I've added a few articles with an operational management angle; but the category is probably still under-populated, so there are probably more that people feel should belong there.

The category &quot;lead&quot; article is identified as Healthcare administration.  However, at present the article really only contains information on some (U.S.-specific) qualifications, and some (U.S. specific) professional associations; but very little on anything that might be contained in those university courses, or any distinctive challenges that arise in healthcare management rather than any other kind of management.  So the article could use some expansion.   () 17:17, 15 September 2009 (UTC)

NOTICE. Request For Comment: Changes to Naming policies which may affect WikiProject naming conventions.

Following recent changes by some editors to the  policy page, a Request For Comment, (RFC) is now being held to debate the removal of the  passage specifying that individual WikiProject and other naming conventions are able to make exceptions to the standard policy of using Common Names as the titles of Wikipedia articles.   

This WikiProject is being notified since it operates such a specific naming convention. Editors are invited to comment on the proposed change at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Naming_conventions#RfC:_In_WP:Naming_Conventions.2C_should_the_specific_exceptions_to_.22Use_Common_Name.22_be_removed.3F this location].     01:26, 16 September 2009 (UTC)
The above &quot;notification&quot; is a grossly biased misrepresentation of the changes under discussion. The old version of the naming conventions policy tried to lay down binding rules; we don't work that way, so it was necessary also to make explicit exceptions. The new version articulates principles, and allows for consensus to establish how they should be applied. Thus there is no longer any need for exceptions. In fact, making exceptions is nonsense, since there are no rules to make exceptions to. These changes are good for specific conventions. Xandar is trying to induce moral panic in those who stand to gain the most from this. Xandar is only opposed to the new version because he thinks the wording, not the general thrust, weakens his position in a dispute unrelated to this RfC. Don't be fooled.  02:43, 16 September 2009 (UTC)
No. Don't be fooled. The proposed wording change is shown at the RFC linked in my post above. The removal of the &quot;exceptions&quot; phrase is a very significant change. The policy never stated that it consisted of &quot;rules&quot; before, and it still doesn't. However it remains policy. Simply stating a personal view that titling a section &quot;principles&quot; changes the status of the policy page, is one not even accepted by many editors on Hesperians side. There is already an attempt to use the principle of no exceptions to the &quot;use common name&quot; policy to radically change the Naming conflict page, and one of the proposers of this change has indicated that the guidance on flora is also targetted. The change is in my view an attempt to impose a rigid, top-down policy on naming which ignores what wikipedia editors on the ground find most useful.    03:09, 16 September 2009 (UTC)

Semi-protect request for Leukemia

Leukemia is having a small problem with a couple of IP addresses adding memorial/tribute statements involving a child with leukemia: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leukemia&amp;diff=314188564&amp;oldid=313990798][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leukemia&amp;diff=313973856&amp;oldid=313067708][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leukemia&amp;diff=314264884&amp;oldid=314215099]  I've left notes at the IP talk pages, but if one of our admins feels like semi-protecting the page for a few days, it might reinforce a change in behavior.

Medical images

I have redacted the names and places of people who have not given their permission to be publicly mentioned in this way.  () 23:15, 18 September 2009 (UTC)

I have received more complaints from psychologist regarding my posting with verbal consent this among other images [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langer-Giedion_syndrome].  I now have formal written consent from this person.  This is the form I used to ask permission for use.

To Whom It May Concern:

I hereby authorize Dr. James Heilman to use images of myself and my condition on Wikipedia and allow their release into the Creative Commons under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License.  This means in short that: people are free to distribute and modify the file as long as the author(s) are attributed in any format.

I am aware that Wikipedia is attempting to catalogue the breadth and depth of human knowledge and to provide it free to the world at large.  That Wikipedia is the 6th most popular internet site in the world and accessed by greater than 65 million people per year as of 2008.  And that nearly 50% of physicians use Wikipedia in Clinical practise.  I am willing to freely contribute to the public availability medical information.

I realize that neither I nor Dr. James Heilman will be financially reimbursed for these contributions.

Wondering if we should attach something similar to images so that no one gets confused?  Any comments on the wording?[[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 22:59, 16 September 2009 (UTC)
Shouldn't you get the creator to contact ? [[User:Fences and windows|Fences]]&amp;[[User talk:Fences and windows|Windows]] 23:37, 16 September 2009 (UTC)

My only comment here was that we should have a formal policy for use of potential sensitive images.  The picture of the child with Down's syndrome for example may be questioned.  We should have a form that we all get people to sign.  This may prevent future misunderstanding.[[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 23:49, 16 September 2009 (UTC)

The above is a subject consent form;  the copyright holder is supposed to send an e-mail to OTRS but there is no similar requirement for subjects.  In any case, how to show incontrovertible proof of consent, without breaching confidentiality?  -- () 02:54, 17 September 2009 (UTC)
Yes people have given me consent for use of their images but I do not think we should be posting names or anything just to prove that they have given written consent.  I guess I will just keep the documentation at home and people will have to take my word for it unless anyone can think of another method.[[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 03:33, 17 September 2009 (UTC)
The way it works in commercial photography is consent is between the photographer and the subject.  Ie, only the subject has grounds to claim consent was not given.  Written consent is kept confidential unless a claim emerges and it appears that the claim comes from the actual subject (as opposed to someone who merely claims to be the subject). -- () 03:49, 17 September 2009 (UTC)

Are you getting complains on-wiki about this, or in real life?  On-wiki, we can help; in real life -- well, there are cranks everywhere.  Your institution or malpractice insurance agent might care about the details of the paperwork, but it's rude for a complete stranger to assume that you lied about the consent, and it's inappropriate for random strangers to appoint themselves to the &quot;paperwork judge&quot; and issue rulings on whether verbal consent is adequate.  
Are you assuming that this is retaliation for your efforts at Rorschach test?   () 04:19, 17 September 2009 (UTC)

To give you further details the complaint comes from [redacted] a psychologist from [redacted].  The letter of compliant is to my college of physicians and surgeons and in it she also makes reference to my involvement in the Rorschach test / public domain.  So it does like like I am being Wiki stalked.
I have legal counsel in these matters.  I am posting to this forum as we here probably need a format to note that approval has been obtained.  Verbal approval may not be sufficient.  My college of physicians and surgeon will be discussing this shortly.  The above psychologists felling are however that it is horrible that we Wikipedians only get verbal consent for images of people we may see in our practice.  She sees herself as attempting to &quot;protect vulnerable people&quot;.  I shall be spending the rest of the day trying to track down the people in the images.  I have the day the image was taken but not the name or any other contact info.  That mean I have a lot of coffee and gift to buy hospital staff for their effort in helping me find these people to get consent in written.
So to finish to COA I shall be getting written approval from all identifiable people I use on Wikipedia and it might be advisable to make this policy to prevent any third party attacks upon use.  We must be proactive in these matter.  Are actions are being scrutinized by many who hope we fail in this endeavor of creating an encyclopedia of all human knowledge.[[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 17:02, 17 September 2009 (UTC)

The intent of  is quite clear. For otherwise non-notable individuals we should be very protective of their privacy. Given that biometric image-based search engines are already starting to appear on the web, we should assume that someone's image will eventually be tied to their personal identity. Omitting the name is not even close to being a sufficient long-term guard of the subject's privacy. Either get (and keep) a record of consent or don't use photos of living people in association with potentially harmful information about them.   18:07, 17 September 2009 (UTC)
Yes, but no:  Doc James has obtained consent; he doesn't have it organized in a handy fashion.  Wikipedia has never required image uploaders to maintain an organized list of what they've uploaded.  Our pages are supposed to do that for them.   () 18:27, 17 September 2009 (UTC)

I have no objection to written consent -- far from it -- but [the psychologist] reasoning doesn't hold up.  Either she believes, without foundation, that the asserted verbal consent is fraudulent (you're a liar), uninformed (you withheld information), or incompetent (highly insulting to the participants) -- or it's really no better, in practice, than written consent.  For example:  your assertion of the existence of written consent relies just as much on your integrity as your assertion of the existence of verbal consent; people misunderstand written forms as easily as verbal ones; people can be pestered into signing documents just as easily as into verbally agreeing; a person incompetent to give consent verbally is also incompetent to give consent in writing (and so forth).  
I'm sorry that you've had to go to the trouble and expense of hiring an attorney, especially since it seems pretty silly for her to get worked up over the exact form of paperwork in the complete absence of complaints from the so-called vulnerable people.  As a judge once told me, based on his many years of family court disputes, what really matters is whether people have a good understanding, not how they write it down.  
In the meantime, I've asked at  for advice on recording consent.   () 18:27, 17 September 2009 (UTC)

Consent and privacy are two separate things, and they can be in conflict.  To protect the privacy of a patient who has given consent, may be better to not obtain a written consent.  Perhaps also to not even know the patient's name.  In Doc James' case, written consent would serve no purpose except to allow the people harassing him to do the same to patients.  Will he violate the privacy of his patients to defend himself?  -- () 19:12, 17 September 2009 (UTC)

I think obtaining consent is the responsibility of the uploading physician. We shouldn't send forms to OTRS; that breaches confidentiality. Just keep the forms for when you need them, e.g. when you are harrassed by psychologists. -- () 19:31, 17 September 2009 (UTC)

I was a bit slow on the uptake. For publication of such images in a medical journal you would need to obtain formal signed consent to publication, and send that consent to the editor as proof. You should definitely obtain signed consent for your own legal protection.  gives our policy on image us and privacy. A problem with the current situation is we have to take your word that you have consent; sending the forms to OTRS would be the equivalent of sending the forms to a medical editor, though I am unable to advise whether this would be a breach of HIPAA or other confidentiality laws. [[User:Fences and windows|Fences]]&amp;[[User talk:Fences and windows|Windows]] 02:08, 18 September 2009 (UTC)
A more sustainable solution may be to give the image to the patient (both legally and physically), and ask if the patient would be willing to upload the image through OTRS. -- () 02:34, 18 September 2009 (UTC)
This has several downsides.  (1) Many patients are not computer savvy enough to do this, and the intersection set of those who are savvy enough and have a condition worth photographing for use here is really small.  (2) This requires the patient to reveal an e-mail address to anyone who can examine OTRS tickets now and in the future (the tickets are kept).  That is a lot of people.  Thus, this substantially diminishes the patients' privacy.  (3) When a patient supplies an image created in a medical setting it is not unusual for Commons editors to challenge the patient's claim of having the right to license the image.  -- () 14:21, 21 September 2009 (UTC)

Advice for new user on rewriting a medicine page

I'm a new user looking at improving/rewriting the page on lymphangiomatosis.  I'd be grateful for advice on any particular considerations to be aware of beyond what is on the general wikipedia page for new users on creating new articles.  My plan is to draft the new page on my userpage and then move it across.

Apologies if this question should be asked somewhere else (I did search the archive but couldn't see anything)  Thanks.

 () 20:16, 22 September 2009 (UTC)

Thanks for offering to help out!
The most important pages are  and . The former provides an outline and stylistic advice for medical articles, and the latter clarifies what kind of sources should ideally be used. The current version is not too bad but a bit jargonistic and devoid of proper sources.
Let me know if you need a hand, or ask her for support/advice.  |  20:49, 22 September 2009 (UTC)

It's great to have another editor to help out with this.  This is a good page to ask for help, and I'm sure the article will benefit from some attention.  You should feel free to work directly on the article if you prefer  (in your userspace is also fine:  whatever you prefer).  Here are some ideas for you:
*  has some ideas about what kinds of things should be included.  The top of that page also has some suggestions about how to write an article that sounds encyclopedic.  (That is, something that sounds like neither a patient-information pamphlet nor a medical manual for the treating physician.)  To avoid , you need to write everything in your own words. 
* We always appreciate really top-quality .  Medical textbooks (if you don't have a relevant one, [http://books.google.com/books?q=lymphangiomatosis&amp;as_brr=3 try Google books], your local library, or other sources) are ideal, as are relatively recent literature review papers, which you might be able to find through PubMed.  I know this is a rare condition, but case reports and older publications (more than about 10 years for rare conditions) are not usually very good sources -- but use your judgment.  For example, you might like to look at , which is a case report, but which also (in the &quot;Discussion&quot; section) provides a good overview that might be useful to you.  
* Please make an effort to use  so that future editors will always know exactly where a given fact came from.  Citations don't have to be perfect as long as they're understandable.  That article is currently using , so you should probably stick with that style.
I hope this is helpful.  Wikipedia's formatting system can be unduly complicated, but there are a number of experienced editors here.  Please feel free to ask more questions as you go along.   () 21:00, 22 September 2009 (UTC)

;Update
After a couple of days of following the article and a couple more on the talk page, here's my overview.  Y'all should plan to show up on the talk page after reading this:

* Fully protected.  Many thanks to the admin for putting a very firm, albeit temporary, stop to the edit warring.
* Page name.  One editor is pushing for a very fine distinction between safe sex and safeR sex.  That is, &quot;safe sex&quot; has an absolute, gold-plated guarantee that you won't get any kind of infection and/or (depending on the definition) suffer any sort of negative (including non-infectious) health effect.  (Sexual activities known to be in this last category:  None.)  SafeR sex, by contrast, reduces your risk of contracting an infection from another person.  The vast majority of sources, as well as this article (since 2001), use the two terms interchangeably.  A small minority of (very good) sources draw a distinction between the two terms -- always and only for the purpose of explaining their stylistic preference for the term safeR sex.  The article currently describes the fine distinction and then goes on to use the term interchangeably.  This matters because I'm about to lose patience with the endless  obstruction -- there's a lot of work that needs to be done that has absolutely no connection to this, but we can't get anything accomplished because of this fight -- and because one editor seems to think that the article's (current, not original) location at Safe sex means that nothing about harm reduction (safeR sex) belongs in the article.  (No, don't bother asking me to pretend that I have any sympathy for this defining-the-article-out-of-existence argument:  I don't.)
* HIV or everything.  There's some question of whether anyone uses safeR sex outside of the context of HIV.  (Sure they do, as any quick trip to PubMed will tell you.  But this is not impinging on our consciousness.)  All of the sources that explain the nuances of the choices are AIDS-specific (e.g., UNAIDS).
* Infecting yourself.  One version of the article says that you can transmit an STI to yourself (e.g., by spreading fecal bacteria to the urinary tract, and thus getting a UTI).  No sources support this notion of autoinfection as an STI.  It appears to be based on a literal interpretation of &quot;safe&quot;:  If you get a UTI from doing that, then it wasn't safe, was it?  (Well, no, but that doesn't mean that it's an STI, either.) 
* We're not writing the article; we're not even trying to.  We're trying to &quot;win&quot;.  This is dueling sources for the sake of having it reflect &quot;my&quot; personal vocabulary quirks instead of for the sake of producing a good product.

What you can do to help:  I've just started a straw poll that I hope will reduce the bickering about whether or not this or that practice is within the scope of the article.  It's at .  Please add your views, and then please watch the page for the next week or so.   () 23:33, 22 September 2009 (UTC)

When asking  for other users to join a discussion do it in a neutral way, not suggesting they should assume any POV or presenting the facts in a distorted way.
You didn't &quot;followed the article&quot; but actively joined the discussion supporting a specific POV.
I asked the article to be protected because unaware editors that recently joined the discussion were reverting it to a intermediary version, after the earlier problematic version.
All definitions I used were from sources, the definitions of &quot;safe sex&quot; were weak because as well were the sources that defined that term. You are presenting then in a caricaturist way, making statements (most of all) I never did. For example you took harm reduction from nowhere since I never used or supported that term.
The very good sources that support the &quot;safer sex&quot; term, the WHO for instance, clearly do it because of the meaning, those sources don't present it as a aesthetic decision you're implying.
The article current description of &quot;the fine distinction&quot; is unreferenced text,  that contradicts at least one of the sources provided (UK).
The HIV was the last step we reached, when you and the other editor refused to clearly state that conclusion: It's a recommended term (at least) for HIV, including by 2008 UN AIDS Terminology Guidelines. So we could move on from that point, discussing other STDs and HIV . Instead, cornered by evidence you shortly decided to abandon that discussion, saying it was not important, but now is 
Talking about &quot;infecting yourself&quot; you're going deep on the article discussion, raising a very recent discussion that started today but seens to be very important for you and you're the only one supporting that POV. The exact term is &quot;cross infection&quot;, there were [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10616355] sources supporting that and you never requested additional sources or gave time for them to be presented.
Don't include me in your quest for win, I said several times that I could change my opinion if reliable~ sources were provided. But you ignored those I presented so far.
We never rejected the reference of any preventive practice and you are starting that pool from nowhere. The discussion so far was what term definition (provided so far by reliable sources) better defined the article content, where I supported the &quot;safer sex&quot; definition brought so far.-- () 01:12, 23 September 2009 (UTC)

I'm astonished that you would pretend to know which articles I've read, and on what days.  I tell you, accurately and in good faith, that I watched the edit warring for a couple of days before my first edit, which was on 20 September.  If you can demonstrate that I'm a liar, then please do share your sources of information.
None of your other points, such as the possibility of non-sexual transmission of HPV (the article you link here) are worth responding to at this time.  Editors here are perfectly capable of giving their opinion about the general subject of the article -- whether it should be the general concept of reducing transmission of STIs between partners, or about the variety of definitions used for the words -- without knowing anything at all about the various definitions.  
Whether the article should focus on the &quot;concept&quot; or the &quot;vocabulary&quot; is a pretty basic question that any editor is capable of sharing an opinion on.  Sometimes it's important for Wikipedia to have an article about names:  See Gay-related immune deficiency and Gay bowel syndrome as examples.  Sometimes it's more important to have the article cover the idea behind the words:  See AIDS and Proctitis for the ideas that those two obsolete terms refer to.  This is the question for editors:  Should we focus on the idea, or on the terms?  It's this decision that determines the article content, not the definition of the words currently used for the page name.  After all, we can change the page name if we need to.

* Current quick question.  Nutriveg has decided that the UK's National Health Service website, NHS Choices, is unreliable per , on the grounds that it's targeted to consumers and is therefore likely to use &quot;lay&quot; language, like &quot;safe sex&quot; instead of supposedly &quot;medical terminology&quot; like &quot;safer sex&quot;, and on the grounds that MEDRS doesn't specifically name this website run by the NHS.  Nutriveg prefers the language preferred in UNAIDS's [http://data.unaids.org/pub/Manual/2008/JC1336_unaids_terminology_guide_en.pdf terminology guideline], which is essentially a house stylebook for the agency's marketing department.  If you have a view on this issue, I think a quick comment at the end of  would be the place to share your thoughts.  The question:  Is the NHS Choices website a reliable source for medicine-related information that is compatible with MEDRS requirements?  (Many thanks to the editors who have taken time to comment on previous issues.)    () 01:27, 25 September 2009 (UTC)
Hum, you again came back here presenting the issue in a non-neutral way using words that don't represent what I said.
NHS Choices, is a website of NHS, I didn't say it was directed to consumers, but the general public, by its own definition &quot;[http://www.nhs.uk/aboutNHSChoices/Pages/AboutNHSChoices.aspx The service is intended to help you make choices about your health]&quot;
That kind of source is clearly defined by : &quot;public guides and service announcements, which (...) are generally less authoritative than the underlying medical literature.&quot;
And I pointed that the discussion about that website is useless, since the links of that website so far provided support more the &quot;safer sex&quot; term
To contextualize we are not discussing this term just to have a discussion, we are discussing the name of article title, where I'm trying to follow  specially where it says:
&quot;Where there is a dispute over a (article title) name, editors should cite recognised authorities and organisations&quot;
I've already cited such  for instance (PAHO/WAS/WHO)[http://www.paho.org/english/hcp/hca/promotionsexualhealth.pdf] and UNAIDS[http://data.unaids.org/pub/Manual/2008/JC1336_unaids_terminology_guide_en.pdf]  supporting the &quot;safer sex&quot; term.
But  and Misch are strongly supporting the &quot;safe sex&quot; title, even though they don't have (equally) reliable sources, by , to support that POV. 
One editor, Misch, say it's of little importance to follow  and  as he sees that article as little related to the prevention and control of diseases, being more related to sexology in his opinion, and even stated that &quot;Safe sex is sexual practice, not medical practice (apart from when doctors and nurses have sex)&quot;
That discussion is happening in  of that article talk page.-- () 04:04, 25 September 2009 (UTC)

The UNAIDS document is a style guideline.  It tells its staff to use British spelling (p. 20) with the same authority that it tells them to use your preferred term.  It is not a scientific document.  Ditto for the PAHO document, whose title is &quot;Promotion of Sexual Health&quot; and repeatedly recommends  using the mass media for education and awareness.  These are not scientific documents. You have insisted for several days now that these two marketing plans are supposed to trump every other source, despite being nothing more than instructions to their marketing departments about how to promote their goals in public.  
You've also recently insisted that the NHS is not a &quot;recognised authority or organisation&quot;, despite the fact that the NHS is specifically listed, by name, as being a recognized authority in the very guideline that you're trying to (ab)use to exclude it.  Please look, again, at , and specifically the bit that says, &quot;Statements and information from reputable major medical and scientific bodies may be valuable encyclopedic sources. These bodies include...the British National Health Service.&quot;  It does not say, &quot;Only certain information from the NHS that supports Nutriveg's preferred term,&quot; or &quot;Only certain parts of the NHS's websites&quot; or anything like that.  
Your complaints are beyond silly:  either you can't understand fairly simple English, or you're being willfully perverse.   () 05:51, 25 September 2009 (UTC)
That's your view about those documents, where I see you qualifying those documents as marketing which Wikipedia defines as &quot;inform(ed) or persuade(d) that existing and newly-identified needs and wants may be satisfied by the products and services of others&quot; as nonsense.
Those documents weren't directed to the general public, nor even to mass media, but to other health authorities/organizations and health professionals.
I've never said that NHS was not reliable, but that website wasn't (equally) reliable by  and didn't fit the purpose described in  since it is directed to inform the general public about health choices, so strict following of &quot;scientific and medical terminology&quot; is not expected. Beyond that the links so far provided for that source, as a whole, support the same term used in those two documents that support the &quot;safer sex&quot; term, so you're just making all this discussion to make a , to disqualify myself. Which also evident when you change approaches, supporting the PAHO, WAS, WHO and UNAIDS  presented documents as &quot;marketing&quot; but the &quot;NHS Choices&quot; as reliable.
You're so much involved that couldn't even find the my citation of  qualifying websites like &quot;NHS Choices&quot;: &quot;public guides and service announcements (...) are generally less authoritative than the underlying medical literature.&quot;-- () 11:32, 25 September 2009 (UTC)

Promotion of one product?

This user's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Biopredictive contributions] seem to be narrowly focused on promoting one company's products on Medicine pages.  Do others here agree?  If so, I don't know what the proper procedure is when there are many pages affected.  Thanks for any comments.  -- () 10:42, 18 September 2009 (UTC)

Good morning, i'm the user biopredictive. I've named my user this way to be very clear that I speak in the name of a commercial company, and don't try to act &quot;hidden&quot; or whatever. What i've done :

- added a page for a validated, recommanded diagnostic test (FibroTest). This test has 98 scientific publications and is validated since 2002. This page explains how test work, benefits and limits ; evidence based.

- added reference to the test as a possible alternative to liver biopsy

If you think my steps are not perfect or clear, I'm willing to discuss about it (here, but i'm not fluent w/ wikipedia yet:), or email).

Have a nice day. 

(Hope I did post on the correct place)

Please familiarize yourself with  and . It is possible to constructively work on articles for which you have a conflict, but it should be approached with care. In most cases, it is best to help inform discussions on the article talk page rather than directly editting the article.  18:47, 18 September 2009 (UTC)
Thanx for your advices, I will clarify all this next week. My intention is to add a article on my user page declaring my COI. I had an hesitation to write a paragraph at end of my article explaining that the initial article was written by us, explaining the possible COI.   () 20:25, 18 September 2009 (UTC)
COI concerns are valid. FibroTest is a notable test for liver fibrosis, but the publication strategy of the authors is a bit spammy. [[User:Fences and windows|Fences]]&amp;[[User talk:Fences and windows|Windows]] 00:07, 19 September 2009 (UTC)
There is no &quot;spamming&quot; intention here at all. What doest make you feel it &quot;a bit spammy&quot; ? How can I help ? � �  () 07:51, 25 September 2009 (UTC)

Relevant to this is .  Input welcome.  I do heartily commend  for discussion this in Talk space rather than directly editing the article. -- () 11:48, 25 September 2009 (UTC)

Recent expansion of Central nervous system disease

If you have time, please visit and help improve the article: a significant amount of content was added during [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Central_nervous_system_disease&amp;diff=315348804&amp;oldid=286385270 this edit series], and there are some problems with the content. Many diagnoses which are not &quot;diseases&quot; were added (such as Asperger syndrome), and at least the AS section contained factually inaccurate information; others may as well.   () 11:24, 25 September 2009 (UTC)
 Gosh, it does need help. Heaps of unreferenced info and opinion.  &quot;You should...&quot; and other remarkable wording.  -  () 13:42, 25 September 2009 (UTC)
ADHD controversies

ADHD controversies article could do with some eyes on it and input. Refs are being misused, one editor is edit warring over content. They have said they would like to see the article deleted and keep fighting over labeling controversies fringe in article text without refs directly saying that. I have been reverted 3 times and other editor has been reverted.--[[User:Literaturegeek|Literaturegeek]] | [[User_talk:Literaturegeek |T@1k?]] 16:19, 25 September 2009 (UTC)
Noticed that.  I wish  specifically said whether editors may or may not introduce the word fringe in an article when it isn't found in any source. IMO if something is decidedly non-notable fringe we leave it out, otherwise we call it minority.
Another factor: On  it is pointed out that &quot;matters that are of notable popular interest&quot; are included in Wikipedia articles even where there &quot;exists little scientific interest or analysis.&quot;  ADHD controversies may be in science and/or in popular culture.  Keeping these things straight would help here. -  () 22:53, 26 September 2009 (UTC)

America’s Healthy Future Act

I recently created 'America’s Healthy Future Act', and I would appricate any comments or points of advice on how to proceed in improving the article.  () 22:21, 26 September 2009 (UTC)

Thanks to those who have taken an interest in the article!  () 06:23, 27 September 2009 (UTC)

Parietoöccipital fissure?

Quick question, is the Parietoöccipital fissure correct or should it be the Parietooccipital (or Parieto-occipital) fissure, as it is the fissure between the Occipital lobe and the Parietal lobe. Regards, [[User:Captain-n00dle|Captain n00dle]] [[User talk:Captain-n00dle|T]]/[[Special:Contributions/Captain-n00dle|C]] 22:47, 27 September 2009 (UTC)

All of these are valid from the 'grammatical' perspective, but we usually follow the choice of Terminologia Anatomica, which appears to be &quot;Parieto-occipital sulcus&quot;.   () 22:57, 27 September 2009 (UTC)

Thanks for the quick reply, I have never seen the ö used before in any english text book. Should I move the page and create a redirect? Regards, [[User:Captain-n00dle|Captain n00dle]] [[User talk:Captain-n00dle|T]]/[[Special:Contributions/Captain-n00dle|C]] 23:04, 27 September 2009 (UTC)

Yes, moving it would be appropriate. (The original page was created from the spelling in [http://education.yahoo.com/reference/gray/subjects/subject/189#p820 Gray's]. The &quot;ö&quot; was common in English back then, but now only The New Yorker still uses a diaeresis for consecutive vowels pronounced separately.) -- () 23:14, 27 September 2009 (UTC)</segment>
