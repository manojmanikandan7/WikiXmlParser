|text = The ikipedia:WikiProject Medicine/Collaboration of the Month|WikiProject Medicine  Collaboration of the Month for December 2013 is soriasis. The previous collaboration was astrointestinal disease. We welcome your help!

This month's COTM has been selected as soriasis! The COTM, here (P:MCOTM), is selected be affirmative voting. Editors are encouraged to post any projects on the page so that they may be voted in as future endeavors. Last month's effort was a bit of a flop, so let's hope that this month's effort is somewhat more encouraging! 

Ping to the following users who have expressed interest: |Peter.C, |Wouterstomp, |jfdwolff, |LT910001. Any other interested editors are of course welcome to participate, and with any luck we can bring this article up to GA-status by the end of the year. --ser:LT910001|LT910001 (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 07:54, 3 December 2013 (UTC)

* Wouldn't it be great if we got into the habit of bringing the COTM to GA status each month... The last one didn't have much interest ... maybe too ambitiously scoped. This is a busy time for me but I will help out where I can. ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 08:59, 3 December 2013 (UTC)
* The article looks pretty good in its current state, so with a bit of concerted effort a GA is not impossible. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 14:49, 3 December 2013 (UTC)
*I think the article is already good enough to justify a GA nom.  It definitely needs work, but that work could occur in the context of a GA review.  The real question is whether there are editors with sufficient topic knowledge who would be willing to do the necessary work on the article. ser:Looie496|Looie496 (ser talk:Looie496|talk) 16:42, 3 December 2013 (UTC)

I suggested a while back that we focus on the students in P:MEDUCSF in December, which generated press in the New York Times. Anybody? I suggest saving the other article for another month.

Expert input
May I suggest that we ask [http://www.aad.org/about-aad/vision-mission-and-values The American Academy of Dermatology], whose mission is to promote &quot;leadership in dermatology and excellence in patient care through education, research and advocacy&quot;, to provide us with one or two interested experts to collaborate on this? They don't expressly have a remit for public education but they may be willing to help - especially considering the number their students and medical professionals that use Wikipedia. --ser:Anthonyhcole|Anthonyhcole (ser talk:Anthonyhcole|talk · pecial:Contributions/Anthonyhcole|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Anthonyhcole|email)  18:55, 3 December 2013 (UTC)

If they agree, would they be welcome here? --ser:Anthonyhcole|Anthonyhcole (ser talk:Anthonyhcole|talk · pecial:Contributions/Anthonyhcole|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Anthonyhcole|email)  06:06, 4 December 2013 (UTC)

Seeing that much of our dermatology content was written by a dermatologist the issue is not with &quot;layperson's&quot; discounting &quot;experts&quot;. It is that most experts are clueless regarding how Wikipedia works. That one cannot plaster their most recent study of 25 individuals across 50 pages while removing all the secondary sources that disagree with your work.
If you read P:MEDRS you will see that this project values the positions of experts as published and in eview articles. ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 22:44, 4 December 2013 (UTC)

Unless it's confidentialser:Bluerasberry|, I prefer to discuss this sort of thing on-wiki. If you'd rather talk, though, I'll email you my number, or email me yours.

ser:Bluerasberry/voice|I ask a lot of people to voice chat. We already have each others' phone numbers and Skype from like 18 months ago - I think it has been a while. If you like I can setup audio recording of our talk and post it on-wiki; confidentiality is not my concern. Conversations just go faster with voice than on-wiki. Let me know what you think. If we talked I would say that one strategy for going to an organization is to present them with an example of how their work can be used, giving them some metrics reporting, and asking them about the extent of their interest in taking a tour of Wikipedia's health content. After that I would ask them if they have a single staff person who could commit three hours to putting their own scholarly MEDRS-compliant content onto Wikipedia sometime over a period of a month, then watching the impact of what they did over 2-3 months. If they like the outcome, then I would probe for deeper engagement. I do not have this documented anywhere on wiki but that is what I have done in the past. Thoughts?

|Anthonyhcole, part of my employment includes the suggestion that I share health information curated by AAD on Wikipedia when doing so would be welcomed by the Wikipedia community and in accordance with Wikipedia community guidelines. AAD has provided the hoosing Wisely health campaign some statements backed by what seem to me to be P:MEDRS compliant sources. As part of the public educational outreach plans of this campaign, I am to consider whether any of what they have to share is appropriate for inclusion into Wikipedia's health articles and if so, to integrate it. The messages which they want to share and the sources backing their statements are [http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/american-academy-of-dermatology/ on the campaign site]. I have not yet done anything with these messages. To what extent might you have interest in joining me in looking at this content? ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 14:35, 5 December 2013 (UTC)
ser:Bluerasberry|Blue Rasberry, I've just looked at a few lists-of-five and they all seem to have a home somewhere on Wikipedia - articles on the relevant diseases and investigations/procedures. They seem like the kind of scholarly society guidelines we incorporate as a matter of course, where they're relevant. I'd be pleased to work with you on incorporating this here. Have you had any blow-back against incorporating these recommendations in Wikipedia? 

Regarding approaching the AAD, do you know if Consumer Reports liaises directly with a contact at the AAD, or do they get the recommendations from the BIM Foundation? (I'm thinking that if we can approach someone at the AAD who is involved with the hoosing Wisely initiative - someone at least familiar with the task of translating and disseminating medical information for a lay audience - we may get a more sympathetic initial reception.) --ser:Anthonyhcole|Anthonyhcole (ser talk:Anthonyhcole|talk · pecial:Contributions/Anthonyhcole|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Anthonyhcole|email)  16:16, 5 December 2013 (UTC)

|Anthonyhcole, you are raising several issues.
#Yes, there have been a few comments about this being promotional and outside of wiki-spirit, but I think those comments dismissed the premise of this project without considering it. I personally think this project is different from many other COI projects and that, while it could be criticized, it should not be dismissed without consideration. The major differences which I identify include that the information shared is uniquely well sourced, the organizations whose content is being added are at least as cautious about Wikipedia as Wikipedia is about them so they are not engaging Wikipedia eagerly as is typical in troublesome COI editing, there is potential for long-term partnerships with the providers of information, and the information being added is already long desired by the Wikipedia community. Besides COI criticism, my other concerns include the accuracy of any summaries of this technical content, the unorthodox practice of making bundled citations which pair MEDRS-compliant journals with less-technical less-MEDRS-compliant purported summaries of those MEDRS sources, the information providers' concerns about the wholesomeness of Wikipedia, and the difficulties I have in making everything that is done transparent. I have not identified any difficulty or criticism for which I can fail to see an actionable way of addressing the problem to the mutual satisfaction of stakeholders.
#The question you asked about the liaison seems to me not the right question to ask, although I cannot briefly clarify in my own mind or to you why I think this is so. I think you are presuming an organizational structure which does not exist. I am new to mass media publishing and I am sure I could be wrong in describing what I am seeing, but let me describe the structure as I understand it and maybe that will clarify something: AAD gives their list to ABIM Foundation, who arrange as best they can for a second opinion on the writing (not peer review as this is grey literature, but everyone here is academic) while recognizing that the society already is representing the consensus of a medical specialty and that a higher authority would be difficult to arrange. Such as they can - and it is my opinion that they find broad insight - they provide feedback and send it back to the society. The society finalizes their list, then sends it to ABIM Foundation and Consumer Reports for dissemination. Consumer Reports, as a consumer partner, seeks to share the information as broadly as possible with consumers. Where the Wikipedia community could intervene in this is that if information were put onto Wikipedia, then I could make an assessment of impact based on metrics of pageviews. If an interpretation of the metrics provided supporting evidence that Wikipedia was a significant channel for sharing health messages, then staff at Consumer Reports using media expertise may assess the validity of the metrics report and interpretation. The societies might have difficulty interpreting any media claims about Wikipedia otherwise, because they usually focus on medicine and not usually massive campaigns like Choosing Wisely. If their information were on Wikipedia, if there were some metrics which gave some supporting evidence of impact, if an organization like Consumer Reports made some interpretation of those metrics, and if all this were demonstrated to a society, then I think we could get that sympathetic initial reception you wanted. It is my opinion that societies would not consider contributing to Wikipedia unless they thought that it would advance their goals, and the rationales for contributing health content to Wikipedia are not found persuasive outside WP:MED. Some metrics reporting would be one strategy for establishing a minimally acceptable rationale.
#Yes, what you did with the link is exactly the kind of reference which I and this campaign desire. You have cited a layman document which is pseudo-MEDRS-compliant and matched it with technical documents from the profession which are more MEDRS-compliant. This is what I think should happen. However, another variable in this is that document you found is a derivative work only made and written by Consumer Reports for the benefit of consumers. The issue is that the societies are able to make technically correct statements, but Consumer Reports reduces the accuracy of these statements while increasing the readability and accessibility using techniques of medical translation of the original statements into simple English. While what you did is what I think should be done, it skirts non-compliance with MEDRS because MEDRS does not take into account readability of sources or describe this kind of reference bundling strategy of technical and non-technical sources.
Thoughts? ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 13:12, 6 December 2013 (UTC)
I have thought about the problem of readability for years.  IMO MEDRS ought to encourage well-developed articles to use one or two good-quality, non-scholarly, ideally free/online sources (that do not contradict the high-quality recent academic literature).  This would put good sources into the hands of younger students and English language learners.  We don't really need a review article behind summary statements like &quot;Acne is a common skin condition&quot; (even though that's a &quot;statistic&quot;) or &quot;Pneumonia is usually treated with antibiotics&quot;. 
The source really only needs to be strong enough to support the actual claim being made.  We're not providing sources to make ourselves look impressive.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:25, 6 December 2013 (UTC)

The readability of the few Consumer Reports lay summaries that I have so far read is superb. I started with the first recommendation of the first society on [http://www.choosingwisely.org/doctor-patient-lists/ this list], which is also a recommendation of two other societies. So I named them in text and cited each society's position statement, along with Consumer Reports's lay summary thus:

ser:Bluerasberry|Blue Rasberry, I based my edit on the Choosing Wisely summary and the three position statements, each a P:MEDRS-compliant source, but I added the Consumer Reports summary to the citation because it gives a lot of useful detail from the position statements that is too much for our article and (per WhatamIdoing's rationale) is much more readable than the position statements. Do I have your OK to continue in the same fashion with the remainder of the societies and their recommendations? --ser:Anthonyhcole|Anthonyhcole (ser talk:Anthonyhcole|talk · pecial:Contributions/Anthonyhcole|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Anthonyhcole|email)  19:23, 6 December 2013 (UTC)

Thanks |Anthonyhcole. You never needed my okay for this but you unequivocally have my support. I have been going about this in a way that is a bit different from what you are doing. It seems to me that you are tracking down your own sources. This is fine - you are pulling great sources, and even from the societies which are authoring the papers. However, I am getting some sources provided to me by the society itself. Since we were talking about AAD before you raised the feeding tube example, see ikipedia:Choosing Wisely/American Academy of Dermatology. I have a list of sources there. I have always been citing the &quot;5 things&quot; paper, and then the sources from which those statements are derived as they are listed on that paper. The layman summary that you are citing does not suggest in itself MEDRS-compliant sources, which you sought yourself.

Additionally, this project was proposed on the premise that Wikipedia is a useful platform for sharing this information, and the measure of utility which I am able to capture is pageviews to a Wikipedia article. When I integrate information from this campaign into an article, I am also making a note of what I have done at the project page I make for each society. While the AAD page is currently empty, ikipedia:Choosing Wisely/AAHPM|this AAHPM page has some items recorded and how I reported on the feeding tube information that you researched. Perhaps it would be good to put that layman summary in there as well, but my concern has always been connecting non-MEDRS layman sources with MEDRS sources and only that list of 5 makes a solid connection. I regularly report traffic back to the monitors. If you want to contact AAD, then I would propose to complete this project page and integrate the five items they requested of me, then show them what has been done as a demonstration. If I were to request something of you, it would be comments on these practices as an outreach and partnership strategy between Wikipedians and any organization. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 17:45, 9 December 2013 (UTC)

 My problem is that I can't even decipher what the article is about, so I'm having a hard time even making the argument at the P:ENI thread.  Google scholar gets one hit on a rat study, so wouldn't prodding it after the student inevitably leaves Wikipedia when the term ends today (they always do) be fastest? [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Education_noticeboard/Incidents#.22NSC_100_Class.22 ENI thread.]    There are at least two beginning neuroscience courses, and probably a dozen other courses this term, hitting medical content, and getting through all of the content they've added isn't doable.  We need to find a fast way to deal with them, and I think prodding them after the term ends may be the most effective; I've never yet seen a student come back and care about an article.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 16:27, 13 December 2013 (UTC)

 Collaboration of the month-- thoughts on how usefulness could be maximized 

urrentMCOTM 
Just talking with James, and I thought that it might be an idea in the immediate future to restrict the COTM article selection to articles which 1. are not GA or FA, and 2. are top importance. Often these topics have broad scope and might also therefore attract more interest from WPMED members. Thoughts? — Preceding ikipedia:Signatures|unsigned comment added by ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk • pecial:Contributions/Lesion|contribs) 

I think as far as priorities for this WikiProject go, this sounds extremely sensible. There's plenty of obscure topics that can wait until we have a steady base of high-quality articles on common and important conditions. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 22:19, 7 December 2013 (UTC)

Yes, I'd include 'high' importance articles. The other thing Id' do is take away the time period and make it that the collaboration lasts until the article reaches GA status, at which point the next one is selected. The auditing points act as points of reference. Any article that doesn't get there won't have it as it inevitably erodes in the face of editing. ser:Casliber|Cas Liber (ser talk:Casliber|talk · pecial:Contributions/Casliber|contribs) 19:25, 8 December 2013 (UTC)
I support this sentiment. We should then discuss some concrete criteria for what constitutes a 'Top-importance' article and then systematically apply that. As it is, this seems to be dominated by psychological conditions and infectious disease. Have nominated two top-importance articles for next month's COTM: regnancy and ancer. (vote or nominate here: P:MCOTM) --ser:LT910001|LT910001 (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 14:43, 9 December 2013 (UTC)

Alternate proposal. I agree with the sentiment but am not in favour of 'iron-cast' rules. How about we give every Top-importance article (+2) votes each round, and every High-importance article (+1)? That way we can still promote the nomination of these articles, but popular choices can also be selected, and there won't be the need for a future RfC or large discussion when, inevitably, a user wants to nominate high-importance article.--ser:LT910001|LT910001 (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 14:43, 9 December 2013 (UTC)

Yes we should not take the articles importance rating as set in stone. I am sure there are top importance articles that should not be top importance, and some lower rated ones that should be top.
It is also worth noting that since COTM has restarted, the articles that are being nominated tend to be top importance anyway.

 Articles for creation 

Whilst I am very thankful for the AfC team for monitoring new articles and contacting us about it, I worry that these queries soak up a lot of time for, essentially, articles which will have a tiny, minute audience and often end up very short in length. I feel that, as with the student editors problem openly festering here, ideally there would be more time for users to work on articles of higher priority. I would like the opinions of other users on this, and how to deal with it? I propose three mechanisms:
# Set a separate page or list, like article alerts, where these queries can be isolated.
# Nuclear option after a certain amount of negative votes is reached
# Set time limit for these articles: if, after 1 week, no change has been made, AfC coordinator has discretion to either delete the article or transfer to mainspace. Query is then archived immediately.
Yes, AfC is important, but I feel working on getting the top 1-100 most visited articles, or the top-priority articles up to GA status would be much more productive.

 A problem with dedicating resources to AFC (as much as I admire anyone willing to take that work on) is that it is often a) poor-quality student work, or b) paid editing.

 lectronic cigarette again 

After one month of the article being protected it has been opened up at once to editing by a group who hold a very clear point of view, and strongly believe that P:MEDRS is only to be followed when it is in favor of their view.

 Society and Medicine Taskforce 

After two months of work, I here formally announce the creation of the Wikipedia:WikiProject Medicine/Society and medicine task force|Society and Medicine Taskforce This taskforce is intended to collect and maintain articles relating to the intersection between society and medicine, specifically people, companies, charities and any other relevant articles. As many users will know, these three groups constitute the majority of new articles, and not only compose an increasing workload but an increasing amount of discussion on this talk page. This taskforce is intended to:
* Collect statistics on these articles
* Serve as a contact point regarding these articles
* Allow a more accessible way of identifying and maintaining these articles.
* Promote neutrality and improve the quality of these articles.

Collecting and centralising information about these articles is the first step in productively dealing with this issue, and has been noted in the past by myself, |Jmh649, |Jfdwolff, quality issues noted by |SandyGeorgia, and I'm sure many others.

To tag an article for this task force, please add society=yes |society-imp=Mid to the assessment status on the talk page. Please do this for all new biographical entries.  I have made a simultaneous edit to our scope so that article assessors (eg. |Wouterstomp) will know.

Special thanks to |Bluerasberry for discussions during the creation of this task force, and |DePiep and |ScottAlter for helping automate the assessment criteria. --ser:LT910001|LT910001 (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 11:40, 12 December 2013 (UTC)

If we can get a list, and have one or two people carefully check the entries and remove anything inappropriate, then we could get a bot to add the task force label to all of them.

 Proposed change to MOS for Anatomy articles 

Per many discussions on P:ANATOMY, and a current attempt at a P:GA|GA status for one article, I have proposed a change to the MOS for Anatomy articles here (Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style/Medicine-related_articles#Anatomy_guidelines), and have outlined the reasons on the said page. Kind regards, --ser:LT910001|LT910001 (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 02:30, 14 December 2013 (UTC)

 uman Liver  article 

The Human Liver article was recently created as a split from the iver article; some WP:MED members might want to take a look at that and analyze whether this split was needed. A lot of the times we dedicate our articles significantly more to humans with an Other animals section, as ikipedia:MEDMOS#Sections shows, because the topic has been studied significantly less with regard to non-human animals and our readers will usually be looking for the human aspect of that topic. 

The article was tagged for speedy deletion, but that deletion has been contested alk:Human Liver|on its talk page.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Human_Liver&amp;diff=585882285&amp;oldid=585815788] If the Human Liver article is to be kept, it needs to be retitled to Human liver (meaning without the capitalization), per P:Article titles. ser:Flyer22|Flyer22 (ser talk:Flyer22|talk) 11:31, 13 December 2013 (UTC)
 This is reflective of a trend among anatomy articles, which doesn't always produce useful results. I think it is reasonable to have articles specifically on human anatomy. One reason I am in favour of this is because the scope is immediately clear, and writing these articles can be more specifically focused. --ser:LT910001|LT910001 (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 11:41, 13 December 2013 (UTC)

As the instigator of the split I did it for just the reasons that LT910001 presents. There is a real risk that articles that focus on anatomy are filled with nonsensical paragraphs, for example in the article in question; on liver as food in the middle of a discussion of transplantation, further the value is diminished when different images of animal livers are placed in the article, and there is no way to argue against their inclusion. There is an active veterinary and organismal biomechanics community working on making articles less human focused, and if a single article is remain coherent regarding human anatomy it will become very large. The simplest way to avoid being caught in a fight with other Wikiprojects is to split. The trend goes on, as before there are articles on; eart &amp; uman heart, lungs etc. etc. Even if there are not immediate results improvement will be simplified with these articles. ser:CFCF|CFCF (ser talk:CFCF|talk) 12:02, 13 December 2013 (UTC)

Such splits are sparingly useful, from what I have seen because, like I stated above, it is often that these topics have been studied significantly more with regard to humans than with regard to non-human animals. When there is little to say about the non-human aspect, a split most certainly should not be made; that is needless P:Content forking, unnecessarily causing our readers to go to more than one article for that information. And often no benefits come out of such splits; examples in this regard are the very poorly-written/constructed enis article, which was split into uman penis, and the very poor/stubby nus article which was split into uman anus. The default titles get significantly more traffic in such cases because our readers are not usually looking for the non-human aspect of the topic. So these moves also disturb P:Common name. When made, the default title should at least be about humans, and a specialized title should be created for the non-human aspect. Further comments from me on these types of splits can be found [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Vulva&amp;diff=581746783&amp;oldid=580001334#Requested_move here] and alk:Pregnancy/Archive 8#Rename article to Pregnancy (human)|here (though I've commented similarly elsewhere on Wikipedia as well). ser:Flyer22|Flyer22 (ser talk:Flyer22|talk) 12:09, 13 December 2013 (UTC)
I'll respond in two separate places. There are some organs (sexual organs, the nose) that are generally associated with humans, but other organs (heart, lung, spine) about which a significant amount of study and variation exists in animalia that makes it impractical to have them in the same article. --ser:LT910001|LT910001 (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 12:32, 13 December 2013 (UTC)
It's also a trend that is not prevalent; nor should it be. ser:Flyer22|Flyer22 (ser talk:Flyer22|talk) 12:15, 13 December 2013 (UTC)
Hmm. I feel that one of the points of contention here is that the primary point of call is not the 'human' liver. What would thoughts about this structure:
*Liver is the main article about humans. Human liver redirects here. At the top, the article states This article is about the human liver. For other animals, see iver in other animals
*Liver in other animals is a secondary article with information about the liver in other animals.
It seems reasonable to retain the focus on humans, but I feel also reasonable to allow a fork to allow a more comprehensive presentation of the liver in other animals. This approach could be replicated for other organs and retain the pragmatic human-centered focus. --ser:LT910001|LT910001 (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 12:32, 13 December 2013 (UTC)

It might also be worth pointing out that after such a split, most newly placed wikilinks which refer to a human anatomy topic point to the main article rather than the article about the human structure. What about this wording: instead of uman mandible and andible, we name the article on human anatomy &quot;mandible&quot; and the one on non human anatomy &quot;Mandible (non-human)&quot;... Non-human is shorter than &quot;in other animals&quot;. Thoughts? I think we should seek external input for this too, it will be easy to achieve false consensus in the microcosm of WPMED, which will be biased towards human emphasis. ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 12:35, 13 December 2013 (UTC)

* ing|HCA if s/he is around. ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 12:40, 13 December 2013 (UTC)

In response to the summons above, I think the key is how much diversity exists for an organ/structure/system.  The liver, for instance, is pretty much the same in every vertebrate aside from trivial differences in morphology and absolute size, and the only taxon using it in a notably different way is sharks using it to store squallene for bouyancy (which can be tacked on as a small section at the end of the article).  For something like the eye, where there are dramatically different forms throughout the animal kingdom, it makes sense to have a dedicated &quot;human eye&quot; article that's linked from the main article.  However, it's also crucial not to let human terminology or anatomical peculiarities eliminate articles for homologous structures, however short - consider the &quot;zygomatic bone&quot;, properly termed the jugal in the majority of species, or synonomizing the mandible with the dentary (when most species have mandibles comprised of multiple bones).  In short, I like to ask myself two questions about these issues: &quot;Can a pre-med student quickly and easily find the article and information they need?&quot; and &quot;Can a vertebrate (or invertebrate) zoology student quickly and easily find the article and information they need?&quot;   ser:HCA|HCA (ser talk:HCA|talk) 17:09, 13 December 2013 (UTC)
I agree with your points on ease of finding relevant articles, but isn't this possible through links in the header as I've attempted? Also as far as I'm aware although physiologically the liver is rather uniform across species I was under the impression that anatomically it wasn't. As far as I know variation is larger in the anatomy, for example lobulation on one hand varies considerably between for example rats and mice (lab-animals) and humans, does it not? ser:CFCF|CFCF (ser talk:CFCF|talk) 17:21, 13 December 2013 (UTC)
True, though I dismissed those as trivial because they don't really seem to effect the function and they're really just variations on a theme.  I'd analogize to stomachs: while every one is different in size and shape, it's only really notable when the difference is extreme and majorly alters function (such as the chambers in ruminants or the gizzards in birds).ser:HCA|HCA (ser talk:HCA|talk) 18:26, 13 December 2013 (UTC)

I agree with LT910001 concerning the use of article names such as mandible for the human and mandible (non-human) for potential animal articles. Regarding high profile articles there is a great deal of information on livers, kidneys, lungs etc. that isn't necessarily non-human or human, but concerns food  and cultural aspects etc., and I think it may be hard to fit in either article. I think it is less demanding of a reader in search for info on the human liver to go to uman liver, than a reader in search of food-preparation to go to Liver (non-human).
This question does not only cover liver, but all the other articles as well. I'll be around to help improve the articles on liver which I split regardless of consensus. ser:CFCF|CFCF (ser talk:CFCF|talk) 12:52, 13 December 2013 (UTC)

LT910001, titling the article with &quot;other&quot; in its heading is not a good idea for reasons that I stated in [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Homosexual_behavior_in_animals&amp;diff=585404440&amp;oldid=585384017#Requested_move this recent move discussion.] &quot;[U]sing the word other begs the question as to what comes before 'other.' In human-focused articles, use of other is clear because the article is [mostly or only] about humans.&quot; I'm not so much concerned with the Liver article split, since there is likely a lot that can be stated about the non-human aspect, whether anatomy-wise or food-wise. 

LT910001, CFCF and Lesion, I'm concerned with such splits being unnecessarily made. Again, if a topic is barely studied, or otherwise significantly less studied, with regard to non-human animals, I believe that it is a terrible idea to then create a content fork for that information instead of covering it with the human material. I will never be in favor of such splits. We should strive to have our articles be as comprehensive as possible (P:Summary style-wise of course). For Wikipedia articles regarding topics that pertain to humans and non-human animals, unless that article is specifically about humans or specifically about non-human animals, such a Wikipedia article is more well-rounded if there is information in it about both humans and non-human animals. Non-human information should only be made into a separate article when a split is needed, per WP:Content fork. If there is no P:SIZE issue in such cases, I see no issue. See the ulva discussion I linked to above; there is absolutely no valid reason that there should be a vulva article about non-human vulvae; the vulva topic is barely studied with regard to non-human animals. And, ideally, a P:Requested move discussion should always be had before such a move. ser:Flyer22|Flyer22 (ser talk:Flyer22|talk) 13:09, 13 December 2013 (UTC)

I think we are looking at a subject expert editor here, and some of the sources seem at least at a glance to be sound. I think it would be best to inform about policy and inform that English sources are preferred unless translation is available. That said quite a few of the sources (if not all) are from Luis Joaquín García López, who seems to have published numerous (200+) papers on the subject, a number of which are CC-BY.

 Question about non-medical information in WP:MED tagged articles 

I work regularly with a class at Rice University titled Poverty, Justice and Human Capabilities.  Last semester's class is ducation Program:Rice University/Poverty, Justice, Human Capabilities, Section 2 (Fall 2013)|here, for example.  More than once a student has worked on a topic that relates to medicine; recent examples include iarrhea in developing regions, ocial determinants of health in Mexico, imbabwean cholera outbreak, and edia portrayal of HIV/AIDS.

Here are my opinions about this sort of content -- I suspect not everyone here would agree with these opinions, which is why I'm posting here.  I'd like to get some consensus on these points, not just for next semester but as a general guideline for this sort of topic.

* Sociological/political/historical information belongs in the same article as the main medical topic.  If the article becomes too long as a result, the topics can be split out via summary style.
* This material should not generally be subject to MEDRS rules except where the statements are specifically medical.  In other words, what governs MEDRS rules is not whether an article is tagged for this project; it's the nature of the content.

Both the above rules are to be applied with common sense and without weakening any other rules -- we still require reliable sources, after all, regardless of MEDRS.  The question is whether non-medical material, governed by non-medical guidelines, can be added to MED articles. ser:Mike Christie|Mike Christie (ser_talk:Mike Christie|talk - pecial:Contributions/Mike_Christie|contribs -  ser:Mike Christie/Reference library|library) 14:29, 13 December 2013 (UTC)
Agree with you on both points. RS generally, not specifically MEDRS, should apply to content on sociological/cultural etc. The &quot;history&quot; and &quot;society and culture&quot; sections generally do not need MEDRS, even though much of the rest of the article should follow MEDRS. ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 14:34, 13 December 2013 (UTC)
I suspect that you will have little disagreement here. P:MEDRS specifically states, &quot;Sources for all other types of content—including all non-medical information in medicine-related articles—are covered by the general guideline on identifying reliable sources rather than this specific guideline.&quot; IOW, historical, legal, political, economic, etc. information is not governed by MEDRS, but by P:RS.  Of course, MEDRS compliant sources may also be good information for such information, as they are still scholarly produced sources. ser:Yobol|Yobol (ser talk:Yobol|talk) 15:19, 13 December 2013 (UTC)
 Agree with Yobol and Lesion except that when P:MEDRS-compliant journal sources are available that are superior to or contradict the non-MEDRS or inferior sources, then RS prefers the superior MEDRS sources (&quot;When available, academic and peer-reviewed publications, scholarly monographs, and textbooks are usually the most reliable sources.&quot;); we wouldn't use inferior sources to cite content in a health-related area (even on the history, for example) when we have better sources.  In other words, as in all RS discussions, we choose the best sources, and if students are citing the history of a medical condition to a random website, and that content is much better covered in a journal review, then we would prefer the review.  In many cases with that course, we've seen students citing text to organizations or sources with a known POV (eg James Baker Institute) when they haven't necessarily engaged the MEDRS-compliant sources that may be available on well-covered topics.  There have been problems with that course, so we shouldn't give them carte blanche to avoid learning best sourcing techniques.  ikipedia:Education noticeboard/Incidents/Archive 1#Cholera Ha, just saw that l|RexxS stated it better [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:MastCell&amp;diff=585912799&amp;oldid=585865247 here.]  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 15:56, 13 December 2013 (UTC)
But that's true even when there is no health-related content whatsoever.  If you're writing about, say, Oprah Winfrey or iTunes, and you've got access to &quot;academic and peer-reviewed publications, scholarly monographs, and textbooks&quot; on those subjects, then you will normally prefer those excellent sources to newspaper articles.  That doesn't mean that you can't ever cite a source that has other desirable qualities (e.g., one that is written in plain English or is free online), but you would normally prefer the better sources to the worse-but-still-acceptable ones.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:12, 13 December 2013 (UTC)
Sandy, I got my question answered; I think you're making a separate point about expectations, as opposed to requirements.  Are you saying that students should be held to a higher standard than non-student editors, because of the non-long-term nature of most student accounts?  Of course I agree with you about preferring the best sources, but for example, if a student were to write some content cited to an RS, and that content could have been better sourced, are you saying that that's unacceptable content from the student, rather than just something to be improved in the future in the usual eventualist way? ser:Mike Christie|Mike Christie (ser_talk:Mike Christie|talk - pecial:Contributions/Mike_Christie|contribs -  ser:Mike Christie/Reference library|library) 18:12, 13 December 2013 (UTC)
 No, I'm saying they should be held to the same standards as everyone else, and that the answer to your query is not binary.  Students-- much more so than regular editors, although there are regular editors who do the same-- don't engage sufficiently either RS or MEDRS, and the answer to the dilemma is to expect them to do so, just as we expect regular editors to do so.  The additional problem with students is that they never return to correct their work, so when one points out that they have used inferior sources and that better sources are at odds with their text, they won't be around to fix it, so we're better off just removing it.  The time we've had to expend on verifying the bad additions is more than should be expected of us, since they won't be participants in the cleanup when we identify poor sourcing.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 18:17, 13 December 2013 (UTC)
Wikipedia is an encyclopedia not a collection of student essays. Most of these pages end up being more or less duplication of the main article. I have no issue with a sub article called &quot;social and cultural aspects of HIV/AIDS&quot; that is than summarized in the main article. But that is not what is being done. Agree with Sandy that the students need to be held to the same high standards as everyone else. ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 05:03, 14 December 2013 (UTC)
* Student accounts are much more long-term than normal accounts.  Of all accounts that are registered (and excluding all those that never make an edit), 70% (seventy percent, that is not a typo) only make one edit.  If the new users makes two edits, or comes back on a second day, then you are already dealing with a much higher level of engagement than median.
* The problem we have with enforcing &quot;the same high standard&quot; is that simply removing suitable, encyclopedic material that is cited to a (barely) reliable source, when it ideally would be sourced to an academic secondary source, is a violation of P:PRESERVE.  So the workflow that the students encounter is this:
*# Student adds a statement and sources it to (for example) a reputable charity's website or a peer-reviewed primary source.
*# One of a very small group of editors sees this and says, &quot;Ah ha!  Not a MEDRS-type source!  Immediate revert!!!&quot;
* The workflow that ought to be happening, if everyone were following the policy PRESERVE, is this:
*# Student adds a statement and sources it to (for example) a reputable charity's website or a peer-reviewed primary source.
*# A more experienced editor sees this and says, &quot;Not such a great source, although someone who doesn't know MEDRS inside and out might accept it.  Let's see:  
*## Does this exact statement even require a stellar source, or is it really okay?  We don't need a Cochrane review to say that the common cold is caused by viruses, after all.  Could it be re-written in a way that would make the existing source okay?  (For example, MEDMOS has advice on how to report single-study results.)
*## Can I find a better source?  I'll do a quick search at Pubmed and Google Books.
*## Should this information be in this article at all?  Should it be moved to a subarticle?  (You wouldn't believe how often someone wants to add something to a main article like ancer that obviously belongs in a subarticle.)  
*## Is this overemphasis of a minority viewpoint?  Is someone cherry-picking sources here?
*## Looking at the article, rather than just following &quot;rules&quot;, is this addition a net positive or a net negative?  It's not perfect, but is it an improvement, however slight?  If I were removing one poorly sourced statement from this article today, is this the right one to remove?  If I pull this, am I going to look stupid for removing a peer-reviewed journal article while leaving behind a patient's blog or an advertorial?
*## What's the chance that the original editor knows more about this?  I'll leave a nice note for him to see if he knows about a better source.  
*## While I'm at it, I'll post a note on the article's talk page to see if anyone watching it knows of a better source, or if anyone else thinks that this should be removed.  I'll check back in a few days to see if anyone replied.
* But as you can see, that's a lot more work than automatically reverting anyone who didn't add the exact kind of source that we currently think is est is the enemy of the good|best.  So from a practical perspective, the people doing this kind of patrolling have a choice between enforcing MEDRS on all the recent changes that they have time to look at, or complying with PRESERVE on only ten percent of that number, while leaving 90% entirely unreviewed (by them, and there aren't enough people doing this work to check every change).  There is no perfect solution that gets all changes reviewed properly.  Editors have to choose between doing improper, PRESERVE-violating reviews or doing no review at all for a majority of changes.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:37, 14 December 2013 (UTC)

 Featured image nomination 

mage:Sobo 1909 260.png|thumb|400px|right
I've currently nominated the image Image:Sobo 1909 260.png for feature image. The reasoning behind my nomintion is that it is a high-quality image from a respectable anatomy text-book without any similar images on Wikipedia. It is in my view easy on the eyes, informative without being overly explicit, and a very high quality retouched scan. It holds both artistic and educational merit.
See here for the nomination ikipedia:Featured picture candidates/Sobo 1909 260.

 edical claims in Scientology doctrine... 

So... this is a &quot;notable&quot; medical P:FRINGE theory, but the whole page (cited by 8 self-published scientology or news media sources) fails EDRS.  It doesn't seem to cover or link to the equivalent mainstream views either.  

Seems like its worthy of an P:XFD|XFD, but I have a feeling that might be a contentious can of worms. Thoughts? ser:Seppi333|Seppi333 (ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert 2¢) 06:27, 14 December 2013 (UTC)
The very fact that the article itself describes these as &quot;claims&quot; is reassuring. MEDRS really is needed to say that a particular treatment is efficacious, whereas this article merely is reporting health beliefs of a particular group. The tone of the article is NPOV, I think there is no need to delete this article. ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 10:04, 14 December 2013 (UTC)
Agreed with Lesion, but I do think there may be need for some cleanup. The article does at least at first glance seem to point out that these claims are not proven in any sense, and are simply ideas within Scientology.ser:CFCF|CFCF (ser talk:CFCF|talk) 11:43, 14 December 2013 (UTC)

Anatomy edit disputes
Posting here as I believe it will garner the most attention. I have been working on adding images from ommons:Category:CNX to Wikipedia as they are a very good source of medical illustrations, just the type we are currently lacking. I started in the far end of the book, also going for one of the articles I knew I would probably meet most resistance: uman penis. Any edits at all are very difficult to do, as there are forces intent on keeping the article from containing images of anatomy or physiology. I know these articles may be a cess-pit of incoherent argument, but if anyone were to quickly look over the recent edits, for example this revert [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Human_penis&amp;diff=586062341&amp;oldid=586060524] and see if there is any reason behind it, I would be glad. ser:CFCF|CFCF (ser talk:CFCF|talk) 18:40, 14 December 2013 (UTC)

Can you explain why you decided to start with one of the most contentious areas?  I'd have taken the opposite approach:  use them in all sorts of articles, and then come back in a couple of years and say, &quot;Look what normal anatomy articles are doing.  Why don't we do the same here?&quot;  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 20:44, 14 December 2013 (UTC)
I didn't start there, but after preliminary work on various articles I started systematically at the back of the book. I don't think waiting will help as there is a group of editors who believe it is important to see all different forms of variation and from all angles instead of images that actually are informative. The same is relevant at ulva, which has maybe 20 different images of variation which I have not removed despite lack of encyclopedic content, due to risk of the same type of resistance met at human penis. ser:CFCF|CFCF (ser talk:CFCF|talk) 21:01, 14 December 2013 (UTC)
CFCF was also [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Erection&amp;diff=586078862&amp;oldid=586078295 reverted] at the rection article. CFCF, keep in mind, if you have not, that I don't object to any specific image you added to the Human penis article; I objected to you going against P:Consensus with regard to the infobox image used at that article and P:Edit warring at that article to maintain your image preferences. I also questioned the inclusion of the Additional images section, but I have no strong feelings on that either way (just like I have no strong feelings about the Human penis article). The images you have been adding to anatomy articles are informative and needed in some cases, as you well know and have received barnstars for. That stated, you need to be careful about adding too many images to an article. And I agree with your inclusion of the image you added to the Erection article, but the size should be reduced; see OS:IMAGES#Consideration of image download size and OS:IMAGES#Forced image size. ser:Flyer22|Flyer22 (ser talk:Flyer22|talk) 21:19, 14 December 2013 (UTC)
Thanks for the pointers on MOS:IMAGES, I will follow the maximum size rule more closely. I'm going to give these articles(no other articles were as strongly disputed) uman penis|this article a rest, even minute edits are questioned, and its taking to much time. Maybe its naive to think that an article like that would reach higher standard before other less contentious articles. ser:CFCF|CFCF (ser talk:CFCF|talk) 07:21, 16 December 2013 (UTC)

 Cochrane Wikipedian In Residence Applications 

Hey folks, 

Just a reminder that Cochrane is taking signups for a Wikipedian in Residence: ikipedia:COCHRANE/WIR.

Cochrane is a fantastic organization which publishes systematic reviews about medical treatments and efficacy.

Wiki Project Med Foundation is helping to coordinate the search for great candidates.

The Wikipedian in Residence would ideally be:

# An active Wikipedia editor, a Wikipedian in good standing, for at least 1 year and with 1,000 edits (more is preferable)
# A science and/or healthcare enthusiast, preferably with a background as either a student or professional
# An ambassador, capable of interacting between Wikipedia's community and Cochrane groups
# A teacher, helping Cochrane contributors to properly and successfully navigate and use Wikipedia
# A collaborator, comfortable working in and among a distributed network of professionals
# A remote facilitator, adept with email, scheduling, online meetings, and conference calls
# A passionate individual, both about Wikipedia’s mission and Cochrane's approach and goals

The position is open to anyone who can meet these criteria but may be particularly suited to students or recent graduates looking to expand their skills and experience, or those who work part-time in another job. Candidates should have an excellent level of written and spoken English, although those that speak more than one language are particularly welcome to apply.

;Location
Cochrane is structured as a network of groups located throughout the world to which people contribute in different ways, but primarily as authors of Cochrane Systematic Reviews. The WiR will work remotely from their chosen location and will interact with a number of groups and their contributors via email and online. Cochrane will provide a selection of online collaboration tools to facilitate communication.

;Reporting
The WiR will report to, and be guided by, Cochrane’s Head of Communications &amp; External Affairs, and a Senior Editor of The Cochrane Library. They will also interact regularly with other members of Cochrane’s senior management team and representatives of its publishing partner for The Cochrane Library.

;Working hours
The WiR will be expected to work flexibly at different times of their day to suit their schedule and to help support Cochrane groups throughout the world (some work in the evenings is likely to be required). The exact number of hours per week will be agreed with the successful candidate, but is likely to be in the region of 7-12 hours per week.

;Remuneration
The WiR will receive a stipend of up to $6,500 USD/£4,000 for the initial six month term, which will be paid in two instalments at the beginning and middle of the term. In addition, the WiR will be funded to attend and present a session at the 22nd Cochrane Colloquium in Hyderabad, India, 21st-25th September 2014.

;Applying to be WIR

 Chronic allograft nephropathy 

Hi, I'm t:user:Doc.mari from Italian Wikipedia. I see that English Wikipedia has an article about hronic allograft nephropathy, while &quot;chronic allograft dysfunction&quot; is a more appropriate term according to many authors (see for example [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22388603], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21116321]). The histologic changes found in chronic allograft injury are very variable according to the specific factors involved, so we can't really talk about &quot;nephropathy&quot;. The same opinion is expressed by Floege et al in Comprehensive Clinical Nephrology, fourth edition, chapter 103. I think we should move the article to &quot;Chronic kidney allograft dysfunction&quot;, as it:Disfunzione cronica del trapianto renale|I did on it.wiki and I'd like to add some informations, but my English is very poor so I need your help and your advice. Thank you. --ser:Doc.mari|Doc.mari (ser talk:Doc.mari|talk) 22:59, 15 December 2013 (UTC)
Hello and welcome. When deciding how to name pages, we should follow the most commonly used term in the sources. This is not always the most accurate term. E.g. we have inusitis and not &quot;rhinosinusitis&quot;. 

If the term you say is better is the one which is more commonly used in up-to-date sources, please feel free to move the page. Click the drop down menu just the right of the watchlist star thing, and click &quot;move&quot;. Then type in the term that the page is to be moved to.

Or I am sure someone will happily move the page for you, but I would like to confirm it is indeed the most common term. ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 23:12, 15 December 2013 (UTC)
Hello Lesion, I still knew how to techically move a page but I'm not very familiar with your policies. &quot;Chronic allograft nephropathy&quot; is in fact a very common term, altough dated and uncorrect. Maybe it's better to leave the current title but this article needs to be updated as soon as possible. Thank you again for the explanation. --ser:Doc.mari|Doc.mari (ser talk:Doc.mari|talk) 21:05, 16 December 2013 (UTC)

Apologies. The policy is here: P:MEDMOS#Article titles

uote|The article title should be the scientific or recognised medical name that is most commonly used in recent, high-quality, English-language medical sources, rather than a lay term (unscientific or slang name)[1] or a historical eponym that has been superseded.
If &quot;Chronic allograft nephropathy&quot; is outdated and most modern sources are using the term &quot;Chronic kidney allograft dysfunction&quot; then yes we should update the article title. ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 21:13, 16 December 2013 (UTC)

 Possibility of a bot for taskforces 

The possibility of a bot has been made available to automatically tag articles under WP:MED with the ikipedia:WikiProject_Medicine/Society_and_medicine_task_force|Society and medicine taskforce. It seems reasonable that this could also be the case for other task forces. Although I'm strongly in favour of getting it working for Society &amp; Medicine first, and tweaking afterwards, as I feel we ought to strike while the Iron is hot, this bot could be expanded later to tag articles for other task forces.

As I understand it, a bot could tag using three criteria:
# An article is concurrently tagged with another Wikiproject (eg. all WP:BIO articles under WP:MED will be added to the society &amp; medicine task force)
# An article has a keyword in the title (eg. all articles with &quot;charity&quot; will be added to the society &amp; medicine task force, as these are not reliably added to additional WPs)
# An article belongs to a category (am not sure if this is technically feasible).

A list of taskforces with proposed criteria is here:
* Cardiology
* Dermatology
**Article contains 'skin' in the title. Article belongs to Category:skin diseases
* Emergency medicine and EMS
* Gastroenterology
* Hematology-oncology
**Article contains 'blood', 'cancer', 'leukemia', 'leukaemia' or 'lymphoma' in the title, article belongs to Category:Cancer or a subcategory.
* Medical genetics
* Nephrology
* Neurology
* Ophthalmology
* Pathology
* Psychiatry
* Pulmonology
* Radiology
* Reproductive medicine
**Article is under both P:MED and P:SEX
* Society and medicine criteria developed
* Toxicology
* Translation
**Articles tagged with Top-Importance?

The aim here is to produce results that are 90-95% accurate with some reasonably simple rules. If we miss some articles, or some articles are added to a taskforce in error, the sky will not fall down. Articles that are subsequently removed from a taskforce may be able to be permanently removed so that they are not consistently re-added. --ser:LT910001|LT910001 (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 02:07, 14 December 2013 (UTC)

I agree that there is no deadline for this.
I would like to have a stage of manual review:  generate a list of candidates and have people remove anything that they think is inappropriate.  This will reduce false positives.

If there are any interested taskforces, we could certainly do this piecemeal. Ah! I think I understand what you mean. Yes, we have already thought about this. I feel the easiest way for this to be done is for all articles to be added to the taskforce under the ??? rating. Articles with this rating can then be triaged and either removed or given a set rating. This facilitates manual review. It would be possible to abstract the process by having a separate list somewhere, but I feel that just adds another layer of complexity without actually achieving additional benefit. --ser:LT910001|LT910001 (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 06:00, 15 December 2013 (UTC)
Here is the additional benefit:  If you first make the list, then I can edit one list, one time, and remove anything that seems to me to be irrelevant.  Under your tag-first system, if there are 500 businesses, organizations, or biographies that have been categorized under Category:Cancer, then they'll all be tagged for hemonc, and the only way to fix it will be for me to edit five hundred separate talk pages.  Now perhaps someone would prefer to edit hundreds or thousands of talk pages to correct the bot, but I would not. 
Also, there is no &quot;???&quot; rating.  It's ara|hemonc|yes, and you can optionally add ara|hemonc-imp, but adding &quot;???&quot; is the same as leaving it blank.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 21:45, 15 December 2013 (UTC)

 Autism Speaks as a source 

As some of you may know, I have created many articles on autism researchers. I was wondering if utism Speaks' blog (blog.autismspeaks.org, later moved to http://www.autismspeaks.org/blog) was a reliable source for such biographical articles, or whether it should be avoided given that it is a &quot;P:BLOGS|blog&quot;. If not, I will remove it from the bios to which I have added it. ser:Jinkinson|Jinkinson ser talk:Jinkinson|talk to me pecial:Contribs/Jinkinson|What did he do now? 22:44, 13 December 2013 (UTC)

 Good question. While blogs have previously ALL had a bad rap as sources here, that is changing, but we must still be cautious. Bogs are now being used as the official newspaper/TV column for journalists and politicians, and as the official website for politicians and corporations, so just because it mentions &quot;blog&quot; doesn't mean we should automatically disparage it.

 Since it's their official blog, it can be listed in the external links of the utism Speaks article. Use as a source there and elsewhere is another matter, and the comments would nearly always be off-limits. If it has an editorial board, or employees who are clearly listed, and their articles speak for the organization, such references could be used in the article, and possibly in other articles. I suspect it would have to be done on a case by case basis. What articles have you used it on? You might even try leaving the links and see if other editors object. (Then be careful about defending them.) If they don't, that may be a tacit sign of acceptance that it's good enough. I recall when I was fairly new here, someone other than myself added a link to my own blog. I didn't know about it for a long time, and later discovered it in the process of defending myself in an ArbCom process (which I survived). It turned out that others had defended the link many times, even though it was a blog, so it all depends on the content.

 I looked at the blog and didn't find a list of editors or such like. Maybe you can find something. BTW, I added some convenience links to aid use of your content above. I hope you don't mind. -- ser:BullRangifer|Brangifer (ser talk:BullRangifer|talk) 00:56, 14 December 2013 (UTC)
 When looking at blogs, it's also worth keeping in mind P:SELFPUB. In the absence of secondary sources, it is acceptable to use self-published blogs as a source of information about the self-publisher as long as: list | the material is neither unduly self-serving nor an exceptional claim | it does not involve claims about third parties | it does not involve claims about events not directly related to the source | there is no reasonable doubt as to its authenticity | the article is not based primarily on such sources.
 So, used carefully and sparingly - as you would with any primary source - blogs can often fill in the gaps in biographies, but shouldn't have a whole article resting on them. Hope that helps. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 02:04, 14 December 2013 (UTC)

The biggest challenge is making sure that the BLP is somehow &quot;part&quot; of the org whose website you're citing.  

Any regular website, whether a blog or not, is self-published:  the people writing the contents are the same people who are making those contents available to the public.  Who writes Coca-Cola's website?  Coca-Cola's employees.  Who made that website available to the public?  Coca-Cola's employees.  This is in contrast to traditional publishing, in which the author and the publishing house are separate entities:  Who wrote Harry Potter?  JK Rowling.  Who decided to make that book available to the public?  Bloomsbury's employees.  

We have strict rules against using self-published sources, including almost all non-newspaper/non-news websites, as sources of information about living people who are not associated with the source.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 20:27, 14 December 2013 (UTC) 
Under this reasoning, the NYTimes is a self-published source (and has been ever since it started using its own printshop). I don't see it. ser:ImperfectlyInformed|II | (ser_talk:ImperfectlyInformed|t - pecial:Contributions/ImperfectlyInformed|c) 20:39, 14 December 2013 (UTC)
Publishing and printing are completely separate issues.  You're a publisher if you're the one who decides to make it available to the public.  You're a printer if you make copies of things.  It is possible to be a printer without being a publisher (e.g., the printshop formerly known as inko's) and common to be a publisher without being a printer (e.g., every publishing house that hires a Chinese printshop).
This is an important distinction, because under your definition, anyone paying a anity publisher is &quot;properly published&quot; on par with having sold their book to Random House (the largest traditional book publisher), solely because the printshop isn't owned by the author.
(American newspapers in particular as an awkward case to explain, because their publisher is always a specific person.  The sole publisher of The New York Times is Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, Jr. (who is also the chairman of the board of directors).  The owner of The New York Times is The New York Times Company.  There are many dozens of editors, and over a thousand writers.  But even there you can see the separation:  the publisher is not the writer.)  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 20:54, 14 December 2013 (UTC)
I wasn't really trying to use that definition, but I was trying to understand where you're making the distinction. OK, so under this reasoning any website which designates someone as the official &quot;publisher&quot; (separate from the writer) is not self-published? In addition, anything which is written with no specific writer identified, could be self-published (how do we know the publisher himself didn't write it?). Not trying to create a strawman, but this seems awkward indeed. ser:ImperfectlyInformed|II | (ser_talk:ImperfectlyInformed|t - pecial:Contributions/ImperfectlyInformed|c) 05:42, 16 December 2013 (UTC)
You might find the ikt:self-publishing|dictionary definition more useful than a series of questions:  &quot;The publishing of books and other media by the authors or creators of those works, rather than by established, third-party publishers.&quot;  Similarly, [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/self-publish M-W] says, &quot;to publish (a book) using the author's own resources&quot;.  If the author is ultimately in control, then you have a self-published piece.  If an established, third-party publisher is in control of publication, then you don't.  If you don't know, then you don't know.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:04, 16 December 2013 (UTC)

Also, nimal models of autism uses Autism Speaks as a source.

 &quot;Relatively inexpensive ways&quot; for parents to &quot;possibly prevent&quot; autism 
 See also:  ikipedia talk:WikiProject Medicine/Archive 40#For review

There is a ikipedia:Articles for creation submission, at ikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Alycia Halladay, to create a biography article about Alycia Kay Halladay, a senior director of utism Speaks.

It currently ends with a quote from Halladay, sourced to the uffington Post, that taking folic acid during pregnancy is &quot;a relatively inexpensive way that parents can take action to possibly prevent risk of tube birth defects and autism.&quot;

I think this and other statements may need some input from this project with regard to ikipedia:MEDRS.

It is also unclear to me whether Halladay is notable under ikipedia:ACADEMIC or not; the sources provided in the submission thus far do not appear to prove her notability under ikipedia:GNG. ser:Arthur goes shopping|Arthur goes shopping (ser talk:Arthur goes shopping|talk) 13:39, 16 December 2013 (UTC)
 First, I think l|Jinkinson has been editing long enough that s/he should be cleaning up his/her own citations by now (citations that specify who the publisher is make it much easier for others to check work).  Second, we don't string together primary sources (PMIDs) to make a claim about someone's research specialty.

 I'm really sorry for using cite pmid templates. I think I'm still used to using them because I have done so for months now, whereas you told me about the Vancouver citation about three days ago.

As an aside, and bear in mind I'm coming at the topic cold, what is the technical issue with the way Jinkinson used the cite pmid template in that edit?  It looks like it generates a proper numbered footnote—I haven't really kept up with the reference formatting templates, so I can't immediately tell by looking what's broken....  ser:TenOfAllTrades|TenOfAllTrades(ser_talk:TenOfAllTrades|talk) 22:52, 17 December 2013 (UTC)

 P:CITEVAR-- citation consistency is a requirement of P:WIAFA and Schizophrenia is a P:FA|Featured article. Almost no medical FAs use the horrid formatting generating by cite pmid (they use Boghog/Diberri).  Besides that cite pmids are generally horrid anyway (when in edit mode, you can't see the date, the title, anything, so you don't know what you're editing).    ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 23:34, 17 December 2013 (UTC)

 c The l|pmid template generates citations using the l|Cite journal template. As it states on the pmid template documentation, it shouldn't be used in articles that use other citation styles. Since chizophrenia overwhelmingly uses the l|Vcite template, generating ancouver system citations, the pmid template simply isn't suitable for use in that article. It is possible to make allowances in a new article where the style hasn't yet settled down, but Schizophrenia is a featured article and consistency of citation style is a requirement.

This really ought to be a bot task, replacing cite pmid or cite doi with the supportable cite journal (etc) on articles which use them. Citation bot does some similar things (e.g. picks the majority choice between l|citation and l|cite xxx), but I'm not aware of any bot that does the equivalent for vcite vs cite.  That said, those choices are made by human editors one article at a time. If they agree to change it (either to or from vcite), that could of course be done very easily. At one time extensively-referenced articles switched to vcite simply for speed (giving up linkages and metadata), but that reason has evaporated with the switch to Lua-based CS1.  It may be time to encourage articles to make the switch back and reduce the number of variations at play.ser:LeadSongDog|LeadSongDog ser talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl! 04:27, 18 December 2013 (UTC)

It doesn't matter if we agree.  If an article is not using cite journal, then you really can't make wholesale conversions without at least leaving a note on the talk page to see if anyone objects—especially not if you're planning to do this at multiple articles.  WT:CITE has discussed this pretty extensively because of P:CITEVAR.  We've had a number of editors in disputes over exactly this.  
 Now, if there's a mix of templates on the page, then you should be able to make it match, and that would probably take care of most of these.  But you can't just say &quot;WikiProject Medicine prefers this other style, so we're changing the citations style that was chosen by the editors who are actually working on the article&quot;.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:20, 18 December 2013 (UTC)
 As I said, &quot;Perhaps we could ask l|Boghog to run through articles that use cite journal and replace the cite PMIDs and cite DOIs ...&quot;  No one mentioned changing citation style. I'm not aware, for example, of any medical FA that does not use cite journal and that does use cite pmids. Furthermore, since the horrid cite pmid template was only invented in 2009, it's unlikely it was the chosen citation style on any established article.  Just sayin', since no one should be adding them to any FA.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 18:31, 18 December 2013 (UTC)
The choice of which citation template to use (or whether to use one) is usually considered to be part of the article's &quot;citation style&quot; and therefore subject to CITEVAR, even when that template's existence is invisible to readers.  
 NB that I'm not saying that it should be, only that this actually is the conclusion of repeated discussions on this subject at WT:CITE.  So if it's a l|cite journal kind of article, then you shouldn't use l|cite pmid—and vice versa.  Wholesale removal from all articles is not acceptable, and if there are mixed styles, then you need to manually decide which is the &quot;established&quot; style for that article, rather than stripping all of them with a bot (or script) run.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 23:13, 18 December 2013 (UTC)

I removed a paragraph based on a single unpublished study, cited to news reports on a conference abstract, and pointed to the WP Medicine reliable sources guidelines, but it has been reinstated with the comment &quot;the page you link explicitly states &quot;Finally, make readers aware of controversies that are stated in reliable sources.&quot; If we were stating this as a medical truth, we would need better info, but at the moment it is carefully and correctly explained as a controversy.&quot; Thanks, ser:Espresso Addict|Espresso Addict (ser talk:Espresso Addict|talk) 17:51, 19 December 2013 (UTC)
 l|Casliber nominated it; l|GrahamColm promoted it.  I can't find the paragraph you said you deleted?  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 18:04, 19 December 2013 (UTC)
Presumably it's [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Redback_spider&amp;diff=586743052&amp;oldid=586743012 this edit].  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:39, 19 December 2013 (UTC)
 Thank you, WAID ... I didn't look back far enough ... and ... that text is still in the article.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 18:45, 19 December 2013 (UTC)
 My removal was reverted with a note to seek consensus before re-removing; refer alk:Redback spider#Effectiveness of antivenom. ser:Espresso Addict|Espresso Addict (ser talk:Espresso Addict|talk) 19:23, 19 December 2013 (UTC)
 I tend to favor P:NOT (News) and P:RECENTISM in applying P:MEDRS strictly.  Now, Casliber edits with his real name, from Australia, and from a position that can be considered one of authority on Wikipedia, as an ex-arb.  Why we have MEDRS?  Let's say someone decides not to use the anti-venom as a result of our article, and dies.  I'd not want to be in that position, but since the text was re-instated, if any editor doing that is willing to take on that responsibility, let me not stand in their way.  PS: See the need for a disclaimer on medical articles, discussed above;[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine&amp;oldid=586829920#Medical_disclaimer] here we have another example of why.  We should be clearly telling people NOT to rely on our articles for medical advice.  This is as good of a demonstration of why as I've seen lately.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 19:42, 19 December 2013 (UTC)
 And now that I've seen that it was not Cas who re-added it, I have removed it.  Gross irresponsibility.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 19:52, 19 December 2013 (UTC)
 Thanks, Sandy. ser:Espresso Addict|Espresso Addict (ser talk:Espresso Addict|talk) 20:10, 19 December 2013 (UTC)

So if it was ser:Casliber who re-added it you would not stand in his way, but if it's me, then you re-revert and call it &quot;gross irresponsibility&quot;?  Nice. --ser:99of9|99of9 (ser talk:99of9|talk) 23:03, 19 December 2013 (UTC)
 No, it was always irresponsible; as I indicated above, I was surprised that Cas (as an editor who edits under his real name) was willing to take on that irresponsibility.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 23:08, 19 December 2013 (UTC)
 But I made it grosser?  By the way, my real name is also easy to find, does that make me more surprising and less gross? --ser:99of9|99of9 (ser talk:99of9|talk) 23:20, 19 December 2013 (UTC)
 Well, actually, the gross irresponsibility belonged to the FAC review, but now that Cas has pointed out that the P:RECENTISM|news came near the very end of the FAC, not even.  So, it was just a mistake that happened, as mistakes do.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 23:28, 19 December 2013 (UTC)
 Not everybody agrees with this, but I think that editors are well-advised to give the benefit of the doubt to editors who have worked most on an article - particularly if they have steered it through the Featured Article process - if only because they are most likely to know the sources well. If I saw something that appeared wrong, but Cas Liber had added to an article he'd taken to FA, I'd suspect my own understanding first. It is quite within the bounds of human nature to give extra deference to those editors whose work we are most familiar with. My advice is never to take reverts personally - both sides are normally acting in what they think is the best interests of the encyclopedia.

 Medical disclaimer 
After discussion on multiple talk pages, it was revealed that multiple other language Wikipedias do have medical disclaimers.  Initially, I was concerned about the decline in participation at WT:MED, where basic concerns are no longer being addressed:
# [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine/Archive_40#Large_number_of_new_medical_BLPs_need_eyes Archived with no resolution]
# Most of these [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine/Archive_40#Submissions_at_WP:AfC moved into mainspace with limited feedback,] and now need to be dealt with

# This problem was [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine/Archive_40#Erlotinib raised here and on an external website]
Separately, I have been concerned with the effect of the education program on medical content-- considering declining participation in Wikipedia, I don't believe we can keep up with the bad content being added by students:

This proposed version for use on en.wikipedia emerged from discussion at ser talk:Alanyst/sandbox/reliability disclaimer and several other on-Wiki talk pages and external websites:

 And for those of is that have missed all those discussions elsewhere, could You explain the reasons to add it? --ser:Wouterstomp|WS (ser talk:Wouterstomp|talk) 20:38, 29 November 2013 (UTC)
 I've added the discussions I'm aware of above; there may be some I missed.  I'm not &quot;proposing to blanket this template&quot; anywhere yet, but I do believe it's time to reconsider and discuss.  There is too much evidence that people take Wikipedia medical content seriously, and aren't aware much of it is written by RandyFromBoise.  As I am the &quot;RandyFromBoise&quot; author of a medical FA, I am more than happy to be one test case, and install the disclaimer.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 00:01, 30 November 2013 (UTC)

Per P:NDA, it's weird that we consider l|recent death and l|current reason enough for a disclaimer, but not potentially life-altering content.  I wouldn't mind working in some of your wording, but I'm still in favor of a more prominent disclaimer.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 02:41, 30 November 2013 (UTC)
I think the reason that those are acceptable is because they are temporary and provide information to experienced editors (namely, that they shouldn't be surprised by edit conflicts).  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:39, 30 November 2013 (UTC)
 Disagree 100% with your take.  Both of those templates most clearly contain wording to warn readers (rather than &quot;experienced editors&quot; as you say) that the information may not be correct, as it is changing rapidly.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 18:21, 30 November 2013 (UTC)
Yes, that's what they say.  But IMO what they say is not the most important reason why they are permitted.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:32, 1 December 2013 (UTC)

How about this version (below)?  It links the disclaimer more subtly to make the box smaller and makes the text a little less semicolon-happy.  I also think &quot;medical content&quot; sounds a bit weird, like &quot;content used as medicine&quot;, so I thought &quot;do not rely on it for medical guidance&quot; is a bit more clear.

I like Alanyst's version. Would be interested in trialing it to see if it increases the frequency of positive edits.

I like the bottom-most one as it doesn't state not to rely on medical content, but to be cautious when it comes to guidance. Saying do not rely on its medical content is like completely undermining the hard work we do here, and saying its all rubbish not to be trusted. ser:CFCF|CFCF (ser talk:CFCF|talk) 08:44, 30 November 2013 (UTC)

I shortened it and made it sound less negative. Not sure we should be using such a template. The rationale that because other language wikipedias use these templates should be qualified with the fact that their medical content is likely of lower quality then the medical content on the English Wikipedia. ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 09:03, 30 November 2013 (UTC)

Something like this was tried a while ago, but I don't think that the data were ever analyzed completely.  And we did have problems with people removing them &quot;per NDA&quot;.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:39, 30 November 2013 (UTC)

I think we have a moral obligation to warn our readers that what they're reading is unreliable, and that the warning needs to be prominent at the top of the article. Whether that warning has a measurable effect on the quality of editing is completely irrelevant. But that said, I think WhatamIdoing's version is concise, to the point, and may help to educate potential editors. --ser:Anthonyhcole|Anthonyhcole (ser talk:Anthonyhcole|talk · pecial:Contributions/Anthonyhcole|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Anthonyhcole|email)  18:00, 30 November 2013 (UTC)

OK, so we have six versions up here now, and it's no longer clear to me which is which or if any have consensus.  Could we address the principle of a disclaimer, yes or no, and then sort out the specifics over at ser talk:Alanyst/sandbox/reliability disclaimer|Alanyst's page or a proposed template page?  Because I no longer know who supports what, if anything.  The last one on the page now is fine with me.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 18:25, 30 November 2013 (UTC)

 Medical disclaimer: yes or no? 
Should Wikipedia have a warning about our reliability at the top of each article or section that contains health-related information? (Let's address the nature of the warning in a separate discussion.) --ser:Anthonyhcole|Anthonyhcole (ser talk:Anthonyhcole|talk · pecial:Contributions/Anthonyhcole|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Anthonyhcole|email)  19:11, 30 November 2013 (UTC)
* Yep. --ser:Anthonyhcole|Anthonyhcole (ser talk:Anthonyhcole|talk · pecial:Contributions/Anthonyhcole|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Anthonyhcole|email)  19:11, 30 November 2013 (UTC)
* Yes. For all the reasons I listed at the top of this discussion.  We can't keep up, RandyFromBoise writes our content, we have bad student edits, internet readers hit us first from Google and take us seriously, and unlike other &quot;bad&quot; medical content websites, ours changes by the minute. Readers ned to know that they are reading content that anyone could have added, not even someone qualified to trim a toenail.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 19:23, 30 November 2013 (UTC)
* All things considered, No-- whilst I appreciate the ethical arguments for, I think this template makes things look unprofessional and will further crowd the lead of articles. The rest of Wikipedia makes do with linking the disclaimer at the bottom of the page. By placing such a template we are saying that medical articles are more important, when other types of articles could also be &quot;dangerous&quot; to readers if they used them for guidance. The argument that non English wikis use a disclaimer template is also not particularly strong imo, since I imagine the medical content on other wikis is less well developed. ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 19:41, 30 November 2013 (UTC)
* Yes in principle, though I'd phrase it as allowing disclaimers on pages with health-related information, and (as a rule of thumb) encouraged for articles or sections discussing serious maladies or treatments; but ultimately the question of whether the disclaimer is appropriate for a particular article or section should be a matter of local (article or Wikiproject) consensus, and neither mandated nor prohibited as a matter of site-wide policy.  (For instance, I'd support a disclaimer on eart attack but not ream (pharmaceutical)|skin cream even though both are health related.)  But this is an improvement over the standard site disclaimer, which is hardly visible enough to alert the reader to potential misinformation in what they read.  IMO &quot;help readers avoid being misled&quot; outweighs &quot;looking unprofessional&quot; or &quot;treating one type of article different than another&quot;. ser talk:Alanyst|alanyst 19:54, 30 November 2013 (UTC)

*Tentative yes. I agree with Doc James, we need to be inviting readers to become editors rather than simply warning that our content is questionable. If these criteria are filled I will support a template message for a limited run after which evaluation can occur.ser:CFCF|CFCF (ser talk:CFCF|talk) 22:20, 30 November 2013 (UTC)

* Yes. I feel conflicted about this, but since so much of the medical material on WP is poor I think there is really a moral obligation at least to trial it. I think it would also be useful if, when editing an article within the scope of Wikiproject medicine, the text that appeared above the edit box very prominently pointed editors at MEDRS (analagous to what happens for BLPs): that might help address the problem &quot;at source&quot;. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn ser talk:Alexbrn|talk|pecial:Contributions/Alexbrn|contribs|ser:Alexbrn#Conflict_of_interest_declaration|COI 11:20, 1 December 2013 (UTC)

*Oppose any disclaimer which includes anything saying &quot;Do not rely on it for medical guidance.&quot; Wikipedia is not a resource for the exclusive benefit of the upper classes of society who are empowered to be able to use Wikipedia as a supplement to the other privileges they have to access medical information. It would be unfair and oppressive to people with less access to medical resources if the community which maintains medical content here perpetuate the false idea that most of society has better choices for access to health information than Wikipedia. Wikipedia is a radically ambitious project and its failure to be a perfect medical resource highlights society's failure to provide good medical information, and not the Wikipedia community's failure to deliver this. Readers should use Wikipedia as they like and not get a bogus consumer disclaimer that they should do otherwise or even that they could do otherwise if they wished. Readers might be fairly warned of the many problems with Wikipedia's content but for most people in the world, Wikipedia is and will be for the foreseeable future the best or only medical guidance they can have for most purposes. I would sooner favor a demand that every health organization in the world drop all their other educational projects and devote all their resources to Wikipedia than I would discourage people from using Wikipedia in favor of other resources. People who have better access to better services will use them. Online and for most people, Wikipedia is the best the world has to offer despite its many faults. If this disclaimer is used then it should explicitly state what people should do instead. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 16:32, 3 December 2013 (UTC)
*Support the proposal. Given the nature of wikipedia - that material is not vetted, that it is open to anyone to edit anonymously, and that content on WP can and does contain errors and distortions - I think that a prominent disclaimer is necessary for medical content in particular. I think that this is ethically necessary regardless of how WP medical content compares to other online sources, the putative impact of such a disclaimer on any readership (readers have their own responsibilities), or whether such a disclaimer might be used to attract editors to medical articles. As a largely anonymous body of editors and in the absence of any formal system of article curatorship, fact-checking or peer-review, the relationship of writers to readers is somewhat abnormal on WP. As a reader of WP content I cannot trace responsibility for content back to any individual or accountable body in any meaningful way. Given that no WP editor, even those who have eschewed the comforts of anonymity, can reasonably stand over the content of any article throughout the article's lifetime to say &quot;I am responsible for this&quot;, there's an minimal obligation to communicate to a readership that medical content has not been verified.
The placement of a hyperlink to a general disclaimer at the bottom of the article, as is current practice, appears to me insufficient. This disclaimer is, practically, invisible - I wasn't even aware that it existed until I read this thread.
However, I think that any disclaimer should not demoralise those editors who have made good and often excellent contributions to medical content by suggesting that all such content is or should be treated as uniformly awful. I would therefore favour a more standard and moderate disclaimer, in a reasonable prominent position, to the effect that medical content &quot;does not constitute medical advice and should not serve as the basis for any medical decision&quot; which would link to the general disclaimer. Communicating honestly to any readership the limitations of WP content is not an act of oppression - it simply informs people and puts them in a better position to negotiate their own decisions. ser:FiachraByrne|FiachraByrne (ser talk:FiachraByrne|talk) 18:00, 3 December 2013 (UTC)
*Support In the u.S. practically every health care provider has a disclaimer that basically says &quot;If this is an emergency, hang up and dial 911.&quot;  It's not there to deprive callers of medical advice from their doctor, rather it's an acknowledgement that persons with emergent conditions may call their doctor instead of an A&amp;E hospital or 911.  We should at least be cognizant of the fact that before someone calls their doctor, they may consult Wikipedia to their peril.  We need a similar &quot;Hang up and call your doctor&quot; message just like every healthcare professional puts on their call system.  --ser:DHeyward|DHeyward (ser talk:DHeyward|talk) 03:04, 4 December 2013 (UTC)
*Support - Lots of people are not really properly aware how exactly wikipedia works and how easily various inaccurate crap can slip in. Argument that there is even worse crap out there in internet is irrelevant, its our job to ensure that our readers are properly warned, also most of those even worse sites will not be among first google search results. &quot;Badge of shame&quot; complaint is just plain silly.

OK. Thanks. Let's do a trial. But let's measure both the impact on the reader's grasp of our reliability and the impact on editor behaviour. Study design and sample size is everything.

I think the vast majority of people who do not contribute to Wikipedia tend to have a low opinion of the information on Wikipedia, and those who regularly contribute certainly understand that it is advisable to take this information um grano salis. What we are actually doing is then duplicating information already supplied by the disclaimer at the bottom of every article, and telling people what they already know.

You don't know that. Do you? Vast majority, eh? Where's your source? What you just said there doesn't match my experience at all. There is a wide spectrum of understanding about the reliability of Wikipedia among the people I know - it seems to be related to how much time they spend online. We have to duplicate the information found in the [http://stats.grok.se/en/latest/Wikipedia:Medical_disclaimer current disclaimer] because most people don't read it. --ser:Anthonyhcole|Anthonyhcole (ser talk:Anthonyhcole|talk · pecial:Contributions/Anthonyhcole|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Anthonyhcole|email)  11:42, 1 December 2013 (UTC)

@Anthony: I based that view on my conversations about Wikipedia with people offline and online (not wikipedia). Vast majority have generally low opinion of Wikipedia in my experience. You ask for a source yet you provide no source for your own opinions apart from your own experience. It could be argued that there is no real evidence that people use medical information on Wikipedia and end up harming themselves. Perhaps your link is evidence that people don't read the disclaimer, I don't know. Perhaps people do read it, but only once and then not again. This whole thread is opinion in fact, so kindly do not selectively ask for sources for my opinion =D ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 12:08, 1 December 2013 (UTC)
Ah. You sum this up nicely. You propose we wait for someone to get hurt before we act. I think it is just self-evident that we have a duty to advise our readers of the unreliability of our content. I've seen comparisons above with crap medical sites and the impenetrable user-unfriendly scholarly literature. Are you, James, saying we should model our transparency on that of those crap sites? And no, due to its density, the scholarly literature is no substitute for Wikipedia. We own the encyclopedia space.

Precisely as I said, Anthony. We already have a general disclaimer, and there is plenty of rubbish health content online that doesn't have a disclaimer at all (e.g. people's personal web pages about obscure medical theories). That is the status quo. What would I like to see in a disclaimer that makes it worth the implied embarrassment of saying &quot;what you are about to read may or may ser:Jimbo Wales|not suck&quot;?
Firstly, I want the decision to be reversible. Therefore, a trial seems reasonable. Ideally we should have some way of determining whether the trial is achieving the desired effect. We could look at article feedback results with and without a disclaimer.
Secondly, we want people to understand that if an article does suck, its informative vacuum is not forever but it can be fixed provided people improve the content based on sources that everyone can trust.
I share Sandy's frustration with the accumulation of bad stuff in so many articles, but I think we need a little bit more faith, and we need to support people like ser:Jmh649|James who are systematically attacking the highest-impact articles and working them up to impeccably high standard (as evidenced by GA/FA status).

|Anthonyhcole. What I am talking about is this: James has been systematically working on high-impact articles, and that is an effort that deserves all the support it can get. Even if it's cheering from the sidelines and the occasional GA review.
I think it is very easy to support a disclaimer on the basis of the recautionary principle (more warnings = better), but I prefer to start from the premise that people currently know that our content is likely to suffer from variations in quality, and any warning must therefore confer a measurable benefit compared to the status quo. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 15:56, 2 December 2013 (UTC)

That works both ways:  it will warn the reader off both the good and the bad information.  The reader does not actually know which is which.  Because of cognitive biases, people who are told &quot;This is unreliable&quot; are prone to believing that the stuff they personally disagree with is the unreliable stuff and the stuff they agree with is the reliable stuff.  So let's imagine an article that really is correct, but the reader doesn't agree with it:  do you want the reader to say, &quot;Huh, it says that when your blood pressure is 160/100 that you really should take your meds, but it says at the top that this is all unreliable anyway, so I'll just skip taking my blood pressure pills.&quot;  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:46, 1 December 2013 (UTC)

cI cannot speak for James, but I don't think there is &quot;obvious good&quot; (unless one simply assumes that the disclaimer will have its intended effect) and the harm is clutter. I agree with doing this as a reversible trial, because the argument for doing it is unconvincing (i.e. not clearly &quot;better&quot; than what we have now).

 The problem with that logic, Doc J, is that we'd be initially (per these samples) inviting people to contribute only if they have access to high quality medical sources ... not everyone does ... it may not be a fair trial.

Support, with the mild qualification that the exact optimum wording be worked out soon, and perhaps some indications regarding whether or not some articles of this type, which could perhaps result in serious negative consequences for people who might follow them blindly, should perhaps be included in &quot;pending revisions&quot; and, maybe, a new form of &quot;expert pending revisions&quot; of people perhaps vetted by the community to be considered trustworthy in such matters. Maybe an RfC or some other means to get broad input would be best. I myself, as a non-medical editor, might like &quot;Wikipedia is the free encyclopedia anyone is allowed to edit. As such, it can happen that less than reliable information or biased information can and often is added to various articles. While we do everything in our power to ensure that such information is quickly appropriately edited, and welcome all editing based on high-quality sources, wikipedia should not be considered a substitute for professional advice.&quot; or something like that. ser:John Carter|John Carter (ser talk:John Carter|talk) 16:32, 1 December 2013 (UTC)

Oppose It is unnecessary and will clutter up the article to have a banner 'of shame' saying basically our content is not worthy of trusting and therefore don't bother reading it as it may very well be garbage. Why not just delete all the medical articles if they are potentially harmful and shut down the medicine project. What is the point? It will discourage people of writing never mind reading our articles. A disclaimer at the bottom of the article are sufficient. Undoubtedly some people will indeed use wikipedia and the internet to diagnose themselves but most of the treatments are prescription only medicines or therapies and thus they will have to seek out a healthcare professional to get the treatment so how can wikipedia be causing any significant or widespread harm? I am of the view that overall wikipedia is a force for good but we live in an imperfect world. Further we already carefully word our content so that it is factual and not instructional in tone. I understand the drive to protect people from harm though - I guess if there is a consensus to add some warning I feel that it should not be done so as a blinding banner but a brief warning in the info box or such like but no blaring banner please.--ser:MrADHD|MrADHD | ser_talk:MrADHD|T@1k? 08:38, 5 December 2013 (UTC)

OK, I see some resistance to putting a template on an FA (personally, I disagree ... utism is not in good shape, and I was willing to be a guinea pig at TS, but whatevs).  How about if someone who knows how to figure such things out (I don't) determines which is our most important and most viewed GA and we trial that?

I do not see a consensus to add these templates and am become more and more hesitant that we should pursue this after reading the above discussion. I see a bunch of potential problems and have a lot of unanswered questions regarding it:
#Does it make any difference? People may just have banner blindness and ignore them all together. Thus it may be wasted effort that could be better spent on improving content.
#And if it does make people's change their behavior will this change be positive or negative? What do we view as positive and negative behavior changes in our readers and how do we measure these? If people stop using Wikipedia, which I think is unlikely, what will they use instead? Nothing, emedicine, the websites of manufacturers, uptodate? Is this a positive or negative change? 
#Have we done a comparison of the accuracy of Wikipedia to other sites? Samir and I tried to do an analysis with medical students at the U of T. We had a protocol drawn up using medical students with access to Wikipedia versus uptodate versus nothing. We wanted to look at tests scores on a licensing type exam. The ethics review committee denied the application.  
#If people decide to use nothing and become less educated about their own condition is this a good or bad thing? There are people who argue it both ways. IMO you want people activity engaged with the literature around their condition.
#While this increase or decrease the number of positive / negative edits being make? Could this banner increase poor quality edits to articles? How does one determine this? With respect to the education program we have groups that state that it is an over all benefit to Wikipedia's quality and groups who say it is an overall harm. Who and how do we decide if this works if we trial it?
#How much time are we going to spend working on this? It will require broad reaching consensus for implementation. This is exceedingly hard to get and requires a lot of time. Think of VE and pending changes. And determining if it works and what we define as working will be equally hard.
#We cannot even agree on the wording to start with. Some want harsher word. Some want wording to invite people to edit.
#There are requests that &quot;experts&quot; should be involved with running the trial. We of course have no money to pay said experts. Convincing the WMF to fund something is difficult / a full time job. I would say that having the foundation work on P:Turnitin is more important. 
#What is an &quot;expert&quot;? This is far from a single unified group. I have asked a good dozen lawyers questions regarding the copyright of X-rays and have gotten more than a dozen different answers. The same occurs in medicine. With respect to breast cancer screening we have people come to Wikipedia and curse us as we contain the conclusions of the Cochrane collaboration and we have people come and curse us as we contain the conclusions of the US services task force among others. The conclusions of these two groups are more or less opposite. And each camp things we at Wikipedia are killing people if we provide any space for the views of the other camp.
Anyway I am not convinced and going back to editing content.

James:
2. Does it make any difference? We won't know until we try. Some not-completely-stupid people think it may and is therefore worth doing - some such people disagree.
3. Have we done a comparison with other sites? Why are you asking that? That other sites are more or less reliable would be good to know but you have failed to show what relevance that has to this question.
4. People may stop looking things up on the internet. Really?
5. &quot;Will this increase or decrease the number of positive / negative edits being make? Could this banner increase poor quality edits to articles? How does one determine this?&quot; Intelligent, non-biased before/after study. The few &quot;studies&quot; I've seen of the education program have featured none of these qualities.
6. You don't have to do a thing. In fact, given your and JFW's attitudes, I'd rather you both stay right out of it.
7. &quot;We cannot even agree on the wording to start with.&quot; We're still discussing that. We (those who actually want a disclaimer) will agree on wording easily enough if those who don't will stop throwing spanners in.
8. &quot;There are requests that &quot;experts&quot; should be involved with running the trial. We of course have no money to pay said experts.&quot; The WMF does. You're the one who insists we &quot;prove&quot; that warning our readers of our unreliability is a good thing. Please don't turn around and say, &quot;Oh, but that can't be proven because we can't afford the expertise, it's too hard to convince the WMF, they should spend their money on other things.&quot;
9. What is an expert? In this instance it's simple, since we're doing a straightforward reader survey. There are polling companies in every civilised nation whose expertise is for sale.
Frankly, unless you can come up with something better than this to oppose a disclaimer, I'd rather you did go back to editing and JFW went back to whatever it is he does. --ser:Anthonyhcole|Anthonyhcole (ser talk:Anthonyhcole|talk · pecial:Contributions/Anthonyhcole|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Anthonyhcole|email)  03:07, 3 December 2013 (UTC)

Comments from LT910001
Have made a separate section to stop this getting too messy. I do not support this proposal. Although I agree that we should strive to keep information accurate, reliable, and sourced, and I agree it's noble goal, I don't support this for the following reasons:
# It will probably drive many users away from Wikipedia to other sites that do not contain this tag. The majority of which will be less reliable.
# I think that at some point we will need to acknowledge our readers as free agents liable to make their own decisions about reliability (as flawed as this may be), there is no claim to reliability anywhere.
# This tag does not appear in every article on other (print) encyclopedias, of which we have been shown to be of equal or greater reliability.
# Putting the tag on pages is very effort-intensive and there doesn't appear to be consensus, so if consensus is built around removing it this will be equally intensive.
# I shudder to think of the appearance of pages with several tags already and this additionally.
# Additional tags already exist for information that is not reliable: a tag for articles of unknown reliability, tags for pages with poor sourcing, tags for pages with disputed neutrality, and so on. These serve a similar purpose.

We could create a new tag along the lines of ('this page appears to be written like edical advice, of which it is not '), and then treat this like a cleanup tag. From my read of the above text, at this stage there does not appear to be consensus in either direction. --ser:LT910001|LT910001 (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 07:06, 3 December 2013 (UTC)

#I don't think ser:Casliber's version, below, is going to scare anyone away - it conveys the need for caution without insulting the authors of our better work. Can you live with that wording?
#&quot;There is no claim to reliability anywhere.&quot; Yes there is. We claim it for scholarly reviews, high-quality textbook chapters, government and professional and scholarly society position statements, etc. Our articles can achieve that level of &quot;reliability&quot; with scholarly review but until an article has received that attention from the same calibre of scholars who bestow &quot;reliability&quot; on our reliable sources, our readers deserve to know.
#The Nature study that found our quality comparable to that of Britannica was tiny - as have been any subsequent similar studies. P:RANDY|Randy can't impose his theory of cannabis and cancer on Britannica.
#Adding and removing the disclaimer can be done by a bot, automatically.
#Sorry. I have no answer to that criticism. Other than to say that 90% of the tags I see at the top of articles can safely be dispensed with - but not this one.
#None of our content is P:MEDRS reliable. It can all be. It should all be. We have a duty to make it so ASAP. But presently it isn't.

Version Cas Liber
I oppose a disclaimer trial as unnecessary. I especially oppose a trial whose success or failure is determined by whether it measurably affects readers' conversion to editors. But if we're to persuade the wider community, we'll need unanimity within WPMED - all of us behind it, including long-time contributors such as ser:Jmh649|James, ser:Jfdwolff|JFW and new chums. None of us will get exactly what we want but I think we're approaching something most of us can support.

ser:Casliber has proposed version CL [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAlanyst%2Fsandbox%2Freliability_disclaimer&amp;diff=584473136&amp;oldid=584464904 here] (Please read his thoughtful reasoning):

Seppi333's 2¢
Too lazy to read through the whole thread, so I'll just give my thoughts/advice: A medical disclaimer is a good idea, but some people personalize things, so don't address the reader directly when disclaiming and, more importantly, ighlight|don't tell the reader what to do.|orange  A disclaimer of any kind, be it investments, medicine, or, more important than both of those, your skydiving parachute, should just be cautionary (if legally possible), not a request or command.  An unnecessarily strong statement just runs the risk of alienating/offending the target audience.


no.

Okey lets go through the basics. There is a ikipedia:No_disclaimers_in_articles#Status_of_this_guideline|very long standing consensus that such disclaimers are a bad idea. No localised position on single wikiproject can overturn that. You want to introduce them I'm afraid its the slog through the village pump and similar.

The idea that medical is a special case doesn't really hold. For example cooling towers which I doubt you would classify as medical have a multiple square mile kill radius (ah Legionnaires’).

I'm not 100% opposed to medical disclaimers, but I do have to remind people here that any decision made from a discussion here is largely a P:LOCALCONSENSUS|local consensus specifically confined to WikiProject Medicine. In order for such a proposal to become valid, it would require overall community consensus Wikipedia-wide, since ikipedia:No disclaimers in articles is an existing guideline. The current consensus is that we do not place disclaimers within articles, because we have pages such as ikipedia:General disclaimer, ikipedia:Medical disclaimer, ikipedia:Content disclaimer et cetera which fulfil this purpose. Sure, there's no specific policy on the issue, but the existence of a content guideline is enough to justify seeking overall consensus first prior to making such a huge change from the status quo. I recommend starting something over at the P:Village pump. --ser:benlisquare|benlisquareser talk:benlisquare|T•pecial:Contributions/Benlisquare|C•pecial:EmailUser/User:Benlisquare|E 01:10, 14 December 2013 (UTC)

 The necessity of disclaimers

Another 2¢

My viewpoint may change as I think about this more, but I think I would support the versions that refer readers to a medical professional but oppose the others. For some wordings, I think that disclaimers on certain articles, like accination (or MR vaccine controversy), are likely to do more harm than good - it will become an argument for anyone who wants to discredit the scientific consensus on these topics, and a prominent reason for a reader (who might otherwise have been educated on the topic) to reject that consensus when it is presented in Wikipedia. On a similar note, many templates can be used for POV pushing, but without the right wording, I think this would be one of the worse ones (when does an article or section have enough medical content to deserve a template? etc). So I would probably oppose any template that contained the phrase &quot;Do not rely on...&quot; but I would probably support the template &quot;Wikipedia is not a substitute for the advice of a medical professional. Please help us improve our medical content using high quality sources.&quot; 

Of course, I do see the problem this is meant to solve, but I'm not sure this is the best way to address it. Is it possible to write some scripts to identify (and maybe tag) non-MEDRS sources being used in medical articles? That would probably meet with a lot less opposition and wouldn't require a community-wide discussion. Or, if such a discussion is to be initiated anyways, I think raising MEDRS to policy might be a better goal, and one which I would support unreservedly. ser:Sunrise|Sunrise (ser talk:Sunrise|talk) 05:08, 15 December 2013 (UTC)

 Suitability of our FAs 
Some participants in these discussions have expressed the idea that our FAs don't need a disclaimer.  (We used to have a nice chart of our FAs on the WP:MED mainpage, which seems to have disappeared along with a lot of other helpful content, but I digress ... ) So, looking at ikipedia:FA#Health and medicine, I can say that at minimum the following have isssues:
* sperger syndrome has not been updated since Eubulides (its main author) left, although I did update it for SM5.
* utism Ditto AS, Eubulides author, not only is it outdated, but DSM5 completely changed the scheme in autism spectrum disorders, so this article needs major work.
* ajor depressive disorder has always been a sourcing problem, needs attention, and may be outdated per DSM5.
* enstrual cycle isn't being watched, you only need glance at the References to see the aricle has likely fallen from FA status.
* chizophrenia is outdated and has some sourcing issues.
* ater fluoridation is another Eubulides FA, and I doubt it has been maintained to standard since he left.
Those are just the ones I know about; I would guess that 50% of our medical FA content would not stand up to P:WIAFA scrutiny.

Thank you for your search. I placed a suggested anatomic diagram of the cervical spine on alk:neck pain.

I think it may be hard to find a less specific image without the undertones of artificiality and advertising. An image of a neck with red color for pain is hardly better, as is the case at umbago. The author claims to genuinely have experienced neck pain even if the posture may be slightly forced. The image on ain is clearly real but is in my view pretty much the same thing.
Looking elsewhere, there are a number of X-ray images on Wikipedia that may suffice, showing different diagnoses that would be relevant for neck pain.File:Cervical fracture dislocation C6-C7.jpeg, File:Retroabscess10.JPG, File:RetrolistheseC35grade1.PNG, File:Morbus_Bechterew.jpg ser:CFCF|CFCF (ser talk:CFCF|talk) 22:50, 20 December 2013 (UTC)
OK, it is going to be difficult to portray pain in a picture. I don't have a problem with the lead image on ain. It is not artificial. Regarding the first image you suggested however, given this: [http://www.flickr.com/photos/bearpark/sets/72157604151627749/], I do not think we should pander to this exhibitionist, for want of a more polite term. For that matter, was there any need for the subject to be topless in this photo?
Not sure these x-rays are suitable either... 
What about a diagram of nerves ... this is indirectly relevant to pain... I was looking at our ervical plexus article, not sure if you would be happy with any of those? ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 23:10, 20 December 2013 (UTC)
I don't think that the leeping photo is a problem, and while the eck pain photo is a little &quot;artistic&quot;, I think it's good to provide a photo that anyone can understand (i.e., not X-rays and nerve diagrams).  What some people call &quot;artificial&quot; or &quot;advertising&quot;, others will call &quot;professional&quot;.  
I've seen people complain about professional-looking photos before, e.g., saying that we should show a casual snapshot of a blood glucose sitting on a wooden table rather than a photograph that was carefully arranged and has a neutral background.  I haven't been convinced by these arguments in the past.  I'm actually glad that Colin's amazing, very professional photo is in the lead of lothes iron.  We should encourage high-quality images.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 02:11, 21 December 2013 (UTC)
I am not attacking professional images in general, just this particular flavor of image which I am finding it hard to describe. They are the kind of photos you get from commercial image repositories. E.g. these I found on getty images by typing in &quot;pain&quot; (not free images, for illustration only): 
* [http://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/photo/woman-with-neck-ache-high-res-stock-photography/AB72516] for neck pain?
* [http://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/photo/woman-suffering-from-a-toothache-royalty-free-image/177259694] for toothache?
* [http://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/photo/man-in-bedroom-with-backache-royalty-free-image/88689523 for low back pain?
They are artificial, devoid of emotion, and you see them all over the internet on sites which are selling something. They set the wrong tone for Wikipedia since the eye is so used to seeing them accompany some ad or other. I know this is not a particularly strong argument, but for this reason I think it is better to stay with an anatomic diagram of nerves for neck pain... ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 02:26, 21 December 2013 (UTC)

 Vital articles level 4 

Looking at ikipedia:Vital articles/Expanded/Biology and health sciences there seems to be a bias away from medical content and towards non-human biology. There are there 159 articles on birds and 110 on medical content. Furthermore the articles on anatomy are mixed between human and non-human articles. Any thoughts? Who makes these lists? ser:CFCF|CFCF (ser talk:CFCF|talk) 13:04, 20 December 2013 (UTC)
Here is an overview of the selection process ikipedia:Vital articles/Expanded. I don't really think its proportionate that there are 1050 articles on organisms, and around 220 on medicine or health. ser:CFCF|CFCF (ser talk:CFCF|talk) 13:06, 20 December 2013 (UTC)
|CFCF I am not sure what to do in response to this. Here are my thoughts, but I can make no conclusion.
*The Vital Article listing project has been contentious, time consuming, and does not actually produce content.
*It is not obvious that in the past listing articles here has resulted in significant development of those articles, but I do feel that some day, articles listed here will be targeted for development in a useful way somehow.
*The Wikimedia Foundation has always pushed for development of these articles, and since it is rare to get their support for particular community projects, that has value.
*People at this WikiProject like medicine but most of the rest of the community has an aversion to touching medicine. This project gets a lot of respect and most people show that respect by staying hands-off, which is is both good and bad. I expect that this means that many people would be adverse to developing health articles even if they were listed there.
*Not only are the health articles on Wikipedia extremely popular as compared to health information elsewhere, but also, the health articles on Wikipedia are extremely popular as compared to other Wikipedia articles. I do not have data to back either one of those claims, but eventually that data will have to be compiled, and when it does, it will give a huge amount of insight into what medical articles should be on the list. For example, the Wikipedia article on etformin is probably the most consulted publication on metformin, and it is among the [http://stats.grok.se/en/latest/Metformin top 0.1% of Wikipedia articles by popularity] as measured by pageviews. This means something - I am not sure what. Wikipedia is being used heavily as an information source for particular treatments and medical procedures. Perhaps 300 of them are super popular (within the top 1%) among all Wikipedia articles, and perhaps only 15 of these are currently listed as vital. The vital article list is more of a setup for a category structure than development of the topics which people are actually demanding. I think the article on metformin is &quot;vital&quot;, but right now, vital articles are being defined in some way that would not accept articles like this in the list. I am not sure how to describe what is happening there. 
*Birds are awesome but for example, the upper limit of popularity for a bird ([http://stats.grok.se/en/latest/Columbidae pigeon]) is 40,000 when many mediocre health articles get that much traffic. Most organism articles are much less popular. Most &quot;vital&quot; articles are much less popular.
*For as long as vital articles are just a theoretic construct unrelated to reader demand, I think medical editors will have a bad time contributing there.
*For as long as there is no data about reader demand to specific categories of articles, there is no way to make a sound argument that lots of readers are demanding health content.
*There are great tools to track traffic in categories but right now there is no precedent for making statistically sound statements on these things. 
I want the vital article project to be a success, and I think that WikiProject Medicine should watch it and have stake in it, but I cannot at this time recommend that it would be useful for anyone here to spend their time there. The return in utility is not yet good. I have hopes that in the future non-Wikipedians or new Wikipedians, perhaps from the pen Educational Resources movement, would develop this kind of content if they recognized Wikipedia as relevant to their interests. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 15:57, 20 December 2013 (UTC)

 Bacterial Pneumonia 

My husband was diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia today,  he is 72.  He had a ruptured colon in Sept. which resulted in removing a part of the colon and a temporary colostomy. Today they prescribed Alubuterol Inhaler and Amoxicillin 875 Mg.  He was  on his third day of a Z-Pack, Zithromyacin, 500 mgm. which he has now completed.  

What can cause this type of bacterial pneumonia They did not tell us the type of bacteria, gram 1, gram 2 etc.

1.  He does use a cpap machine

2.  We are careful with his bags and bag changes with his colostomy.

3.  We were in the San Joaquin valley of California for Christmas, and they also checked him for Valley Fever, but did not give us any results???  We were staying in our large building, in an office we changed into a place to stay while there as we live 7 hours away.  So we stay while work is being performed.   They tore out an old cold box(like meat storage or cold storage, and there is a lot electrical, dropped ceiling and flooring going on.  Could this be a possible source of the bacteria?

There's also a fringe issue: by producing a unchecked catalogue of scientists' fringe views we are (in my view) creating an article that advances/implies a certain position without the necessary context. I also have to wonder how I knew which editor had created this article before even looking at the edit history. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn ser talk:Alexbrn|talk|pecial:Contributions/Alexbrn|contribs|ser:Alexbrn#Conflict_of_interest_declaration|COI 10:12, 18 December 2013 (UTC)
(Add) Relatedly (and sorry I have not idea how DYK works) one of the current hooks for DYK on WP's front page today is &quot;... that an nimal models of autism|animal model of autism was used by ady Hornig to implicate thimerosal in autism?&quot; - which has been raised as problematic e.g. at P:FRINGE P:FT/N. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn ser talk:Alexbrn|talk|pecial:Contributions/Alexbrn|contribs|ser:Alexbrn#Conflict_of_interest_declaration|COI 10:22, 18 December 2013 (UTC)
You mean P:FTN. :-) The extent of my understanding is that if the hook is to be altered or removed, it requires admin intervention (requested ikipedia:Main_Page/Errors#Errors_in_the_current_or_next_Did_you_know...|here, but none is forthcoming yet). I think that the hook being based on a non-MEDRS-compliant medical statement should be sufficient reason. ser:Sunrise|Sunrise (ser talk:Sunrise|talk) 11:04, 18 December 2013 (UTC)
The hook is no longer on the main page. It rotated off before anything could be done - see [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Main_Page/Errors&amp;diff=586649535&amp;oldid=586622161]. ser:Sunrise|Sunrise (ser talk:Sunrise|talk) 16:17, 18 December 2013 (UTC)
 l|Sunrise you're raising this important issue in the wrong place at the wrong time.  I have been screaming (really) at DYK for years that they need to get some admin accountability for MEDRS and BLP issues they put on the mainpage, offering to check any DYK they will bring to my attention.  DYK refuses-- and has for years-- to put any accountability into place, and admins pass hooks to the mainpage, knowing they are medical content or BLPs, without requesting checks.   l|Nikkimaria is one of the few adults over there, and she alerted me on my talk page sometime yesterday of two DYKs on the mainpage, but by the time I saw them they had a) already been promoted, and b) already pushed on to the mainpage, and it was too late for me to do anything.  The problems with DYK have been repeatedly and for years raised at DYK and at ANI-- they don't want to hear from me again, so feel free to go over there and take it on them, where it will fall on deaf ears. I've checked your contribs, and although you indicated somewhere you had raised this at DYK talk, it doesn't seem that you did.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 16:55, 18 December 2013 (UTC)
Jinkinson posted a note on this page that directly asked for advice on this particular hook before it went live.  
DYK is supposed to be surprising or otherwise catch the readers' attention, not to tell the whole story.  It sounds to me like this one met the goal.  So long as the article told the whole story, then I don't especially mind.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:25, 18 December 2013 (UTC)

@WAID: I am assuming that when he posted at 02:47 UTC saying &quot;it's a DYK&quot;, it was already live; that message is in fact how I noticed it. (But even if it was before, it wouldn't have been enough time to get meaningful feedback on the hook.) The article actually did not &quot;[tell] the whole story&quot; until I edited it at 07:20. 
@Sandy: yes, when I left that comment I meant to refer to ikipedia:Main Page/Errors which I had found through a link from DYK. I did leave a message there [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Did_you_know&amp;diff=586612308&amp;oldid=586573231 later] though. ser:Sunrise|Sunrise (ser talk:Sunrise|talk) 23:12, 18 December 2013 (UTC)

I have notified the creator. We need to keep in mind that list criteria are extremely broad. We have a parallel situation at ist of scientists opposing the mainstream scientific assessment of global warming. In an overall sense, we have an undue weight issue, but I'm not sure that counts on the creation of lists. It does place all the fringies in one place. Maybe we need one for all the homeopathetics ) NOT. Maybe a case could be built using the rulings on improper fork articles. I assume they would apply to lists as well. -- ser:BullRangifer|Brangifer (ser talk:BullRangifer|talk) 23:20, 18 December 2013 (UTC)

**That &quot;known for&quot; is a nice turn to exclude the incidentals, but the included lists don't seem to use it in their titles. Even so, these lists present a real-world problem. They tend to lock people into the position once uttered, making it more difficult for them to change that position in the face of new information or even new understanding of existing information. We also have no way of knowing when they do change their minds unless they choose to publish that. Ultimately they come down to a strange sort of rgument from authority. These lists should be nuked from orbit.ser:LeadSongDog|LeadSongDog ser talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl! 17:43, 19 December 2013 (UTC)
