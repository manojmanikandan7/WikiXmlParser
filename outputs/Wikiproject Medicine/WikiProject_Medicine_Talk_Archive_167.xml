 Listing DSM and ICD diagnostic criteria 

I'm currently trying to update an article and I wanted to add the ICD-11 and DSM-5 criteria and specifications for the disorder. I was wondering how to list the criteria without any copyright issues. I checked the discussion archives and wikipedia's manual of style and I can't seem to find a clear answer. Any advice would be appreciated.  ser:CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath|CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (ser talk:CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath|talk) 04:35, 1 August 2023 (UTC)

Welcome, @ser:CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath|CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath.  Is this related to alk:Somatic symptom disorder#Incorrect and potentially damaging description of the disorder?  I'm not at all familiar with the changes to that disorder in recent years, and from the description on the talk page, it sounds like if a breast cancer patient is really upset about losing her hair to chemotherapy, then that's now &quot;somatic symptom disorder&quot; ...and that sounds unreasonable, so I suspect that I'm wrong and can't be much help to you with the content for the article.
What I can help you with is the copyright question.  You shouldn't put the complete word-for-word criteria into the article.  Firstly, it's likely illegal, and secondly, the DSM is not exactly a stellar example of the best, most encyclopedic writing style.  So what you want to do is to completely re-write the description, from the ground up, in a way that never contradicts the DSM's criteria but which explains them more fully.  So, for example, since things have changed, you might decide to emphasize that the DSM-5 criteria have substantially changed (=not in their criteria at all).  To clarify the difference between people worried about having a heart attack for an hour or two last weekend and people with SSD, you might foreground that that it is normal for this to be a long-term, chronic condition (equivalent to their &quot;typically more than 6 months&quot; language).  You can describe the criteria in your own words, trying to make them clear for the typical case.  For example, instead of &quot;A. One or more somatic symptoms that are distressing or result in significant disruption of daily life&quot;, I might write something like &quot;People with somatic symptom disorder experience somatic (bodily) ymptoms, such as ain or atigue, that are distressing or disruptive enough to interfere with their everyday lives.&quot;  You can also add an explanation of the old criteria (be sure to cite it!) and its connection to ain disorder.  (I'd omit the severity ratings, as they're neither necessary to understand it nor core encyclopedic content.) ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 19:47, 1 August 2023 (UTC)
For context I stumbled upon SSD while looking through the Category:All pages needing cleanup|All pages needing cleanup category and as i started researching i realized how outdated and inaccurate the wiki for SSD was. After gathering most of my info I checked the talk page and noticed others had some good points but there was a lot of misinformation on the talk page so I didn't pay too much attention to it. And yes someone being upset about the effects of a disorder is most definitely not SSD. 
The reason why I felt like the DSM and ICD criteria is so relevant to SSD in particular is because of how vague it is and the controversial changes between the DSM-4 and the DSM-5. I would like to specifically highlight the differences between the ICD and DSM criteria as well as the changes made from the DSM-4 and DSM-5 criteria. My idea was to write something along the lines of &quot;the DSM-4 required &quot;a history of pain related to at least four different sites or functions&quot; while the DSM-5 only requires &quot;one or more somatic symptoms that are distressing or result in significant disruption of daily life.&quot; However that involves putting word-for-word criteria.
I also wanted to add the specifications for the DSM-5 criteria as the DSM-4 didn't have any specifications. 
Another thing I wanted to write about is how different the ICD criteria is from the DSM. I'm less worried about copyright here because the ICD is creative commons, however I know that listing things word-for-word from non-copyright material is still frowned upon.
Usually I would just omit the criteria because I'm not very knowledgeable on the specifics of copyright and I don't want to risk anything with it, however I do feel that the ICD and DSM criteria is very relevant in this specific circumstance.  ser:CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath|CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (ser talk:CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath|talk) 00:01, 2 August 2023 (UTC)
@ser:CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath|CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (I like your username), 
When the specific wording matters, then it makes sense to quote that (little) bit.  However, it's very unlikely that all of the exact wording will ever matter.
You can usually describe the differences without necessarily using the exact wording, too.  Consider something like &quot;the DSM-4 had restrictive criteria, including a requirement that the person be experiencing pain in at least four separate places or bodily functions, whereas the DSM-4 not only eliminates the requirement to have four separate pain points, it also accepts non-pain symptoms&quot; (or whatever the actual facts are).  The key thing to watch out for is that you're not doing the compare-and-contrast yourself, because if you do, someone will complain about P:SYNTH.  There should be eview articles and similar sources that talk about the change (also about the DSM vs ICD conceptions), and you will want to cite at least one of them.   ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 01:14, 2 August 2023 (UTC)
Thanks so much this is really helpful. I’ve found quite a few review articles on the criteria however those fit better in the controversy section however I’m going to look for some articles specifically highlighting the differences between ICD and DSM criteria.  ser:CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath|CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (ser talk:CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath|talk) 01:50, 2 August 2023 (UTC)

 Unbelievably persistent refspammer 

I have been following for several years the actions of a Czech user who is a biomedical researcher. Every single time he publishes a new piece of primary research, he inserts a reference to it, often into multiple Wikipedia articles, usually in the form of confident statements that do not allow for the possibility that the research findings may be tentative. Every single reference to any paper co-authored by Marek Mraz, and virtually every one for Sarka Pospisilova, is added from an IP at the institution where he works, or geolocated close by. I tried for a long time to get some kind of engagement, but talk page messages were completely ignored.  He is, by all accounts, a reputable researcher, but this is obvious P:COI and self-promotion. He publishes an email address, but to contact him and ask him to suggest on Talk rather than continually adding his own primary research would almost certainly violate Wikipedia policy.
I collected these before giving up on recording them.

 Pandemic's over! (redux) 
ile:Coronavirus. SARS-CoV-2.png|right|60px
There's a RfC[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:COVID-19_pandemic#RFC_on_current_consensus_#18] about having Wikipedia say the COVID-19 pandemic is over and that it should be referred to in the past tense. Med editors may find this of interest. ser:Bon courage|Bon courage (ser talk:Bon courage|talk) 17:11, 31 July 2023 (UTC)
More precisely, it is about overturning an old &quot;consensus item&quot; from the talk page. According to the RfC's OP at least, the RfC is for &quot;either a new standard first line or to allow for the editor liberty to later decide one&quot;. Even if the item is removed, it would still require a new consensus to change the text of the article to past tense. An odd technical point perhaps, but worth pointing out IMO. ser:Crossroads|Crossroads ser talk:Crossroads|-talk- 23:53, 31 July 2023 (UTC)
Right - the gist is that Wikipedia should take a project-wide stand against the WHO (which it shall deem unreliable in the light of what many newspapers are saying), and make all references across the encyclopedia refer to the COVID-19 pandemic in the past tense. ser:Bon courage|Bon courage (ser talk:Bon courage|talk) 05:29, 1 August 2023 (UTC)
It's not about a stance against the WHO, but it is in part a question of 'if WHO officials refer to it as a pandemic and nobody else does, what is it?' ser:Crossroads|Crossroads ser talk:Crossroads|-talk- 23:42, 4 August 2023 (UTC)
Your question would be better as &quot;if relevant scientists call it a pandemic and newspapers don't, who do we follow?&quot; A scientist like ans Kluge (who we cite) has a position with the WHO because he is a prominent and experienced scientist (not just some 'official'). The view of the WHO are built on international committees of relevant scientists. This is why the WHO is a strong MEDRS and the whole anti-WHO vibe from editors who are aping a US far-right position, doesn't count. ser:Bon courage|Bon courage (ser talk:Bon courage|talk) 09:59, 5 August 2023 (UTC)
q|US far-right position is inaccurate and completely unnecessary politicization. The problem with characterizing these quotes as &quot;view of the WHO&quot; is that the WHO as a body simply does not have a mechanism for labeling something as a pandemic. It's an expert opinion, sure, and someone could try to make the case that it's more weighty than usual because he is a WHO official, but that's it. A position paper by the WHO put together by an &quot;international committee&quot; about whether the term applies would be of much interest, but such a thing has never and will never exist. ser:Crossroads|Crossroads ser talk:Crossroads|-talk- 00:36, 6 August 2023 (UTC)
 I tend to trust scientific experts more when they write systematic reviews than when they reply to talk show hosts on twitter, being employed by a public health body trying to ensure compliance with its recommendations is probably half-way between these two extremes. This is more a question of bias than expertise, scientists funded by pharmaceutical companies who plan to sell the drugs they research may well be very good scientists, and yet perhaps we would prefer someone else's opinions. This argument seems quite similar to the systematic review versus professional guideline argument which [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Identifying_reliable_sources_(medicine)/Archive_11#RfC_on_adding_the_following_wording is not  new]. Regarding far-right positions, I'm not sure forming one's views based on the scientific views of extreme groups is a good approach. Nazis do occassionally believe things that are true - such as when they ran public health campaigns against smoking before the rest of the world - it just so happened that they also said that smoking could cause deterioration of the Aryan race... ser:Talpedia|Talpedia 00:48, 6 August 2023 (UTC) 
* It would probably be fair to say that we are beyond the &quot;acute phase&quot; of the COVID-19 pandemic. I notice today that Adam Kucharski[https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/kucharski.adam] is quoted in the Guardian[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/05/uk-almost-flying-blind-on-covid-this-autumn-experts-say] as saying &quot;the UK is no longer in the phase of pandemic where rapid actions are being taken&quot; and the invocation of such phasing is in-line with what the WHO[https://apps.who.int/iris/rest/bitstreams/1508359/retrieve], EU CDC, etc say. But saying the pandemic is &quot;over&quot; seems like a political proclamation adrift of how epidemiologists view the matter. ser:Bon courage|Bon courage (ser talk:Bon courage|talk) 11:47, 5 August 2023 (UTC)
 Kucharski clearly doesn’t want to be associated with the conspiracy theorists who refuse to accept the reality that the pandemic is over. I note that one such nutter from WHO even proclaimed that this pandemic isn’t over until the next one starts. LOL! However, you misquote Kucharski. The Guardian paraphrased him, so we don’t know precisely what he said. pecial:Contributions/169.155.228.119|169.155.228.119 (ser talk:169.155.228.119|talk) 15:00, 5 August 2023 (UTC)

Thanks, |WhatamIdoing. Oxygen toxicity is FA, and I was not involved in the FAC, but have been doing maintenance. Currently it is listed as Emergency medicine, which seems relatively unlikely. It is definitely encountered in Hyperbaric and Diving medicine, in both forms, and in Neonatal medicine in the effects on eye development, all discussed in the article, but I would have thought most emergencies would not continue long enough for pulmonary oxygen toxicity to be a problem, and acute toxicity does not occur at normal atmospheric pressure. |Doc James should be able to clarify on Emergency medicine, but if we have a Hyperbaric or Diving medicine specialist in the project, they have kept a low profile. An anesthetist may also have some useful input. My opinion is that Diving, Hyperbarics and Neonatal should be added, but have no useful opinion on whether Emergency should be kept, and whether there is a respiratory specialisation that should be considered regarding pulmonary toxicity in long term supplementary oxygen therapy.Original discussion at alk:Oxygen toxicity#Additional medical specialties involved in dealing with oxygen toxicity.

The article on autistic burnout is well-sourced with recent literature and the topic has been covered outside of the academic literature as well, eg by the NYT, seconding its notability.

I'm not interested in continuing discussions with you.

I don't see anything there that indicates that the specific quotation in ARFID, which has been there since 2014, is problematic.

ser:TempusTacet|TempusTacet, I'm coming a bit late to this discussion. Don't know if is resolved for you. I recall the issues way back with DSM. There is a link above. I think this explanation is best: q|&quot;The problem for the WMF is that material that may be fair use in one article becomes a different issue in aggregate. If we replicate their diagnostic criteria in each article related to the disorders, it seems like we could wind up reproducing the entire book--or at least most of it--which is decidedly not fair use&quot;. Copyright is complex and not very rational at times and Wikipedia often has to err on the side of &quot;if in doubt, leave it out&quot;. The community accepted the advice we got way back in 2010 and I don't think the matter is up for negotiation. -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 18:02, 30 July 2023 (UTC)
Thanks, ser:Colin|Colin. There's certainly a difference between copying entire diagnostic criteria and accompanying texts, which is unfortunately done frequently on Wikipedia, and citing specific parts of diagnostic criteria within context, though. The former doesn't make sense from an encyclopedic perspective anyway, so the question whether this is allowed legally doesn't need to be raised, but the latter is definitely fine even without invoking fair use. I've checked with the plagiarism/copyright folks over here and there is no issue with quoting copyrighted works as long as one is engaging with the quote, ie it's not just done to reproduce an entire text/work. (Aside from that, the diagnostic criteria make up just a small part of the DSM, so the fear that the entire book would be reproduced on Wikipedia is unfounded, and it's questionable whether diagnostic criteria meet the threshold of originality.) Do you happen to know who Wikipedia's contact at the APA is/was? Might be worth clarifying what their current position is. They've either given up tracking down even reproductions of diagnostic criteria or changed their approach/focus, also considering that the DSM-5 is [https://archive.org/details/diagnosticstatis0005unse/page/n9/mode/2up apparently available for free here] and all DSM-5 criteria we're talking about here are part of [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519708/pdf/Bookshelf_NBK519708.pdf this public domain publication] by the ubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.

Nor why you think finding a DSM 5 document on the internet made it legally free or that this makes the text public domain. Even if DSM 5 were published at no cost, that doesn't make it public domain text. There are very good reasons why a body like that would insist on retaining full copyright control. For example, so nobody can publish text purporting to be DSM 5 but actually altered to say something different. TempusTacet, I'm not getting any &quot;oh I'm interacting with a world expert on copyright&quot; vibes. More just someone who's done some googling and thinks everyone else is wrong.

This is difficult to parse on its own, and I see a number of references to past actions, statements, etc. of which I am unaware or to which I do not have access.  Notwithstanding that disadvantage, perhaps the following observations will be of some use (I've tried to present it in a digestible form, so forgive the tortured format--it is meant only to serve that goal}:
*I do not see the basis for the purport that [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519708/pdf/Bookshelf_NBK519708.pdf this publication] is in the public domain:  
#The fourth page includes: &quot;This publication was developed for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ), by RTI International, a trade name of Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, under Contract No. HHSS283201000003C&quot; (underlining added).  While the SAMHSA is a public agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the RTI is an independent NPO to which [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/105 17 U.S.C. § 105] (which I assume is what was being implicitly invoked) would not be expected to apply.

#The public domain assertion has the appearance of being the &quot;Government hosting&quot; misconception referenced in the ikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2008-08-11/Dispatches|free images dispatch; we would need additional information (e.g., What are the terms of Contract No. HHSS283201000003C?  Did the federal government receive, but then release copyright?) to assess this document.
*The specific work, or portion thereof, being discussed (text sought to be included) is unclear to me.  If we are discussing &quot;diagnostic criteria and accompanying texts,&quot; there may be a legitimate possibility that the former could be ineligible for copyright as facts of the world.
#Originality is “the bedrock principle of copyright” and “the very premise of copyright law.” (Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., Inc., 499 U.S. 340, 347 (1991))
#To quote [https://copyright.gov/comp3/chap300/ch300-copyrightable-authorship.pdf the Copyright Office], lazily and verbatim: &quot;'No one may claim originality as to facts ... because facts do not owe their origin to an act of authorship.' Feist, 499 U.S. at 347 (internal citation omitted). A person who finds and records a particular fact does not create that fact; he or she merely discovers its existence. As a result, facts 'are never original' and Section 102(b) of the Copyright Act 'is universally understood to prohibit any copyright in facts.' Id. at 356. '[This] is true of all facts – scientific, historical, biographical, and news of the day.' Id. at 348&quot;)
#Similarly, &quot;Section 102(b) of the Copyright Act expressly excludes copyright protection for 'any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.'&quot;
#Again, I have no clue what the referenced diagnostic criteria are, and thus whether originally expressed.  (If this were a news report, I would be reading the title, not the article--this is not the domain of the intellectually honest; I am entertaining a hypothetical to assist those with genuine relevant knowledge.)

@ser:Elcobbola|Elcobbola, to give you a bit of an idea of what the referenced criteria look like, entries begin with a section called &quot;Diagnostic criteria&quot;, which is typically in list form, followed by paragraphs of explanation on subjects like &quot;Subtypes&quot; and &quot;Diagnostic features&quot;.  (I assume that everything after the criteria section is what's being called &quot;accompanying texts&quot; above.)
Looking at the criteria alone, the entries are variable in size, but mostly they are on the longer side.  Sometimes a whole diagnosis could get just a single paragraph (especially if it's basically a variation on the preceding item or a catch-all item like &quot;Other specified mental disorder&quot;), but the criteria for ipolar I disorder take up almost four pages; ADHD is two pages; PTSD is three and a half pages – and that's just the list of diagnostic criteria alone.  Other lists of diagnostic criteria (e.g., for nuresis, ica (disorder)|Pica, xcoriation disorder) are half a page or less.  
Even though the criteria are in list form, the list items themselves are usually sentence-length.  The PTSD criteria for adults, for example, has criteria A through H, and five of those eight items have their own sub-lists.  Most of the list items are not obviously simple facts (like &quot;normal value is above 2 µg/mL&quot;); for example, from the PTSD adult criteria, there is item E3, t|&quot;Hypervigilance&quot;, which could be a simple fact, but there is also item E1, t|&quot;Irritable behavior and angry outbursts (with little or no provocation) typically expressed as verbal or physical aggression toward people or objects&quot; or from the criteria for young children, A2, t|&quot;Witnessing, in person, the event(s) as it occurred to others, especially primary caregivers.  Note:  Witnessing does not include events that are witnessed only in electronic media, television, movies, or pictures&quot;, both of which I would assume were copyrightable content if I saw them in RecentChanges.  (We could, after all, re-write those descriptions in other words with no significant loss in meaning.)  Then there is the question of whether assembling and organizing multiple items, often amounting to hundreds of words, into a description could be considered &quot;unoriginal&quot;.  
From paging around in the book, these longer, descriptive items are more typical than single-word criteria, but it depends on the subject.  More &quot;biological&quot; disorders, such as drug withdrawal symptoms (&quot;hand tremor, insomnia, nausea, vomiting...&quot;) might tend to be more likely to have criteria that could be considered a list of simple facts.  (On the other hand, we wouldn't prefer the DSM for that kind of content, which can be found in any textbook about emergency medicine.)  Some of them also have very short lists of criteria (one of the entries on sleep apnea amounts to &quot;The sleep clinic says they have sleep apnea&quot; plus &quot;symptoms of sleep apnea&quot;, though they use four times as many words to say that), but overall I'd feel very comfortable advising editors that they should assume that copying and pasting the entire list of diagnostic criteria for any DSM entry was a violation of our ikipedia:Copyright violations policy unless and until proven otherwise. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 19:09, 1 August 2023 (UTC)
I'm disappointed in Elcobbola's reply. Firstly a quick look at some diagnostic criteria (as noted, the text is findable on the internet with some googling) would confirm they are generally complex and more importantly, are the clever invention of DSM and the folk that feed into their work. An actual psychiatric disorder itself is a human invention that is essentially defined by its diagnostic criteria. In the next edition, two disorders could be merged into one, or one could be split into three. New ones added, disputed ones removed. These are not merely descriptions of eternal facts, like the height of a mountain, or what the symptoms of a cold are. DSM have authority to invent/modify/delete psychiatric and some neurological conditions, though there are other authorities who may disagree.
Secondly, I am criticised for making an rgument from authority fallacy. This from someone summoned here on the basis of their esteemed authority. Why should you care to tell us that you think little of Godwin other than you feel their authority is undeserved: &quot;an intellectual property expert Godwin is not&quot; is not a legal argument but a dismissal of their authority as an &quot;expert&quot;. Authority matters. Nobody would care to listen to random-editor's opinion of Godwin.  Our problem on Wikipedia with legal issues is that anyone can turn up and start making claims. Look I found this on the internet! It must therefore be not only legally free but public domain. Some claims are straightforwardly clueless. But others we have to trust the explanation our apparent expert is making is taken on trust. Maybe Elcobbola doesn't find themselves needing to take anyone's explanation on trust, but all the rest of us do. The actual legal arguments only take us so far.  -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 13:55, 2 August 2023 (UTC)

The short answer is: Yes. The main question seems to be the title of the article, &quot;meltdown&quot; is mostly used from a therapeutic/pedagogical perspective eg by parents or teachers, to describe a range of behaviors. It is not a medical or psychiatric term. (Similar to &quot;timming&quot;.)--ser:TempusTacet|TempusTacet (ser talk:TempusTacet|talk) 21:50, 27 July 2023 (UTC)
The long answer is no; see alk:Autistic meltdown for a full-day's work. The only good sources explain and put it in context as a colloquialism for other behaviors.  And in the last few weeks to month, several just like this have popped up, usually with not a single MEDRS source. The autism walled garden has been growing in the ten or so years since Eubulides left, and Colin and I gave up on the entire suite. Stimming is quite a recognized and defined thing, covered in legions of secondary reviews; this is not.

Table 1 in the literature review of [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8595127/ this paper] has a couple of citations on meltdown and shutdown, though it mentions that what it considers to be the overall topic of &quot;Burnout, Inertia, Meltdown, and Shutdown (BIMS)&quot; has had little formal study. From a quick search on Google Scholar, there are a few other papers that are using the same BIMS acronym, so we might want to consider this as a single broader topic instead of three or four discrete ones when searching for secondary sources. Of course the paper I've just cited is a primary source, as it is another interview based one similar to those in the subsections below.

Best I can tell, the sources they link are all primary, and not of the highest quality kind (generally, the methodology can be summed up as interviewing or surveying autistic people, sometimes online, hence highly biased). b  But this is very helpful and does point to a possible solution until/unless some good sources become available -- merging all of them to one article on BIMS, to at least control the proliferation of poorly sourced content. ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  19:28, 28 July 2023 (UTC)

|SandyGeorgia That's true, however the value of this paper is in the content and citations in the introduction section. I've not been able to find any sort of meta-analysis or systematic review on either the individual components of BIMS or BIMS as a whole, but I've not had a lot of time to check (been busy with life and other discussions on an unrelated guideline expansion/rewrite). All that I have been able to find are brief contextual literature reviews in the initial sections of papers such as the one I linked above.

Have you looked for textbooks?  &quot;Do kids with autism sometimes have meltdowns?&quot; is not really the kind of thing I'd expect to find a meta-analysis for.  DSM-5 (p. 160) says &quot;In addition, children with autism spectrum disorders frequently present with temper outbursts when, for example, their routines are disturbed&quot;, so it's possible that searching under alternative terms (&quot;temper outbursts&quot; is defined on p. 860) would help. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:19, 16 August 2023 (UTC)
I've not had a chance to look through textbooks yet, the guideline discussions have been taking up a lot of my attention. I'd be wary about conflating meltdowns with temper outbursts though. While they may look similar to outside observers, as autistic individuals and most support/advocacy organisations describe them they are distinct things. That might not be something that's been picked up on in academic literature yet however.
I might have to find a copy of the DSM-5 though. I've got the 5-TR, and while it does have the text you quoted, on page 182, unless I've missed it it doesn't seem to have a definition for &quot;temper outbursts&quot; later in it.

ccupational burnout is going to remain a mess unless and until the real world decides what they want that condition to encompass.

That article, and several others around workplace stress, have been the site of a long-term war between an editor and a persistent sock, both of whom have real-world expertise in workplace psychology.  While it's a mess, I don't think that the relative absence of WPMED folks is really the biggest problem.  Also, it's not tagged for WPMED, but even if it were, it still wouldn't be one of ikipedia:WikiProject Medicine/Popular pages|our most-read articles, so WPMED folks who were looking for a project might not prioritize that one. 
I do wish that the articles around autism, which are extremely popular, were in better shape, but I understand that the major change to the definition a while back prompted a dearth of high-quality up-to-date sources.

This kind of editing is seen across all autism articles.

Yes, it appears so ...

But if you look at this recent (2023) spate of articles, there are both kinds of walled gardens (little broad community input, generally one editor, and a series of articles that basically link to each other). ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  18:17, 28 July 2023 (UTC)
The last time I looked at any of the autism articles in depth was during a alk:Autism_spectrum/Archive_4#Merger_proposal;_Outdated_terminology/taxonomy|merge proposal between the utism, sperger's syndrome, and utism spectrum articles between February and April 2022. While that did eventually lead to utism being merged into utism spectrum as the state of the literature didn't really consider those to be separate entities any longer, there's still a bunch of articles in the autism spectrum template that need updating, trimming, merging, and deleting as contextually appropriate. 
Unfortunately the enormity of the task, along with more than a little distraction, has left me feeling overwhelmed at even contemplating tackling it. I wouldn't even know where to begin right now. I'm more than happy to help out, but I think we might need to plan this out because of how many articles are a problem here. ser:Sideswipe9th|Sideswipe9th (ser talk:Sideswipe9th|talk) 18:38, 28 July 2023 (UTC)
|Sideswipe9th the task is doable if enough WP:MED-knowledgeable editors care.  And the way to do it is just the way that Eubulides and I did it a decade ago, when we had two editors creating a walled garden of POV advocacy and non-notable topics. I put all the articles in to a chart (since moved to Eubulides' user space) to help us prioritize our work, as there was so much to do.  Then we started chipping away at them, prioritizing the least important and least viewed 'til last. b You can look at almost any one of these articles and see that huge swatches can be simply removed (over quoting, copyvio, no MEDRS sources, failure to use P:SS etc).  b Your [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1167598101 BIMS (Burnout, Inertia, Meltdown, Shutdown) post above] is a good starting point re the walled garden, creating multiple articles on one as-yet-to-be-MEDRS-sourced concept. A huge part of the problem is that so many editors gave up on the suite years ago, and it has all deteriorated, in spite of autism being a highly viewed topic/page. ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  19:21, 28 July 2023 (UTC)
q| I put all the articles in to a chart (since moved to Eubulides' user space) to help us prioritize our work, as there was so much to do That would be perfect. After being hit by the autism and ADHD double whammy, my working memory is awful, and when a task is this large it's super easy to get overwhelmed. Any sort of structure on this would be immensely helpful. 
q|You can look at almost any one of these articles and see that huge swatches can be simply removed Yeah, I fully agree. There's also a fair amount of outdated content, and what could best be described as &quot;legacy articles&quot; that are out of sync with the current state of the literature as the terminology has moved on.

 Sample 2 (Autism and memory) 
Another example of the kind of editing spreading throughout the autism suite:  utism and memory.b The aticle relies on many primary sources, and P:MEDDATE|extremely dated secondary reviews, and yet a recent review, MID|37431322 states that &quot;None of the studies found a significant association between WM and ASD symptoms&quot; and several reviews indicate that results are mixed.  So we have more than 3,000 dated words, that could probably be reduced to a 100 as part of the main article, if written correctly using recent reviews.  What is happening across the suite is that people are using primary and dated sources to synthesize articles-- not understanding that what you may do in a research paper, you may not do on Wikipedia.  Another article that should be P:TNT|gutted and re-written to recent secondary sources.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  13:59, 29 July 2023 (UTC)

 Costs of surgical procedures 


I reverted this unsourced [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Appendectomy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1170528416 edit ]. There will be a cost associated with the procedure, but in the UK most people will benefit from the structure of social medicine. Should we be stating the costs of (any) surgical procedures, which will become quickly outdated anyway? - Thoughts please. ser:CV9933|CV9933 (ser talk:CV9933|talk) 12:40, 16 August 2023 (UTC)

Agree that cost to the patient is not the same a cost to the facility. Just the other week, I boldly removed ara|costs from l|infobox medical intervention following a merge of two variant infoboxes. Have now found the RfC I was recalling in my [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3AInfobox_medical_intervention&amp;diff=1168350975&amp;oldid=1167539646 edit summary]: P:MEDMOS2020 Whilst I admittedly misremembered the RfC's scope (pharmaceuticals) and the certainty of the outcome (&quot;generally opposed&quot; for inclusion), it doesn't alter the point I was making about there being widely different procedure costs in a global healthcare economy. 13:57, 16 August 2023 (UTC) ser:Little pob|Little pob (ser talk:Little pob|talk) 13:57, 16 August 2023 (UTC)
I think this sort of information should be covered in articles on the relevant country's healthcare system, and to the degree that sources feel appropriate when discussing the healthcare system. I don't think it belongs in articles on surgical procedures (or drugs, for which we had an RFC) as the information not only quickly dates as you say, but is extremely difficult to convey correctly to the reader. Look at the US paragraphs in that section of the article. What does it mean by &quot;cost&quot; or &quot;charge&quot;?
The first set of sentences are dealing with what appeared on the bill. That bill may have been paid by insurance, if they have it, who then negotiate their own discounts, and the amount the patient paid is not given. Thus the bill figure may sometimes be an entirely irrelevant number that no person or organisation actually paid. The $182,955 bill apparently came for a woman who also had cancer, though according to the source, their actual treatment was no more complex than the $1,529 bill to another patient at another hospital. Does the first really indicate that patients with cancer are hugely over-charged for routine surgery? We can't know. It seems perhaps that the bill is set by &quot;what we think we can get away with&quot; rather than by anything actually related to &quot;appendicitis&quot;. The article gives a median but we don't say how these prices spread or why, and outliers are rarely informative other than to make one's eyes boggle. This is raw data, that doesn't IMO belong in a tertiary source like an encyclopaedia. And does this data from 2009 still apply today, several governments later. I don't think this serves our readers at all. Unlike a newspaper, where any figures given will at least be recent and relevant to their readers, here they are not.
The latter sentences, with the $7,800 and $12,800 figures, are an estimate of the cost to the hospital of doing the procedure, in 2010, but calculated by taking the charge (bill) and applying a hospital-wide cost-to-charge ratio. How good that estimate it is perhaps debatable. It seems the purpose of this estimate is to say &quot;The total cost for perforated appendix discharges was more than 50 percent higher than all appendicitis discharges&quot;. That might be a reasonable comment in this article, and less likely to date, but the actual numbers, no. It may well be that after reading the article, the reader will already know that a perforated appendix is a big extra complication, and so could probably have guessed it costs more. -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 14:06, 16 August 2023 (UTC)
For surgical procedures, I think it is more relevant to say that it usually takes one hour, or a team of 4 people, or other &quot;universal&quot; facts that affect the cost, than to say that at one point in time, in one place, one person paid some amount.  That won't point directly towards an amount of money, but we can all see that a one-hour, two-person procedure is going to cost less than one of those 18-hour, multi-team marathons. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:43, 16 August 2023 (UTC)
Some good points raised above and I noticed that there was an intention to add advice [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style/Medicine-related_articles here] on how to present costs .

Not really?  There's a distinction between medical &quot;advice&quot; and medical &quot;information&quot;.  Advice is saying &quot;You (you personally, not just some people, or people in general) should walk one hour every evening after dinner&quot;.  Information is saying &quot;People who have ERD often sleep better if they go for a long walk every evening after dinner&quot;.
Given that, I don't think that there is a problem with actual medical advice.  However, I'm not wild about the style.

Taurine

The aurine article had heavy traffic back in June after American and British newspapers misrepresented some non-clinical studies making far-fetched headlines claiming that taurine has been shown to reduce aging in humans. However, the study that the media had cited actually took much of its data from mice studies [https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn9257], the paper is &quot;Taurine deficiency as a driver of aging&quot;. This is clearly a primary source making biomedical claims, it is not a reliable secondary source. It is not a review paper. The data the paper cites does not cite clinical data from human trials. It says &quot;Taurine supplementation improved life span in mice and health span in monkeys&quot;.

I believe the paper should be removed. Currently the line &quot;taurine levels are inversely-associated with aging-related diseases in humans&quot;, has been inserted into the lead. ser:Psychologist Guy|Psychologist Guy (ser talk:Psychologist Guy|talk) 14:31, 26 August 2023 (UTC)

A line was also previously added to the &quot;Physiology and nutrition in non-human animals&quot; section which reads &quot;A study published in 2023 suggests that the blood concentration of taurine declines during the aging process, as measured in mice, monkeys, and humans&quot;. However, one of the paper also listed here is [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37289872/] which is not on humans, it discusses studies on mice and monkeys. There is not any good clinical data for humans, I believe the content about humans should be removed. We do not have enough human data on this topic so far to be making claims about aged-related diseases. ser:Psychologist Guy|Psychologist Guy (ser talk:Psychologist Guy|talk) 14:36, 26 August 2023 (UTC)
 To cite the abstract of &quot;Taurine deficiency as a driver of aging&quot;, &quot;taurine deficiency may be a driver of aging because its reversal increases health span in worms, rodents, and primates and life span in worms and rodents. Clinical trials in humans seem warranted to test whether taurine deficiency might drive aging in humans&quot; [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37289866/]. Because of the lack of clinical data, I believe we should remove these papers from the article as they are being used incorrectly in regard to humans. ser:Psychologist Guy|Psychologist Guy (ser talk:Psychologist Guy|talk) 14:46, 26 August 2023 (UTC)

Thanks for the reply. The article has now be cleaned with the outdated and incorrect information removed. Interestingly, just yesterday the media have published new articles on taurine [https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/25/taurine-supplements-may-lengthen-lifespan-heres-what-research-shows.html], this time the reporting is more accurate. I would not suggest including any news articles, I have not seen any that covered the misreporting. My understanding is that clinical trials are currently being done on taurine but we are in the early stages of research and it is going to be a long time until we have a good review of such trials. On the taurine talk-page you will see that one user still wants to include the paper &quot;Taurine deficiency as a driver of aging&quot;. ser:Psychologist Guy|Psychologist Guy (ser talk:Psychologist Guy|talk) 19:02, 27 August 2023 (UTC)

 Collagen VI 

Hello, there is some unattributed content in the Collagen VI page at the end of the sections Associated Disorders and Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy, Treatments, &quot;and the potential novel therapy of drinking molecular hydrogen water everyday, to prevent muscle atrophy.&quot;  I know enough to know that this is unproven and that there should be a proper reference to a scientific paper with such content and there isn't. I don't know how to add (says who) or the equivalent. Please would someone do so in both places. Thanks Dr Rick Nelms ser:DrRickZTTwo|DrRickZTTwo (ser talk:DrRickZTTwo|talk) 12:55, 26 August 2023 (UTC)

@ser:DrRickZTTwo|DrRickZTTwo, would you please ikipedia:Be bold and remove the inappropriate content?  It would be ideal if the good content had a source at the end (e.g., a medical textbook) but getting the inappropriate content out is more important.
Articles do sometimes have information about therapies that are being researched, but those should generally be in a separate section (usually called Research directions) so that it's clear these are not current or accepted treatments. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:22, 26 August 2023 (UTC)
@ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing Thank you for suggesting that I edit the text to remove the unproven and unreferenced material which I have done. I have a good reference from a 2023 meta-analysis published as free access through PubMed for the current treatment but I am too tired to work out how to make the reference work (I live with motor neurone disease and can only work in short stretches). So the published page is now corrected, and the reference to treatments currently available will get added sometime in the next 24 hours. ser:DrRickZTTwo|DrRickZTTwo (ser talk:DrRickZTTwo|talk) 01:12, 27 August 2023 (UTC)
@ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing I have now inserted the reference (using the cite dropdown in the edit toolbar) to physical therapy/surgery in the two places to which it refers (having worked out how to use reference name to avoid duplicating the reference), though I am unable to give a specific page number; in the pdf the information is on page 16 out of 22, but the PubMed online article there is no pagination. As a default I have given the published first page number, 5095. At least there is a good, relevant, freely available, up-to-date meta-analysis from a reputable peer-reviewed journal. I just went back in and added the PMC number in both places that gives the little green freely accessible padlock as I noticed it was missing from my first attempt. I also referred again to an existing reference which was relevant to the lack of therapeutics and added a reference to the Global Registry for COL6-related Dystrophies since it is registered with the International Trials system and therefore subject to ongoing peer evaluation, and aims to match up to 1000 people across the world with clinical trials.

@ser:DrRickZTTwo|DrRickZTTwo, you did great, thanks!  
For journal articles, we usually follow the old-fashioned approach of listing the full page range, assuming that there actually are any pages at all, but the first page number is fine, too.  If you ever encounter an unpaginated or online-only source, and you really want to point straight to a specific bit, then there is an optional |quote= parameter that you can use for a short quotation, and another called |at= that will let you put in things like section headings or descriptions like &quot;Caption for Figure 3&quot;. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 15:22, 28 August 2023 (UTC)
 Excellent suggestion about using ara|at.  Unfortunately ara|at conflicts with ara|page, one can use one or the other, but not both at the same time.

aturated fat

This topic has been raised before on this board regarding a problematic source, so apologises for going over old ground but input from some experienced users would be useful. Unfortunately it is always the same fringe sources that are being cited from the low-carb community on this topic. See talk-page discussion on saturated fat article regarding a 2017 meta-analysis from Steven Hamley which argues against scientific consensus. The Hamley meta-analysis has been cited before on Wikipedia talk-pages related to red meat and saturated fat. It was agreed that it is an unreliable source in at least 2 places, (I have lost where that conversation is, but it must be in the archive somewhere), I will try and find it but some familiar users here may remember those conversations.

The Hamley meta-analysis [https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-017-0254-5] challenges the findings of the Hooper 2012 meta-analysis [https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD002137.pub3/full]. The 2012 Hooper meta-analysis found a small effect, the Hamley meta-analysis found no significant effect. We have more recent and reliable data on this topic, so there is no reason to cite either of these sources.

There is a more on topic meta-analysis from Hooper which also contains a meta-regression [https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011737.pub3/full] from 2020, this source is high-quality and is cited on the saturated fat Wikipedia article. I suggest that we do not cite the Hamley meta-analysis, there are many reasons for this.

@ser:Psychologist Guy|Psychologist Guy, are you looking for ikipedia talk:WikiProject Medicine/Archive 152#Saturated Fat, shifting consensus, Cardiovascular disease (CVD), and general health or ikipedia talk:WikiProject Medicine/Archive 164#Salim Yusuf ?
It can be difficult to explain P:DUE weight to people who are convinced that they know The Truth™, but this is probably a question of due weight, rather than reliability per se.  You might be able to pound on P:MEDDATE if a short-term &quot;win&quot; is all you care about, but a P:YESPOV approach might solve the problem long-term.  That means saying that there is a current scientific consensus that saturated fat is harmful (to some degree), and that there is a significant minority viewpoint that saturated fat is likely neutral.  The idea is that recognizing the existence of their POV, in a neutral manner, might make them less likely to try to change the mainstream POV to match theirs.
I suggest citing reputable medical textbooks rather than journal articles whenever possible in this article.  Here are a few that might give you an idea of the options available:  [https://www.google.com/books/edition/Anatomy_and_Physiology/Sz8QEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=%22saturated+fat%22&amp;pg=PA43&amp;printsec=frontcover] [https://www.google.com/books/edition/Prevention_and_Management_of_Cardiovascu/Mai5EAAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;pg=PA140&amp;printsec=frontcover] [https://www.google.com/books/edition/Principles_of_Anatomy_and_Physiology/Xz8QEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=%22saturated+fat%22&amp;pg=PA49&amp;printsec=frontcover] [https://www.google.com/books/edition/Understanding_Normal_and_Clinical_Nutrit/TwfFDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=%22saturated+fat%22&amp;pg=PA59&amp;printsec=frontcover]   ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 21:38, 12 September 2023 (UTC)

 Chiropractic woo through the backdoor 
ile:Chiropractic spinal adjustment.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Chiropractic spinal adjustment
If you go read the article hiropractic, it says it’s a crap pseudoscience (well, in a different tone and with sources, but you get the idea). I suppose there are thousands of hawk-eyed editors watching it and all is fine.

Could any of those divert some attention to the article eterinary chiropractic? The tone there is, let’s say, more positive. The lead features all the classic hits:
*q|Veterinary chiropractic is a fast-developing field that is complementary to the conventional approach (Yes, there is a source. No, it is not MEDRS-compliant.)
*q|a holistic medical approach that focuses on restoring homeostasis in the body and allows for the body to naturally heal itself (ppeal to nature)
*It cannot be placebo, placebo does not work on animals. Yes it does. Many scholarly publications stopped using the term &quot;placebo effect&quot; and moved on to &quot;caretaker effect&quot;, precisely because &quot;placebo&quot; implies a false belief of the patient about the nature of the cure received. There’s a couple of studies demonstrating a caretaker effect in humans when the physician tells them, explicitly and clearly, that they are getting a sugar pill - but they went through the doctor’s office, examination, trip to the pharmacy etc. so they had the &quot;ritual of healing&quot; that triggers the caretaker effect. Rant over.
*It is not pseudoscientific bullshit. It is q|a controversial method due to limited evidence. Yes, for a Wikipedia editor that is synonymous, but not for the average reader.
ser:Tigraan|Tigraanser talk:Tigraan|Click here for my talk page (&quot;private&quot; contact) 13:51, 20 September 2023 (UTC)

Well...
The first statement is about how humans classify medicine, which is not ikipedia:Biomedical information, and therefore doesn't require a MEDRS &quot;ideal&quot; source.  Ditto &quot;holistic&quot;.  You might find ikipedia:Alternative medicine useful, if you haven't seen it before.
On the more general subject, the &quot;theory&quot; behind chiropractic is certainly non-scientific, but that doesn't mean that it is worthless in practice.  I could give you a nice pseudoscientific story about how your cell phone works, and your cell phone wouldn't stop working as a result (nor would it gain any new powers my story attributes to it – healing rays, maybe?). ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 03:21, 21 September 2023 (UTC)
You are right about the first statement. The problem isn’t P:MEDRS, it is P:WTW/P:NPOV. &quot;Holistic&quot; is a loaded term (= &quot;it’s a more natural/good/non-invasive treatment compared to Big Pharma’s awful chemicals&quot;). Even if it were not, it would still require a RS (which a scientific article in a shady journal by woo-peddlers isn’t).
As for the rest, yes, chiropractic &quot;is worthless in practice&quot;. By the definition of your essay, it is &quot;bad medicine&quot; (scientifically proven to not work, with an unhealthy dose of side-effects). At the risk of being rude I will not debate this; if you have good sources to the contrary, the article hiropractic is waiting for your edits. I am not interested in handling the articles myself either, because I know pseudoscience articles are a pain to maintain and my willpower is weak. ser:Tigraan|Tigraanser talk:Tigraan|Click here for my talk page (&quot;private&quot; contact) 14:30, 21 September 2023 (UTC)
I understand that whether chiropractic is worthless in practice depends on exactly what you're looking at (e.g., the woo-woo theory of vital forces vs spinal manipulation of the sort also practiced by non-chiropractors) and what you're comparing it against (e.g., chiropractic for chronic lower back pain is about as effective as opiods, and less risky to your overall health; if you wake up with a crick in your neck, chiropractic is faster but riskier [=stroke] than the conventional medical treatment of waiting for self-resolution and prescribing muscle relaxants if it doesn't sort itself out). 
I expect that article to be a battleground for our anti-woo warriors.  Chiropractic is popular in the US (the US has one chiropractor for every two internal medicine physicians), and it's an easy entry point for pushing the One True™ Scientific POV on wiki.   ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:14, 21 September 2023 (UTC)
The claim that chiropractic is at all effective for lower back pain is fairly weak sauce from my reading. Controlled studies show there is essentially no intervention that shows efficacy for lower back pain beyond any other, so it is questionable as to why chiropractic should be favored over, say, vanilla physical therapy, an exercise regimen, or a whole host of placebos. Is chiropractic better than an opioid addiction? Almost certainly. But so is homeopathy. Or breathwork. Or yoga. Or faith healing. ser:ජපස|jps (ser talk:ජපස|talk) 15:44, 22 September 2023 (UTC) 
Well, I have heard that the evidence is stronger for acute lower back pain than for chronic back pain, but I think the overall thing we need to remember is that neither pseudoscience nor alternative are fancy ways of spelling ineffective.  
Speaking of evidence-based medicine, henylephrine is in the news for being yet another piece of conventional medicine that doesn't actually work.

The data is pretty equivocal for both chronic and acute: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK66610/] I'm a bit curious about your argument that &quot;pseudoscience nor alternative are [not] fancy ways of spelling ineffective&quot;. While not all ineffective treatments are pseudoscientific or alternative, I am pretty sure all pseudoscientific and alternative treatments are ineffective -- at least given the published metrics. Granted, new discoveries are made all the time, but there is a pretty strong argument to be made that once a treatment that is considered part of &quot;alternative medicine&quot; is convincingly shown to be effective, it is typically no longer classified as &quot;alternative&quot;. ser:ජපස|jps (ser talk:ජපස|talk) 18:13, 23 September 2023 (UTC)
&quot;Alternative&quot; is a social classification, rather than a medical one.  Home births are alternative in the US.  They are conventional in the Netherlands.  Do you think that home births are ineffective? ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 19:21, 23 September 2023 (UTC)
I see a difference between an alternative social classification and lternative medicine. As far as I can tell, no one calls home births &quot;alternative medicine&quot;. ser:ජපස|jps (ser talk:ජපස|talk) 21:43, 23 September 2023 (UTC)
Different authors have different definitions of altmed.  If you look at it from the POV of what's an &quot;alternative&quot; to &quot;normal&quot;, then we'd see that the US medical system doesn't train physicians in out-of-hospital births, that US health insurance plans don't voluntarily pay for them (even when that would be cheaper than paying for a hospital-based birth), and that most people don't consider it to be the usual, normal, &quot;conventional&quot; thing to do.  If it's not &quot;conventional medicine&quot;, it's &quot;alternative medicine&quot;. 
AltMed definitions are often challenging to get right.  For example, the first detailed definition in the article says &quot;Alternative medicine is defined loosely as a set of products, practices, and theories that are believed or perceived by their users to have the healing effects of edicine, but whose fficacy|effectiveness has not been established using cientific method|scientific methods&quot;, and it includes everything in FDA-approved clinical trials, even though nobody actually thinks that these are altmed products.  Some common-sense health and safety measures, [https://www.bmj.com/content/363/bmj.k5094 like using parachutes] or like not swimming in lava, have not truly been established as effective through the scientific method, but we consider following those to be conventional.
On the other side, one can define altmed as &quot;anything that doesn't work&quot;, but that means that arthroscopic knee surgery for osteoarthritis is altmed and lack salve isn't, because that knee surgery does nothing, but black salve permanently cures about 10% of superficial skin cancers.  (The conventional medicine cure rate is above 98% and has much less scarring.) ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 22:21, 23 September 2023 (UTC)
Seems to me that en Goldacre's and dzard Ernst's approaches on the subject are more-or-less standard. I certainly don't think it's fair to define alternative medicine as &quot;anything that doesn't work&quot;. Alternative medicine relies on defenders who intentionally oppose mainstream medicine. Additionally, conventional medicine does not become alternative medicine even when it is inefficacious or when it lacks study backing (which, as you rightly point out, are not the same thing). Finally, &quot;alternative medicine&quot; as a matter of definition runs counter to mainstream medicine judgement. Crucially, mainstream medical judgement is not the same thing as &quot;what is done normally in medical practices&quot;. A lot of medical insurance, for example, actually pays for various forms of alternative medicine because the goal of medical insurance is insurance and not medicine. ser:ජපස|jps (ser talk:ජපස|talk) 03:26, 24 September 2023 (UTC)
I think it's difficult to make sweeping generalizations.  For example, usually disproven or less-effective or less-safe conventional medicine doesn't continue as altmed, but I can give you an example of exactly that happening in lack salve, which Ernst describes this way:  &quot;Black salve is said to originate from Native American tribes who used the paste as a treatment for a range of conditions.  It was adopted by conventional medicine about a century ago as a treatment for several skin problems.  When effective treatments became available, black salve became obsolete.  More recently, however, it has been re-discovered by SCAM-practitioners who recommend it as a natural treatment...&quot; ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 04:17, 25 September 2023 (UTC)
I'm sorry, I did not mean to imply that conventional medicine when shown to be less-effective or problematic cannot continue as alternative medicine. I totally agree with your example that black salve is more-or-less only used in the context alternative medicine. I can think of other similar examples like yrup of ipecac. What I was trying to say when I wrote q|conventional medicine does not become alternative medicine even when it is inefficacious or when it lacks study backing was that there are conventional practices that are in common use right now which are objectively ineffective and lack study backing, but that hasn't been recognized yet by the conventional medicine researchers and practitioners. Even though such practices have a lot in common with alternative medicine in terms of efficacy and study-backing, they don't become alternative medicine until the conventional medicine moves on their backers continue to argue in favor of the treatment in spite of that. ser:ජපස|jps (ser talk:ජපස|talk) 15:10, 25 September 2023 (UTC)

 Inclusion of service provider names in arm reduction 

I am arguing with Graywalls over whether or not it’s appropriate to link to nPoint NYC in the article arm reduction.

It is already in arm reduction in the United States. I believe the inclusion of specific named organization into the higher level broader article covering the concept is undue when it is already in the one for United States where the existence is more reasonable. It is just creating a coat rack of service providers. The article does not need to name specific safe consumption site that is the first, the largest, or the biggest.. or whatever in each country to fulfill encyclopedic purpose.

It looks like the discussion is at alk:Harm reduction#I have removed links to specific service providers, agencies, clinics.
Speaking generally, the English Wikipedia does not have a set pattern for this.  Sometimes we name one or two organizations (e.g., untington's disease, which names two US organizations).  A few articles, like reast cancer awareness, (correctly) name many organizations.  We are more likely to name notable organizations and organizations that are either major players (e.g., the merican Heart Association) or had some special significance (e.g., the first charity for that disease, the first hospital where research was done).  But there's no general requirement to name organizations.  Editors really do have to use their best judgment and come to an agreement about whether and how to mention an organization. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:11, 27 September 2023 (UTC)

 CALC and prevalences 

In the &quot;uber-rare chromosome disorders&quot; sphere, there's one subject that I previously considered inappropriate for an article, because it was so rare that there was no real sourcing to build on. In the past year, two additional cases have been discovered and reviews of the literature done when reporting them, so I think there's enough now to build a worthwhile/informative/usable article.

One problem: both reports give a confident statement of &quot;how many cases are known&quot;, but they don't seem aware the other exists, so their numbers don't fit (to be precise, they're both written assuming seven known cases, when CALCing their data gives eight). To make it stranger, the latter seems at least ambiguously aware of the former -- it states it's the &quot;third known case in the 21st century&quot; when their data would make it the second, so they're presumably aware there was another, but don't 'count' it even in the sense of mentioning &quot;an unpublished case&quot;.

Does CALC permit taking these and adding together for their prevalence (&quot;there are eight known cases of Ultrarare Syndrome&quot;)? The letter of CALC seems to me that it does, given it explicitly mentions things like &quot;CALC can use relatively complex mathematics&quot; (so not just the simple addition here) and &quot;if necessary you can show your work in a footnote&quot;, so pretty much any simple addition seems...fine, then?

Hi Tesleemah, welcome to WikiProject Medicine! If there's a particular article(s) you'd like to start working on, feel free to post it here and we're happy to help. As a medical student, you're in the unique position where you'll be reading and learning topics all across medicine. I'd encourage you as you learn new concepts/topics/diseases in school, to check our article on the topic and see if they're up-to-date and comprehensive. When you find articles that could use some updating (as you often will), feel free to find sources and update them yourself, or flag them here and folks will be happy to work with you to update them. Please keep in mind that since the biomedical literature is so vast and contains so much back-and-forth, we find medical textbooks and review articles to be more reliable sources for current medical info than primary research papers (summarized at P:MEDRS). Getting involved in a new topic will always result in some barriers and friction; as you hit challenges, just reach out and we'll do our best to help.

I've struck three of these. Clinistrip needed redirecting, yeah.

*:I just want to add that about 1 in 238 articles tagged by WikiProject Medicine are tagged as being completely unsourced.  For all of the English Wikipedia, it's 1 in 55 articles.  We are doing better than most, and I really think that we could get a source into nearly all of them.   ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 02:07, 26 September 2023 (UTC)

Please post if you couldn't find a source for any of the remaining articles.
