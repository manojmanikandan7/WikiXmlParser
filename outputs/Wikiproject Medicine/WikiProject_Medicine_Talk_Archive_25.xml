 Medical translation 

Had an excellent talk with ranslators Without Borders today.[http://translatorswithoutborders.com/] Both they and I are interested in working on a collaboration to translate medical articles first into simple English and then into other languages. Are there others here interested in helping? ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) 03:17, 15 December 2011 (UTC)

I'd be interested in translation to Slovene language (could also translate to simple English). How would the work go then? --ser:Eleassar|Eleassar ser talk:Eleassar|my talk 23:13, 15 December 2011 (UTC)

I have so far created this page ook:Health_care which is still a work in progress. I will than be moving a copy to simple English. This is currently simply a rearranged list of the top importance articles. Many of the top importance articles will also need improvement here on the main English wiki. Translation is being taken care of by translatorswithoutborders who I am sure could use help. If you email me I will add you email to the offline discussion. We are going to need people to not only translate but than to also Wikify and return to the appropriate language wiki. We also must make sure that the if the content already exists it is merged appropriately. This will require people involved in the medical aspects of the Wiki in question.ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) 02:40, 16 December 2011 (UTC)

It might be interesting to talk to the Google Project folks and see if they have feedback.  I have two different thoughts about initial targets:
* If you pick subjects that don't have corresponding articles, you're expanding the encyclopedia and you don't have to bother with merging.
* If you pick articles that are FA- or GA-quality, then you'll be pretty confident that you're translating something worth keeping.
Also, translating just introductions is a quick way to expand things.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 19:06, 16 December 2011 (UTC)
Where are these google translating folks? Would be good to get them involved. First we are looking at translating the GAs and FAs. Will than attempt to clean up the rest of the articles before translation. Help of course appreciated :-) ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) 21:45, 16 December 2011 (UTC)

I found this:Coeliac disease, or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, is only one aspect of a range of possible manifestations of gluten sensitivity. Although neurological manifestations in patients with established coeliac disease have been reported since 1966, it was not until 30 years later that, in some individuals, gluten sensitivity was shown to manifest solely with neurological dysfunction.ite journal |author=Hadjivassiliou M, Sanders DS, Grünewald RA, Woodroofe N, Boscolo S, Aeschlimann D |title=Gluten sensitivity: from gut to brain |journal=Lancet Neurol |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=318–30 |year=2010 |date=March 2010 |pmid=20170845 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(09)70290-X |s2cid=206159061 |url=http://www.bmlab.no/filestore/Forskningsartikler/Hadjivassiliouetal.Glutensensitivityfromguttobrain.Lancet2010.pdfbut have no idea how mainstream this is. --ser:Anthonyhcole|Anthonyhcole (ser talk:Anthonyhcole|talk) 14:55, 8 December 2011 (UTC)

*uote|Gluten sensitivity is a systemic autoimmune disease that occurs in genetically susceptible individuals on ingesting gluten. It can appear at any age, then becoming a permanent condition. It is more frequent in women, as happens with other autoimmune diseases. Celiac disease is the intestinal form and the most important manifestation among a set of gluten-induced autoimmune pathologies that affect different systems.

*uote|Celiac disease, or gluten sensitive enteropathy is a relatively common disease of the jejunum, leading to malabsorption. It is an immune mediated disease, induced by gluten on the grounds of a specific genetic makeup. After gluten exposition immune processes are induced mainly by T-cells, causing typical intestinal and extra intestinal manifestations. The diagnosis of celiac disease is based on jejunal biopsy histology and the presence of antibodies against endomysium and tissue transglutaminase.

I read those to mean that the genetic predisposition is revealed after exposure to gluten, which then triggers an immune response and (SYN?: at some point) an autoimmune response. The disease process is cyclic, but the intolerance to gluten is seen as a precursor to the autoimmune disorder. One might hypothesize a child (prescreened for the genetics) who by some means manages to avoid significant gluten exposure and never develops from intolerance to autoimmunity. (My speculation: This might happen spontaneously in a culture where corn, rice or tubers are overwhelmingly the predominant source of dietary starches.) Still, celiac is overwhelmingly the most important complication of the intolerance and itself precedes further complications. I'm not sure how relevant a distinct gluten intolerance article would be. ser:LeadSongDog|LeadSongDog ser talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl! 16:04, 8 December 2011 (UTC)

This is a readable recent reviewCurrently, a number of morphological, functional and immunological disorders have been considered under the umbrella of [gluten sensitivity] that miss one or more of the key CD criteria (enteropathy, associated HLA haplotypes and presence of anti-TG2 antibodies), but respond to gluten exclusion.ite journal |author=Troncone R, Jabri B |title=Coeliac disease and gluten sensitivity |journal=J.

That review might suffice for an article on onceliac gluten-sensitive enteropathy (NCGSE), but because that condition is so rare compared with the more common GS-as part-of-CD I would not think that we want to lump the two together in a GS article that would mostly repeat parts of the CD article, and indeed question if the dab page would be more helpful than a &quot;not to be confused with&quot;. ser:LeadSongDog|LeadSongDog ser talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl! 17:04, 8 December 2011 (UTC)
&quot;luten sensitivity&quot; is, apparently, now being used to describe a disease distinct from coeliac disease. It has its own article. If &quot;gluten intolerance&quot; covers both of these entities, and I think it might, then it makes sense to me to make luten intolerance a disambiguation page pointing to both articles. But I don't care enough to pursue this. --ser:Anthonyhcole|Anthonyhcole (ser talk:Anthonyhcole|talk) 19:19, 8 December 2011 (UTC)
Fair enough. At times ood intolerance has been something of a p:BATTLEGROUND for CAM mongering, so this fork suggestion pushed some buttons. I think the &quot;sensitivity&quot; term is inclusive of CD, not distinct from it, and therein lies the problem for the articles or for the DAB page. According to MID|16782524 the &quot;intolerance&quot; term excludes allergies. ser:LeadSongDog|LeadSongDog ser talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl! 19:36, 8 December 2011 (UTC)
A careful read of the Lancet article, or any of the above, I think, makes it pretty clear &quot;gluten sensitivity&quot; is being used against, as distinct from, coeliac disease. luten sensitivity is fairly explicit. I completely share your trepidation here. Reading some of that was evoking Wakefieldish horrors in me. But it's being pushed by multiple authors, in multiple teams from multiple locations, and I don't think we can ignore it. I'd love to see a serious expert take that whole garden under their wing, but that's definitely not me. --ser:Anthonyhcole|Anthonyhcole (ser talk:Anthonyhcole|talk) 20:04, 8 December 2011 (UTC)

True allergy is normally defined as requiring the presence of IgE antibodies, which means that none of these (not CD, not GS, not any other variants) are true allergies.  
I believe that &quot;intolerance&quot; and &quot;sensitivity&quot; are normally interchangeable words in the field of allergies, and while they may be defined differently by some sources for this particular antigen, normally &quot;gluten intolerance&quot; and &quot;gluten sensitivity&quot; would be identical, and would include all possible manifestations of any non-IgE-mediated immune response to gluten.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 03:35, 9 December 2011 (UTC)

 I have some knowledge of this area. Celiac disease and Gluten sensitivity which is often refered to as Gluten intolerance are two different things, with different testing done to diagnose them.  I know a lot of people who have gluten intolerance which is often diagnosed during food intolerance testing (often something naturopaths recommend to those who see them when people have food issues but on the other hand it's something many doctors dont believe in).  It all ties into the debate of &quot;food intolerances' (other then true allergies) existance being real or not.  Doctors use the other allergy test to diagnose &quot;true&quot; allergies (allergies have got to with two different antibody reactions as WatamIdoing said). So Gluten sensitivity can actually be a controversional condition thou many do have it. 

 I dont know if there is a connection thou between it and being more likely to end up with Celiac disease even if there is (eg maybe those who carry the Celiac gene are more likely to get gluten intolerance? maybe gluten intolerance can happens before Celiac disease??), I think it would be wise to keep the two conditions apart cause to put them together would really confuse things and bring a controversional diagnoses into a clearer area thou some ideas even in the field of Celiac disease have undergone some changes.
(sorry I dont have references but just know that is a general consensus view elsewhere in that area).  — Preceding ikipedia:Signatures|unsigned comment added by ser:Taniaaust1|Taniaaust1 (ser talk:Taniaaust1|talk • pecial:Contributions/Taniaaust1|contribs) 10:17, 12 December 2011 (UTC)

There is no such thing as a gene for coeliac disease. Gluten intolerance is the development of symptoms after exposure to gluten, and I suspect that this is to the exclusion of coeliac disease which can be diagnosed with serology and histology. Some people (ser|Pdeitiker amongst others) will claim that there are people with clinical symptoms who have positivity to older types of gluten serology (e.g. anti-gliadin) who anecdotally respond to gluten withdrawal. This is actually a controversial area, and Pdeitiker has created a large ikipedia:Walled garden|walled garden of articles, mostly built on P:MEDRS-incompatible sources, expounding on these subjects. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 17:20, 12 December 2011 (UTC)

Well, there is sort of a &quot;gene for celiac disease&quot;.  That is, there are genes (most importantly, HLA DQ2) that give people a predisposition to developing the disease.  If I've got it straight in my mind, almost no one without these genetic variants will end up with the disease, but the vast majority of the people with the gene variant won't end up with the disease anyway.  Calling it &quot;the celiac gene&quot; might be a little sloppy for formal writing, but it's no worse that referring to &quot;the breast cancer gene&quot;, and I think we all know what's meant by it in this kind of casual discussion.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 21:37, 12 December 2011 (UTC)

 yeah, I agree I did put it a little sloppy.
This site is a general public site so I try to put things in a way in which most are going to understand.  I was refering to being DQ2/DQ8 postive. This test is nowdays often recommended to rule out Celiac disease if there is suspicion.  As previous poster stated, negative DQ2/DQ8 virtually excludes Celiac disease.  I will continue to refer to this as the celiac gene rather then DQ2/DQ8 as this isnt a medical site and most will understand that more.  Not all who carry predisposition to breast cancer get breast cancer either.
--ser:Taniaaust1|Taniaaust1 (ser talk:Taniaaust1|talk) 05:23, 19 December 2011 (UTC)

DQ2/DQ8 seems to be a sine qua non for the disease, but most people with DQ2/DQ8 don't get coeliac disease, as rightly stated, and there are numerous other risk factors that - together with the genetic makeup - determine the risk of disease. I would therefore struggle to refer to any gene as the &quot;coeliac gene&quot;. Gluten intolerance, gluten-sensitive diseases, and coeliac disease are probably on some sort of continuum, but many people are doubtful about the existence of the gluten neuropathies (almost everything written on the subject comes from a single group in Sheffield, UK). ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 22:09, 12 December 2011 (UTC)

The first and most important thing is to decide whether a laundry list of every possible cause, no matter how minor, actually belongs in Wikipedia at all.  The ability to source a fact does not make that fact P:DUE. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 01:42, 17 December 2011 (UTC)
That is a very reasonable question. 
Drugs are probably the single greatest identifiable group of agents known to be associated with this condition: scores if not hundreds of these having been shown to cause this problem. Only a fraction of those know are listed here. These alone could probably justify a separate page. As to the utility of such a listing, it used to be the case that lists of drugs causing conditions such as hepatitis used to be 'firewalled' (available only to paid up subscribers) despite their universal utility. The situation has improved at least in part because of oogle - and probably also Wikipedia.   
arasites definitely belong on such a list: several are listed as class 1 carcinogens (the same category as igarettes) by the HO. The iver fluke lives up to its name by residing within the liver (frequently with fatal consequences). iruses belong on this list: the classical hepatitis viruses (A, B, C, D, E) would be difficult to leave out. Several (B and C) have also been classified as class I carcinogens. Yellow fever was the first virus shown to cause hepatitis. The aemorrhagic fever viruses (bola, arburg and others) use the liver as their primary site of eplication. rotozoa belong on this list: eishmania and lasmodium both use the liver as their primary site of replication. Amoebic abscesses are common in the tropics. acteria belong here because congenital yphilis typically involves the liver. The liver is a primary site of replication for artonella. The differential diagnosis for granulomatous hepatitis includes all the listed fungi and several of the bacteria as well as a non trivial number of non infectious causes (arcoid being one). A number of the bacteria - including isteria - cause significant liver disease in the immunocompromised - iabetics, rgan transplants, eukaemia and others. 
The other non infectious causes have a number of common and important cases. Cardiac cirrhosis is well known. clampsia typically presents abnormal liver function tests. Vascular insufficiency - including udd Chiari syndrome - is well known with several different operations having being devised for this condition alone. Leaving out lcohol IMHO would be difficult to justify. on-alcoholic fatty liver disease is an increasingly commonly recognised problem. Fatal cases of this condition have been reported in association with massive weight loss. The list of enetic and ongenital conditions of unknown aetiology is anything but complete here. Many of these give paediatric physicians and surgeons serious difficulties.  
The essential problem here is that many, many agents can cause this condition. If anything this listing is far from comprehensive let alone ncyclopedic. Virtually all the agents currently listed have been associated with fatal outcomes due to massive hepatic necrosis. IMHO a very strong case would have to be made to leave any group of these agents out of a listing.ser:DrMicro|DrMicro (ser talk:DrMicro|talk) 12:03, 17 December 2011 (UTC)
A possible alternative instead of a new page might be a series of tables with one for each group. The drug table could be divided by their chemical nature. I'm not sure how this would compare with the alternative proposed. Again constructive suggestions would be appreciated.ser:DrMicro|DrMicro (ser talk:DrMicro|talk) 13:57, 17 December 2011 (UTC)
The number of agents than can cause hepatitis isn't just a problem for hepatitis. There are similar problems with urinary tract infections, pneumonia, septicaemia and numerous other conditions. There are literally scores of different organisms that can cause these conditions. A consistent method of presentation for these seems a sensible idea.ser:DrMicro|DrMicro (ser talk:DrMicro|talk) 14:21, 17 December 2011 (UTC)

Yes, and the list of things that cause atigue (medicine) is basically the entire table of contents of a drug forumlary plus half of a medical dictionary.  Encyclopedias are supposed to summarize and hit the high points, not include everything.  The job of an encyclopedia is to provide a little bit of information about every subject, not every detail about any given subject.  An encyclopedia is a great example of the concept of being &quot;mile wide, but only an inch deep&quot;.
I like what you're saying about &quot;common and important causes&quot;.  Presumably, common and important causes are ones that if you picked up a five-page overview on hepatitis, they'd be naming those common and important causes, and we want to produce something similar to that type of source.  We should be able to name stellar sources for all common and important causes.  In fact, we should be able to name the same stellar source for them (or at least for all common and important causes that are drugs, and then another stellar source for all common and important causes that are parasites, and so forth).  So as a basic rule of thumb, if we're having to reach to a case study, a paper from more than 10 years ago, any original paper, or any other non-stellar, non-secondary, non-independent source to support a given cause, then that cause probably isn't common enough or important enough for us to mention at all in the hepatitis articles.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 22:37, 19 December 2011 (UTC)

Consensus on sexual orientation and sexualities are made by both the psychological and medical community, and the two communities greatly overlap.

I haven't been following this recent student editing situation, but I once mentored a class of 30 psychiatric nursing students through an assignment here. I believe all students sent here on assignment ought to be (a) tested beforehand by their tutor for their grasp of MEDRS, DUE and citation generation, and (b) instructed to propose all edits on the article talk page before making them. If that had been done in the case I'm referring to, there would have been no dramas, for what it's worth. --ser:Anthonyhcole|Anthonyhcole (ser talk:Anthonyhcole|talk) 17:05, 17 December 2011 (UTC)

Hi Anthony. Discussing all edits on talk page is too harsh; many articles don't have enough people watch listing them and thus a large number of these talk page proposed text requests/suggestions would get ignored. It is overly and unnecessarily harsh in my view. Your other suggestions sound good, they should have a basic grasp of how wikipedia works before being set loose, they don't have to have mastered wikipedia though.--ser:Literaturegeek|Literaturegeek | ser_talk:Literaturegeek |T@1k? 16:28, 18 December 2011 (UTC)

 Class editing of medical/neuroscience articles 

Hi. I'm seeing some potential problems from ser|Biol373.cwru - basically pasting in entire class papers over existing articles - but I currently have a final exam to create.

 Thanks for the heads-up, Allen. To be honest, there's nothing to deal with. The massive expansions of the stubs ingle-unit recording, eurokinin A and lfactory tubercle into sizeable articles are very welcome (unless there's any suspicion of copyright violation - but I don't think so). The Olfactory tubercle article has been cleaned up and wikified by a couple of editors, and the same will happen to the other two articles quite soon. That's how it works on the wiki. The only thing I'd worry about is that the students may not know about P:DYK and it would be a shame to miss out on the recognition.

 Chronic fatigue syndrome 

Should the lede of hronic fatigue syndrome include &quot;multiple psychological and physiological factors may contribute to the development and maintenance of symptoms&quot;? I know little about this condition, though I've read a few reviews in the last couple of days. My superficial view is, using the quoted phrase in the lede gives undue emphasis to weakly supported speculation. (Of course it should be, and is, covered in the body of the article.) I fear that the phrase is being held in place because it offends patients and advocates, and is making some kind of point. I would appreciate other views. Talk page discussion is alk:Chronic_fatigue_syndrome#.22Multiple_Psychological_and_Physiological_Factors_may_Contribute.22_to_CFS.3F|here. --ser:Anthonyhcole|Anthonyhcole (ser talk:Anthonyhcole|talk) 16:36, 19 December 2011 (UTC)

I don't think individual content disputes in that particular article should be brought to this page. There are already loads of people bickering over there. I don't think the quoted phrase is any stronger or weaker than many other pronouncements about CFS made elsewhere in the article. I don't think it offends either.

 Medical articles at P:GAN 

Hi everyone! You may all know about this already, but there were several medical articles nominated at P:GAN recently, all by the same person as part of a university class. I am hoping that there are a few of you that might be willing to look over the articles and either do a full GA review or post comments on the talk page regarding their adherence to P:MEDRS. The articles still needing review are:

* pina bifida (Doc James)
* ging brain
* utism spectrum
* ysthymia (Doc James)

The majority of reviewers at GA don't have an in-depth knowledge of the reliable sources guidelines specifically for medical articles, so they may miss major issues with primary/secondary sources, reliance on outdated/unreliable journals, etc., which is a major reason I'm hoping some med-focused editors can help out with these reviews.

 Long-term, undetected misrepresentations in inkgo biloba 

Would anyone be interested in looking through inkgo biloba? I happened upon it today, and noticed that it claimed that ginkgo &quot;improved cognition&quot; in multiple sclerosis patients. The cited source, MID|17439907, says the exact opposite (that ginkgo &quot;did not show a statistically significant improvement in cognitive function&quot;). That's a bald-faced, outright dishonest misrepresentation with the potential to mislead readers about their health. It was apparently inserted [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ginkgo_biloba&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=318559715 in October 2009] and has remained undetected since in this relatively high-profile article.

 Tasks for Non-Medics 

Hello, everyone, I'm new on Wikipedia. I have an interest in medicine and hope to pursue it as a career,and would like to contribute to WikiProject Medicine in any way possible. However, I am limited by the fact that I am still a teenager, and thus have not even started university, let alone gained a medical degree.
Until such a time as I can contribute with tangible and verifiable information, what can you suggest that a person with no medical knowledge (such as myself) might do to contribute to the project?
ser:Benjitheijneb|Benjitheijneb (ser talk:Benjitheijneb|talk) 20:05, 6 January 2012 (UTC)

Welcome to Wikipedia!  I suggest looking over the list at ikipedia:WikiProject Medicine#Other_ideas.  One idea that really anyone could do is this:  Go to [http://toolserver.org/~svick/CleanupListing/CleanupListingByCat.php?project=Medicine this list] (warning:  will be slow to load) and see if the clean up templates are still valid.  Pick a section on that page and work your way down the list.  For example, under &quot;Articles lacking sources&quot;, the article hird ventricle has been tagged as having zero bibliographic citations to reliable sources since 2007, but if you look at the article, there's one listed.  So clearly the lp|Unreferenced|dateNovember 2007 tag at the top is outdated, and just needs someone to remove it. 
If you're not sure about whether a tag is okay, then you can ask here, or just skip it and move on to the next one.  If you think you can solve the problem (sometimes the tag itself explains how to do that, or links to a page that does), then try to solve the problem (and then remove the tag, if you're pretty sure that your efforts worked).
Good luck, and thank you for the offer to help!  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 20:45, 6 January 2012 (UTC)

 A pharma company making corrections in entries?

ser:NCurse|NCurse  ser talk:NCurse|work 16:06, 19 December 2011 (UTC)

The best way to get information to readers is to find good quality sources that comply with P:MEDRS and then summarise the sources in the article along with the cited source. Or in the case of a potential COI, to place a suggested edit on the relevant article talk page, and wait for comments. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 16:25, 19 December 2011 (UTC)

If a single named person in the company is going to do the editing, it makes most sense for that person to have an account with a userpage that clearly states their conflict of interest. I don't think individual edit summaries need COI tagging.
Generally, uncontroversial edits should be allowed even when the account is managed by a drug company employee, but controversial edits should be discussed on the talk page and possibly actioned by others. All edits, as RexxS rightly said, should be based on MEDRS-compatible sources. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 20:41, 19 December 2011 (UTC)

This is the encyclopedia that anyone can edit.  There's no footnote off that statement that excludes people who happen to have jobs in the pharmaceutical industry.  We really desperately need knowledgeable people to correct errors.  That said, they might like to read P:MEDCOI and see if some of those drama-reducing strategies will appeal to them.  I'd also suggest that if someone is doing a significant amount of work, that the person introduce himself or herself either here or at T:PHARM.  They're both good places to get practical help and to grab extra eyes if you find yourself in an unexpected dispute. 
Also, they might find it useful to at least glance over P:MEDMOS to notice things like our desire not to be a drug formulary and not to provide dosing information.  Some of our stylistic choices (e.g., omitting dosing information) are designed to reduce the likelihood of safety concerns.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 23:57, 19 December 2011 (UTC)

Thank you for the feedback! I guess the consensus is that if someone from a pharma company wants to make a correction in an entry about a pharma product (no matter whether it belongs to their own company or to another), they should cite reviews, peer-reviewed papers, reliable resources and leave a message on the discussion page of the entry or on the pharma project page claiming that they are from this pharma company therefore all conflicts of interest are revealed. ser:NCurse|NCurse  ser talk:NCurse|work 10:14, 28 December 2011 (UTC)

Hi NCurse (I'm answering you after reading your LinkedIn post :-) ). I worked for pharma industry and I'm presently a strategy consultant for it, so I immediately declare my eventual COI :-). To resolve the issue, I feel we should have to rely on the Wikipedia rules, which say that a) anybody can edit a Wikipedia article b) edits have to be referenced c) any edit can be counteredited when found not sufficiently supported by bibliography and/or has an evident promotional intent. On the other side, I feel that pharma executives are the most entitled and knowledgeable persons to make edits on the drugs their company commercialize. On this principles, I feel that editing should have to be self-regulated as per the Wikipedia rules; but that any promotional intent can be individuated and criticized by other Wiki authors (not excluding competitor pharma companies' executives :-) ). Hope this helps.--ser:Ferdinando Scala|Ferdinando Scala (ser talk:Ferdinando Scala|talk) 15:27, 3 January 2012 (UTC)

Many thanks for your insights, Ferdinando! You are right, that's clear. Of course, pharma companies can edit any entries they want, but as they approached us in the first place to get some feedback about their own plans, we came up with this solution (namely, they would identify themselves revealing COI, but can make any edits they want). I guess this is the perfect consensus, somewhere between your point and ours. What do you think? ser:NCurse|NCurse  ser talk:NCurse|work 13:50, 5 January 2012 (UTC)

I have been working with a Steering Group consisting of physicians, pharmacists and medical people from the industry to look at how people can make updates to articles adhering to Wikipedia standards and at the same time stay within pharma industry guidelines for communicating to the public.  As you can imagine there are some areas needing interpretation - for example, the degree of responsibility someone from the industry has for an article they have updated. When considered, the answers to most questions like this are pretty clear (as you say the self-regulation aspect of Wikipedia is a given and our suggested approach is also transparency and declaration of any potential COI) but we thought there was merit in offering guidance because we know that many people with knowledge are currently reluctant to contribute.  We were considering turning this into a Wikipedia task force to open up the discussion - what do you think?

P:PAID editing isn't prohibited on our end.  Whitewashing is a problem no matter what the industry or financial arrangement is, but correction of outright errors should be honored even if the person is being paid.  Along those lines, I'd like to repeat the fact that the English Wikipedia encourages people to voluntarily disclose such relationships, but it does not require it.

In terms of reliable sources, what is everyone's opinion on the matter of pharma companies (having declared COI) using their own published information as a source? ser:Basalisk|Basalisk pecial:Contributions/Basalisk|inspect damage⁄ser talk:Basalisk|berate 00:29, 7 January 2012 (UTC)

Technically, a source needs to be only strong enough to support its claim.  A personal blog is actually good enough, if all you're trying to support is something trivial like &quot;Joe Bloggs once posted the following words:&quot;.  Pharma sources are therefore &quot;good enough&quot;—for limited purposes.  They fall under our rules about P:SPS|self-published sources, and often they will be P:USEPRIMARY|primary sources as well.  
So they might be &quot;good enough&quot;, but they're not the best possible sources for almost any technical/medical claim.  We'd far rather see a good eview article or textbook cited (even if that publication was authored by an employee of the same company) than the manufacturer's website or prescribing information.  Additionally, readers seem to be more impressed by journal articles than by something obviously published by the manufacturer.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 02:08, 7 January 2012 (UTC)
There is a good chance that if what you are adding is health related and it is not supported by high quality sources (eview articles or major textbooks) it will get removed. Specifically self published material by the pharmaceutical industry is generally not a reliable source for medicine or pharmacology.ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) 02:44, 7 January 2012 (UTC)
It depends on the source.  The prescriber's insert is technically self-published, but I've never seen one reverted.  Some sort of direct-to-consumer website would be considered suspect for many purposes, but it would not be nearly as suspect as a website promoting herbal extracts or one claiming conspiracy theories.
Also, we're supposed to be smart about this.  It is in the best interests of our readers to have a variety of types of sources listed in an article, because not every reader is capable of understanding a scientific paper.  Assuming that the content in question is entirely accurate and fairly basic, there's nothing wrong with citing a lay-accessible website rather than the fanciest scientific source we can find.  A citation to a basic FAQ page at a cancer charity website or health agency website is totally adequate for a simple statement like, &quot;Leukemia is characterized by the presence of too many white blood cells&quot;.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 21:43, 9 January 2012 (UTC)

 Summer student 

I have had a few offers of money for Wikipedia's medical initiatives.

I would personally teach this person how to edit and basically they would spend 40 hours per week doing so during their summer holidays.

 List of hospitals in India 

Hello! This ist of hospitals in India is very unorganized and obviously incomplete. I had some doubts about it. Hence thought that anyone would answer them here. Do we define what a Hospital means? I see many clinics also added to this list. Maybe they are hospitals but called as clinics or are clinics itself. But do we have some fixed thought on whats to be included here? And dont we require references?

Quick answers:
* Lists are supposed to P:LSC|define their inclusion criteria at the top of the page (in paragraphs of text).  Don't rely solely on the title, which is often incomplete.  If no one has defined this list, then anyone who wants to should feel free to do so. 
* There is no requirement that lists contain only the names of hospitals that already have articles on Wikipedia. 
* While references are very desirable, they are only required if one of P:MINREF|these four situations apply, which is unlikely in the case of such a list.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:12, 13 January 2012 (UTC)

Okay! Will discuss with other editors &amp; have a suitable definition of the list on top. Simple definition would be just what the title says. But i think thats too vast. There is this infinte ist of cities and towns in India and then there will be n hospitals in them!! Your point about including non-blue linked names is also right. Because many of them are not notable enough to withhold their own article space but are notable enough to be included in a list. Also; in this case references are not required.

I understand your concern about the potential size of the list.  It might make more sense to have a series of lists, one for each state and territory.

 Major Depressive Disorder (Vincent van Gogh:  &quot;At Eternity's Gate&quot;) 

I refer the group alk:Major_depressive_disorder#Vincent_van_Gogh.27s_painting_.22At_Eternity.27s_Gate.22 | to this thread on the Talk page at Major Depressive Disorder concerning the use of Vincent van Gogh's  painting &quot;At Eternity's Gate&quot; in that article and to alk:Major_depressive_disorder#The_use_of_the_Van_Gogh_picture_to_create_an_image_of_depression | this comment of mine pointing out it has no place in the article and should be removed.

The essence of the complaint is that is fully documented that van Gogh's painting is not at all, nor was ever meant to be, a portrayal of depressive disorder but is rather merely a study of an old man. For that reason alone it should be removed for reasons of encyclopaedic accuracy.

As it stands it necessarily makes a judgement about the nature of depressive disorder, that it necessarily implies despair, even that it necessarily implies suicidal ideation (because of its title and van Gogh's own well known suicide). It is very much to be regretted indeed in my opinion that a Wikipedia administrator, ser:Casliber|Casliber, a practicising psychiatrist it seems but a poor historian of art, appears to be the prime mover behind perpetuating these poor judgements.

It also mythologises Vincent van Gogh himself who took the greatest care to separate his difficulties in life from his work; the nature of whose illness is not settled but which is not certainly typical of a depressive disorder; who is not documented as suffering from suicidal depressive moods in the last months of his life when this painting was completed and whose suicide itself has in the past year been plausibly questioned by a respected source as rather a manslaughter.

I ask that the image be removed. If it is felt necessary, and I cannot imagine why it should be, that the article be illustrated by a fine art image, then I suggest the original image, Durer's Melancholia, be reinserted. ser:Skirtopodes|Skirtopodes (ser talk:Skirtopodes|talk) 22:33, 13 January 2012 (UTC)

I shall respond to your post paragraph-by-paragraph.
#Whether or not the painting was intended to portray an individual suffering from major depressive disorder, the contributors to the article thus-far (including some trained psychiatric professionals) believe it does accurately illustrate depression. Neither the caption nor the image description substantiate your claim that the painting is definitely not portraying a depressed man, and so the image is not misleading. To paraphrase: the image gets the point across. It's good for the article.
#Though you're right in saying that not all depressive patients have suicidal ideations, suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts are one of the most prominent and severe symptoms of depression. The image accurately portrays this. If you go to eningitis, you'll see an image of the characteristic rash of meningococcal septicaemia. This is a very common presentation of the disease, but meningitis can and does occur without it. That doesn't mean we exclude the image, as it is informative. That said, there is nothing about the image which specifically implies suicide, so I'm not sure what you're trying to argue there, whereas despair and hopelessness certainly are important and virtually universal features of depression.
#The effect of including this image on the MDD article on either the artist or the artwork itself, is irrelevant. The fact that its inclusion may give rise to popular misconceptions about the mental state of Vincent van Gogh is of no concern when considering the quality of an article about MDD.

Overall, you seem to be obscuring this discussion towards a debate about whether van Gogh really was depressed. The inclusion of the image is not making any dramatic statement in this regard, it is simply seen as a good visual representation of depression. ser:Basalisk|Basalisk pecial:Contributions/Basalisk|inspect damage⁄ser talk:Basalisk|berate 20:23, 14 January 2012 (UTC)

No. The painting is at the Kroller-Muller in Holland (the original lithograph is apparently lost). The title &quot;At Eternity's gate&quot; is not van Gogh's but some traditional title and it is exhibited at K-M as &quot;Sorrowful Old Man: At Eternity's Gate&quot; http://www.kmm.nl/object/KM%20111.041/Sorrowing-old-man-At-Eternitys-Gate?artist=Vincent%20van%20Gogh%20%281853%20-%201890%29&amp;characteristic=&amp;characteristic_type=Painting&amp;van=0&amp;tot=0&amp;start=63&amp;fromsearch=1. The same collection has an accompanying lithograph from the period of the original lithograph with a title beginning &quot;Sorrowful woman ... &quot; and in addition there is another lithograph from that period depicting the same old man reading a book with concentration and not displaying any signs of strong emotion. It's not clear what van Gogh's theme was at the time (his letters of the time are concerned only with the technicalities of producing these lithographs) but it's clear that at most he was concerned to depict sorrow, which I expect your trained psychiatrists you mention will concede is not a clinical condition. It is in fact only the subjectivity of the viewer who introduces the idea of 'sorrow' looking at this picture, let alone a diagnosis of depressive disorder your trained psychiatrists apparently make.

If the trained pyschiatrists you mention were writing a book on depressive disorder and wished to illustrate it with a dust-jacket depicting this painting, they would have to seek the permission of the trustees of the Kroller-Muller museum and it is far from clear to me that the trustees would wish to grant that permission. As trustees of the estate and moral rights of one of our greatest ever artists, they would undoubtedly wish to see that his work was viewed freely without stereotyping or mythologising the artist and might very well look askance at this attempt to make, quite gratuitously, the painting an iconic representation of depressive disorder and the more so given the considerable difficulty in assessing to what degree illness played a part in the painter's life and indeed what the nature of that illness was. 

What your trained pyschiatrists are really doing with this painting are peddling sterotypes and myths. It is absolutely disgraceful and a matter of concern to all art lovers, 'trained' or otherwise. When you consider further, as every beginning student of art history knows, that van Gogh himself wrote intelligently about the relationship between insanity and artistic creation (he took a view that was to become fasionable decades later, that society 'labelled' artists as mad and so indeed they did eventually become) it becomes little short of outrageous, because that labelling is precisely what your trained psychiatrists are doing with the subject of this painting. ser:Skirtopodes|Skirtopodes (ser talk:Skirtopodes|talk) 00:44, 15 January 2012 (UTC)

Look, you are completely missing the point. The effect of the inclusion of the image on the public perception of the work of art doesn't matter, because we are not having a discussion about the history of art. It doesn't matter what van Gogh called it or what he wanted to convey when he painted it, because here, today, it illustrates MDD well. This is the only reason the image has been chosen; not because it has some obscure link to a supposedly depressed artist. We could caption the image &quot;Man about to hang himself in the midst of a major depressive episode triggered by the death of his dog by Duane van Eisenhower&quot; and it wouldn't matter, because it would still accurately portray the condition we're describing. That is the only reason we use this image.

Moreover, we do not have to seek permission from anyone for anything, because the image you are talking about is in the public domain, and thus the trustees of the museum where the original is kept have no control over the distribution of copies.

Take this example. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Storm_in_Pacifica.jpg This] image, I assume, was taken by the photographer to illustrate the impressive waves it pictures. That's fine. We could also use to portray California (where it was taken), or the Pacific Ocean (as indeed it is, at acific Ocean). We could even use it to illustrate how the sky appears blue, or how human settlements are often built by the sea. The fact that the author had none of this in mind when he took the photo would be no good reason to refrain from using it as such; we just use the images for whatever purpose they are useful.

The fact is, no one cares about this P:TRUTH|huge historical injustice which is apparently being done by using this image in the article, because it serves a good purpose there. It illustrates the subject, it isn't misleading, it isn't illegal. There's no good reason for it not to be there. ser:Basalisk|Basalisk pecial:Contributions/Basalisk|inspect damage⁄ser talk:Basalisk|berate 01:08, 15 January 2012 (UTC)

No again. It is you who deny an issue and you do it in the time honoured way of accusing me of misunderstanding the 'real' issue.

However, I shall take you as face value and treat what you decribe as the real issue - that the painting is a good representation of MDD (Major Depressive Disorder). I did notice, incidentally, that this last reply of yours moves to the royal wikisodality 'we'. Are we by any chance young and naive - a student perhaps? High school?

Whatever, will you please explain what it is about the image that makes it a good illustration of MDD? That the man is old? That he is holding his knuckles to his face in an apparent gesture of depair? What makes you say the image accurately portrays that suicide attempts and suicidal thoughts are amongst the most severe and prominent symptoms of depression (or so you characterised them for my instruction)?

Above all, will you please quote reliable sources, as should be the Wikipedia way, that attest this painting as a good image of MDD. Who are these 'trained pyschiatrists' you mention?

I will simply say that an image of a man in an apparent state of private despair is a pretty good depiction of major depression (seriously, have you even read the article?). Apart from that, I'm not carrying on this debate ser:Jnc/Astronomer_vs_Amateur|and getting into an endless cycle of demands for citations to verify every word I type, especially as you seem willing to stoop to patronisation to derail the discussion.

I would say that it is simply an image of a man in an apparent state of despair and not that he was suffering major depressive disorder, which frankly does strike me as pretty condescending ('patronising') of you. It might be that he is simply in despair, perhaps because he's behind on the mortgage or can't get the Wikipedia community to see his point of view (or worried about his exams), and not in the least bit ill.

 I have been away. You are quite juvenile. You cannot even distinguish between p -&gt; q and q -&gt; p. The whole point is that this merely a painting of a sorrowful old man. Just because an old man is sorrowful does not imply that he he is clinically depressed whereas indeed it may be true, as I presume you mean to instruct me, that an old man who is clinically depressed is necessarily sorrowful, nevertheless the two are not equivalent. I wonder what your mentor Casliber's professional association would make of this attempt to stereotype the old and sad as clinically depressed and in need of treatment?

 medical article infoboxes hard to understand? 

Hi docs:

I wondered what is the rationale for the infoboxes that I see on medical articles?  Like this one:

nfobox disease |
  Name        = Skeletal fluorosis |
  ICD10       = CD10|M|85|1|m|80 |
  ICD9        = CD9|733.9 |


I guess they are lists of External Links.  I'm fine with that actually (never been a stickler for the approach of not referring to external content.)  But my concern about the boxes is they are so inscrutable to a regular reader.  Why not have some format that is more like normal external links, where we say what article and content people are heading to?  I mean, maybe docs know what the letters and numbers are, but it is pretty cryptic even to a technically trained, smart, non doctor.

You all are very helpful here (honest, have gotten great help, don't get mad at me), but I still worry that the vast amount of people are getting crufty letters and numbers in a very &quot;valuable piece of real estate&quot;.  I mean, look at this infobox, is there any reason to have the MeshID (whatever that is) unique identifier so prominent?  It feels like putting an ISBN or a LOC catalog number up in a very important area.  

nfobox disease 
 | Name            = Fluoride poisoning 
 | Image           = 
 | Caption         = 
 | DiseasesDB      = 29228 
 | ICD10           = CD10|T|59|5|t|51 
 | ICD9            = 
 | ICDO            = 
 | OMIM            = 
 | MedlinePlus     = 
 | eMedicineSubj   = emerg 
 | eMedicineTopic  = 181 
 | MeshID          = D005458 


 For what it's worth, I consider these links and their esoteric codes to be unhelpful, even detrimental, to Wikipedia's medical articles. It is especially ironic when COI editors attempt to justify adding external links that are actually more useful than these infoboxes' links. ser:Axl|Axl ¤ ser talk:Axl|[Talk] 23:34, 8 January 2012 (UTC)

But seriously, thanks for letting me interact and even thinking about it.  Really liked how you all tried to help me get the HF burn image. I finally tracked one down from a hand surgeon (fourth donation attempt!)

ile:HF burned hands.jpg|thumb|250px|center|alt=left and right hands, two views, burned index fingers|HF burns, not evident until a day after

Getting serious, now though.  Take a look at the different infoboxes.  I think in some cases, infoboxes are actually bad (when they just repeat the lead, say for something in Project Mythology) and then they also drive a too small image in one of the few spots where a big image really great.  I do like city infoboxes having some of the &quot;World Almanac&quot; info convenient.  Am kinda meh on the species infoboxes with the long synonym lists, but they are OK.  I think the element or chemical infoboxes are pretty useful.  My gut feel is no infobox, would actually serve you better.  Then put all the number stuff down in some penatlybox table at the end, sort of like a Project Aviation list of plane specs.  but I am just babbling...ser:TCO|TCO (ser:TCO#Reviews needed|Reviews needed) 00:35, 9 January 2012 (UTC)

Oh...and I was seeing some really good doc to talk about something...and he used the Wiki when a question came up!  He was kind of young and academic and used a program that had more of a root cause analysis path (not like a normal neighborhood doc, no offense).  But he sure as heck did NOT use the ICD stuff.  He scanned the text.  I had to push him to look at the ref (I'm such a good Wikipedian...but it was some paper by a Harvard doc...and on the web too...)

ser:TCO|TCO (ser:TCO#Reviews needed|Reviews needed) 00:39, 9 January 2012 (UTC)
ICD and MESH codes are mostly a way of aggregating and categorizing data. I don't think they're particularly useful in clinical practice, nor would they be useful to the interested lay reader. It's a bit like including an ISBN or Dewey decimal number in a book infobox. I agree the ICD/MESH info maybe should appear somewhere, but I'd agree with those who think it doesn't belong in an infobox. I agree that there's plenty of borderline useless info in other infoboxes (e.g. elements), but we don't need to follow that lead in our articles if we think it's a bad idea. ser:MastCell|MastCell ser Talk:MastCell|Talk 01:03, 9 January 2012 (UTC)

I agree with MastCell here. I think the links in the infobox add important info and should be included somewhere in the article, but inclusion in the infobox skews the article towards their importance. I am a medical student – before I was, I found the boxes confusing. Now, I understand them, but don't find them useful.
Also, I think removing these links from the infobox template would free up room for information which a non-medical reader may find more useful (random examples: name of person who first described disease, date of first description, body system(s) affected etc.). The infobox at present seems to cater more to healthcare professionals as a technical tool, rather than to inform the layman. ser:Basalisk|Basalisk pecial:Contributions/Basalisk|inspect damage⁄ser talk:Basalisk|berate 01:17, 9 January 2012 (UTC)
Comments 1) Many diseases do not have discovers and have been described since antiquity. 2) Many conditions involved many body systems. 3) The main purpose for the ICDs IMO is the justify how we name the conditions in question.

I realise those issues with the examples I suggested. To be honest, I wasn't suggesting them as an alternative, I was just trying to illustrate my point. The ICDs may well be useful to a professional as reference, but I don't think ICDs are useful to a non-medical reader, and it is non-medical readers we're writing for. ser:Basalisk|Basalisk pecial:Contributions/Basalisk|inspect damage⁄ser talk:Basalisk|berate 13:53, 9 January 2012 (UTC)

The content is &quot;still in the article&quot; even if you shift it to the end.  You don't have to have an infobox, either.  If the choice is no infobox or one with those Dewey decimal numbers, I would go no infobox and just have a big picture.  Make the MESH, ICD stuff a table way at the end.  I mean &quot;refs&quot; are helpful for paperwork also.  But they are at the end.

The ICD codes are actual content; some readers are actually looking for them.  
But nobody's looking for the eMedicine section/number, so we could put anything we wanted there.  However, I haven't been able to think of anything that doesn't seem pointless (like the name of the disease).  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 21:17, 9 January 2012 (UTC)
I tend to think of such links as useful in the early stages of article development, less so later on, but not terribly problematic even then. For example, using them avoids p:OR in choosing article titles among various options. There's some value in them in helping to find different names for the same disease, and in kickstarting interlanguage linking (because the ICD code listings are available in many languages). That's an area that might well someday be bot-assisted. Editors are far from unanimous on the question of hiding information: some want everything reflected on the rendered page, others would happily bury such details on a subpage or under a show/hide toggle. The former perspective seems to be the one that holds sway most often. I'd suggest that the ICD codes should be accompanied by the plain-English name that the code represents. Again, this could be bot assisted. ser:LeadSongDog|LeadSongDog ser talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl! 21:25, 9 January 2012 (UTC)
How does hiding the ICD code number help educate the person who actually wants to know what the code is?  It's like hiding the tomic number on an element.  We know from past comments that real people (both professionals doing medical coding and patients trying to figure out their paperwork) actually use Wikipedia to look up these ICD numbers.  If you replace CD9|733.9 with [http://www.icd9data.com/2012/Volume1/710-739/730-739/733/733.9.htm Other and unspecified disorders of bone and cartilage], how does the person find the &quot;733.9&quot; that he actually wants to know?

 linking to Clinicaltrials.gov as a reference 

Is there a policy of linking to clinical trials as a reference?  In general I make it a habit to remove links to prospective or ongoing clinical trials; though there's guidance regarding external links, what about those found in the body of the article?  As an example, I just removed an entire table of [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alzheimer%27s_disease_clinical_research&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=471874379 &quot;advanced disease-modifying drug (DMD) candidates&quot;].

I think that, at best, it might be a barely acceptable P:USINGPRIMARY|primary source, but I generally discourage them.  
In particular, for something like Alzheimer's (where excellent sources about the state of research exist), it smacks of advertising and promoting trials.

* I certainly do not agree that linking to clinicaltrials.gov would violate P:CRYSTAL. In fact, that page says this specifically: &quot;It is appropriate to report discussion and arguments about the prospects for success of future proposals and projects or whether some development will occur, if discussion is properly referenced&quot;. If someone is now going to change that, please let me know because I don't have it watchlisted. Mentioning on ongoing clinical trial does not say that it will be successful, but it does provide further, often notable information on the topic, and when the due date for the clinical trial comes up, it provides a reminder for the editor to go look for the results. My opinion is that removing these without a good reason is a poor use of time, likely to lead to pointless and lengthy arguments (if nobody else, I may defend their inclusion), and does not serve the reading public in any way that I can tell. Admittedly, ideally these trials would be large and have secondary coverage. Also, considering that trials are often eager to find people, from a public policy perspective they could help connect potential participants connect to trials, a perennial problem (see, e.g., http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/03/health/research/03trials.html?pagewanted=all) and help draw scrutiny to clinical trials prior to publishing, which is often nice given the common methodological flaws which are discovered after all the money and effort is spent. ser:ImperfectlyInformed|II | (ser_talk:ImperfectlyInformed|t - pecial:Contributions/ImperfectlyInformed|c) 21:52, 17 January 2012 (UTC)
II, makes me think of the injunction in the &quot;Diseases&quot; subsection that points out we're not a directory of clinical trials (and not said there but implied - we're not here to help recruit people).  
These links would be very susceptible to ink rot as the trials end and new ones begin, and if secondary sources exist discussing a clinical trial then they are redundant.  
There's no consensus apparent on removing them and that pretty much addresses my original question, thanks for everyone's comments.  ser:WLU|WLU ser talk:WLU|(t) pecial:Contributions/WLU|(c) Wikipedia's rules:P:SIMPLE|simple/P:POL|complex 23:15, 17 January 2012 (UTC)

The primary sources need addressing, but this does not give you a carte blanche to discuss unproven or doubtful non-standard treatments.
Secondary sources are usually not &quot;studies&quot; but reviews or textbook chapters that place the mass of primary research in context, describe trends, and identify gaps in the knowledge base. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 20:33, 15 January 2012 (UTC)

I depend on the community. I somewhat agree with you, but I prefer to use other words. The in vitro and in vivo results are promising, but the clinical findings (prostate cancer, rheumatoid arthritis etc.) are early and limited, and should be used with care.

As to the question regarding secondary sources vs. primary studies, it is my impression (being a Wikipedian for three months) that the majority do a very good job, respect the NPOV and do their best to build an Encyclopedia. That is why I think that something also must be left to the judgment of its members. Perhaps the contributors to the “Prostate cancer” article have found a certain balance? ser:Granateple|Granateple (ser talk:Granateple|talk) 00:18, 16 January 2012 (UTC)
Prostate cancer articles needs a rewrite using review articles. I will get there eventually. Look at featured articles like engue fever for the appropriate balance.

It's a little complicated, because primary sources are always fine for some purposes (e.g., a particularly famous paper), and what the best balance is depends on both the subject (good luck finding a bunch of secondary sources for extremely rare diseases) and on the use (a textbook cited 20 times is more important to the article than three primary sources, even though you might say that 75% of the citations were to primary sources).  
What we really want editors to do is to use the best type of source that is available.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:20, 16 January 2012 (UTC)

I know WhatamIdoing likes to correct any statements that smack of P:BANPRIMARYSOURCES but empirical evidence is that citations to primary research papers nearly always indicate an incorrect use of sources, an attempt to violate P:WEIGHT, and evidence the editor is P:OR|conducting their own review of the primary literature. For example [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ketogenic_diet&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=472339973 this edit] to etogenic diet required reverting twice after [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/NutritionalNeuroscientist this editor] didn't get the point. Frequently we see such editors cite policy or guidelines in saying they &quot;may use primary sources&quot;, even [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SandyGeorgia&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=472479044 arguing no reviews exist] (which in this case is clearly false).
Can we, for balance, ensure that every time it is pointed out that one may use primary research papers as sources for medical articles, also point out that is is very likely that one should not. And the chances that one should not increase if one is in a dispute over content. In addition, discussion of PSTS without context is pointless. BTW, I can think of a &quot;particularly famous paper&quot; by a chap called Wakefield.  ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 13:48, 23 January 2012 (UTC)
Ouch! But there are some generic instances that we can identify. Eponymously named diseases such as lzheimer's, arkinson's, etc generally got those names for a seminal paper that should be cited in our articles, just as those papers are frequently cited in subsequent reviews and texts. We could hardly ignore Wakefield in the articles on utism or the accination controversy. The trick is not to fall into the error of treating these primary or outdated sources as more reliable than the subsequent higher-quality sources in the article. They remain of interest to readers (if only historically) and should be included with appropriate context from current reviews. This is of course not an argument in favour of nonsense such as edicinal mushrooms where the use of primary sources has run amok. ser:LeadSongDog|LeadSongDog ser talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl! 14:19, 23 January 2012 (UTC)

We absolutely do not cite seminal papers &quot;just as those papers are frequently cited in subsequent reviews and texts&quot; -- for reviews and other text cite the source research paper as a matter of course and in order to attribute credit. Citations can appear in WP articles for two reasons. The most common is when referring to a source used by the editor for the article. Another less common reason is to fully identify the work or study referred to in the text. The former typically appears as footnotes in a References section. The latter could appear in the article body (e.g., a list of papers published by someone, in their bio article), in a Bibliography section or as a footnote. It is not uncommon to see such footnotes interspersed with article-source citations in the References section but there could be a separate Notes section or the Bibliography could be hyper-linked from the body text if one wanted. If you haven't actually read the paper, then P:SAYWHEREYOUGOTIT requires you add a &quot;cited by...&quot; suffix if you put it in with the References. Such info-citations aren't covered by P:V or P:MEDRS: they aren't sources.
Editors may wish to list Parkinson's seminal work(s) to inform the reader. But lets not pretend they are sources [except rarely]. You didn't, one dull wet afternoon in an obscure corner of the university library, happen upon some old manuscript and say to yourself &quot;You know, this Parkinson fellow might just have been the first person to describe that shaking palsy disease&quot;. Unlike in academia, we should not be ashamed to cite the true secondary source of our information, and we are under no obligation to credit the original discoverers of new information.
Using primary sources in the History section is as potentially troublesome as using them in any part of WP.

 There is a discussion of the relative speeds of citation templates at ikipedia talk:Featured article candidates/Citation templates (technical). Vcite is quicker than Cite because it does not offer as many features. In addition, Vcite uses a &quot;Vancouver&quot; style of reference formatting, rather than the normal &quot;wikipedia house style&quot; (which I think is mainly based on a &quot;Chicago&quot; style).

The applicable rules are at P:CITEVAR.  Wikipedia does not have a single &quot;house style&quot;.  The style chosen varies between articles, based on what editors at that particular article believe is best.  If you want to change the style on an article, you must have a discussion (at each and every single article, not just one mass discussion here) that demonstrates a consensus to change the style for that article.  This means, by the way, that if the article is already using vcite, then you need to use vcite for any material that you're adding or re-working, even if that means going to the trouble of manually typing a &quot;v&quot; into the template that Diberri's tool generates for you.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 04:47, 22 January 2012 (UTC)
 At the risk of being pedantic here, Wikipedia does have a &quot;house style&quot; (although I feel we are using it in different senses), which is the default produced by the l|cite templates: author1 last name; comma; author1 first name; semicolon; additional authors; year in parentheses; period; title in quotes and linked; period; publication in italics; period; etc. This is neither Chicago, nor API , nor Vancouver, but a hybrid that Wikipedia has created. In that sense alone, it is our house style, but obviously is not mandatory. Everything else WAID said is absolutely correct however, and editors may invest a lot of effort into deciding which style of reference works best in any given article. They will often not take kindly to wholescale changes for no obvious reason. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 03:05, 23 January 2012 (UTC)

 The l|cite series use a common set of core routines and have been tweaked over time to return reasonably consistent results within the family. Of course l|citation gives a noticeably different format, so the two shouldn't be mixed; likewise for l|vcite. The editing interface presents an editor with the 'cite' family from the toolbar, and I expect that the majority of citation templates are inserted by that route using default settings in a style that appears to be unique to Wikipedia.

This editor has repeatedly been ignoring my contention (based on the sources) that X-ray appearances do not correllate with the presence or absence of tension. One of the sources on pneumothorax (Noppen &amp; De Keukeleire) states unequivocally that mediastinal shift is a common feature on X-rays in people with pneumothorax, and that this is not a proxy for tension. The sources make very clear that tension is defined by the clinical state of the patient. Despite this, Snowmanradio has repeatedly insisted on adding to the image caption that the &quot;X-ray is consistent&quot; with tension, something that one simply cannot conclude from the image. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 01:14, 23 January 2012 (UTC)
I think that Snowmanradio's changes amount to a straightforward NOR violation and should be rejected.  I also think it inappropriate for him to worry about the state of the Commons information page, as what appears not only a completely separate page, but actually a completely separate project is irrelevant to the FAC.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 01:20, 23 January 2012 (UTC)
There is no element of NOR in writing &quot;consistent with tension pneumothorax&quot; in the caption. The original X-ray description on commons said that the person, who was X-rayed had tension penumothorax clinically. I agree with User Doc James that &quot;abc changes are consistent with a diagnosis of xyz&quot; is a commonly used expression. The phrase is used in X-ray reports, pathology reports, and probably many other situations. I think that than an X-ray, like this one, consistent with a potentially life threatening condition should have &quot;consistent with tension pneumothorax&quot; (or another phrase to mention tension pneumothroax or an emergency in an appropriate way) written clearly in the caption. I am concerned partly because readers might look at the image and read its caption, but not read the text in the article. Incidentally, I think that image documentation on Commons it a legitimate topic for FAC, especially when there are important differences between the two. ser:Snowmanradio|Snowman (ser talk:Snowmanradio|talk) 09:54, 23 January 2012 (UTC)

If the fact that this image (or images similar to it) is &quot;consistent with xyz&quot; does not appear in a published, reliable source, then you, that is, the Wikipedia editor, deciding that it happens to be &quot;consistent with xyz&quot; and calling out your own conclusion about the image, is a straightforward violation of NOR.

I am not quite sure exactly what Doc James is saying &quot;yes&quot; too, but I think he is again confirming that &quot;consistent with a tension pneumothorax&quot; is a useful thing to say about this X-ray. I do not see a mass of fibrosis that could be pulling the mediastinum to one side in the lung not affected by the pneumothorax. I maintain that this X-ray is consistent with a tension pneumothorax and that this dangerous possibility should be mentioned in the caption. ser:Snowmanradio|Snowman (ser talk:Snowmanradio|talk) 13:58, 23 January 2012 (UTC)

I agree with Doc James' statement that a person with a &quot;clinically diagnosed tension pneumothorax&quot; should not proceed to x-ray prior to treatment. That assertion alone makes the Commons text questionable. The Commons text continues: &quot;Due to the fact this is an posterior to anterior x-ray of the patients chest, the patient's left is your right (as if you are looking at the patient facing you&quot;. That statement is unequivocally false. The only information that we can definitively claim from the x-ray alone is that there is a pneumothorax with tracheal deviation away from the side of the pneumothorax. We can't even be sure which side is the left; for some reason the marker has been obscured. (I accept that the shape of the heart suggests that the x-ray is in the conventional orientation.)

I am unable to view the links that Doc James provided. Radiologists and pathologists are provided with a lot of extra clinical information. Indeed they keep insisting that clinicians provide as much relevant information as possible, because it assists them in reporting. Despite extra clinical information, radiologists may &quot;sit on the fence&quot; with terms such as &quot;consistent with&quot;, purely because the diagnosis must be made in the clinical context, not from the x-ray alone. ser:Axl|Axl ¤ ser talk:Axl|[Talk] 14:18, 23 January 2012 (UTC)

I would like to advance the discussion, because I think that writing in the possibility of a significant diagnosis in a X-ray or pathology report with &quot;consistent with a diagnosis of xyz&quot; is primarily to inform clinicians useful information and it is not simply a case of &quot;sitting on the fence&quot;. Writing in &quot;consistent with a diagnosis of xyz&quot; is proactive, while at the same time being honest about the limitations of the material or images at hand. It is also for medico-legal reasons, to insure that the clinician is aware of the possibility of a significant diagnosis or sometimes to write in a working clinical diagnosis that has ample alternative documentation. I would agree about delays taken to do an X-ray of a clinical case of tension pneumothorax could be very important here, and the expected delays are dependant on the whereabouts of the patient. I was reading one reference yesterday, which said that some tension pneumothoraces take hours to evolve, while others are very quick. If the X-ray facilities are distant then this would make the time delays of doing an X-ray even more unacceptable. I would agree that the image description on Commons could be improved. The image shown in the article is a cropped version and the un-cropped image can be seen in the file history in Commons. The shape of the heart, a possible stomach bubble under the left of the diaphragm and the possibility of a radio-apaque liver under the diaphragm on the right are all indicators of the left and right orientation, and I think that there is no doubt about its orientation. I had access to two out of three of the external links Doc James provided. ser:Snowmanradio|Snowman (ser talk:Snowmanradio|talk) 14:52, 23 January 2012 (UTC)

 should articles about medical conditions only deal with medical information? 

Should articles about medical conditions only deal with medical information? Or can they also report about what people actually do with their disease, (as far as this practice meets P:notability), even if the medical community has not written anything about it? The current guidelines P:MEDRS do not deal with this topic: they deal with non-academic sources http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources_%28medicine-related_articles%29#Other_sources as sources of medical information, but they do not deal with them as sources of information about social practices related with a medical condition. This is different: I think that medical information should clearly be separated from social practices information, but I also think that both can be part of the same article. For example, volution article has a section &quot;Social and cultural responses&quot;.ser:Mokotillon|Mokotillon (ser talk:Mokotillon|talk) 14:47, 24 January 2012 (UTC)

In most cases, if a medical condition has a significant sociocultural impact one would be able to find something on this in the medical literature. But I agree that if this is not possible, a reliable secondary source is still required. Quite a few medical articles have &quot;Society and culture&quot; sections, where appropriate. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 11:04, 25 January 2012 (UTC)

If you're talking about non-medical stuff—e.g., lawsuits about drugs, references in popular culture, social movements, historical perspectives—then no, you don't need to use medical journals or medical textbooks as your sources.  In fact, while such sources are often available, they're often not the best possible source.  Try a law review for legal issues, a pop culture book for pop culture issues, a sociology text for sociological stuff, a history journal for historical information, and so forth.  And even for medical information, you're not restricted purely to review articles; you can also use good-quality medical textbooks or other kinds of secondary sources.
Given your recent edit history, though, let me clarify what &quot;non-medical&quot; means:  Most of what you'll find at reast cancer awareness is non-medical.  Most of what you'll find at IDS#Society_and_culture is non-medical.

 Open Access Journals and related issues 

There is a serious question about the legitimacy of &quot;open access&quot; journals as sources under P:MEDRS. Clearly, the concept that the author pays to have his paper published is at odds with the traditional model of academic journals, raising questions about the extent to which the journal's editorial standards (assuming it has any to begin with) are compromised by the lure of the cash from the  prospective authors.  Many open access journal publishers have been singled out as nothing more than the academic journal version of a vanity press, others identified as being on a &quot;watchlist&quot; for having vanity press aspects that raise questions. [http://metadata.posterous.com/83235355] This question came to my attention because of a large number of articles in open access journals of recent vintage being extensively used as sources in the Wikipedia article ranscendental Meditation research. See discussion here alk:Transcendental_Meditation_research#Sources_under_scrutiny I question (i) whether any &quot;open access&quot; journal can serve as a source and (ii) if being an &quot;open access&quot; pay-to-play journal is not automatically disqualifying, how we establish for purposes of P:MEDRS whether a particular publisher or a particular journal is indeed high-quality, accepted and reputable. Anybody nowadays can publish an online-only journal, claim to have peer review, put an impressive name on it, and have someone at Wikipedia use it as a source on a medical article. Thoughts? ser:Fladrif|Fladrif (ser talk:Fladrif|talk) 16:05, 24 January 2012 (UTC)

Open access journals and papers more and more becomes the rule rather than the exception in science. PLoS ONE is an good example. ser:Granateple|Granateple (ser talk:Granateple|talk) 17:26, 24 January 2012 (UTC)
This is hardly a medicine-specific issue, it should be discussed at P:RS/N if anywhere, but in short the idea that the method of payment affects the reliability of the result is hardly a new one. We need objective measures of reliability. That's what itation index measurements such as mpact factors and ournal ranking are for, flawed as they may be. For new journals these measures take some time to be established, hence they are generically suspect. Journals with prominent experts on their editorial boards gain some alo effect but we can't quantify that.ser:LeadSongDog|LeadSongDog ser talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl! 17:38, 24 January 2012 (UTC)

If authors are paying to have research published, in smaller, obscure journals, I think this is a big red flag for the reliability of the material (I have not looked into whether this is the case in this instance). Also, after a brief review of the discussion on the TM page, other red flags that immediately rose for me about the journals being discussed include that they are being published in journals that would be typically outside their specific area of interest (in this case nursing and nutrition -- which raises the question of how good the &quot;peer&quot; review actually was) and that the journals, after a quick search, are not MEDLINE indexed (to me almost an immediately disqualifying factor - there are enough journals that ARE MEDLINE indexed that don't meed MEDRS, there is no need to use ones that aren't). ser:Yobol|Yobol (ser talk:Yobol|talk) 17:57, 24 January 2012 (UTC)

No, you are not moving this discussion to RSN. The presumption is staggering. This involves particulary references to specific journals and whether they meet the requirements of P:MEDRS, and there is an ongoing discussion here. This smacks of desparate forum shopping as the initial comments here are hardly favorable to your advocacy of these sources. ser:Fladrif|Fladrif (ser talk:Fladrif|talk) 18:48, 24 January 2012 (UTC)

I didn't say I'd moved this discussion, I said I'd moved a discussion that is more specific per a single source. To be clear.  As well this isn't a DR forum, so whether the source is considered reliable or not and removed should be dealt with on a NB, which it now is. (ser:Littleolive oil|olive (ser talk:Littleolive oil|talk) 21:59, 24 January 2012 (UTC))

A complicating issue is that several institutions require researchers to publish in journal that ensure public access to the material (this notably includes NIH-funded research).  See, for example, [http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2009/12/us-government-looks-to-expand-scientific-open-access-policy.ars this] Ars Technica article, or the [http://publicaccess.nih.gov/ NIH policy].  While this doesn't mandate open access journals, they may be the easiest way to comply with such a requirement.  So I don't think that we can regard open access as automatically suspicious.
That said, there are an awful lot of journals, both open access and with a conventional publishing model, that seem highly dubious from a reliability standpoint.  I wish that we could find some way of sorting the wheat from the chaff.  I haven't looked at any of the sources in this particular case, and hence won't comment on them. ser:Jakew|Jakew (ser talk:Jakew|talk) 18:58, 24 January 2012 (UTC)

Last I checked, the &quot;traditional model of academic journals&quot; was that you paid Elsevier or Springer somewhere between a couple hundred and two thousand bucks a page (depending on the journal) for the privilege of letting them publish your paper.  Some of their journals also have submission fees, i.e., payments made for them to even consider whether they want to publish your article.  They're also now typically charging a couple thousand dollars so that readers won't be charged ~$30 each to read your article.
Why would it be okay to pay Elsevier to publish your paper, but not an outfit that additionally guarantees anyone can read the article for free at no extra cost?  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 19:56, 25 January 2012 (UTC)

We've got Postpartum post traumatic stress disorder, Postnatal post-traumatic stress disorder, and trauma related to childbirth all mentioned in the sources. And a search of PubMed turns up more mentions of general postpartum anxiety, stress, trauma, psychiatric disorders, etc.  So I don't know how to name the article. I found one copyvio, deleted one that might have been, and the sources are primary studies-- I don't know what search term to use for locating reviews. ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 09:50, 25 January 2012 (UTC)
Strikes me that &quot;in postpartum women&quot; would be a tad redundant unless it's to distinguish from eonatal PTSD or aternal PTSD (if such disorders even exist). Searching on &quot;Related Citations for PubMed (Select 8159558)&quot; turns up quite a variety of formulations. Is the article to discuss only partus as the stressor or be more general? The largest envelope would seem to be osttraumatic stress disorder after pregnancy, which would encompass all stressors, including emergency delivery, miscarriage, injuries during pregnancy, and so forth.

I noted a change on my watchlist today on ental disorder by ser|Psychiatrick which looked like material that took material out of context to promote an undue POV.  I note that this user has made numerous other Psychiatry-related pages including sychiatry which have prominently cited the works of psychiatry critic homas Szasz as well as using google book references to publishers I'm not familiar with.  As this user has added numerous similar material across multiple pages, I wanted to see if anyone else is seeing the same problem I am seeing before mucking around with these articles, or if I am missing something (psychiatry being outside my usual comfort zone).

The editor has made thousands of edits! Is there an article or some edits which are of particular concern?

 Do you all think that the article “sychiatry” needs the new section “Criticism” based on reliable sources by physicians and psychiatrists critical of psychiatry? There are a lot of psychiatrists critical of psychiatry, not only oren Mosher, who was a member of the American Psychiatric Association, and homas Szasz, who is its member. Then, why does the article “sychiatry” not have the section “Criticism” and why is psychiatry badly defended from its critics? Biased against them, people do not usually think that criticism of surgery is antisurgery, but they think that any criticism of psychiatry is antipsychiatry, and any critics of psychiatry are unreasonably labeled as antipsychiatrists. ser:Psychiatrick|Psychiatrick (ser talk:Psychiatrick|talk) 14:46, 27 January 2012 (UTC)

I had the very quickest skim over the article and sources. It appears to mostly a historical and social article rather than one dealing with many medical facts, so P:MEDRS isn't the main concern. The sourcing for the emergency birth control drugs at the end isn't appropriate IMO. The article is concerned with
*the dates of FDA approval
*that the drugs are available over-the-counter
*that the drugs are effective for three days and five days after sex (respectively) (hence the '&quot;morning after pill&quot; is a misnomer' point)
For these facts, the papers Sarkar 2001 and by Creinin et al 2006 are not appropriate as sources (nor are they especially interesting or relevant to the reader of this article). It is one thing for a scientific study to show efficacy for five days, say, but another for the drug to be approved and recommended for that duration -- which is what counts in this historical article. I would be quite happy to use any reliable professional US-related secondary source on drugs or birth control. For example, the FDA website if you can find a stable url, or an up-to-date drug reference book.
I'll try to read this article properly later but probably not today. ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 08:38, 25 January 2012 (UTC)

No problem. Oh, and one other point.

 Article Osteopathic Medicine in the United States Nomenclature DO vs. Osteopathic Physician 

I have come to this talk page to discuss this nomenclature issue in an effort to prevent an editing war. A user has been reverting my edits that have changed the phrase &quot;osteopathic physician&quot; to DO. I have laid out several logical reasons for making this change both on the Osteopathic Medicine in the United States page and on the user's talk page. I would like to hear other opinions on the matter. The user has stated more or less that it is his personal preference that osteopathic physician be used to refer to the holder of the DO degree and that DO should be reserved solely for the degree. He believes that referring to osteopathic physicians as DOs will confuse people. However, I completely disagree with him. An example of a sentence using DOs in this way: DOs perform surgery, prescribe medications and attend medical school for four years just like their MD counterparts. It is clear from context in a sentence like this one that the holder of the degree is what is being described by the phrase DO or MD not the degree itself. Clearly, degrees do not perform surgery, prescribe medications, etc. Secondly, DO is potentially less confusing in terms of nomenclature since many people those relatively uninformed about DOs and MDs often conflate U.S. trained osteopathic physicians and foreign osteopaths which are not the same thing. The term DO would make this distinction clearer and lessen confusion. Third, replacing the phrase osteopathic physician, which in an article like this is used extensively, can shorten the article somewhat and make sentences more concise and vary the sentence structure to further improve the writing in addition to the added clarity that will result from my previously mentioned point. Additionally, professional organizations such as the AOA and AACOM use DO to refer to both the holder of the degree and the degree itself in the way I have asserted is acceptable. Here are some links to support this statement: http://www.osteopathic.org/osteopathic-health/about-dos/what-is-a-do/Pages/default.aspx http://www.osteopathic.org/osteopathic-health/about-dos/Pages/default.aspx  http://www.aacom.org/resources/bookstore/cib/Documents/2012cib/2012cib-p21-23.pdf

Also, this same person has insisted in his edits that the plural of DO must be written as DO's which seems incorrect since the plural of MD that I have seen written most often is MDs. I have also found pages from professional DO organizations that write the plural of DO as DOs which is the form I have been advocating. Here are links demonstrating this: http://www.aacom.org/resources/e-news/ome/2011-03/Pages/LoanRepayment.aspx  http://www.osteopathic.org/osteopathic-health/about-dos/Pages/default.aspx  http://www.osteopathic.org/osteopathic-health/about-dos/dos-around-the-world/Pages/default.aspx

So, to sum up my points, the term DO is synonymous with osteopathic physician and should be written as such to make a more parallel comparison with the term MD in this (and other) articles discussing/comparing DOs and MDs and editor's &quot;personal preferences&quot; should not be a deciding factor in an NPOV article.

One last note-people on the user's page (the one who has been undoing the edits) has had people on his own talk page tell him in the past that DO is a more accessible/recognizable term to them and the purpose of wikipedia pages is to inform and serve as a resource of accessible and easily comprehensible information. ser:DoctorK88|DoctorK88 (ser talk:DoctorK88|talk) 19:41, 25 January 2012 (UTC)

Hi. Many lay readers will not know what 'DO' stands for, therefore I think osteopathic physician is more clear and an easier understood term for our readers.--ser:Literaturegeek|Literaturegeek | ser_talk:Literaturegeek |T@1k? 19:51, 25 January 2012 (UTC)

Calling a practitioner &quot;an MD&quot; or &quot;a DO&quot; is equally wrong, even if it is a common error to do so. The granted degree is not the person holding it. Neither is it their license to practice. Our language should be as clear and accurate as we can make it. ser:LeadSongDog|LeadSongDog ser talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl! 20:55, 25 January 2012 (UTC)
 [Disclosure: I am a British doctor and I have limited exposure to the US healthcare system.] My understanding is that &quot;MD&quot; refers to the degree. Use of the abbreviation to denote the holder of the degree is ikt:colloquial|colloquial and should be avoided in a formal setting such as an encyclopedia. I have looked at the [http://www.osteopathic.org/osteopathic-health/about-dos/what-is-a-do/Pages/default.aspx American Osteopathic Medicine] website, and I believe that they use this colloquial term to help engage with lay American readers who are probably already familiar with the colloquial use of &quot;MD&quot;. ser:Axl|Axl ¤ ser talk:Axl|[Talk] 20:58, 25 January 2012 (UTC)


With all due respect Literaturegeek,LeadSongDog I must strongly disagree with you both. DO professional organizations use the term this way and it is used this way commonly in both the DO and MD communities alike not to mention peer-reviewed research uses the terminology this way as do government websites such as the NIH. These titles can be used dually for the degree and for the person who has the degree. It should be clear from context that when an MD performs surgery that it is not the piece of paper doing the action but the holder of the degree. It is simply common sense and I really do not believe it requires further explanation for the lay reader beyond that. As long as a DO or an MD is defined at the beginning of the article, as it is in this particular article for DOs, then the point is moot.  Furthermore, the article starts off by saying what a DO is by definition. The first sentence says &quot;Osteopathic physicians also known as DOs&quot; so I cannot agree that the confusion argument for lay readers is a legitimate one. Again, there will likely be more difficulty for lay readers to distinguish between foreign osteopaths and U.S. trained osteopathic physicians since the names are even more similar than what I am proposing. I have seen numerous posts expressing this confusion in lay readers. As for the claim that these terms are colloquial, that is false. For a term to be colloquial means it is used in everyday language, which it is, but not in more formal writing such as that of academics. However, I have seen these terms used in peer-reviewed literature which is a prime example of academic writing not to mention that professional organizations of these groups use these terms in exactly the way I have proposed. I would be happy to provide links to demonstrate this if you are not convinced, feel free to ask. Also, what do you think about the other point, the plural of DO?ser:DoctorK88|DoctorK88 (ser talk:DoctorK88|talk) 23:59, 25 January 2012 (UTC)

I think you should go read P:MOS#Abbreviations, which prohibits the use of the apostrophe in such circumstances.
Whether professional organizations and some (not all) publications use the informal &quot;DO&quot; to refer to licensed physicians is irrelevant.  Wikipedia aims for a more formal tone.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 01:46, 27 January 2012 (UTC)

If we're being technical here, which I feel like you are being a bit technical here, DO is not a colloquial term. And I am the one advocating for the removal of the apostrophes from the plural of DO if I have not yet made that clear. That is the reason I asked it in the first place, because I removed those apostrophes and someone reverted it. So, just to be clear, consensus has not been reached yet and reversions should not occur until it is reached. The standard for a formal term is not for &quot;all&quot; papers to use it. The threshold is that the term is used in academia and government pages (which should not be ignored) which are indeed formal arenas designed to inform so I must disagree with you on a fundamental level WhatamIdoing. It is not irrelevant because it addresses Leadsongdog's claim that it is colloquial because I showed that by definition, it is not: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloquialism   http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/colloquial   It is a term used in formal settings whether you agree or not and I have shown that.

 Yes Axl, I mixed up the comment you left with one of the other users. I apologize for not having left a DRN notice on your talk page as well to give you notice, it was indeed an oversight on my part. And Literaturegeek I actually looked up consensus before you even wrote your post and what you said is incorrect. While I acknowledge that you followed the &quot;be bold&quot; principle (though the reversion you made had a factual inaccuracy in it) we are supposed to be working toward a compromise and trying to build consensus. To be frank with you, your responses have seemed antagonistic in tone. I hardly think that three or four users and one dissenter (myself) qualifies as consensus. You might say we have near unanimous consensus but I think we are still in the process of consensus building in which we try to persuade one another and reach a mutual compromise. We should have at least made it crystal clear on here that we had made a decision and reached a consensus and that we had finished our discussion and no such communication was given nor do I believe that phase is over, I believe we are still at the stage of presenting arguments and evidence since new objections have come up and I have addressed them. As for the discussion board, I addressed on there why I did that. It was because I got minimal response and the substance of the arguments presented was largely ignored not to mention the board seemed like a place to seek outside help.

No, you haven't proven that the abbreviation is formal.  You've only said that it's used in certain kinds of publications.  
Encyclopedia Brittanica is a general-purpose encyclopedia.  Thefreedictionary.com is not an ncyclopedia of any sort.  Generally, if we're trying to figure out whether something has &quot;encyclopedic tone&quot; (the particular variant of formal tone best favored for the English Wikipedia), we look at what professionally edited general-purpose encyclopedias choose.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 05:21, 28 January 2012 (UTC)

 Let's be clear here, I have shown that it is used in more than &quot;certain kinds of publications.&quot; Please do not ignore the fact that I have shown that it is used not only in a formal setting such as peer-reviewed academic research but also in government pages and by professional organizations. These do have significance as well. And if you believe wikipedia, which I don't always, I take wikipedia articles with a grain of salt, it does say that thefreedictionary.com is a dictionary and encyclopedia but believe what you want. As for Encyclopedia Britannica, do you have any other recommendations? I do not have access to that encyclopedia online and I currently do not own a copy. Not to mention that Encyclopedia Britannica is not a make it or break it criterion for a word being formal or not. I have shown its use repeatedly in formal settings. It seems to me like you keep changing the stakes and the burden of proof higher and higher and just give another hoop to jump through after I have done so already. As for the &quot;certain kinds of publications&quot; theory, I have found quite a few that use it and from different journals.

An proper descriptive term such as &quot;osteopathic physician&quot; is generally preferable to an acronym (DO), which could refer to many things, see O. If this article were written for a specific audience with some medical/technical knowledge, I would support the notion that DO might be preferable, however, since the article is written for a general, layman audience, the most unambiguous terms possible are preferable.  This policy is consistent across WP:MED.  Obviously, &quot;physician&quot; is highly preferable to the term &quot;MD&quot;.  Further, using the term &quot;DO&quot; widely creates confusion since in other regions of the world the degree &quot;DO&quot; refers to a different level of professional designation. Finally, the use of the term &quot;osteopathic physician&quot; is widely supported within the American Osteopathic profession, see [http://www.do-online.org/TheDO/?p=24181 AOA position on use of &quot;osteopathic physician.&quot;] ser:Hopping|Bryan Hopping ser talk:Hopping|T  23:29, 28 January 2012 (UTC)

Hopping, I already addressed this point about DO on the article's page. It is a moot point because the term is defined at the beginning of the article very clearly so your concern over the ambiguity doesn't really seem valid. The article, as currently written, I'm sure can be understood by a broad reader base. There is nothing inherently more descriptive about the term osteopathic physician that makes that term any clearer than DO meaning Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine which it does say at the start of the article. Again, you can use the word physician to refer to both MDs and DOs but since people insist on discussing their differences even though they have more similarities than differences, this is the easiest way to distinguish between them without using the allopathic/osteopathic dichotomy which carries pejorative connotations that many in the MD community have voiced concerns and anger about. I have seen on your talk page that people have had such discussions with you. It is only your opinion that the term physician is &quot;highly preferable&quot; to MD but this is not a statement based on facts or evidence. I also disagree with you fundamentally about DO creating more confusion within lay readers since osteopathic physicians is a term close enough that many lay readers conflate this term with osteopath (foreign-trained) and I have seen people express this sentiment to you on your very own talk page so I cannot understand how you can honestly believe that when experience should have shown you otherwise. I never have said that the AOA does not support the use of the term osteopathic physician, I think the term is perfectly acceptable, however, you have said that the substitution of DO for this term is not acceptable, this is not the same thing. I have no issue with the term osteopathic physician, I am arguing for the validity of DO as a substitution for it. Again, it is only your opinion that a term such as &quot;osteopathic physician&quot; is a &quot;proper descriptive term.&quot; So, once again, I must strongly disagree with your statement here Hopping. ser:DoctorK88|DoctorK88 (ser talk:DoctorK88|talk) 00:40, 29 January 2012 (UTC)

 &quot;Physician&quot; is a noun; &quot;osteopathic&quot; is an adjective.

WhatamIdoing, again, you are changing your objection/criteria here. First, you said it only needs to be present in general-purpose encyclopedias, and now you are saying that because it is in the &quot;topics&quot; and not the &quot;articles&quot; that it does not count. Frankly, when I looked at the website I did not even see that this distinction was made. Regardless, this encyclopedia is professionally edited as you requested. I sincerely have the feeling that no matter what evidence I present you are always going to find fault with it. Did you mean that the article derives its content from AACOM? I do not see any references in the topic page to the AOA nor do I see anything taken from that page though perhaps I am looking in the wrong area. The link you sent me led to where I looked. If you look under the first tab Gale's Encyclopedia of Alternative Medicine you will see what I referenced. The link you sent me only had &quot;encyclopedias&quot; checked, not articles. When I chose to refine it to just articles they all said that the page no longer exists so I have absolutely no clue what you're talking about at all. Regardless, I have shown use in a general-purpose encyclopedia. I actually see in the description of the articles, even though they don't work when I try to open any of them, the title DO used to represent the holder of the degree.

Hopping, please read above. You keep rehashing the same point over and over again that DO can mean many things. Yes, it can. And at the very start of the article it is clearly defined what DO means in that article to eliminate confusion. There are lots of words like that in the English language. This is why we define what we mean at the beginning of the article, for clarity and to eliminate ambiguity. The same applies in this article. It is defined extremely clearly such that I am very confident that someone with a middle school reading level would be capable of understanding that DO, as it is being used in this article, refers to osteopathic physicians. I mean, the second sentence says, and I quote: &quot;Osteopathic physicians, known as DOs, are licensed to practice medicine and surgery in all 50 states and are recognized in forty-seven other countries (a factual inaccuracy, it is 55 countries), including most Canadian provinces.&quot; Frankly, it does not get much clearer than that, Hopping. Please read what I write here carefully because I have addressed this point of yours numerous times now both here and on the article's talk page and repeating your point does not make it more valid. I have already demonstrated Hopping how DO is synonymous with osteopathic physician, which you have already agreed to on the article's talk page. You said the issue was not the validity of the term DO but when to use it. I'm quoting you here: &quot;the issue is not IF the acronym should be used, but when.&quot; So, I feel like you are changing your argument considerably here in that respect. Literaturegeek, believe it or not, I really did not expect the substitution of DO for osteopathic physician to be so controversial. From my point of view, I feel like you guys reacted with a far greater magnitude to this than I ever would have expected. I have also consulted people in real life about this issue and they agree with me (about my position and the unexpected controversy generated) though I realize this is not evidence here, it is just anecdotal. I could ask the same question of you and the others, why you oppose this change so vehemently.

There's no controversy here. This is an encyclopedia.  This encyclopedia has a widely-accepted standard, namely that we use descriptive English prose in our articles whenever possible, avoiding acronyms, because all acronyms are ambiguous. That is not to say acronyms should never be used, rather the preference in this encyclopedia to use descriptive language (nouns and adjectives) over acronyms (letters and numbers).ser:Hopping|Bryan Hopping ser talk:Hopping|T  15:04, 30 January 2012 (UTC)

 Acronyms are not ambiguous when you clearly define them Hopping, that is the entire point which you are making me repeat. I am running out of ways to say this.

Defining an acronym at the beginning of an article is helpful, however it does not eliminate the ambiguity with regard to future use of the term.  The preference is not use symbols or acronyms in articles whenever possible, but to use standard English terms.  &quot;DO&quot; is two letters and therefore not standard English. &quot;Osteopathic physician&quot; is a noun and an adjective, therefore it is standard English. ser:Hopping|Bryan Hopping ser talk:Hopping|T  13:37, 31 January 2012 (UTC)

Actually, unless otherwise defined in an article, defining the acronym does eliminate ambiguity within that article, Hopping. That is just how the English language works. You only need to go through a few articles to find abbreviations used that are defined at the beginning of the article and reader knowledge is then assumed when using that same abbreviation unless it is defined again as something else though most editors would use a different acronym to minimize confusion in readers, e.g. preventing the use of the acronym IC on the Interstitial Cystitis page for more than just the term interstitial cystitis. DO is clearly defined at the start and is acceptable. MD is used throughout the article, do you have an issue with that as well? What about the word an? That's two letters. DO is defined at the start of the article as equivalent to osteopathic physician. Regardless of your arguments that largely ignore the substance of the arguments I have been putting forth, I have read Mr. Stradivarius' comments and though I disagree with him on some things, he did have one suggestion that I found acceptable. He suggested that instead of collapsing osteopathic physician to DO that we instead expand the term MD which I think is fine. So, instead, I think we should change osteopathic physician to Doctors of osteopathic medicine and MD to Doctors of Medicine to improve clarity and go away from the allopathic/osteopathic dichotomy. I sincerely hope there are no objections to this because if there are then that's getting a little ridiculous. ser:DoctorK88|DoctorK88 (ser talk:DoctorK88|talk) 16:38, 31 January 2012 (UTC)

 A couple of things WhatamIdoing. First of all, I am not &quot;asking the other parent.&quot; It is true that you and the other editors with the exception of one have disagreed with me (unreasonably so in my opinion) but you have all also ignored the substance of my arguments and evidence presented by and large. Furthermore, I have also stated, several times, that I do not believe we have a representative view of the wikipedia community in this discussion yet with so few editors contributing. I initially hoped for far more voices to take part in this debate when I started discussing this on more public forums. I suggest WhatamIdoing that you not jump to conclusions and tone down the antagonistic tone in your responses. You are attempting to turn this into a personal argument and I refuse to participate in such nonsense. I am not being disruptive, I am presenting arguments/evidence for an issue that is worthy of discussion and I have been addressing objections to my proposal, so your assertions seems quite illogical to me. I have clearly stated my reasons for an Rfc. If you choose to ignore them, that's your decision but I won't stand for false accusations being thrown in my direction. If we're being frank here, I do not care about your personal opinion about whether or not I should discuss this issue. That is not a relevant factor to me. You are free to not participate in the discussion if you wish, that is your choice. If the Rfc shows that the wikipedia community by and large does not want this change, as I have said, if you read my comments carefully, which you clearly didn't, then you would have seen that I said I would drop the issue and accept the baffling resistance to such a slight change in nomenclature. I urge you to adjust your tone and work in a way that is constructive so that we may all find a solution that everyone finds agreeable. You have been very resistant to doing this from the start judging from your comments. I do not know if you have a personal issue about this issue but you should do your best to check that at the door. This is a forum for debating the issue, not personal attacks. Additionally, I have seen Mr. Stradivarius' closing comments on the DRN and one suggestion of his seemed acceptable to me though I disagreed wholly with the rest of his statement about the persuasiveness of certain arguments and I told him so. The suggestion that seemed acceptable was to expand the term M.D. instead of collapsing that of osteopathic physician which seems fine. Perhaps it would be better to change osteopathic physician to Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (a more descriptive and modern time in my opinion and one I sincerely doubt anyone will find objectionable, if you do, I think you're being a little ridiculous at this point) and M.D. to Doctor of Medicine. I think this solution will serve as the closest thing to a compromise with the best possible outcome for all parties and will address concerns of clarity, recognition, formality, etc. I would appreciate hearing what you all think about this, in a calm, respectful manner.

I'm going off of something Mr. Stradivarius said because he seemed very reasonable to me and it seemed like a nice middle ground though I see that, as usual, WhatamIdoing has takes issue with it. Regarding the difference between holders of these degrees and those who can are also licensed, we can simply add a sentence that informs readers that not all Doctors of Medicine and Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine, the holders of these degrees, are necessarily licensed to practice medicine. That should eliminate any confusion stemming from this area. ser:DoctorK88|DoctorK88 (ser talk:DoctorK88|talk) 02:07, 1 February 2012 (UTC)
This has the unfortunate side effect of making the statement be about anyone who holds the degree, rather than about licensed physicians.  Degree holders without a license are not legally permitted to practice medicine, and thus some statements would be materially false.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 23:44, 31 January 2012 (UTC)

DrK, unlike you, I really don't care about the subject one way or the other.  My primary goal at this point is to introduce you to the reality of working on the English Wikipedia.  Sometimes you &quot;lose&quot;, even when you believe your arguments and evidence to be compelling and your opponents to be baffling, ignorant, thoughtless idiots.  This is very likely to be one of those times for you.  
Here's another fact that you need to know:  You've already had a dozen different editors tell you that DO is not the right choice.  That's not &quot;so few editors contributing&quot;; that's a high level of input for a single dispute.  Look over the rest of this page, and count up the number of people commenting on any single topic.  Look over a typical noticeboard like P:RSN or P:ELN and see how many people comment on any single question.  See how many more people have rejected your &quot;arguments and evidence&quot; compared to those other discussions?  The English Wikipedia may have thousands of editors, but very, very, very few comment in discussions like this.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 23:44, 31 January 2012 (UTC)

Well, obviously that's complete nonsense. I think you should use Mr. Stradivarius as a model of how to speak to other people on wikipedia. He was quite professional and though I disagreed with what he had to say, there was nothing in his words that had a hostile tone or unnecessary negativity towards others. Your attitude on the other hand has been very transparent in your comments. Even this last one is very rude. And it's difficult to &quot;lose&quot; an argument when people do not address the substance of your arguments. Actually, I have not had a dozen, though we're close and one person did agree with me and people objected for different reasons from each other if you read carefully. Again, I addressed these concerns with logical arguments and evidence and that was ignored for the most part. Seriously, tone down the antagonistic rhetoric. Even now you still do not sound like you are trying to work in a constructive manner with me and the other editors to find a solution. People may have rejected arguments and evidence but on what grounds? Exactly. Very little in response was given to show why the arguments were rejected. That is how debate works. And I know how wikipedia works just fine, though I do have to admit I have some very deep reservations about its flawed policies. That being said, most other editors I have encountered on here have been civil in tone which I do not believe you have been from the start. It does not matter how many people have talked about this particular issue compared to other issues on this specific page. Either way, it is not representative of the wikipedia community's opinion. That being said, how many editors you need exactly to constitute a representative view seems unclear to me based on wikipedia's policies, one of many I think is deeply flawed. However, none of this is an excuse for you to be unprofessional and not stick to the issues and attempt to make it personal. You say you aren't but the rhetoric/tone of your words speaks volumes and it says different. I am quite familiar with reality and with the way wikipedia works, thanks but don't do me any favors that I don't ask you to do WhatamIdoing. I would prefer not to receive unsolicited &quot;advice&quot; from you which obviously does not have genuine friendly intent behind it. And I find it unbelievable that yet again that even when I extend an olive branch and make a very sound compromise offer that it is immediately shot down, more importantly, without a counteroffer or modification offered. Simply remarkable and very unfortunate.ser:DoctorK88|DoctorK88 (ser talk:DoctorK88|talk) 01:36, 1 February 2012 (UTC)
I would be of the opinion, that it is you who is ignoring evidence and logical arguments.--ser:Literaturegeek|Literaturegeek | ser_talk:Literaturegeek |T@1k? 01:41, 1 February 2012 (UTC)

How do you figure? I have addressed objections made and countered them with logical arguments and evidence. I have jumped through the hoops people have asked me to but there just seems to be no satisfying any of you. What arguments did I ignore exactly and not address at all? I have heard many &quot;subjective opinions&quot; out of the other editors but I have yet to see people provide links and logical arguments to substantiate their claims. I have heard other editors say it will be confusing to other readers (an opinion, in fact literaturegeek that was you who said that first), wikipedia policy (I acknowledge that abbreviations should be avoided if &quot;unwarranted&quot; but what does it mean when an abbreviation is &quot;unwarranted&quot;?) I have addressed whether or not the term is colloquial and shown that by definition it is not even though the proof I showed was not up to other editors &quot;expectations.&quot;  I have shown that DO and osteopathic physician do mean the same thing and that yes, DO can mean the degree, it can also be used to mean Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine and I addressed the claims of ambiguity of the term with the response that it is clearly defined at the beginning of the article what the term DO means within the context of that article. I have also disagreed about the issue of whether or not we reached consensus but I did address it. I just scanned the entirety of this whole discussion. Please let me know which arguments/evidence I failed to address and I will address it, Literaturegeek. It really is the other way around, if you don't believe that, that is okay, but that is what I believe based on what I just read (this whole discussion). Aside from that, I have also been civil to other editors here and do not feel that all editors here have returned the same courtesy. I feel like a broken record here but let's stick to the issues, shall we? And instead of simply shooting down others' ideas, perhaps make counteroffers, modifications, revisions, changes, etc to work towards a compromise.  ser:DoctorK88|DoctorK88 (ser talk:DoctorK88|talk) 02:03, 1 February 2012 (UTC)
Wow. I have been an editor on Wikipedia for years. I can honestly say I've yet to see anything quite like this.  Among the numerous reasons why this is so unusual, one stands out as particularly noteworthy.  The acronym &quot;DO&quot; is already used in the article, several dozen times, alongside and in conjunction with the term &quot;osteopathic physician.&quot;  As anyone with knowledge of the topic would wholeheartedly affirm, it would literally be impossible to discuss this topic without using both terms.  As per well established Wikipedia guidelines, and quite frankly common sense, the term &quot;osteopathic physician&quot; is used more frequently for clarity. Nevertheless, the use of the term DO is unavoidable, as reflected by its long-accepted usage in the good article in question.  In other words, this entire controversy, manufactured single-handedly by &quot;DoctorK88&quot;, can only be interpreted as either a ruse of epic proportions, or an episode of cognitive dysfunction so profound, it should hereafter be referred to by its own acronym, CD. ser:Hopping|Bryan Hopping ser talk:Hopping|T  03:47, 1 February 2012 (UTC)

Hopping, a couple of things. One, that was incredibly rude. For a physician, I really think you have a great deal of maturing to do in terms of how you interact with other people. I did not manufacture a controversy here. I made a suggestion and received very vigorous objections to it which I responded to with equal vigor. It is not &quot;impossible&quot; as you say to discuss osteopathic medicine without the term osteopathic physician and I have NEVER said that I want the term osteopathic physician completely stricken from the article, so please do not put words in my mouth. I am advocating for DO as a valid substitute for osteopathic physician but I have acknowledged (repeatedly) that there is nothing wrong with the term osteopathic physician itself, you and the other editors are saying that my proposal is what is not acceptable to all of you. There is no ruse and there is no cognitive dysfunction (a very rude accusation sir, you really should be ashamed of yourself for attempting a personal attack like that). And I know people in real life who use the term DO more frequently than that of osteopathic physician so your claim of common sense is not true, it really depends on who you ask which term is used preferentially. Not to mention that I take exception to your implication that I have no common sense, especially when I have previously shown that arguments you have proposed are moot. It really is not important how long you have been an editor on wikipedia, that does not make your arguments any more persuasive or logical. And your comment displays yet another egregious attempt to avoid working to finding a mutually acceptable solution. I feel like my words are no longer registering because I have said this so many times and nothing changes with the tone in your responses. In one ear and out the other. Please try to refrain from attempting to engage me in a personal argument, I am not going to have that argument with you, Hopping. Once again, let's stick to the issues and be mature. Okay? Great. ser:DoctorK88|DoctorK88 (ser talk:DoctorK88|talk) 04:27, 1 February 2012 (UTC)
DoctorK88, do you feel the community is required to find a solution that is acceptable to you?--ser:Taylornate|Taylornate (ser talk:Taylornate|talk) 04:47, 1 February 2012 (UTC)

No, but I do expect respect and courtesy from other editors and for them to keep the discussion to the issue at hand and not resort to personal attacks. I am trying to establish collaboration/cooperation but regrettably, I am encountering a great deal of resistant, antagonistic behavior. I never said a solution that is solely acceptable to me Taylornate. So please do not put words in my mouth. If you read what I wrote carefully, I said a mutually acceptable solution/a solution we are all satisfied with. ser:DoctorK88|DoctorK88 (ser talk:DoctorK88|talk) 04:55, 1 February 2012 (UTC)
If everyone else is satisfied, to ask for a mutually acceptable solution is to ask for a solution that is acceptable to you.  Do you think the community is required to satisfy everyone?--ser:Taylornate|Taylornate (ser talk:Taylornate|talk) 05:59, 1 February 2012 (UTC)

 Not &quot;everyone&quot; else is satisfied as you say. Especially considering the debate has not concluded. And actually, the concept of consensus on wikipedia is ill-defined and people far more familiar with wikipedia than myself have agreed that it is quite a vague policy. I understand that it is the current policy and acknowledge that. Regardless, the point of these things is to work cooperatively. No, I don't think the community is required to satisfy everyone, I do think however that the community should  try to find a solution that satisfies as many as editors as possible. I do not feel like the other editors are trying to do that. Instead of trying to work towards a compromise they have been consistently shooting down suggestions without backing up their claims, not making counteroffers, modifications, etc. of the idea, basically contributing to the process in a constructive way. That is what I am saying. To say that everyone is satisfied seems like a big oversimplification to me when only a few of us have spoken on here. That is why I put out an Rfc, to get a much larger variety of opinions. I have already stated repeatedly above that if it is clear that the wikipedia community in general decides it does not agree with the proposal then I will accept that decision even if it is to my befuddlement and I find it very strange. Regardless, the point of a discussion here is to work on ideas and be constructive, and it is certainly not to wage uncalled for personal attacks. Understand that this all came from my proposal of a relatively minor change in nomenclature. That proposal was met with some very harsh responses when I did not just blindly accept their objections and actually defended my proposal and gave reasons why I thought it should be put in place. I came here to have a discussion and while of course everyone wants to get their own way in wikipedia and agree wholly with what they have to say, I am not so stubborn and inflexible as to be close minded to the idea of compromise and working toward a solution that satisfies everyone. Again, I did say everyone, yes, including me, but also them and that is important. The point is I am making adjustments and offering alternatives and being as constructive as I can Taylor. That is my gripe. Rude behavior on here is absolutely unacceptable and counterproductive. ser:DoctorK88|DoctorK88 (ser talk:DoctorK88|talk) 06:57, 1 February 2012 (UTC)

 There's no need to quote me in the future. I know what I said. Yeah, it satisfies you guys (again, most of whom I maintain never tried to work with me constructively in the first place, Axl you were an exception to this) however, as I have said before, altogether we make up an extremely limited sample size and we are not representative of wikipedia's community view here. When I say I am not so inflexible as to reject a decision that befuddles me because I find it wholly illogical, I am referring to one with a wider variety of opinions included which is what I have been trying to achieve for a while now with the Rfc, etc. Not to mention that the bulk of the arguments/evidence I presented earlier went largely ignored from the start. Furthermore, even if you believe that most editors would be satisfied with the solution you guys in particular want, it is not a satisfactory excuse (I know you did not say this Axl but other editors seem to kind of sweep this issue under the rug) for the earlier behavior exhibited.  ser:DoctorK88|DoctorK88 (ser talk:DoctorK88|talk) 15:07, 1 February 2012 (UTC)

FWIW, I disagree with the changes proposed by DoctorK88 for reasons which have already been adequately summarised. To be perfectly honest, I'm not sure why such an insignificant issue has dragged on for so long and wasted so many people's time. I see no problem with the article as it is. ser:Watermelon mang|Watermelon mang (ser talk:Watermelon mang|talk) 15:20, 1 February 2012 (UTC)

 I agree that it has dragged on. Every attempt I have made to expedite the process has been met with disapproval and quite a bit of resistance. The majority of my responses to objections were ignored Watermelon and editors continued to put the burden of proof on me and said unless I provided this evidence or that evidence then their objection stood. That is what dragged this out. I have been calling for more cooperative behavior to expedite this process for quite a while now. When I have made alternative suggestions they have been shot down with no counteroffers made or modifications suggested. The article still needs some work. The allopathic/osteopathic terminology is outdated and I think we should move away from it which is why I also made the alternative suggestion of changing osteopathic physician to Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine and DO to Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine and MD to Doctor of Medicine and including a sentence that informs readers that not all holders of these medical degrees are licensed physicians. Like I said before, I never expected such a benign proposal of nomenclature change to generate such a harsh response. ser:DoctorK88|DoctorK88 (ser talk:DoctorK88|talk) 15:31, 1 February 2012 (UTC)
DK, what you see as an attempt at expediting, I think most others see as dragging something out that has already ended.  You need to understand that while relatively few people have commented, they are representative of the people who would care enough to comment.  Most of the thousands of editors just aren't interested.  What you've seen here is the full extent of the community view.--ser:Taylornate|Taylornate (ser talk:Taylornate|talk) 15:57, 1 February 2012 (UTC)
DoctorK88, people did respond, and the general consensus was strongly against the DO abreviation. Your dragging it out with so much discussion over this 'DO issue' is approaching P:DISRUPT|disruptive editor levels, in particular P:IDIDNTHEARTHAT. Your proposal was benign, your dragging the benign issue was not benign but disruptive by wasting people's time. With regard to changing &quot;osteopathic physician to Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine and DO to Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine and MD to Doctor of Medicine and including a sentence that informs readers that not all holders of these medical degrees are licensed physicians&quot;, I would say preliminarily that I would be fine with that, but I would like see what others have to say (pros and cons) about this change, before comitting a support or oppose view.--ser:Literaturegeek|Literaturegeek | ser_talk:Literaturegeek |T@1k? 16:14, 1 February 2012 (UTC)

We've discussed this before, and using allopathic to describe conventional medicine has always been opposed.  The term is incorrect on its face, was originally intended to be insulting, is offensive to a significant fraction of non-DO-holding physicians (who may have MDs, MBBSs, or other degrees), and is easily confused with the alternative medicine branch of allopathy (homeopathy uses diluted onion juice to treat watery eyes; allopathy uses the same diluted onion juice to treat dry eyes).  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 20:08, 1 February 2012 (UTC)
Interesting—I didn't know that.--ser:Taylornate|Taylornate (ser talk:Taylornate|talk) 20:25, 1 February 2012 (UTC)

Since I got so many responses I will address each one individually. First, Taylornate. I did not drag this out, I disagree (now and then) that consensus was reached with such a small amount of wikipedia users, if you read above, that is why I said we should continue the discussion. So few people are not representative of the wikipedia community, you and I disagree at a fundamental level there. People who &quot;care enough to comment&quot; is not who this wikipedia is for. It is for everybody, not for the interested few. This is not the full extent of the community view, you and I are not going to agree there, period. 
Literaturegeek, you are incorrect here. People did not respond to most of the arguments and evidence I put forth with logical counterarguments showing why what I said was invalid, etc. All I received were comments like oh,   no, you haven't proven your point or oh, no, you've only shown it in a few sources, now that's not good enough, etc.  Most people did not say something to the effect of &quot;you're arguments are incorrect, or illogical because...&quot; and show why that was the case. Yes, people &quot;responded&quot; to me, but not in a constructive way that discredited my arguments, most of them were side stepped or we just disagreed fundamentally but after reviewing these discussions of ours I see little effort to provide evidence that renders my arguments invalid and shows my evidence to be false. So, again, we are going to disagree on a fundamental level here, Literaturegeek (not surprising to me, we have disagreed the entire time). How taylornate, is one additional sentence wordy? It's not. Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine is not a big difference from osteopathic physician in terms of &quot;wordiness&quot; and I did not say it needs to be used for the entirety of the article, I was suggesting more along the lines of using it to define the term at the earlier parts of the article. I was not disruptive at all Literaturegeek, I actually looked up wikipedia's definition of disruptive and our debate did not fall under one single category of it. I would contend that the disruptive behavior was yours, WhatamIdoing's and Hopping's with your rude, antagonistic tones (from the start). Feel free to continue discussing the Doctor of Medicine/Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine substitution instead of the shift of osteopathic physician to DO, I am now washing my hands of the whole thing. I have more important things to attend to, this has become a drag on my time and if I can be frank, I am exhausted from dealing with editors such as yourselves (most of you, not all of you) who I find to be unreasonable and uncooperative (again, from the start, not from a dragged out debate which would have gone much faster had people directly addressed my arguments and evidence). I am mainly disappointed in the behavior exhibited by many of the other editors here, not angry or sad, just disappointed and now a bit tired. There is no need to respond to this last response of mine because I will not see it. Do what you like, if you are satisfied with your illogical arguments, most of which I have proven to be false, then so be it. I do hope that in the future you can work with me in a  collaborative and cooperative fashion. Make no mistake, I am not leaving mad, I am just finished with this debate since the discussion is no longer going anywhere and you have become very sidetracked with whether or not we should have the debate instead of the issue itself despite my attempts to try and get you to focus on the issue at hand. The silver lining was to see that there are reasonable, professional editors such as Axl, Mr. Stradivarius and Pesky. I sincerely hope you use them as models for your interactions with other editors in the future, best of luck to you all in whatever you are doing. Consider the matter, on my end, officially closed. You can continue to talk about Doctor of Medicine/Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine replacement of MD and DO, respectively if you wish. I will no longer be participating. Consider me retired.
Do you think that some of your criticisms of other editors could apply to you? I have read over my brief interactions above with you and I believe I was actually quite calm and reasonable when typing to you.

 ndothelium article edit 

In my opinion, the endothelium has, for too long been, overlooked and generally ignored when it is the originating organ in most CVD events. What I would like to see is an article that is accessible to the average person without medical training as well as being useful to the professional. Next, people, professionals too, need to know that to take care of their heart, they have to take care of their endothelium. Third, the present article does not have a history section and I think that would be an improvement. Fourth, the present article mixes disfunction and function.

Most seem to be attached to Wikiproject Psychology. Is someone from Wikiproject Medicine liaising with them on article choice? --ser:Anthonyhcole|Anthonyhcole (ser talk:Anthonyhcole|talk) 10:42, 10 February 2012 (UTC)
Not that I am aware of. It would be good if someone can reach out to the profs in question and offer medicine specific guidance. I am away for the next few weeks.ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) 16:50, 12 February 2012 (UTC)

 Comment requested 

There is an RfC at alk:Circumcision#RfC: how should the lead summarise positions of medical associations?.  Input would be appreciated. ser:Jakew|Jakew (ser talk:Jakew|talk) 21:08, 11 February 2012 (UTC)

 Dissociative identity disorder popular vs scientific history 

Hi everyone.  Brand new editor here, about a month, first time doing something like this so excuse my mistakes please.
As seen [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Dissociative_identity_disorder#Scientific_history| here], WLU, Jlfosternz and I have been very actively collaborating on the DID article very successfully and we are discussing a unique phenomena with DID history which is that there is significant cultural history that is mostly independent of the scientific/research history, and vice versa.  Additionally, both of these areas have hot contention from two very opposite sides who mostly refuse  to even cite or in some cases even acknowledge the existence of the other.  This makes for a very busy and disordered [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_identity_disorder#History| history] section, and a big general challenge for the article itself (we are working hard on it though!).  We all agree something needs to be done with the history section, but are not sure how exactly to do it appropriately and aren't sure of any precedent for this kind of thing.  Any help or ideas are appreciated, thank you. ser:Forgottenfaces|Forgotten Faces (ser talk:Forgottenfaces|talk) 22:52, 11 February 2012 (UTC)

 lantar fasciitis 

More eyes, please on lantar fasciitis.  There appears to be a coordinated effort by some IPs to add positive, remove negative information with regards to extracorporeal shockwave therapy to the page.  More eyes on the page/voices on the talk page would be helpful. ser:Yobol|Yobol (ser talk:Yobol|talk) 18:41, 12 February 2012 (UTC)

I'm going to watch this page, thank you! ser:NCurse|NCurse  ser talk:NCurse|work 07:38, 13 February 2012 (UTC)

 epA 

I tagged this article, epA, mostly because it is too technical for the literate reader who has no knowledge within this field P:NOT#JARGON. There is no way for me to vouch for the accuracy of the article. Also it looks like the vocabulary has been taken from some academic journal article, but I am unable to determine if this is so. I was wondering if someone from this project can take a look at this article for accuracy and maybe make sure it is not a copyright violation. Thanks in advance. ---- ser:Steve Quinn|Steve Quinn (ser talk:Steve Quinn|talk) 19:31, 14 February 2012 (UTC)
Seems like a good article to me.  Technically specific where appropriate and discursive down below where it is useful.ser:Terry Dwyer|Terry Dwyer (ser talk:Terry Dwyer|talk) 13:10, 17 February 2012 (UTC)
 Phew, it's heavy going! Perhaps the author should read P:MTAA. I skimmed the reference abstracts, and the text seems to be accurate. ser:Axl|Axl ¤ ser talk:Axl|[Talk] 15:24, 17 February 2012 (UTC)</segment>
