 Crash course/Beginner's Guide developed for Students 4 Best Evidence editing campaign 

Hello Everyone,

Students 4 Best Evidence is planning a Wiki Week from September 15 to 19 to encourage students to add evidenced based content to Wikipedia health articles. http://www.students4bestevidence.net/s4be-wiki-week-15th-19th-september/

In addition to adding great content during the edit-a-thon, the aim of the campaign is to encourage the students to settle in long term and continue editing medical articles. To help guide the students contributions, we have identified a few tasks that are useful for the medical articles:

*add high quality references to health articles.
*rewrite health article leades to be a comprehensive overview of the topic in simple language with sufficient references.
*add maintenance templates to health articles that need further attention.
*remove duplicate content or excessive wording from existing health articles.
*fill in gaps in content in existing health articles using high quality sources.

For the ducation Program:Students 4 Best Evidence/Students 4 Best Evidence, September editing campaign () this months, Ammar developed a crash course/beginners guide to help the students get started. http://www.students4bestevidence.net/wikipedia-medicine-newbie-crash-course/

We're encouraging the students to create an account and do practice edits before the day of the edit-a-thon, so we will likely see the new medical editors coming in over the next few weeks. Sydney Poore/ser:FloNight|FloNightser talk:FloNight|♥♥♥♥ 22:04, 1 September 2014 (UTC)

 With regard to this point, &quot;rewrite health article leades to be a comprehensive overview of the topic in simple language with sufficient references&quot;, I believe that references in the lede generally are unneeded/discouraged.  The lede summarizes the article, rather than introducing new moments.  The references belong in the various subsections.  --ser:Hordaland|Hordaland (ser talk:Hordaland|talk) 18:17, 3 September 2014 (UTC)
I disagree. I think referencing the lead is important and should be done routinely. Especially as we are just translating the leads of key medical topics. ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 18:24, 3 September 2014 (UTC)
That makes sense, but there's no mention at all of a lede section in p:MEDMOS. Just overlooked? ser:LeadSongDog|LeadSongDog ser talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl! 18:38, 3 September 2014 (UTC)
 The policy on this is in P:LEADCITE. There is nothing wrong with citations in the lead, if they are needed. There just tend to be fewer citations, as most of a lead will be a summarization of the rest of the article. Alternative names for a topic, for instance, may only be mentioned in the lead and may need a reference to back them. Stubs are often all lead and could certainly use citations. --ser:Mark viking|Mark viking (ser talk:Mark viking|talk) 19:01, 3 September 2014 (UTC)
*As Doc James says, the reason that medical articles include references in the lead is so that they can be translated to other languages with adequate references. And also if references are included in the lead, it can be taken from the article and used separately as a good plain language overview of the topic. Sydney Poore/ser:FloNight|FloNightser talk:FloNight|♥♥♥♥ 21:46, 3 September 2014 (UTC)
**Without citations in the lead the lead often fills up with &quot;citation needed&quot; tags. These are a pain to continually clean up and it is thus easier to reference the article. ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 04:38, 4 September 2014 (UTC)

 COI query - Moving section from existing article to its own article space 

There is a section in an existing article that I feel merits an article in its own right. The original article is John Travis (physician) and the section is the Illness-Wellness Continuum. This is a model that has been (and still is) widely used in relation to wellbeing and I feel it is sufficiently notable to move into its own space. I have expanded the original section - currently residing in my sandbox: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Fbell74/sandbox

As I have a connection to the creator of this concept I wanted to get the views of editors on this to see if it maintains neutrality. I originally posted this comment in the Teahouse but another editor (ser:Dodger67|Roger (Dodger67)) suggested I post here, as it seemed to be relevant.

Any help would be gratefully received.  — Preceding ikipedia:Signatures|unsigned comment added by pecial:Contributions/112.205.139.48|112.205.139.48 (ser talk:112.205.139.48|talk) 05:55, 2 September 2014 (UTC) 
It's all set out at ikipedia:Splitting. I doubt the continuum would meet the P:GNG requirement for a standalone article, but I haven't examined this in any depth. The guidelines at P:COI offer sage advice. Personally, I think people with COIs are better off not editing on topics for which they have a conflict: this cleanly avoids many difficulties and so spares other editors' precious time resolving them. I would also recommend getting an account. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn ser talk:Alexbrn|talk|pecial:Contributions/Alexbrn|contribs|ser:Alexbrn#Conflict_of_interest_declaration|COI 06:19, 2 September 2014 (UTC)

Oh, conflicted interests fuel a high proportion of editing activity hereabouts. For general COIs I believe there is guidance, not policy (and typically a conflicted editor will even then read the guidance as somehow not relevant to them). For medical content, we have an essay: P:MEDCOI. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn ser talk:Alexbrn|talk|pecial:Contributions/Alexbrn|contribs|ser:Alexbrn#Conflict_of_interest_declaration|COI 14:33, 4 September 2014 (UTC)

 linical trials on glucosamine and chondroitin

BlueRasberry started it with stuff from two other articles, where they were presumably TMI. This is legitimate. The actual P:NOTABILITY of the topic is surely beyond question, but then notability as such is rarely an issue with any area of mainstream medicine, such is the volume of RS literature. At AFD it it is RS not MEDRS that applies, no?  The [http://stats.grok.se/en/latest90/Clinical_trials_on_glucosamine_and_chondroitin page views are reasonably high] at about 800 per month. Articles like this should carry a &quot;last updated as at....&quot; tag though. ser:Wiki CRUK John|Wiki CRUK John (ser talk:Wiki CRUK John|talk) 11:10, 2 September 2014 (UTC)
Thanks John. Since we do not really have a space limit and their are lots of sources I do not see a issue. ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 13:59, 2 September 2014 (UTC)
What John says is so. I only made these articles as place to put content that I found elsewhere. The content is useful for what it is and it seems to have worked as a way to keep the lucosamine and hondroitin articles clean of primary sources. Check
*hondroitin_sulfate#Clinical_trials_for_osteoarthritis
*lucosamine#Clinical_trials_on_glucosamine_and_chondroitin
as both sections are short and seem to have been accepted by the community. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 16:16, 2 September 2014 (UTC)
 I find the title of this article a bit strange.  Any article name with the word &quot;and&quot; in it is immediately P:AND|suspect.  As both lucosamine and hondroitin are apparently precursors of lycosaminoglycan, wouldn't it be better to replace &quot;glucosamine and chondroitin&quot; with &quot;glycosaminoglycan&quot;?  Also &quot;clinical trials&quot; appears a bit narrow since at least glucosamine has been used clinically for a number of years.  Perhaps it would be better to replace &quot;clinical trials&quot; with &quot;treatment&quot;, which would cover both current use and clinical trials.  Finally the main use appears to be the treatment of arthritis.  Hence wouldn't a better name for this article be &quot;glycosaminoglycans for the treatment of arthritis&quot;? ser:Boghog|Boghog (ser talk:Boghog|talk) 19:07, 2 September 2014 (UTC)
|Boghog How would you feel about the title linical trials on glycosaminoglycans for the treatment of arthritis? You suggested covering both clinical use and clinical trials. The clinical use part probably should go into the main article for the drugs. Right now, so far as I understand, these articles only contain information which is dubious with regard to treatment but good with regard to summarizing the history of the research. I was unaware that these two drugs could collectively be called &quot;glycosaminoglycans&quot; but if that is the case, and if the sources are using that term when they discuss &quot;glucosamine and chondroitin&quot;, then it seems right to match the title to the sources. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 19:57, 2 September 2014 (UTC)
|Bluerasberry Per P:CONCISE, I prefer the shorter name that I proposed above, but would accept the longer name that you propose. An even shorter tittle would be &quot;Glycosaminoglycan arthritis therapy&quot;.  Another possibility is &quot;Glucosamine and chondroitin combination arthritis therapy&quot;.  I agree that the available clinical evidence shows no benefit with this type of treatment.  Nevertheless, at least in the US, glucosamine and chondroitin are sold as food supplements and not drugs.  Furthermore at least a few physicians recommend this therapy to their patients.  Hence this therapy is currently used by a number of patients who are not in clinical trials.  Therefore I think it is appropriate that the scope of this article include both the clinical trials (it doesn't work) and its current &quot;utraceutical &quot; (nevertheless patients continue to take it) use. ser:Boghog|Boghog (ser talk:Boghog|talk) 21:13, 2 September 2014 (UTC)
Regarding the appropriateness of the page name: The lead currently regards efficacy, reviews and recommendations (ie &quot;treatment&quot; &quot;use&quot;?). It does not actually mention any &quot;clinical trials&quot;. pecial:Contributions/86.134.200.29|86.134.200.29 (ser talk:86.134.200.29|talk) 09:14, 3 September 2014 (UTC)
@ IP - the text of the article does talk about clinical trials and primary research.
|Boghog If the article's title were &quot;Glycosaminoglycan arthritis therapy&quot; or &quot;glycosaminoglycans for the treatment of arthritis&quot; then someone might be tempted to put useful health information in the article, which was something I was hoping to avoid. I was trying to use the term &quot;clinical trials&quot; as a signal to indicate that all the information contained in the article would be useless for guiding health decisions, and that this would be a good place to post sources which would be inappropriate outside the context of a discussion of research. I do not mean to press the issue about this article specifically, but I might like to hear any other thoughts you have about best practices for doing this generally. Do you want this article to contain both health and research information, or just research information? If this were just a research article, can you suggest a titling scheme to indicate that this or any like article is a review of the clinical trials on a topic, and ought not actually be the place to summarize the health conclusions of the research? ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 11:50, 3 September 2014 (UTC)
 |Bluerasberry I don't think it's feasible to split health research information from health information in the context of evidence-based medicine. The fact that the lead currently focuses (broadly in the spirit of WP:LEAD) on questions of efficacy, recommendations, etc is perhaps indicative of the intrinsic difficulties of such an approach. While I agree there is a case for Wikipedia providing more information than it does at present regarding the research history of major clinical trials, I'm not sure this is an appropriate way to do that (in preference, say, to P:SUMMARY|summary style). Hum, perhaps Clinical research or evidence...? pecial:Contributions/86.134.200.29|86.134.200.29 (ser talk:86.134.200.29|talk) 12:41, 3 September 2014 (UTC)
We already have made commitments to have some separation of research and treatment. In ikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Medicine-related_articles#Drugs.2C_medications_and_devices|MEDMOS there is a section for &quot;research&quot;, and what happened in these glycosaminoglycan articles was that the research sections became so long and were being replicated in enough different places that it made sense to fork these sections from each article and merge them into one new article. Evidence-based medicine follows decades of outdated evidence, and for many drugs and procedures, this outdated or dead end research could be summarized in a clinical research article like this one. Especially in alternative medicine there is a community which likes to review the old research, and I was hoping that forking the research from the health information would circumvent controversy while creating a place for people to host information from medical journals which is noncompliant with P:MEDRS but still aligned with P:RS. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 13:26, 3 September 2014 (UTC)
 Hum, yes, it's a delicate question I agree. I suppose &quot;Research&quot; can be understood in two ways: as ongoing research (per the MEDMOS usage?); or as the history of the research, ie how the evidence-base was built (another legitimate topic, imo). pecial:Contributions/86.134.200.29|86.134.200.29 (ser talk:86.134.200.29|talk) 18:11, 3 September 2014 (UTC)
The advantage to &quot;Clinical research&quot; (vs &quot;Research&quot;) is that it should discourage people from including non-human primary sources.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 15:11, 4 September 2014 (UTC)

 Using the term &quot;diagnosis&quot; 

I have been cleaning up our article on ultiple chemical sensitivity. It is not a widely-recognized diagnosis with an ICD code or anything like that. Is it appropriate to use the term &quot;diagnosis&quot; in this context? - ser talk:2over0|2/0 (pecial:Contributions/2over0|cont.) 20:41, 6 September 2014 (UTC)
 Looking at the article, it has quite a bit to say about diagnosis. It's quite possible that there are two valid viewpoints: no diagnosis exists (per WHO in the first paragraph); or it's a diagnosis by exclusion (per the rest of the section). If that's so, the section probably just needs tightening up to present each view with due weight. Of course, it might be that the WHO view is mainstream and the alternative is sufficiently fringe that it ought not to be there at all. In that case, take an axe to the latter part.
 Either way, it seems there's sufficient sources and content to justify having a Diagnosis section. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 23:34, 6 September 2014 (UTC)
&quot;Diagnosis&quot; is the process of identifying something (ideally, but not necessarily, something useful) about the nature of your situation; it is not the process of assigning an ICD code to your situation.  People can be &quot;diagnosed&quot; with anything, even conditions that have been rejected by medical authorities or conditions that are unknown to medical authorities.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 01:18, 8 September 2014 (UTC)

 Introducing Myself Ammar/user:amosabo 

Hi all,

I'm Ammar, I'm a 5th year medical student in Cario, Egypt. I have had this account for a few years now but have not really done anything useful with it yet. I am doing a placement at the UK Cochrane Centre (Summer 2014) and I am helping out with one of their partner networks: Students 4 Best Evidence (S4BE) which I have been a volunteer contributor for for just over a year now. S4BE is a global student network for Evidence Based Health.

As you will have heard from Sydney above, S4BE are organizing a Wikipedia week to encourage students to participate in editing Wikipedia's health content, and I am helping out with that.

I hope to continue editing Wikipedia after the event and my placement end. I met some of the very kind people from WikiProject Medicine in Wikimania London and must say it was a pleasure; everyone was very welcoming and the atmosphere was very encouraging. I would be delighted to get to know you all better and would love it if anyone had any tips/pointers.

 ina Medina: the world's youngest mother or a hoax? 

I am concerned about the article Lina Medina. She is presented as the youngest person known to have given birth. To me the story appears to be a hoax as there is little evidence to support the claim that at 5 years old she gave birth. Many women have been left infertile from giving birth at a very young age, but Lina Medina is said in the article to have given birth to another child almost 40 years later. I would like the sources in the article to be examined, in particular by experts in human growth and development. ser:AlwynJPie|AlwynJPie (ser talk:AlwynJPie|talk) 06:59, 9 September 2014 (UTC)

Like I told AlwynJPie, P:Reliable sources, including ime (magazine)|Time, report the pregnancy as real. Some of these sources include medical evidence of the pregnancy, such as mention of X-rays. If there are WP:Reliable sources reporting the pregnancy as a hoax, and those sources have evidence that it is a hoax instead of simply claiming it as a hoax based on original reports, then that material should of course be included in the article. ser:Flyer22|Flyer22 (ser talk:Flyer22|talk) 07:09, 9 September 2014 (UTC)

 articles on proteins that are also used as drugs 

nsulin-like growth factor 1, latelet-derived growth factor are two articles I came across today and worked on a bit. The IGF-1 article was a disaster and is just a bit better now.  How do you all think we should handle articles that molecular biology people have filled with all kinds of basic science data , and that have use as a drug as a recombinant protein?   Seems weird to shove the whole article into MEDMOS format (and would probably cause a ruckus with the biology people).   Have a separate article on the drug like nsulin-like growth factor 1 (drug)?

 The article &quot;nsulin&quot; is explicitly about the protein while &quot;nsulin therapy&quot; describes the drug. That seems like a sensible solution. Of course there is a lot more known about insulin than about IGF-1 or PDGF, especially as a drug. 
 If there is only a small amount of information about the drug applications of IGF-1 &amp; PDGF, those could be added to the main article. If you anticipate a big expansion, or if that occurs later, a spin-out article could be created similar to &quot;nsulin therapy&quot;. ser:Axl|Axl ¤ ser talk:Axl|[Talk] 09:06, 12 September 2014 (UTC)

I'm in favor of keeping them in together as long as possible, but if you've reached the level of tens of thousands of words, it's time to consider a split.
The &quot;which format&quot; question is usually settled by considering what the &quot;primary&quot; subject is.  If you heard someone on a bus talking about IGF, would you assume that they were talking about the drug, or about the natural protein (and, e.g., its effects on cancer risk)?  For that one, I'd assume that latter, and therefore follow mostly a non-drug layout.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 15:14, 12 September 2014 (UTC)

Dependence is defined as an adaptive state that develops in response to repeated drug administration, and is unmasked during withdrawal, which occurs when drug taking stops. Dependence from long-term drug use may have both a somatic component, manifested by physical symptoms, and an emotional–motivation component, manifested by dysphoria.  While physical dependence and withdrawal occur with some drugs of abuse (opiates, ethanol), these phenomena are not useful in the diagnosis of addiction because they do not occur with other drugs of abuse (cocaine, amphetamine) and can occur with many drugs that are not abused (propranolol, clonidine).

The official diagnosis of drug addiction by the Diagnostic and Statistic Manual of Mental Disorders (2000), which makes distinctions between drug use, abuse, and substance dependence, is flawed. First, diagnosis of drug use versus abuse can be arbitrary and reflect cultural norms, not medical phenomena.  Second, the term substance dependence implies that dependence is the primary pharmacologic phenomenon underlying addiction, which is likely not true, as tolerance, sensitization, and learning and memory also play central roles. It is ironic and unfortunate that the Manual avoids use of the term addiction, which provides the best description of the clinical syndrome. [see ref quote] one and another termed the reward-reinforcementite book | author = Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE | editor = Sydor A, Brown RY | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 9780071481274 | pages = 365–366| edition = 2nd | chapter = Chapter 15: Reinforcement and Addictive Disorders | quote=The reinforcing effects of drugs can be demonstrated in animals, where rodents and nonhuman primates readily self-administer certain drugs … The strength with which certain drugs reinforce behavior in animals correlates well with their tendency to reinforce drug-seeking behavior in humans. 

The neural substrates that underlie the perception of reward and the phenomenon of positive reinforcement are a set of interconnected forebrain structures called brain reward pathways; these include the nucleus accumbens (NAc; the major component of the ventral striatum), the basal forebrain (components of which have been termed the extended amygdala, as discussed later in this chapter), hippocampus, hypothalamus, and frontal regions of the cerebral cortex. Addictive drugs are rewarding and reinforcing because they act in brain reward pathways to enhance dopamine release or the effects of dopamine in the bbr|NAc|nucleus accumbens or related structures, or because they produce effects similar to dopamine. paradigm [this includes concepts like self-administration, conditioned place preference, drug reward, behavioral reward, reinforcement, etc... gene expression terminology is used a lot too]) aren't defined as a group on ddiction or anywhere else I've looked. The former is mainly a clinical/diagnostic paradigm, whereas the latter is a research paradigm (e.g., used by all the reviews cited in FosB).

A second related point that I figure I'll mention: addiction and dependence are essentially used interchangeably in virtually every addiction and addictive drug article on wikipedia, and also in emplate:infobox drug's dependence liability (I'm guessing this is influenced by the DSM's framework).  See the dependence liability field at affeine for a high-traffic article example of where this is weird.  It makes the meaning of the term &quot;dependence&quot; very vague in drugboxes/articles at the moment. ser:Seppi333|Seppi333 (ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert 2¢ | pecial:WhatLinksHere/User:Seppi333/Maintenance|Maintained) 13:08, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

Ideally, I'd want to transclude a column box that could be used to list terms and had a right-aligned box, similar to an infobox. I figured I'd seen something like this before, I just don't remember the article. This would be a substitute for transcluding a whole section of prose solely on definitions that covers these in the text. Also, most of these articles have tiny infoboxes and giant TOC's, so there's usually a lot of room in the right-column. From the recent statements made during the dispute at ex addiction, I gathered that there's at least a minority of people who think the establishment of diagnostic criteria is equivalent to the medical/clinical identification of an addiction. This isn't even remotely true, and most articles include text associated with both frameworks, which is why I think it would be useful to indicate that there's two addiction frameworks and the associated terminology, or, at the very least, a link to a page of those terms. ser:Seppi333|Seppi333 (ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert 2¢ | pecial:WhatLinksHere/User:Seppi333/Maintenance|Maintained) 13:43, 11 September 2014 (UTC)

 Pathophysiology section at the exual addiction article 

Opinions are needed on the following matter: alk:Sexual addiction#&quot;Pathophysiology&quot; section. A P:Permalink for that discussion is [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Sexual_addiction&amp;diff=624874316&amp;oldid=624874093#.22Pathophysiology.22_section here]. The discussion is about whether or not text that ser:Seppi333|Seppi333 included is a P:Synthesis matter, and whether or not the text should be presented as though sexual addiction is a valid concept, given that some researchers dispute that sexual addiction exists. ser:Flyer22|Flyer22 (ser talk:Flyer22|talk) 00:04, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

Indeed. ser:Seppi333 has inserted a great blob of material from the OSB article into at least three other articles -- ddiction, ubstance dependence and exual addiction -- in a context which seems to suggest that the FOSB theory of addiction is the be-all and end-all of addiction research (not to mention the end of the discussion regarding the existence of sexual addiction), in a way that seems to break P:NPOV and border on being P:SYNTH. 

When I removed and queried their edits, they were most forthright in laying down the law that this was settled, uncontrovertible medical fact.  Which is interesting, because that's not what researchers in the field appear to say about it. (see, for example, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25083822], where the author makes it very clear in the abstract that this is a tentative conclusion) 

From Seppi333' user page, I can't see any claim that they have any background in biochemistry or medicine. Asking them about this seems to have annoyed them quite a lot. I'd appreciate it if any medically knowledgeable editors could take a look at this. -- ser:The Anome|The Anome (ser talk:The Anome|talk) 00:11, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

My point is this. The material you've added is perfectly fine Wikipedia article material, supported by P:MEDRS, etc. etc. I have no problem with that. The way you've inserted it into these articles, though, is contrary to P:NPOV and appears to me to constitute P:SYNTH, in giving a misleading impression that this is the end of the discussion as far as medical research goes. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25083822 As the abstract of J.K. Ruffle's recent review article on the matter shows], it clearly isn't, and Ruffle is a proponent of the hypothesis. 

Their language is clear: 

&quot; This induction is likely to, at least in part, be responsible for the mechanisms underlying addiction, a disorder in which the regulation of gene expression is thought to be essential. In this review, we describe and discuss the proposed role of ΔFosB as well as the implications of recent findings.&quot; (My italics.) 

You clearly have very strong opinions on the matter, which you don't hold back on, and present yourself as an arbiter of truth in these matters, yet you (self admittedly) have no relevant professional expertise in thse matters. 

I have no problem with the FOSB hypothesis -- it sounds perfectly reasonable to me, it might wellbe true, who am I to say? I also have no problem with it being mentioned in all of these articles. But, if it is to be in those articles,  it needs to be mentioned at much shorter length, with attributions as to who is putting forward the hypothesis, and to in particular to cite references that explicitly say that the FOSB hypothesis applies to the particular article it's being mentioned in. Otherwise, this is just original research on your part. -- ser:The Anome|The Anome (ser talk:The Anome|talk) 00:30, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

*I've deleted all but 1 citation for every behavioral addiction clause, so there obviously can't be any synth in the text now. Go ahead and P:V check.
*You realize Ruffle's publication is a primary source, right?

* I don't think you understand what I'm talking about with P:SYNTH, but I will check.
* Regarding Ruffle's paper, I'm not citing it in a Wikipedia article -- I'm just using it as evidence, here, that an actual credentialled medical researcher advanced those opinions in a peer-reviewed journal -- ser:The Anome|The Anome (ser talk:The Anome|talk)

 I just noticed pubmed doesn't call it a review, though the article itself indicates this.  Since it is a review, I'll download and read it and then use it to write/cite text for these articles later this week when I get around to updating FOSB again.  Also, you're correct, I'm a bit clueless as to how text cited by a single source could constitute P:SYNTH, a policy on combining material from multiple sources. ser:Seppi333|Seppi333 (ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert 2¢ | pecial:WhatLinksHere/User:Seppi333/Maintenance|Maintained) 01:08, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

Thanks. The P:SYNTH policy is about original research by synthesis, where an editor combines reliably sourced statements in a way that makes or suggests a new statement not supported by any one of the sources. For example, unless your sources refer to sexual addiction directly, then you would be making the inference yourself that it's relevant to that article -- making the (possibly correct) inference that because FOSB is likely involved in sexual and other reward pathways, it's necessarily also implicated in sexual addiction -- and that would be original research on your part. 

In the meantime, can you please take the disputed sections out of the articles for now, or allow me to do so? As you can see, I've got no objection to either the FOSB hypothesis or its presence in those articles per se, it's just that it needs to be done in such as way that P:NPOV and P:OR are followed, and in particular the clear absence of P:SYNTH. -- ser:The Anome|The Anome (ser talk:The Anome|talk) 01:15, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

Pitchers and colleagues (2010) reported that sexual experience was shown to cause DeltaFosB accumulation in several limbic brain regions including the NAc, medial pre-frontal cortex, VTA, caudate, and putamen, but not the medial preoptic nucleus. Next, the induction of c-Fos, a downstream (repressed) target of DeltaFosB, was measured in sexually experienced and naive animals. The number of mating-induced c-Fos-IR cells was significantly decreased in sexually experienced animals compared to sexually naive controls. Finally, DeltaFosB levels and its activity in the NAc were manipulated using viral-mediated gene transfer to study its potential role in mediating sexual experience and experience-induced facilitation of sexual performance. Animals with DeltaFosB overexpression displayed enhanced facilitation of sexual performance with sexual experience relative to controls. In contrast, the expression of DeltaJunD, a dominant-negative binding partner of DeltaFosB, attenuated sexual experience-induced facilitation of sexual performance, and stunted long-term maintenance of facilitation compared to DeltaFosB overexpressing group. Together, these findings support a critical role for DeltaFosB expression in the NAc in the reinforcing effects of sexual behavior and sexual experience-induced facilitation of sexual performance. ... both drug addiction and sexual addiction represent pathological forms of neuroplasticity along with the emergence of aberrant behaviors involving a cascade of neurochemical changes mainly in the brain's rewarding circuitry.  The quoted excerpt is the only part of that review supporting the article text on sex addiction, so it's much shorter than the first review. ser:Seppi333|Seppi333 (ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert 2¢ | pecial:WhatLinksHere/User:Seppi333/Maintenance|Maintained) 02:28, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

Agreed. I'm working on another off-wiki project at the moment, but I will have a go at this tomorrow. In the exual addiction article, I think it probably belongs in the &quot;Causes&quot; section of the article, alongside the &quot;Psychological distress theories&quot; and &quot;Heterogeneous theories&quot; subsections, perhaps with a subheading like &quot;FOSB hypothesis&quot; or &quot;Biochemical hypothesis&quot;. I think it should be a brief one or two paragraph summary of the views of authors who explicitly link FOSB to sexual addiction, per P:NPOV with a link to the FOSB article itself for the full details of the FOSB/addiction hypothesis. 

For example, the reference above could be used to support a sentence of something like the form &quot;In a 2012 paper, Blum et. al. proposed the hypothesis that DeltaFOSB played a critical role in both drug addiction and sexual addiction.&quot; There should be similarly customized treatments for ddiction and ubstance dependence, with the section in ddiction being larger than the others. I don't believe there's any need to introduce large chunks of the FOSB article into other articles, that's what wikilinks are for. -- ser:The Anome|The Anome (ser talk:The Anome|talk) 11:08, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

No, really, it's not resolved, unless your idea of problem resolution is to steamroller all other opinions out of existence. 

Not only have have you completely ignored my offer above to submit an NPOV version that meets policy as a starting point for meeting consensus, you've now gone back and shoved all the FOSB stuff back in, and also, as a bonus, now removed anything about competing psychological theories. Please see my revision [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sexual_addiction&amp;oldid=625436458 here], which I believe references the FOSB material in a balanced way that I believe follows the P:NPOV guidelines, and allows the reader to follow the link to the OSB article to read about the FOSB theory in detail. 

As I said in my comment to you in my comment on your talk page, added a few minutes ago, some experts think sexual addiction does not exist.  Yet others think it not only exists, but has a clear biochemical mechanism. Yet if it doesn't exist, it can't have a cause, and if it has a cause, it must exist. It's clear that these two positions are logically incompatible, but are both held by experts: therefore neither of these views are uncontroversial, and P:NPOV applies.- ser:The Anome|The Anome (ser talk:The Anome|talk) 21:14, 13 September 2014 (UTC)

 Notice of intention - working on clinical coding articles 

As several of the below articles are under the P:MED umbrella (and as a coder there being a potential P:COI), I thought it best to declare here that I intend to start cleaning up the articles around clinical coding in the near future.

I'm currently looking at a structure similar to below:
*linical coder - the specific occupation.
*Clinical coding - new (currently a redirect) - the practice of applying codes from a classification to a health service encounter (irrespective of the practitioner).
*edical classification - the tools used in clinical coding.
as this seems to reflect the separation between practitioner, mechanisms and implements used in other articles around occupations.

Related articles that may also need work during or afterwards:
*edical billing
*iagnosis code
*rocedure code
*harmaceutical code
*opographical code
*ase mix
*iagnosis-related group

For various reasons, including the COI, I'm going to assume that all should this be done in sandbox; with consensus/fresh eyes being sort when ready to publish. However, I need to ask; do articles have their own sandbox area? If not, is it possible to have multiple sandboxes in my user space? ser:Little pob|Little pob (ser talk:Little pob|talk) 13:05, 17 September 2014 (UTC)

Working for/with a particular coding system might represent a COI, though as I think there is relatively muted competition between the various systems which different countries/organization use (is this right?) it may not be too serious.  I agree you should be able to edit directly, but you need to declare your potential COI.  You've done this on your user page, which is great, as well as here.  You might also consider a note declaring it on the talk page of articles you intend doing major work on, especially if your edits might be considered controversial. And/or in your first edit summary on a page. You could ask here for a check when pretty much finished with an article. But it doesn't seem a very controversial area, not that I'd know.

 MEDDATE when no newer sources have been identified 

We are having a bit of discussion at alk:Acupuncture#MEDDATE regarding what the P:MEDDATE|MEDDATE section of MEDRS suggests that we do when sources used by the article are more than five years old but no newer sources have been identified to replace potentially outdated information. Do we summarily remove the source and information cited to it? Do we add a tag such as l|update inline or l|medrs to indicate to readers that the article may not reflect current understanding? Do we leave it alone until newer sources of similar caliber are identified?

I think that WP:MEDDATE is clear on the matter; we should not remove a medical source simply because it's not published in the last five years or so. Unless, of course, more recent reviews are available. But WP:MEDDATE points out, &quot;Within this range, assessing them may be difficult. While the most-recent reviews include later research results, do not automatically give more weight to the review that happens to have been published most recently, as this is ikipedia:Recentism|recentism.&quot; And it gives space to areas that are less researched, stating that sourcing &quot;may need to be relaxed in areas where little progress is being made or few reviews are being published.&quot; My opinion on the particular case you are citing is that &quot;we leave it alone until newer sources of similar caliber are identified.&quot; ser:Flyer22|Flyer22 (ser talk:Flyer22|talk) 16:59, 14 September 2014 (UTC)

(e/cx2) Largely in agreement with Flyer22 here; we should update information as we find newer source of equal or better quality, but not remove material just because it is cited to a review that is 6 years old. Some fields are incredibly fast moving (HIV treatment) in which 5 years may be too old; others have so little research that a 20 year old textbook might be the best source.

I'm not going to look at the source or what it supports or why people are fighting over it.  Instead, I'll tell you my general opinion:  
* If you've got a review article, and there have been no more recent review articles on that particular point, and the review is less than ten (10) years old, then leave it alone. 
* If there are more recent reviews (notice the plural:  it means &quot;two or more&quot;) on that particular point (not just the field in general), then update or replace to reflect newer sources.

The article is nominally a biography but appears to be used as a P:COATRACK for convincing readers of the subject's belief that injections of Enbrel are good treatments for back pain, Alzheimer's, and stroke (and possibly other things).
It looks like the article recently received some significant changes that [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edward_Tobinick&amp;diff=622469168&amp;oldid=622466959 removed negative information] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edward_Tobinick&amp;diff=622539393&amp;oldid=622469168 added a lot of praise].  The page has been protected due to edit warring [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;page=Edward+Tobinick twice in the last two months].

It might have been better to P:PRESERVE the accurate information and improve the source than to blank it, but that's not actually required.

 Reanalyses of Randomized Clinical Trial Data 

An interesting [http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1902230 paper] in JAMA which provides a wonderful illustration of why we should insist on secondary sources. Of course, it too is a primary source in some regards... ser:LeadSongDog|LeadSongDog ser talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl! 14:39, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

&quot;Reanalyses differed most commonly in statistical or analytical approaches (n = 18) and in definitions or measurements of the outcome of interest (n = 12).&quot;  I don't have access to the full text, but isn't that pretty much the definition of post-hoc analysis?  The original trial endpoints and statistical analysis are pre-specified as good statistical practice requires.  Overall (and admittedly without having seen the full text), this strikes me more as a warning of some of the potential problems with reanalysis of trial data than direct evidence of its benefits (which have been demonstrated in other sources). ser:Formerly 98|Formerly 98 (ser talk:Formerly 98|talk) 14:59, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

 My understanding is that these were reanalyses of the original study hypothesis (primary outcome), as distinct from post-hoc sub-group analyses. Therefore, such reanalyses aim to verify the published findings by conducting an alternative (improved?) analysis of the original data set. The findings of the paper published in JAMA are relevant to key questions regarding transparency and the desirability of open access to trial data. The [http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1902214 accompanying editorial] concludes: The recognition that one trial can potentially lead to different findings and conclusions depending on many discretionary decisions that are made about the data and reanalyses almost mandates that those choices are transparent and described in detail—and that others have the chance to replicate them. Rather than the rare exception, open science and replication should become the standard for all trials and especially those that have high potential to influence practice. Support, pecial:Contributions/86.164.164.123|86.164.164.123 (ser talk:86.164.164.123|talk) 18:32, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

The problem is not just retrospective subgroup analysis, nor is it that the newly chosen endpoints and statistical methods are &quot;non-transparent&quot;.  It is that any non-prespecified analysis of the data creates a problem of multiple hypothesis testing. This is part of why the EMA for a while (I don't know the current status) was pushing for data release only to those who provided advance protocols of what their re-analysis endpoints and statistical methods would be. The issue is similar to why the FDA does not allow companies to substitute &quot;improved&quot; endpoints or statistical analyses for proving efficacy after their data is unblinded. 

Interestingly, just today, [http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2014/09/10/clinical_trial_fraud.php this news report] by Derek Lowe of a biotech suspending development of a drug due to what they call &quot;fraud&quot; by employees who conspired to view unblinded clinical trial data and reformulate the trial endpoints after unblinding of the data to make the drug look better. ser:Formerly 98|Formerly 98 (ser talk:Formerly 98|talk) 19:19, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

 Evidence of willful malpractice is another matter. Imo, providing open access to data sets is ultimately relevant for transparency (as well as to possible pooled analyses). Quite what credence to give to an alternative analysis, in the light of the methodological questions it will inevitably raise, is a question that must be open to peer review and debate. As of course is the original report of the study design, analysis and interpretation...  pecial:Contributions/86.164.164.123|86.164.164.123 (ser talk:86.164.164.123|talk) 22:53, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

Let me restate that in a way that might be clearer. Its not a subtle question of methodological questions that are equally applicable to the original and re-analysis that I am referring to.  I'm specifically referring to the well-established issue of the ultiple comparisons problem.  This is an important potential source of statistical error and even &quot;cherry picking&quot; for reanalyses that do not prespecify both the endpoints and the statistical method.  It is normally not a potential source of these problems in the original analysis because the FDA requires pre-specification of both the endpoints and the statistical plan for any trial designed for regulatory approval. My point is simply that in order to be valid, the reanalyzers need to publically pre-state their analysis plan like Cochrane does and not go on a fishing expedition. (Though even Cochrane has been criticized for [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22486554 deviations from its prespecified analysis]) 

In general, whatever the flaws in pivotal clinical trials reviewed by the FDA for approval purposes may be, they are all based on efficacy endpoints and statistical analyses that are selected in advance of unblinding of the data, e.g., the investigators are blind to any effect their choice of one endpoint or statistical method vs another will have on the conclusions (&quot;statistical significance&quot;) of the study.  They cannot cherry pick.  This can never be rigorously known to be true for any re-analysis, except in the narrow situation in which patient-level data is released by companies or regulatory authorities only after the re-analyzer pre-specifies an analysis plan. ser:Formerly 98|Formerly 98 (ser talk:Formerly 98|talk) 23:17, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

 Of course those are all valid points. But ones that do not (imho, at least) militate against the principle and potential of open access, per se (although that would presumably preclude the possibility of prespecified reanalyses, which at present are somewhat rare anyway).  pecial:Contributions/86.164.164.123|86.164.164.123 (ser talk:86.164.164.123|talk) 08:11, 11 September 2014 (UTC)
I wish they were all valid points, but they are not. Not all trials are subject to FDA review (accupuncture practices, for instance). Even when they are, investigators, funders, and journal editors can and do cherry pick. The simple fact is that investigators (or their funders) quite regularly choose not to publish, rather than publish a &quot;failed&quot; trial which merely found the &quot;wrong&quot; conclusion. Simply search through clinicaltrials.gov and you'll see a huge proportion of trials which have not published conclusions, despite being long past their end dates. One sees extraordinary levels of this in trials of homeopathic preparations, herbals, manipulation therapies and many other alt-med interventions. ser:LeadSongDog|LeadSongDog ser talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl! 16:59, 12 September 2014 (UTC)

ing|LeadSongDog I agree with much of that, but a lot of the studies of non-publication have their own problems, including the COI problem that a paper is always more publishable if you get an &quot;interesting&quot; result, and that many of the authors are seeking to publicize or add support for pre-existing publicly held positions. 
[http://www.bmj.com/content/347/bmj.f6104 This paper] for example, found that 29% of &quot;large&quot; (large was used as a marker of &quot;importance&quot; for the purposes of this study) clinical trials remained unpublished, and concluded (more accurately, simply assumed) that this 29% corresponded to negative trials that were being covered up for commercial purposes. But if you go to the listing of the unpublished trials in the supplementary material, here is what you find for the first 10 unpublished Industry-sponsored trials.
# NCT00005918 is just a comparison of an immediate release to an extended release version of stavudine from 2002.  Should have been published, but this was a really minor drug and calling the non-publication of this trial a coverup seems a little extreme.
# NCT00046761 is a 2005 trial of a drug that was never approved.  Not exactly a coverup of negative results for marketing purposes
# NCT00057239 is a 2003 trial of an antidepressant that was dropped from development and never approved.  
# NCT00057382 is a 2003 trial of a cancer drug that was dropped from development and never approved.
# NCT00062582 is a trial of an approved drug in an indication for which it was never approved.  Probably should have been published anyway. 
# NCT00071266 is a trial of an approved combination pill for hypercholesterolemia.  It should have been published.
# NCT00083421 is a trial of an Alzheimers drug that was abandoned and never marketed. 
# NCT00087724 also a trial of an Alzheimer's drug that was abandoned in development and never marketed
# NCT00097344 is a trial of a breast cancer drug that was abandoned while in development and never marketed
# NCT00106509 is a trial of an antibiotic that was abandoned in development and never marketed.
So I'd say there are some problems, but I'd look beneath the headlines before concluding that every unpublished trial is a coverup.  I for one, would rather see researchers spend their time trying to find new drugs than writing up unsuccessful trials of drugs that will never be marketed. ser:Formerly 98|Formerly 98 (ser talk:Formerly 98|talk) 16:05, 19 September 2014 (UTC)
 A fascinating and insightful discussion and I would agree with most of what has been said above. However I would disagree about the value of writing up unsuccessful drug trials.  There is a lot to be learned from failed drug trials, especially for refractory diseases such as Alzheimer's. The cost for researchers to write up the results of a failed clinical trial are minuscule compared to the cumulative unk cost of developing that drug candidate.  Furthermore the volunteer participants in these trials were put at risk. In my opinion, drug sponsors and journals have a moral responsibility to recoup as much as possible the financial and human capital that went into developing and testing a failed drug candidate by publishing the results.  ser:Boghog|Boghog (ser talk:Boghog|talk) 19:35, 19 September 2014 (UTC)

Currently the Chondromalacia patellae article states it is the same as PFPS. Another source states:

&quot;In the literature there is some agreement that PFPS is a term to be applied only to people with retropatellar pain in which no cartilage damage is evident (Arroll 1997; Cutbill 1997; Holmes 1998; Juhn 1999; Thomee 1999; Wilk 1998; ). However, retropatellar pain is generally thought of as a self-limiting condition with a good prognosis, especially for people who are young (Kannus 1994), people who have unilateral complaints, and people in which crepitation is absent (Natri 1998). This means that people are usually managed in primary care and are rarely referred to specialist care (Bourne 1988). Therefore reliable diagnostic techniques for determining cartilage damage such as computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or arthroscopy (Cutbill 1997; Nissen 1998) are seldom applied. In fact a diagnosis based solely on symptoms and physical examination of the knee is not uncommon. Furthermore, Natri showed that neither the radiologic nor the MRI changes seen in affected knees showed a clear association with persistent symptoms seven years later (Natri 1998). This makes the distinction between chondromalacia patellae and PFPS theoretical rather than practical, so people with either chondromalacia patellae or PFPS will be included in this review.&quot; (source= [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003470.pub2/full]). ser:Matthew Ferguson 57|Matthew Ferguson (ser talk:Matthew Ferguson 57|talk) 22:04, 22 September 2014 (UTC)

I'd say the &quot;softening&quot; mentioned in the lead of the 2nd has continued, &amp; the rough consensus is that a general low-carb approach to weight loss is the most successful, but not actual Atkins.  Eg Richard Lehman remarked along these lines in a recent BMJ blog (he being my personal proxy for &quot;actual current consensus or major viewpoint&quot; on such things).  Most of the refs used now seem 2008-9, as so often. But the matter can't I think be called settled. ser:Wiki CRUK John|Wiki CRUK John (ser talk:Wiki CRUK John|talk) 11:33, 23 September 2014 (UTC)

 Presenting potentially alarming prognosis information 

Some of you will remember we discussed this at CRUK before Wikimania. Just as a matter of presentation (I haven't edited the actual content yet), what do people think of the approach I've tried at ancreatic_cancer#Prognosis?  Again the wording probably needs work. Does anyone object to this approach as such? The idea would be to have overall survival rate information elsewhere, but to treat prognosis stats by stage this way.

QuackGuru, the only problem with the ref formatting is that [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Traditional_African_medicine&amp;diff=626548385&amp;oldid=626453910 you screwed it up] by removing the heading that separates the short citations from the full ones.  If you're not familiar with this system, then see P:CITESHORT, or if you're like more details, Chicago Manual of Style or just about any other style book that would be recommended to students by any professor of English.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 15:38, 22 September 2014 (UTC)
See P:CITESHORT: &quot;Some Wikipedia articles use short citations, giving summary information about the source together with a page number,...&quot;
The citeshort is used for when there are notes or a summary about the source for the reader. See raditional Chinese medicine#Notes for how that is done.
This is not what was done at Traditional African medicine (TAM). The references for TAM are not &quot;properly formatted&quot;. Any GA article that used malformed refs should be delisted. ser:QuackGuru|QuackGuru (ser talk:QuackGuru|talk) 22:02, 22 September 2014 (UTC)
Nope.  Could I encourage you to actually click through to P:CITESHORT and read the example?  You obviously haven't done so, or you'd not believe that an explanatory footnote like the one in the TCM article had anything at all to do with short citations.  You're looking for the bit that begins with this paragraph:  t|Some Wikipedia articles use short citations, giving summary information about the source together with a page number, as in Smith 2010, p. 1.. These are used together with full citations, which give full details of the sources, but without page numbers, and are listed in a separate &quot;References&quot; section.
As for your belief that malformed citations are a cause for de-listing or failing an article, you can take up your proposal at T:GACR.  Just be prepared to lose that particular debate.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 02:14, 23 September 2014 (UTC)
By the way, this system is used to FAs moderately often.  onatus and oyal_Maundy#Notes use it in slightly different ways.  See hroffer#Notes for an FA that features all three elements:  one explanatory footnote, 59 short citations, and an alphabetized list of full citations (including some P:General references).  It would be silly to prohibit at GA what is commonly and automatically accepted at FA.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 02:33, 23 September 2014 (UTC)
Are you sure about that? The notes section is for &quot;Some Wikipedia articles use short citations, giving summary information about the source together with a page number,...&quot; This is one example for a notes section. A notes section can be used for a summary or to give the reader addtional information such as I did at [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Traditional_Chinese_medicine&amp;diff=609121002&amp;oldid=609119800 TCM] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Acupuncture&amp;diff=623556386&amp;oldid=623553271 Acupuncture]. See raditional Chinese medicine#Notes. See cupuncture#Notes.
Another use for a notes section is for notes like onatus#Notes and oyal Maundy#Notes that is used for a very different purpose such as when different page numbers are used for a single source.
There are only specific circumstances for when to use a notes sections. The notes at raditional African_medicine#Notes are not used together with the full citations. They are separated. At oyal Maundy#Notes a reader can click on a short citation to read the full citation to verify the text. See oyal Maundy#CITEREFRobinson1977. ser:QuackGuru|QuackGuru (ser talk:QuackGuru|talk) 07:44, 23 September 2014 (UTC)
Yes, I'm sure about that.  There are dozens of acceptable ways to format citations.  &quot;Onwuanibe, pp. 27&quot;, which is one of the ones you're talking about, is definitely one of those acceptable styles.  Some of the sources cited in that article are too short for page numbers to matter, like the Gale Encyclopedia entry.  You don't include page numbers if they're not necessary. 
I have no idea why you say that onatus' &quot;Traupman 1966, p. 52&quot; and oyal Maundy's &quot;Robinson 1977, pp. 23–24.&quot; are serving a different purpose than raditional African medicine's &quot;Onwuanibe, pp. 27&quot;.  They use different technoogy, but the purpose (telling the reader where to verify the material) is obviously identical.  We always assume that our readers are smart enough to read an author's last name in the short citations and find that author's last name in the immediately following alphabetical list of full citations (just like readers have done on paper for the last century).  There is no requirement that any sources whatsoever be clickable.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 15:31, 23 September 2014 (UTC)
A short citation must be linked together to the full citation. You can see how this was done at onatus#Notes and oyal Maundy#Notes. If the citations are not linked then the reader won't know which short citation belongs to which full citations. Only in some circumstance there is a [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AWikiProject_Medicine&amp;diff=626734920&amp;oldid=626713887 benefit for using a short citation with a full citation]. If the benefit has not been met then the references should be formatted the usually way. At Traditional African medicine, no reason has been given for using a shortcite which is not linked to the full citation. ser:QuackGuru|QuackGuru (ser talk:QuackGuru|talk) 16:05, 23 September 2014 (UTC)
QG i don't think you have a leg to stand on there.  but more importantly, QG if your point is that the article is not GA on the basis of ref formatting alone, that would a losing argument.  my sense is that your argument is not hung from that one peg, so what is the point? you can put the ax down on this issue. hardly any Med articles use Chicago style in any case (and my sense is that the African article is going to get its refs reformatted soon anyway) ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 17:14, 23 September 2014 (UTC)
t|&quot;A short citation must be linked together to the full citation.&quot;  This is not true, if by &quot;linked&quot; you mean using a clickable wikilink (or similar technology).  So long as the reader is capable of reading one and finding the other, then it's sufficient.  
Please feel free to read the entire P:CITE guideline, or just ask at T:CITE.  If you find anything that says that they must be linked, then please advise.  NB that the current, non-linking style used at raditional African medicine is exactly what the CITE guideline gives as an example of how to do this.  P:CITESHORT contains no clickable links.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:45, 23 September 2014 (UTC)
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Maundy#cite_note-FOOTNOTERobinson197727-16
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Maundy#CITEREFRobinson1977
The short and full citations are obviously liked together at Royal Maundy. This is done at Royal Maundy because a single reference is sourced to more than one page. At Traditional African medicine the references are not linked together and there is no point to having a short and long citation when a single reference is not linked to cited different pages. The &quot;non-linking style&quot; is wrong and should be discouraged. How is the reader to know which source is the full citation? Only if it is needed there should be a short and full citation with a linking style at Traditional African medicine. A &quot;properly formatted&quot; shortcite used the &quot;linking style&quot; like oyal Maundy#Notes. ser:QuackGuru|QuackGuru (ser talk:QuackGuru|talk) 18:44, 23 September 2014 (UTC)

t|&quot;How is the reader to know which source is the full citation&quot; when the reader is given the name of an author, the year of publication, and a page number, and immediately underneath that short citation, he reader is given a full bibliographic citation, one of which also contains a matching author's name and publication date?

Maybe because the reader spent several years of high school writing reports using this exact style of footnoting?  Maybe because the reader will use just a tiny bit of common sense?  Maybe because the reader is not actually a complete idiot and therefore does not look at &quot;Smith (2010) page 15&quot; followed by a mere inch lower on the screen by an entry that says, &quot;Smith, Bob (2010) The Sun is Really Big New York:Random House&quot; and jump to the idiotic conclusion that there could not possibly be any connection between these two references to someone named Smith who published a book in 2010?

This isn't &quot;wrong&quot;.  This isn't even difficult.  This is a system that is widely recommended by real-world experts and used in millions of papers and books.  It is used, without any hint of links, as a normal and acceptable method in the example at P:CITESHORT.

They are not formatted the way you like them, but it has been abundantly demonstrated above that this is not a GA requirement, nor one of ikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Medicine-related_articles#Citing_medical_sources. It is inappropriate to talk of them being &quot;malformed&quot;, &quot;not properly&quot; formatted, or not &quot;working&quot;. If it bothers you that much, you might ask on the talk page if people object to you changing them, but they are well within their rights to do so. I don't think P:CITEVAR has been mentioned above, but it is highly relevant here.  If people want more examples of FAs using similar systems, most of mine do (all the ones where I was the primary writer).

 Suggestions for very short article 

Hello all. I've found isual processing, which doesn't seem problematic but it's very short and (probably?) covered elsewhere. However I'm not a subject matter expert and as such I'm unwilling to redirect it (and don't know a good merge target to propose or do one). Is this ok by itself? Should it be expanded? Or is it better merged into a more appropriate target. Alternately is there an extant article which better covers this topic but exists under a different name? Thanks. ser:Protonk|Protonk (ser talk:Protonk|talk) 17:02, 24 September 2014 (UTC)
I think you can go ahead and redirect it to isual perception. They are essentially the same thing, and visual perception even has a section on artificial visual perception. As there are no references in the article I don't know if you would even need to merge, as there are no references for the name. -- ser:CFCF|CFCF ser talk:CFCF|🍌 (pecial:EmailUser/CFCF|email) 18:03, 24 September 2014 (UTC)

 It might be better as some sort of disambiguation page. Visual processing in a biological systems is covered at a high level in isual system and at lower level in some of the daughter articles. Visual processing in a computer context is covered at a high level in omputer vision and in lower levels in various mage processing articles. While there is some overlap between the computer and biological vision communities (one notable interface may be euromorphic engineering), its not clear that an article uniting the two fields is the best approach. --ser:Mark viking|Mark viking (ser talk:Mark viking|talk) 18:06, 24 September 2014 (UTC)

 Since no-one else has looked into it (pun intended), I have done so. There are 44 papers in Pubmed that mention &quot;corneal inlay&quot;. Although only two of these papers ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23703461 Lindstrom] and [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18045251 Sweeney]) are review papers, I think that overall, there is enough third-party coverage to support notability of the topic.

 15 references are provided in the draft article:-

# The first paper (Chang, &quot;Novel Approaches to Treating Presbyopia&quot;, Review of Cornea &amp; Contact Lenses) is not listed in Pubmed.
# [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22018596 Seyeddain (1)] is said to be a cohort study but is really a case series—a primary study.
# [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22921231 Dexl (1)] is another case series by the same group in Salzburg.
# [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21570249 Yilmaz] is a larger case series (39 patients).
# [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21436279 Tabernero (1)] is a small case series in Murcia, Spain.
# [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22045576 Waring] is a larger study of 507 patients.
# [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22138501 Dexl (2)] is another case series from the Salzburg group (24 patients). [The draft misidentifies and misspells the first author as &quot;Taberno&quot;.]
# [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22177883 Tabernero (2)] is a primary source describing a series of 16 models (Murcia group).
# [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22105801 Dexl (3)] is another case series from Salzburg. (The draft misidentifies the primary author as Seyeddain.)
# [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22921231 Dexl (4)] is more of the same, again with the primary author misidentified.
# [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23084361 Gatinel] is a case series of two patients.
# [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23079332 Seyeddain (2)] is a letter.
# [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22340607 Tomita] is a bigger study of 180 patients.
# Ocular Surgery News seems to be a news website. There are [http://www.healio.com/search?q=corneal%20inlay&amp;requiredfields=specialty:Ophthalmology several relevant articles] on that website. [http://www.healio.com/ophthalmology/refractive-surgery/news/print/ocular-surgery-news/%7B74f54a76-88c7-4621-b776-d9ac1acfbada%7D/corneal-inlays-provide-safe-reversible-option-for-presbyopia-treatment The reference] used looks suitable.
# The journal named &quot;Cataract and Refractive Surgery&quot; is not listed in Pubmed, although it is unclear if this should be the &quot;Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery&quot;. Either way, the article title given is not listed in Pubmed, although Waring has similar papers listed. The most similar paper is [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21383579 Corneal inlays for the treatment of presbyopia]. This is a &quot;historical article&quot;.

 In summary, all but one of the references are inappropriate. The draft needs to be re-written from scratch with carefully chosen references and in-line citations. ser:Axl|Axl ¤ ser talk:Axl|[Talk] 15:24, 23 September 2014 (UTC)

I also rewrote the first part to be more readable by non-scientists (for example, people like me with bad eyesight).  However, having no previous knowledge of this topic except for one lecture at my local computer and technology club, I may have mangled it, so I hope that you or anyone else who is more knowledgeable will adjust as necessary.

 Accuracy and Completeness of Drug Information in Wikipedia: A Comparison with Standard Textbooks of Pharmacology 

Reading the morning news I came across a news article about a new paper published in PLOS:[http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0106930 Accuracy and Completeness of Drug Information in Wikipedia: A Comparison with Standard Textbooks of Pharmacology]

Their research found we have something like 99.7%±0.2% accuracy when it comes to drug information, and 83.8±1.5% completeness.

Looking at the abstract they also did some review of readability. Indication was most complete and pharmacokinetics the least - which is understandable. Their conclusion is very promising (my emphasis):

Drug articles in Wikipedia had an average of 14.6±1.6 references and 262.8±37.4 edits performed by 142.7±17.6 editors. Both Wikipedia and textbooks samples had comparable, low readability. Our study suggests that Wikipedia is an accurate and comprehensive source of drug-related information for undergraduate medical education.

For me these are astounding numbers if they are true. I haven't dived into the paper yet, but will as soon as I have time.

The line about “low readability” sounds like a challenge, doesn't it?

Totally awesome findings. Not too surprising about problems with readability. I bet that they didn't check to see if the references were outdated which is one of the main problems that plagues our medical articles. But compared to textbooks it would likely be comparable.

I'm against using these too much, because when the main article is updated the summary won't be (most of the time).

very interesting project! Would be happy to collaborate.  Are you going to be working primarily in the ipolar disorder article?  Quick note, in case you are not aware of the following.  Please know that wikipedia is not a place for P:OR|original research; instead we rely on the best sources we can find, as described in our guideline for sourcing health related content, P:MEDRS.  The best sources are reviews published in the biomedical literature and statements by major scientific and medical bodies (so a treatment guideline from APA or the like would be great).  Here is the most recent review I found (which also has some primary research in it) in pubmed that compares lithium and valproate - MID|22000157.  there is also a recent cochrane review on valproate that has some discussion, comparing it it lithium: MID|24132760.

 Article in need of checking over - icrotherapy 

Hi all. I just came across icrotherapy, which hasn't been substantively edited since 2007. I lack the medical expertise to judge, but my first impression was that it may be either pseudoscience, or an article which has since been eclipsed by a more comprehensive one under another name. Even if it's neither of those, its sourcing is remarkably lacking. Perhaps if someone from this project is looking for something to do, they could take a look over it and see what needs doing?

(ec) Yeah, that does look a bit problematic.  The first source in the article, which waves vaguely at the definition, is just a PubMed search on 'microtherapy'.  It turns up just 65 hits, which is awfully thin already.  Further, most are not actually papers about the topic (or even mentioning the topic) but the work of a few scientists who have an institutional affiliation with one department of one university (Department of Radiology and Microtherapy, University of Witten/Herdecke).  A small number of scientists seem to be trying very hard to make the word microtherapy (Mikro Therapie or Mikrotherapie, in German) into a thing; it's just a synonym for inimally-invasive surgery ([https://www.thieme-connect.com/DOI/DOI?10.1055/s-0031-1283862], [http://www.dafmt.de/]).  If the term stays around at all, we should probably just point it to our existing article.
If you filter the PubMed results to only include publications mentioning 'microtherapy' in their title or abstract, you're down to 13 hits (at least one of which is a false-positive because of an institutional affiliation in the abstract text).  Three more papers refer to an apparent term of art (or possibly a nonce word) in speech pathology from about 30 years ago, and a couple of papers talk about an ocular drug delivery method from the same era.
Worse still, the article at icrotherapy doesn't even deal with any of those topics.  It actually appears to be describing microcurrent therapy.  See requency Specific Microcurrent, icrocurrent electrical neuromuscular stimulator, and lectrotherapy (cosmetic), which are themselves in need of varying amounts of attention. ser:TenOfAllTrades|TenOfAllTrades(ser_talk:TenOfAllTrades|talk) 18:24, 30 September 2014 (UTC)

 Images of people getting care 

I spent a while looking for an image for orning care (the routine of getting people dressed for the day, most prominently in long-term care facilities).  I was unsuccessful.  If anyone knows of some, or even could take some pictures, that would be great.  Commons seems to have a shortage of pictures of elderly people, and a picture of, say, an elderly man being shaved by someone else is even rarer.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 03:38, 29 September 2014 (UTC)
 Wouldn't that be a vulnerable person? ser:Axl|Axl ¤ ser talk:Axl|[Talk] 09:30, 29 September 2014 (UTC)
Axl is teasing a bit because of the proposal at ikipedia_talk:Image_use_policy#Vulnerable_people.
I am working in health publishing these days and as a Wikipedian, I have come to realize that all health nonprofit organizations all have an endless demand for reusable photos of people getting health care in their illustrations. I am not sure of the focus of the demand, but at least I can say that everyone wants pictures of a doctor or caregiver talking with a person receiving care. The images have to represent as many mixes of ages and ethnicities as possible in both doctor and patient, and neither can look rich or poor. If I tried to imagine a photoshoot which would force every health organization in the world to use Wikimedia Commons images, it would probably be for us to maintain a pool of stock photos with cleared personality rights of a bunch of models who agreed to be depicted suffering from and treating every imaginable disease in health articles. Health organizations pay a lot of money for everything they publish to get images of the recycled fake patients from photo companies, and then when they want to republish something they have to clear the rights again. If the Wikimedia community could provide such pictures, they would practically be forced on the world.
Perhaps some of you remember that in the past few months [https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=67477 Wellcome Trust donated 300 gigs of health photos] to us. In this donation, they withheld the boring fake patient photos that make them so much in licensing, because this is still big business. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 13:41, 29 September 2014 (UTC)
I am working on this at CRUK, where we do lots of our own photos/videos, mostly of real patients, but in this area model release issues may prevent much progress, even for images made in the future.

Might be, Axl, although a ulnerable adult is not a synonym for any adult who is vulnerable, and is even less a synonym for an old man getting shaved by someone else. 
For our purposes, we would do everything Blue said, and also have photos with the people arranged to focus on the impersonal action rather than on their faces.

The lines of argument are that:
* FGM is &quot;medical&quot; because it's safer to do it in sterile medical facilities than in dusty village streets (and in Egypt, you can get it done in medical facilities for exactly that reason).  It's also &quot;traditional&quot; and &quot;African&quot; (both undisputed), and P:NOR|therefore it's &quot;Traditional African medicine&quot;.
* FGM is cultural, not &quot;medical&quot;, because it meets none of the basic definitions of &quot;medicine&quot;, i.e., &quot;the science that deals with preventing, curing, and treating diseases&quot;.[http://m-w.com/dictionary/medicine]
As for sources, there are [https://www.google.com/search?q=%22female+genital+mutilation%22+%22traditional+african+medicine%22 a few] that mention both terms, but few that equate the two and [https://www.google.com/search?q=%22female+genital+mutilation%22+%22cultural+practice%22 significantly more] that mention &quot;cultural practice&quot; in relationship to female genital mutilation.

That's not a very neutral summary - it is of course a &quot;cultural practice&quot;, like male circumscision in the West. It is also a medical procedure, with hygene claimed as one of the benefits, as well as the prevention of sexual appetites considered unacceptable. There is no dichotomy there, any more than for other aspects of osmetic surgery or many other areas of medicine such as psychiatry.  The WHO and similar bodies think it falls under them, and take a great interest, as searches will show. I'm very puzzled as to why anyone would think it does not fall under that subject, unless they share the somewhat hippy-ish &quot;all traditional and alternative medical ideas must be great&quot; perspective that seems to dominate the current article and its sources, using an artificial definition of Traditional African medicine that excludes all the questionable stuff to leave altruistic grannies doling out herbal remedies. ser:Johnbod|Johnbod (ser talk:Johnbod|talk) 15:12, 27 September 2014 (UTC)

Your justification is being questioned for adding it to the TAM category, not because of whitewashing or stone-walling, but because you have not providing any reliable references for the view that FGM is practised for healing purposes under TAM (like ivination, erbalism, hamanism|shamanic practices are) and not specifically as a cultural practice.

 When hoaxes go wrong 

I trust some people here have seen [http://abcnews.go.com/Health/nigerian-ebola-hoax-results-deaths/story?id=25842191 this] or [http://news92fm.com/482421/nigerian-ebola-hoax-results-in-two-deaths/ this], where a single known Twitterer is credited for starting a phenomenon that is credited with killing two Nigerians and putting 20 in the hospital for drinking too much salt water.  It's possible [http://topsy.com/s?q=%22bath%20with%20hot%20water%20and%20salt%22&amp;window=a&amp;sort=-date watch how this played out], at least to some extent, though I fear that as usual somebody has been busy sanitizing the primary sources.  Interesting though that there are a couple of tweets with an apparently similar idea from three years ago - I wonder how much the myth was already established culturally?

Another difficult case for us free-speech believers concerns the most amazing (and appalling) prank phone calls I ever heard, [http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/4560997.html in which] a caller managed to convince two different women that he was a doctor, they had been exposed to a serious disease, and they had to diagnose or treat it by cutting their nipples off - with one actually completing the act.

But I don't think that the knee-jerk reaction of cracking down on communications is right.  If there are people walking around with &quot;the key in the ignition&quot;, just waiting for anybody, a twitter voice, a phone call, to tell them what to do, then that is the main problem.  We need people to think more, to question their source more, and I don't think we can train them to do that by feeding them only predigested data for consumers.  And if there is a moral duty here, one which people like the prank caller have badly transgressed, is that ethic really not to say things that are wrong -- or to point out what is true whenever given the opportunity?

We are in the midst of a terrible and international assault on the freedom of communications, and I know that events like the Ebola hoax can be used to back that, but we can do better. ser:Wnt|Wnt (ser talk:Wnt|talk) 22:11, 30 September 2014 (UTC)

It's not &quot;importance&quot;, despite what the label says (it's too much trouble to change the parameter on 30,000+ talk pages, although we could change the description on the template); it's &quot;priority&quot;, as in &quot;Which articles should be put into the offline, limited-space collections of Wikipedia articles that the P:1.0 team assembles first?&quot;  
We have a general rule that articles about events happening for a limited space in time (e.g., any article whose article contains a specific year) and/or in a limited geographical region (e.g., any US law about healthcare) are lower priority for inclusion than articles about general subjects, e.g., ramps, which have affected people worldwide every day for millenia, or the main article for bola, which includes a good summary of this year's epidemic at bola virus disease#2014 outbreak.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 14:58, 1 October 2014 (UTC)
 It might have been once for the use of WP:1.0, but that's essentially historical now. The &quot;importance&quot; parameter is decided by the Wikiproject whose tag it exists in (and could easily be different between projects): that simply reflects the importance that the Wikiproject gives to its own efforts to improve the article.

 Comment on the WikiProject X proposal 

Hello there! As you may already know, most WikiProjects here on Wikipedia struggle to stay active after they've been founded. I believe there is a lot of potential for WikiProjects to facilitate collaboration across subject areas, so I have submitted a grant proposal with the Wikimedia Foundation for the &quot;WikiProject X&quot; project. WikiProject X will study what makes WikiProjects succeed in retaining editors and then design a prototype WikiProject system that will recruit contributors to WikiProjects and help them run effectively. Please eta:Grants:IEG/WikiProject X|review the proposal here and leave feedback. If you have any questions, you can ask on the proposal page or leave a message on my ser talk:Harej|talk page.

 Is a MEDRS suggesting systemic bias suitable to establish noteworthyness of non-MEDRS secondary sources? 

Regarding the discussion at alk:Environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing#WP:WEIGHT of new study: &quot;Proximity to Natural Gas Wells and Reported Health Status&quot; (2014), I believe [http://wirelessrighttoknow.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Seymour-Rev-Env-Health-2013.pdf] (MID|24413211) is a WP:MEDRS which may establish the noteworthyness of secondary news source coverage of [http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/wp-content/uploads/advpub/2014/9/ehp.1307732.pdf]. If this is incorrect, please explain why.

Hi, I'm not seeing any of these articles as review articles. And we can not take the finding of each review and combine them to create our own review.

 When MEDRS reviews are unavailable 
When there are no MEDRS-quality review articles on a topic, but an abundant number of peer-reviewed sources which include literature review sections and would otherwise fit the MEDRS criteria except for the fact that they are not primarily literature reviews, is there any actual specific prohibition on using those review sections as if they were MEDRS-quality?

you will find a range of opinions on that.  some say if there are no reviews at all then the subject shouldn't be discussed in WP at all.  others would reach for something like a review of the literature found in the discussion of introduction section of a P:PRIMARY source but even in that case most would say that strong statements should not be made based on such weak sources.  i would tend to agree with the position that WP should be silent if there are no MEDRS quality reviews at all but cannot judge without more details. ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 18:13, 21 September 2014 (UTC)

Colin, one of the initial authors of MEDRS, pretty much takes that stance. it goes deep.  the underlying notion is that our goal is to provide reliable information to the public, and if there are no secondary sources that comply with MEDRS then there is nothing reliable that can be said; so we say nothing. it makes sense.ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 21:47, 21 September 2014 (UTC)

I do not see anything in MEDRS that prohibits it.  Often writers of original studies will summarize the existing literature before explaining their own research.  I do not see anything wrong with using these, particularly when review studies have not been written or are outdated.  The same source can be both a primary and secondary source depending on its use.  ser:The Four Deuces|TFD (ser talk:The Four Deuces|talk) 19:47, 21 September 2014 (UTC)
Well, MEDRS technically doesn't &quot;prohibit&quot; anything, and P:IAR is still a policy.  But on the assumption that the goal is to have  the best possible material supported by the best possible sources, then MEDRS does strongly discourage this, because these mini-reviews tend to be biased.  It's not always the case that the authors deliberately include only sources they agree with, but they've got limited space, so they focus on the prior work that explains or justifies their own work.  The incompleteness results in (varying degrees of) bias.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 21:11, 21 September 2014 (UTC)

It does provide an overview of chemicals used in fracking and potential risks but is quite clear that &quot;The effects of these agents on the water supply and subsequent human health are not well known and require further investigation&quot; and says that &quot;When applied to children, the health consequences associated with ongoing contact with these and other gas exploitation toxic substances, although not presently known, at the very least, constitute a threat to children's health now and in the future.&quot; (emphasis added) - in other words - what Alexbrn said above &quot;we don't yet know the health implications of frac'ing but there is concern, data is being collected, and in time we likely will know more&quot;.  The article from Energy Policy is not relevant to MEDRS. ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 19:04, 22 September 2014 (UTC)

 Why is the Energy Policy article not relevant to MEDRS? The bulk of its Section 2 is all about health and safety. ser:EllenCT|EllenCT (ser talk:EllenCT|talk) 20:02, 22 September 2014 (UTC)

I'd just be careful not to jump on these references as validating edits designed to promote a single view of this subject.  The statement that &quot;shale gas extraction can affect water safety&quot; is not equivalent to &quot;shale gas is currently having a negative effect on water safety all across the country&quot;.  In fact it doesn't really say anything at all.  Radioactive materials from meteorites &quot;can&quot; affect the safety of water from above ground reservoirs too, but its contingent on said meteor falling in or near the reservoir.  The author encourages better tracking and transperancy of extraction efforts, and points out that gas is a good transitional fuel as we move to more renewable sources.  

It always worries me when people use the word &quot;admit&quot; to describe statements or reports by government agencies.  Most of these people are just bureaucrats with no axe to grind and no conspiracy to carry out.  Most are trying to do their job, and not there for the purpose of frustrating activists. ser:Formerly 98|Formerly 98 (ser talk:Formerly 98|talk) 18:58, 22 September 2014 (UTC)
I've never been politically active on the issue of fracking ever, but I'm looking for evidence of how obvious and widely-reported COI breaches (such as mandatory nondisclosure laws) off-wiki materialize on-wiki and affect articles here. 
How about, &quot;Although potential benefits of Marcellus natural gas exploitation are large for transition to a clean energy economy, at present the regulatory framework in New York State is inadequate to prevent potentially irreversible threats to the local environment and New York City water supply.

PubMed says that MID|23722091 is a review, not an advocacy or opinion piece.  We do not have a rule against using reviews if the author has ideas about what the world should do with scientific information.

I've followed this a little bit.  The fansite data was quoted in a peer reviewed article (possibly even a review) somewhere at one point, though I don't know the reference. The concern is that there are dozens of garage labs making this stuff for body builders and the like who want to get tan, and there have been reports of melananoma like skin changes in some users.  Might want to looks at ttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bremelanotide too, as it is a similar compound with some similarities in activity.  I think Brem does not cause the tanning, but both compounds act on MC4 receptors to increase sexual appetite and induce weight loss. So an obvious candidate for abuse. 

Its kind of an interesting compound for the porphyria indication, though it did not hit its primary endpoint in the second phase III trial.  ser:Formerly 98|Formerly 98 (ser talk:Formerly 98|talk) 17:18, 2 October 2014 (UTC)

 Addition of Malnutrition in Peru to WikiProject Medicine

Malnutrition is an important health concern in Peru, especially rural populations. I plan on examining the causes, effects, and management of malnutrition within the context of Peru. There seems to be a lack of focus on health related issues, with only seven pages that fall under the “Health in Peru” category.

 Myocardial infarction and Acute coronary syndrome 

In wikipedia there is some occasional confusion between myocardial infarction (MI) and ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). For instance, the article on cute coronary syndrome|Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) has a link to yocardial infarction|MI right uder the STEMI subsection of the cute coronary syndrome#Treatment|treatment section. More importantly, there is occasional confusion between MI and ACS. Currently, ACS is the general term encompassing the following acute conditions: STEMI, non ST elevation MI (NSTEMI), and unstable angina. Moreover, NSTEMI and unstable angina fall under the umbrella of non ST elevation ACS: both American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology and European Society of Cardiology guidelines refer to Non-ST elevation ACS rather than NSTEMI.ite journal|last=Amsterdam|first=EA et al.  |title=2014 AHA/ACC Guideline for the Management of Patients With Non-ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes: A Report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines|journal=Circulation|date=2014|volume=Published online September 23 2014 |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/early/2014/09/22/CIR.0000000000000134.citation|accessdate=27 September 2014|ref= fnref|Amsterdam|2014 ite journal|last1=The Task Force for the management of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) in patients presenting without persistent ST-segment elevation of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC)|title=ESC Guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes in patients presenting without persistent ST-segment elevation|journal=European heart Journal|date=2011|volume=32|pages=2999–3054|doi=10.1093/eurheartj/ehr236|url=http://eurheartj.oxfordjournals.org/content/32/23/2999.full.pdf The major article is currently yocardial infarction|MI, in the sense that it contains most details on the ACS family of medical conditions. Accordingly, yocardial infarction  management|MI management is the only special article on the management of conditions of the ACS spectrum, and, indeed, is actually an article on management of ACS, as little distinction is made in current medical practice between management of NSTEMI and (confirmed) unstable angina. This perplexes what articles under each of the above titles must contain. I wonder: 

# Should yocardial infarction management be renamed Acute coronary syndrome management?
# Should, perhaps, two different articles be written on the management of STEMI and NST-ACS - which, despite significant overlap, have important differences (e.g. reperfusion)?
# Should, even, yocardial infarction be renamed ST elevation MI, and all information that pertains both to STEMI and NSTEMI be directed to cute coronary syndrome?
My opinion is:
# Agree. (Though not totally sure).
# Oppose, despite the great difficulties I have in improving the article on yocardial infarction management|MI management. It would make the articles too technical for the general reader.
# Oppose. The term of the layman is &quot;myocardial infarction&quot;. The article on ACS (which needs to be expanded) will just significantly overlap with the article on MI. (E.g., symptoms are basically the same).

 ikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Insulin Allergy 

Dear medical experts:  The nsulin article doesn't seem to have a section about &quot;insulin allergy&quot;.  Should it? 

As an aside: While looking through this article for mentions of allergy, I noted that it has information about the first uses of insulin in the USA, but nothing about first uses in other countries - just saying... —ser:Anne Delong|Anne Delong (ser talk:Anne Delong|talk) 12:39, 5 October 2014 (UTC)

 esentery - narrower or broader definition? 
Discussion also at T:ANAT

Right, there is some talk about whether we merge ransverse mesocolon, igmoid mesocolon, esoappendix and oot of the mesentery into esentery - all depends on how narrowly or broadly we define mesentery  - either &quot;mesentery proper&quot;, which is just of small bowel, or the whole lot - so what do folks wanna do? ser:Casliber|Cas Liber (ser talk:Casliber|talk · pecial:Contributions/Casliber|contribs) 05:30, 6 October 2014 (UTC)

Get rid of Cite PMID and DOI
We have discussed this [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine/Archive_47#Replace_.22cite_pmid.22_with_.22cite_journal.22 previously] and there was consensus to remove emplate:Cite pmid and emplate:Cite doi from our top 1000 most viewed articles. This has been a great move forwards IMO. I would like to propose removing it from all articles tagged by WPMED and replacing it with emplate:Cite journal. Than also have a bot that regularly goes around and replaces any new ones added. Hopefully ser:Boghog can do this again.

I recognize the seriousness of the problems associated with these templates. However, I fail to see these problems as urgent and I do not want the infrastructure built by these templates to be damaged until it is certain that it is no longer needed. This proposal is not describing any damaging action, and only proposes to replace some templates with expanded citations. I think that is a good line to have in making changes without harming anything. Since the last time this was discussed, d:Wikidata:WikiProject Source MetaData has been established and there is currently a grant proposal being developed at meta:Grants:IdeaLab/Tools for using wikidata items as citations to address this. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 15:28, 6 October 2014 (UTC)

* How many articles use this as their chosen style, rather than just on a couple of citations here or there?  If the article normally uses l|cite journal, then &quot;correcting&quot; the formatting on a couple is no big deal.  But if it's used for everything/most citations, then that's a more complicated case.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 05:43, 5 October 2014 (UTC)
 Before BogBot substituted transcluded pmid/doi/isbn templates with in-line cite journal/book templates, only about ~300 of the top 1500 MED articles used transcluded templates.  In the vast majority of these 300 articles, the transcluded templates were in the minority. There were only a handful of articles (~10) where cite pmid/doi/isbn templates predominated and even in these, the transcluded templates tended to be the most recently added. Per P:CITEVAR, if transcluded cite templates were in the majority, I tried to determine what the initial citation style used in the article was and follow this style. ser:Boghog|Boghog (ser talk:Boghog|talk) 07:30, 5 October 2014 (UTC)
* I assume that the scope of this request includes any article that transcludes the l|WikiProject Medicine on its talk page.  According to the [https://tools.wmflabs.org/templatecount/index.php?lang=en&amp;name=WikiProject_Medicine&amp;namespace=10#bottom template transclusion count tool], this amounts to 32,298 articles.  Based percentage of the top 1500 MED articles that had transcluded cite template, I would estimate approximately (300/1500) X (32,298 - 1500) = ~6000 articles would need to be edited. ser:Boghog|Boghog (ser talk:Boghog|talk) 07:45, 5 October 2014 (UTC)
** And, also if the stats hold, then something on the order of 200 of them will need manual processing, which is simultaneously a tiny fraction of our articles and a big hassle to sort out manually, especially if any of them provoke disputes.

*:It is great that consensus is to cease using CITE DOI. We also need a bot that goes around and replaces CITE DOI and CITE PMID with CITE JOURNAL.

Interesting. I'm a bit surprised the reviewers didn't request the Epidemiology section be repositioned earlier in the article (pace MEDMOS) and certainly before the Prevention section.

 Question asked on the Talk:Ebola virus disease page 

An editor asked about immunology as regards to Ebola virus disease, as there has been some talk in the news regarding using survivors in treating the currently ill. A brief look on the CDC sites suggests a possible 10 year-ish immunity, but cross-strain immunity isn't known (at least, that is the impression I got). Can we get a bit of help on this from someone who knows a bit more on this particular subject? Thanks in advance.ser:Wzrd1|Wzrd1 (ser talk:Wzrd1|talk) 16:59, 6 October 2014 (UTC)
I believe I heard about this being done about 15 or 20 years ago, so presumably it will be mentioned in sources somewhere.  This would be a type of assive immunity, so that's probably an appropriate keyword to search for, but that (&quot;passive immunity ebola&quot;, no quotation marks) gives me only MID|11023960 and MID|9291299 at PubMed, both of which are a bit elderly.  Perhaps another term is more common for this idea now, and perhaps the newer term might give you more results.
(Also, ransfusion-related immunomodulation needs some help.)  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 23:10, 6 October 2014 (UTC)
Thanks for the quick response. The issue raised by an editor was, a physician who suffered from Ebola spoke to the notion of using survivors to help treat the inflicted. I see the notion as over simplistic and since it does not consider previous exposures to different strains, *really* problematic. That said, I have zero references to support the obvious and even less to support current immunity and even less time. I'm swing shift and time is a bit of a premium, due to that life thing. From what I recall, the evidence is still a bit awaiting for this epidemic, hence the request for assistance. My Google-Fu is strong and repels nonsense. My Time-Fu is weak, currently.ser:Wzrd1|Wzrd1 (ser talk:Wzrd1|talk) 08:19, 7 October 2014 (UTC)</segment>
