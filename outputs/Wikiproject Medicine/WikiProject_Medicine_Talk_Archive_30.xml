 refuses to answer a straight gf query  as to the existence of any COI with Cell Science Systems, the marketers of the ALCAT test, simply providing an edit summary that reads Ridiculous accusations that don't deserve a response [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Plot_Spoiler&amp;curid=21451996&amp;diff=519944341&amp;oldid=519943697]. Given this user's history (a previous username failed to meet Wikipedia's username policy because it was &quot;that of a product or company&quot; [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Plot_Spoiler#Username_concern]) and editing habits I feel that the question is anything but ridiculous.

Good point. I content maybe reasonable.  Is this WP:DUE? Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 19:38, 30 October 2012 (UTC)
They'd still need to determine whether it is an independent, secondary source, and whether the edit uses the source appropriately (not cherry-picking, e.g.) I don't personally have the necessary full-text access to make such an assessment. I simply state that I would not reject it solely on the basis of the choice of journal, or that of the absence of Pubmed indexing. LeadSongDog come howl! 19:57, 30 October 2012 (UTC)

Myoclonic epilepsy

FYI, see the talk page of Myoclonic epilepsy where I said this student could ask questions at WT:MED or my talk page. There seems to have been a little confusion. Colin°Talk 15:37, 1 November 2012 (UTC)

Hi Colin- I am a student and part of the myoclonic epilepsy article you took a look at.  I'm very confused by the plagarism issue. If the sources are cited then how it is plagarism? Some of parts of the article was 100% copied from a book but I thought that didn't matter as long as it was cited where we got the information from.  Please let guide me in the right direction here. thank you R.EEGbrittry (talk) 17:56, 31 October 2012 (UTC)
 Have a look at . In summary, verbatim copying of text counts as plagiarism even if the reference is given. This is because unquoted text implies that this is original text based on the reference. Related issues are  and . Axl ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 18:15, 31 October 2012 (UTC)
 FRom WP:PLAGIARISM: &quot;Stronger attribution is required when content is copied or closely paraphrased from sources. This helps to maintain the clear distinction between work submitted by Wikipedia editors as their own work (which can be &quot;edited mercilessly&quot;), and work marked as a quotation (which must be properly credited and left essentially untouched).&quot; Such &quot;copy &amp; quote&quot; text should be reserved for situations when a direct quote from the original speaker enhances the reader's understanding beyond that of new text based on the source.

Hi Colin-- Will you take a look at my talk page and tell me what you think of the updated version for the myoclonic epilepsy article? I would like your feedback to make sure I referenced everything correctly.  thanks! R.EEGbrittry (talk) 20:45, 31 October 2012 (UTC)
 Wait—I'm not Colin. I suspect that you should be asking these questions on Colin's talk page. Axl ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 21:25, 31 October 2012 (UTC)

Hi, there seems to be a little confusion over WT:MED vs my talk page. Anyway, yes we need to write Wikipedia articles in our own words and we can generally only lift other people's words directly when they are in quotes. And we don't build articles from lots of quotes. Any significant amount of copying is a copyright problem, which is rather serious hence the knife taken to the changes. I will try to get time to look at this but am not sure I will have time tonight or tomorrow night. I could only review your work against the source text via a Google Books search as I don't have that book (though I have a couple of others too) If someone else here on WP:MED can help that would be appreciated. The issues are covered on the article talk page. In addition to rephrasing source text, some help with wiki formatting/referencing might be useful. Colin°Talk 15:37, 1 November 2012 (UTC)

Sugar high

Could someone have a look at Sugar high? It was changed from an article to a redir to List of common misconceptions some weeks ago, and now the article has been restored. I find it a bit fishy but don't know enough to decide whether this condition actually exists. Thanks, ἀνυπόδητος (talk) 08:52, 1 November 2012 (UTC)
I don't know if it needs to be a separate article or not, but either way the article needs some serious work.  I've removed some unnecessary content, some of it redundant and copied from sucrose, but it still needs some attention from someone familiar with the subject.  Personally I think it should be redirected to sucrose, since most of the article seems to be copied from that article, with maybe a brief sentence explaining &quot;sugar high&quot; and whether it's a thing or not.  I don't think this needs its own article; if you took away all of the unsourced content, there's hardly anything there. - SudoGhost 09:33, 1 November 2012 (UTC)

Being fat isn't bad for your health?

This article Fat_acceptance_movement#Modern_movement appears to claim that being fat isn't bad for your health. IRWolfie- (talk) 10:27, 2 November 2012 (UTC)
I see no suggestion in that section that there are no medical consequences to being overweight or obese. A little farther down, in the criticism section, issues of cmedical consequences are given some airing, but personally i find the anti-shaming arguments generally compelling. Also, the clinical terms, as above, are &quot;obese&quot; and &quot;overweight,&quot; not &quot;fat&quot; which seems to carry slightly more stigma than the former two, at least at the moment. UseTheCommandLine (talk) 10:39, 2 November 2012 (UTC)

The Fat_acceptance_movement#Modern_movement section certainly deserves its tag, imo. At the same time, the stigma issue is clearly a relevant topic from a health perspective [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3175190/]. —MistyMorn (talk) 11:23, 2 November 2012 (UTC)

I suppose it depends on what you mean by &quot;bad for your health&quot;.  There was a media flurry a little while ago reporting that obesity, if not accompanied by hypertension, diabetes, etc., had no negative effect on heart health.  About a quarter of obese people fall into that group, and if heart disease is your definition of &quot;health&quot;, then it's not bad for that lucky minority.  Also, overweight people are more likely to survive a MI than thin people, so it could even be positive, in a limited sense.  I think the comment in a prior section is probably right:  &quot;it's complicated&quot;.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 00:34, 3 November 2012 (UTC)

Within scope?

Is Mindfulness-based_stress_reduction#Benefits within scope of this project? It appears to state that there are benefits to this therapy and that it says &quot;Practicing MBSR can change the brain and how it works&quot;. The poor sourcing, and quotes of benefits from the proponents, raises a red flag for me that there might be cherry picking going on. IRWolfie- (talk) 11:43, 2 November 2012 (UTC)
I would think this would be more 's bag, though there's no bright line UseTheCommandLine (talk) 11:53, 2 November 2012 (UTC)

Adding: This PubMed search string &quot;Stress, Psychological&quot;[Majr] AND mindfulness[ti] AND (2007[PDAT] : 2013[PDAT]) AND (Review[ptyp] OR systematic[sb]) turns up several more potential MEDRS from recent years (and there may well be other relevant candidates, eg [http://www.tripdatabase.com/search?categoryid=1,11,16,18,10,9,4&amp;criteria=mindfulness%20based+stress+reduction]).

Renaming Skene's gland

Seeing as Skene's gland has been renamed to &quot;female prostrate&quot; by the Federative International Committee on Anatomical Terminology[http://seattletimes.com/html/health/2002865111_carnalknowledge15.html], I think it would be appropriate to change the article title as well.

 Hmm, I found [http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/90/9/713.1.full this paper]. However the phrase is rarely used. The article should remain with its current title. Axl ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 12:19, 4 November 2012 (UTC)
I did manage to find the Terminologia Anatomica: International Anatomical Terminology on googlebooks [http://books.google.se/books?id=0dYwOxPA6VcC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=en&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false], but here they are instead listed as minor vestibular glands. The book is published in 1998, however. If the article in the Seattle times is true, one can wonder what the point is in having an international committee that sets standards in medical terminology while not informing the rest of the medical community about them, and whether they should be considered an authority on the subject on an online wikipedia. Their official website looks rather shabby as well. Oh well. Maybe someone else knows more about this; from my (minor) experiences in the subject, it seems that medical terminology is trying to move away from non-functional (if that is the correct term?) names.

German translation

If someone reads (medical) German fairly easily,  has some disease-related drawings with German captions.  It would be handy to have a translation, or even a transcript (which would be searchable, unlike the text that is in the original images, and something that could be pasted into Google Translate at a pinch).  I'd like to get these categorized as something more specific than &quot;diseases and disorders&quot;, and that's a lot easier to do when I know what I'm looking at.  

As each drawing only has a few words on it (e.g., one says only &quot;Windpocken&quot;, which means chickenpox), I suspect that the translations will be quick and simple.

How many peers typically review an article submitted to a prestigious peer-reviewed journal; do they get paid and if so how much; are reviewers still usually anonymous; do all or only some journals charge the author to submit an article and if so is that determined by their quality?

sounds like you should talk to an academic librarian. from what i understand, only having been on the submitting end of things a handful of times, reviewers by and large dont get paid (though editors may), reviewers are usually anonymous (never heard anything to the contrary), and most journals charge the author to submit an article (&quot;editing fees&quot;), though again, my experience might be atypical. unaware of any basic overviews like this, but if you find one it would be great if you could share the link(s).

Well, some of your specific questions are easily answered. Policies vary, but typically a peer-review journal will send a submission to 2, 3 or sometimes even 4 unpaid reviewers who (in theory at least) have little to gain beyond prestige.

Removal of medical text at Antifreeze article again

Hi. In September, a few of you commented in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Antifreeze#Current_discussion Current discussion section] at the Antifreeze talk page about the contested removal of medical information from this article. The editor who opposes an appropriate summary of this material has challenged the inclusion again and has recently replied on the talk page. Will any of you who participated in the discussion last time participate in the discussion this time, and/or will any of you who didn't participate in the discussion last time participate in the discussion this time?  (talk) 21:20, 12 November 2012 (UTC)

The dispute seems to have been going on for at least three years.  The persistent editor wants to remove this material:
&quot;Such poisoning is difficult to identify without specialized testing, as it often mimics other illnesses, and various symptoms can result from such poisoning, including severe diarrhea and vomiting. In the human body, it forms crystals of oxalic acid which can cause illness and death, while leaving characteristic physical evidence of poisoning.&quot;

to leave the Antifreeze#Ethylene glycol#Poisoning section at only three sentences (one of which constitutes practical advice).  WhatamIdoing (talk) 22:12, 12 November 2012 (UTC)
Yep. The wording has changed somewhat since the wording you cited, as acknowledged on the article's talk page, but it's still the same material (just with minor changes) that he's been objecting to including. That, and any mention of calcium oxalate crystals. He's yet to offer any good reasoning for this objection.  (talk) 23:10, 12 November 2012 (UTC)
Ozone therapy - attention needed

A [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Bi%C3%B3logo_conservacionista new editor] is promoting Ozone therapy as if it was an accepted mainstream medical specialty. TTBOMK it's only a fringe alternative medical practice without any scientific support and with some dangers. They are editing and creating articles and also adding categories, all in an attempt to make this seem like an accepted practice. It seems like they are using Wikipedia to create an alternate reality and notability for the practice. Their edits need to be checked for NPOV and for adherence to MEDRS.

New article: Dutch hypothesis

Hi folks, I'd appreciate some eyes at the Dutch hypothesis article that has been created recently. I'm clueless about medicine but, aside from the obvious grammatical and structural issues, I am concerned that if it is indeed a hypothesis (and, yes, I've read The_Structure of Scientific Revolutions and a bundle of other such books over the years) then perhaps the current depiction might possibly be one-sided. I know, in a vague sort of way, that the MED standards are necessarily quite high but the area that this project covers is really not one in which I have any expertise.A disclaimer is in order: the creator and I do have a bit of history on articles far, far removed from medicine. If the article is ok then that is just fine by me.- Sitush (talk) 02:26, 17 November 2012 (UTC)
The topic itself is clearly notable: see [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=%22Pulmonary%20Disease%2C%20Chronic%20Obstructive%22%5BMesh%5D%20AND%20dutch%20hypothesis%5Btiab%5D%20AND%20Review%5Bptyp%5D http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=%22Pulmonary%20Disease%2C%20Chronic%20Obstructive%22[Mesh]%20AND%20dutch%20hypothesis[tiab]%20AND%20Review[ptyp]]. —MistyMorn (talk) 23:33, 17 November 2012 (UTC)

Oh, yes. I was not concerned about notability. It is just that I've glimpsed some controversy concerning the validity of it as a hypothesis but I'm out of my comfort zone and also do not particularly want to antagonise the article creator. - Sitush (talk) 19:57, 18 November 2012 (UTC)

Until a scientific hypothesis is disproven it remains, well, just that... a hypothesis. In the present case, the Dutch hypothesis still appears to be a plausible candidate [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22793938]. —MistyMorn (talk) 20:44, 18 November 2012 (UTC)

I've tried to clean up and expand the stub a little, but unfortunately our edits overlapped. I've tried to integrate the changes you made, but I may well have missed/bungled something. Yes, I do agree that the content really would be better placed/merged in COPD or, ideally perhaps, in a subarticle dedicated to research into its etiology and pathogenesis. In the meantime, I feel there's nothing seriously amiss here, at least as far as the core information regarding this particular hypothesis is concerned, although the wider picture obviously needs to be filled in. —MistyMorn (talk) 22:47, 18 November 2012 (UTC)

Yes, and serious is only what MistyMorn produces. Others haven't a clue about the subject, sure! I'm still supprised about MistyMorns proposal, only to use &quot;core journals&quot; for the question of (clinical) effectiveness (whatever clinical means, in this case). He gave a list of journals where only three journals about psychiatry are mentioned. I wonder how to wirte about effecitvness when the most RCTs and meta analyses are beeing excluded, because published in non-core journals? Sorry, this is a simple trick to exclude findings MistyMorn don't like. Nothing else. Now he's wondering why his argumentation is being attacked and called up WP:CIVIL. I tell you what: Calm down and accept that your argumentation fails. Not least because the argumentation is nonsense but also because you try to exclude relevant sources in a special case.

Oh great. Wikipedia now says cerebral malaria is caused by a virus, that the lack of vaccine (to &quot;cure&quot; it) is due to an uncaring unaffected West. This is yet another example of a student picking a subject they know nothing about and expanding it beyond what a hyperlinked enyclopaedia should properly hold in one article, so it repeats (and wildly contradicts) related (parent/child) articles. The folk at WMF think there's no difference between the average newbie and a student. Show me a newbie, who doesn't even know the difference between a protozoan parasite and a virus, with the over-confidence to attempt write a 2000-word article on an advanced topic on the world most popular encyclopaedia. I think it would be best if the article was shrunk considerably to contain essentially the aspects of cerebral malaria that are distinctive. Colin°Talk 09:04, 20 November 2012 (UTC)

I agree with culling with most of what's there; if the article doesn't improve much by the time the class is over, I'll replace the current contents with a shortened version that meets MEDMOS/MEDRS standards (luckily, I'm familiar with the sources, so it shouldn't be too strenuous). Sasata (talk) 22:04, 20 November 2012 (UTC)
What also worries me is that if Biosthmors hadn't published this list, would anyone have spotted it? This article was expanded from a redirect. How many folk watchlist a redirect apart from the one editor who created it and probably left the project years ago. Same goes for the stub-&gt;GA stuff that students are asked to do. There is sometimes a reason why these subjects are stubs. Colin°Talk 16:05, 21 November 2012 (UTC)

Nutrition transition

Hello. My name is Nehemiah Ankoor. I am a doing a project for my poverty, justice, and human capabilities class at Rice University regarding the global nutrition transition. As of now the page is seriously lacking organization and readability. It has been flagged for clean up since 2008 and I plan to do just that in addition to integrating new content. The page currently has a decent amount of information but it does not flow from each section to the next fluidly and there are many issues regarding the subject that are missing. In order to reorganize it, I plan to change the main sections to a brief overview, causes related to globalization, case studies, health outcomes, policy implications, references, and external links. Each main section will consist of several subsections that further break down the information. For example, under causes related to globalization I will list media and food promotion as a subsection. For the case studies section, I will not provide much information, but I hope that other authors will choose to expand upon it in the future considering the tremendous amount of research conducted concerning specific countries and the nutrition transition. Most of my information will come from Barry M. Popkin and Benjamin Cabellero, the most prominent authors/researchers in regards to nutrition transition, but I do have plenty of additional sources to help balance their comprehensive research and findings. I would greatly appreciate any and all suggestions you can provide to help improve my project. Thank you. NehemiahAnkoor (talk) 09:49, 20 November 2012 (UTC)

 What is the relevance of quoting the frequency of pageviews?
 &quot;Nutrition transition&quot; contains a lot of text, but it desperately needs clean-up. Before a merge could be performed, first an editor would need to sift through the existing text to find the salvageable material.
 &quot;Human nutrition&quot; is already quite a large article, and a major expansion of its &quot;History&quot; section is likely to place undue weight on this, as well as bloat the article—at which point a spinout article would be better.

 Whether it is a suitable topic for students is perhaps best decided by educationalists. (I accept that Bluerasberry and Biosthmors may be educationalists.)

 Thank you for all the feedback everyone. Biosthmors did bring up some excellent points and I was not at all offended by them even though I do believe the page should stand on its own.

There is loads of images out there in open access journals that we can use. The Journal of Brachial Plexus and Peripheral Nerve Injury actually has , just like  other BioMed Central journals and many other journals. 
There are several ways to find your way to these materials on Commons - one is [http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Categories&amp;offset=Media_from&amp;limit=250 simply by journal] or  categories on Commons, which are used for indexing. The other is by way of topic categories there, e.g. . These latter ones are currently being reworked (mainly split into more specialized subcategories - e.g.  and subcategories thereof) in order to accommodate the multimedia files (9k so far) brought in by the . Help with that would be much appreciated - for instance, most of the imported files (and some of the categories created along the way) still , and interwiki links to and from Commons are often still missing. Of course, if an article contains multimedia files relevant for us, it is likely to have a few useful images, text bits or references too.

Medical student elective for 3/4th years at UCSF

There is ongoing discussion of setting up an elective for 3/4th year medical students at UCSF here [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Medicine/UCSF]. The hope is to launch this initiative in Jan 2013. I have agreed to spend a week in San Franscico in early Jan to give some talks and hands on editing sessions. We still do not know the number of people who will be interested. More details will occur on this page as time goes on. If people are in the area and wish to become involved would love to have you join. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 16:50, 22 November 2012 (UTC)
I won't be in the area but it would be wonderful to be involved somehow. This also dovetails with the timeline for a project at my own school for first years, which we expect to properly announce soon. -- UseTheCommandLine (talk) 06:13, 23 November 2012 (UTC)

Community pharmacy

I'd like to &quot;nominate&quot; the Community pharmacy for attention. I don't think I can do a very good job with the topic but the article is such terrible quality that I'm tempted to nominate for deletion or stub it.

Well, it needs a lot of work, but I don't think that stubbing it will necessarily be the best choice, because there is a lot of good information and concepts there.

Need input to help build journal evaluation tool

Hello  members, I'd like your input on a project.  I'm considering building a journal evaluation tool.  The idea would be that you'd give it a PMID or a DOI or a name of a journal, and it would give you some basic information to help you evaluate where the journal or journal article would rank on the  scale.  Some of the outputs would be:  Is the journal MEDLINE indexed?  What is the journal's impact factor?  Is the journal associated with a major medical organization?  How much other publishing have the authors of an article done?  The idea is to improve our articles by helping editors evaluate sources, and to help resolve &quot;my journal article which says X is better than your journal article which says Y&quot; disputes.  The end product could be added to  and could live on the Toolserver alongside things like [http://toolserver.org/~verisimilus/Scholar/Cite.php this].  Any interest in providing this sort of input?  Thanks... Zad68 13:23, 1 November 2012 (UTC)

That's a neat idea, but I have mixed feelings.  On the one hand, having a tool that did some of the basic spadework when checking up on a new source could be handy.  On the other hand, I fear that such a tools' output (depending somewhat on how it was presented) might also be susceptible to abuse—article X got all the green checkmarks in the assessment tool, so we have to use it-type problems.  In other words, there may be a temptation to substitute the tool's numbers for an actual understanding of the scientific literature and the place of a given work within it; feel free to read that as me being an elitist snob.
I guess the other question is, do we actually have much trouble evaluating a journal's overall quality or identifying whether or not a paper's authors have a significant research history?  In my experience – others may differ, please comment! – our experienced editors generally have no difficulty quickly determining when a paper is an uncited, decade-old, primary study, in a crappy journal by authors who only publish fringe nonsense about how magic crystals cure cancer.  From my experience, we tend to have longer, more active (and sometimes more acrimonious) discussions when a source does meet some (or many, or even all) of the MEDRS checkboxes.  Sometimes a journal publishes something outside their usual experience or expertise.  Sometimes a generally-competent and oft-published scientist starts pontificating on stuff they don't really understand (perhaps from within the warm and fuzzy cocoon of tenure) and it gets tagged in PubMed as a review article and pushes our 'ooh shiny secondary source' buttons.  Sometimes the article was written by an editorial board member and the peer review was kind of squishy.  Sometimes there's just a bad paper published in a good journal, for whatever reason.  On the flip side, sometimes there are good papers in low-impact journals: young scientists, yeoman work on confirmation, etc.  I'm wary that a journal/article evaluation tool might inadvertently frame or distort our current organic approach to evaluating sources.

I actually think something like this would be helpful; while most of us regulars know how to do this, having this option available to the wider audience may make it easier to recruit people to help us out.  I agree with TenOfAllTrades that this could be misused, but as long as the documentation clearly states that this is just a tool, and not a substitute for critical evaluation, I see more upside than downside.

In addition to sorting the work I would also like to increase this project's ability to help individuals collaborate with each other, and I was thinking that some of the structure used for meetup or chapter organization could help with this. There are some resources for this which we could consider.
*The  is in the middle of a major reform. The idea is to encourage every university to have a &quot;Wikipedia club&quot; to encourage classes to participate in Wikipedia editing. This is relevant because every club will need a Wikipedia project page to host and coordinate volunteers. A template to create project pages will need to be developed, and the style of those project pages will likely be based on a review of many project pages. Some useful insight should come of this and we could probably collaborate to our mutual goals.
*There are problems in organizing collaboration pages in general.  and  are not so organized, and WikiProject Medicine will soon face the issue of being complimented somehow by . [http://uk.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page Wikimedia UK] is a brilliant presentation. I would like for WikiProject Medicine to be able to efficiently sort and support anyone who wants to contribute.

The general questions brought here are 
*1. - Whether the deletion of all medical claim not supported by a source is WP:TEND and WP:POV, or whether it is something that is required per WP:MEDRS. 
*2. - Whether &quot;minority&quot; can be asserted re a position regarding a medical practice, without sourcing the assertion.
*3. - Whether being a (supposedly) &quot;minority&quot; view on a medical practice implies that WP:UNDUE trumps WP:MOS (lede) - &quot;include significant controversies&quot;. 
*4. - Whether publication of a controversy in multiple major mainstream peer reviwed medical journals, specifically on topic to the article topic, establishes MOS (lede) &quot;significance&quot;, no matter whether it is a minority view or not. ParkSehJik (talk) 20:48, 27 November 2012 (UTC)

*1.

*2. The second lede paragraph of the DSM article at WP states &quot;It has also attracted controversy and criticism. Some critics argue that the DSM represents an unscientific system…”. 
*3. There is corresponding controversy specific to article topics psychiatry, forensic psychiatry, and bipolar disorder. 
*4. Per MOS (lede) - &quot;summarize the most important points — including any prominent controversies&quot;. I applied MOS (lede) with solid MEDRS and RS sources, International Journal of Risk and Safety in Medicine Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law, and New York Law School.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_psychiatry#cite_note-IMN-1]

Better; thank you for adjusting so quickly.  Regarding your points 3 and 5, see  and .  There was notable criticism of DSM-3, we don't require Criticism sections in articles, and also see  as it explains how we would determine what controversy should be added to aricles.

SandyGeorgia (Talk) 20:19, 27 November 2012 (UTC)
I posted at Talk before editing. I got no response. I asked for sources for the edit summary claims of &quot;minority&quot;, and of UNDUE since minority. I got no response. There is certainly significant controversy, as the sources I provided are peer reviewed then edited mainstream sources, different from those cited in DSM, critical specifically of the article topics I was editing at, but related to the DSM controversy. I put up citation needed tags on unsourced medical claims. Looie496 took them off as &quot;pointy&quot;. I then deleted the unsourced material entirely, and it was immediately put back in withuot sources, violating MEDRS. . There was not RS cited to support WP:UNDUE trumping MOS (lede) &quot;significant controversies&quot;. I put up construction tags to hold the edits while I tried to improve the articles and the construction tags were removed within hours. 

The general question brought here seems to be whether it is POV to apply MEDRS to delete all med claims without sources, and whether being a (supposedly) &quot;minority&quot; view on a medical topic makes WP:MOS (lede) - &quot;include significant controversies&quot; trumped by WP:UNDUE.

 What is your source for saying that putting dubious tags on psychiatry as &quot;medicine&quot; is pointy. That is the very essence of what is argued in the deleted sources. Part of psychatry is medicine. Psychiatry is not all medicine, according to the WP definition of medicine as being all suported by scientific method, according to my deleted mainstream MEDRS sources, and per recent discussion at Alternative medicine re the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences Flight from Science and Reason conference. There is a significant question as to whether certain psychiatric catgories describe are correlated with &quot;disease&quot; at all, or worse, are entirely imaginary, like demonic possession. For example, &quot;penis envy&quot; was used in 20th Century forensic psychiatry to involuntarily inter people and sieze their assets , and what is practiced at Guantanamo does not &quot;heal&quot;. That is the significant controversy cited by the sources I added. If someone has a source calling ALL psychiatry medicine, then put it in the article. If someone has a source challenging certain practices in psychiatry as not being related to &quot;disease&quot;, or not being science based, i.e., not medicine, then this is not being pointy. What is your source? ParkSehJik (talk) 21:22, 27 November 2012 (UTC)
what the hell are you talking about may I ask? lesion (talk) 22:05, 27 November 2012 (UTC)
ParkSheJik, psychiatry is a combination of medicine and psychology from a medical perspective. Diagnosing and treating mental illness, requires a lot of skill as much as psychiatric scientific knowledge. I don't think there is any debate that psychiatry is a mixture of science and skill, such as the skill of psychoanalysis and the ability to consider differential diagnoses etc. Even medical doctors don't practice pure medicine and a lot of their work will require aspects of psychoanalysis, gut instinct etc when assessing and diagnosing patients. I don't really see what your position is or where you are coming from clearly? Are you coming from the anti-psychiatry angle that because psychiatry is not a pure science that psychiatry is not legitimate?--MrADHD | T@1k? 22:13, 27 November 2012 (UTC)
I think the motivations of an editor are less important than how they edit.  I suggest that we focus on the latter.  I have urged ParkSehJik to  and listen to advice from experienced editors.  A lot of WPMED content (particularly Psychiatry content) is poorly sourced, but in many cases excellent sources exist and simply need to be cited (&quot;excellent&quot; being defined as clearly representing consensus - scientific or otherwise).  -- Scray (talk) 22:35, 27 November 2012 (UTC)

There is controversy regarding the motives and scientific validity of forensic psychiatry findings of mental disorders. Forensic psychiatrists are frequently called “whores”. In psychiatry, “politics and economics has replaced quality science”.

Thanks for the supportive AGF. I expect editors new to reading RS on the topic will gradually come around per the RS and MEDRS. 

* 10% of legal opinions (re forensic psychiatry) termed or compared expert witnesses to “hired guns”, “whores”, or “prostitutes”. (source - Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law, 27:414 –25, 1999 – 2). Prosecutors made the plurality of the comments. This is not just a review of usage on the street, this is a review of legal opinions. 10% of legal opinions, the majority of which are by prosecutors, is significant per MOS (lede), and is in no way UNDUE. And that is just a citation of what is in the legal record, so it the very most conservative number on prevalence of opinion in the legal profession. 

* There is also RS that such usage has a rational basis in the way the profession is currently practiced, of which I am compiling. Here are four of many RS on the topic - (1. “Hired guns,” “whores,” and “prostitutes”: case law references to clinicians of ill repute, D. Mossman, Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law, 27:414 –25, 1999 – 2. Whores of the Court: The Fraud of Psychiatric Testimony and the Rape of American Justice, Hagen MA, New York: HarperCollins, 1997 – 3. Reel Forensic Experts: Forensic Psychiatrists as Portrayed on Screen, Susan Hatters Friedman, MD, Cathleen A. Cerny, MD, Sherif Soliman, MD, and Sara G. West, MD, J Am Acad Psychiatry Law 39:412–17, 2011. 

* Hagan criticized the methods of clinical assessment and psychological testing (in an evidence based and very reasoned and manner) and argued that mental health testimony is business rather than science, which is only a small part of the many bases of my placement of the Dubious tag on “medicine” re forensic psychiatry, and thereby on &quot;all of psychiatry&quot; being medicine. I was ridiculed as not being worthy of responding to re my arguments to keep the content I put in with MEDRS, with no sourcing for the ridicule, and simply because I put a dubious tag per the MEDRS and RS. This is not a good way to treat editors, nor is it a good basis for editing andarguing on talk, citing &quot;common knowledge&quot; to trump MEDRS sourced info. 

* Samuel Gross (a Michigan Law School prof)  writes “The contempt of lawyers and judges for experts is famous. They regularly describe expert witnesses as prostitutes.” This is RS for the use of “famous”, in addition to the source I provided describing “frequent” use of the expression. No wiki editor critical of my edits is citing any sources to base their opinions. The New York Times published similar remarks re being partisans rather than science based medical practitioners (In U.S., expert witnesses are partisan, Liptak A, New York Times. August 12, 2008, p A1). 

* This is not just a “minority” “opinion”, and my recitation of what is in highly MEDRS and RS sources is not POV. It is citing sources. Deletions based on editors (likely as yet uninformed) opinions are not justified. I expect that in the end, these editors, likely deleting in good faith, will read the RS and MEDRS literature, and the material will gradually go into the article. In the meantime, editors should stop attacking me because they are uninformed as to what is in the MEDRS and RS sources, and is a prevalent, if not dominant, view in the legal, medical, and scientific community. 

This discussion belongs here, as well as in the three articles whose content and POV is in dispute, because of the general points I raised at the top of this section. Please read the sources, or refrain from comenting, and in any case, as I requested at the outset of this section, please comment on the sources, not on me. I am simply regurgitating what is all over in the RS and MEDRS, all evidence based, like it or not. ParkSehJik (talk) 18:52, 28 November 2012 (UTC)

All I see here is a lot of attention seeking. If this topic is notable as is suggested, it may be put in its own article (where the user can rant on that talk page)?

Am I correct in thinking that the Samuel Gross comment refers to expert witnesses in general or is it specific to psychiatrists? If the former, are the views of prosecutors of psychiatric expert witnesses different to their views of other expert witnesses? FiachraByrne (talk) 21:45, 29 November 2012 (UTC)
I don't know. It appears in isolation to be to general experts, but I was working from hard copy source which quoted Gross, which was about forensic psychiatry experts. I believe the quote first appeared in Wisconsin Law Review (although he is at Michigan Law). I will do more research. Per these sources however, WP:SPADE seems to be more appropriate re the &quot;people who will do anything for money&quot; phenomena in court, including locking people up for life or putting them in assisted living, and seizing all of their assets to sell off to pay themselves and for the involutary internment, all done based on highly dubious claims of a basis in &quot;science&quot;, rather citing POV and BATTLE just for stating what is in multiple RS. ParkSehJik (talk) 22:14, 29 November 2012 (UTC)
I have no doubt that there are notable controversies regarding forensic psychiatrists and their opinions in court, which deserve some form of mention on wikipedia.

Pending changes goes live in two hours

Just a reminder that, after an exhausting round of RFCs,  goes live in a little less than two hours.  The policy is in the usual place, at .  Requests should be handled like any regular request, i.e., at .  

Requests for  permission can be made at the usual place ().  Admins automatically have the permission.  If you have the permission, you can review changes and will see notes about any articles needing review on your watchlist.  Please do your best to review changes quickly, and squawk here, at , or on my user talk page if you need help.

People who are just thrilled about it are reminded that it's for real problems on lower-traffic pages, not for universal deployment, and sincerely, strongly begged not to drown RFPP in requests during these early days.  Also, please keep in mind that it's rumored to have some performance issues, so it's not good for very large or very busy pages.  It might be perfect for a short, obscure vandal magnet, though.

For those who don't know what I'm talking about, pending changes is a special kind of page protection that allows unregistered users and newbies to edit the page, but doesn't display their changes to the readers until someone else &quot;approves&quot; the change.  This lets us move pages out of  and into a semi-sorta-protection mode, because these people can edit directly, but if the change is vandalism or libel or other serious garbage, we can reject the change and no reader will have ever seen it.  It makes more work for the rest of us, but it should reduce problems that the readers see.  If you're interested in helping review changes, you can request the permission/userright.

Asperger syndrome and DSM-V

Asperger syndrome will be dropped from the DSM-5 in May 2013.  It is a featured article.  I believe that if it is rewritten carefully, it should be able to retain its featured status.

In order to retain , working carefully and collaboratively in sandbox might be a good approach.  Is anyone willing to help?  The holidays make it hard for me to take the lead in this effort, but if the med editors don't do the work, IPs and random editors may cause the article to deteriorate to the point of losing its featured status.

It gets [http://stats.grok.se/en/latest/Germ_theory_of_disease 22k views a month], and I think of articles over 20k as being of average importance. I have actually looked for sources into this about contemporary notions of germ theory, because in the developing world one of the major external health recommendations is to provide access to clean water but many local people do not see this as a priority. It upsets international health workers when they go to places which do not respect external attempts to provide clean water. About a year ago I looked for sources describing contemporary disregard for germ theory as it relates to water and sewage infrastructure in the developing world but was unable to find anything. If anyone can find sources about educational outreach for boiling water, building toilets, or teaching handwashing which ties those actions to germ theory then I would help integrate the content into this article. In the field, germ theory education is a hot topic. I just have not found literature on it.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 14:40, 4 December 2012 (UTC)
Interesting, thanks for mentioning this. Biosthmors (talk) 23:33, 4 December 2012 (UTC)
Since the article is partly a summary of work in the 19th century, it lends itself well to re-using sections from other pages, and then editing them together. This is what I've done so far.

Merging the articles Applied behavior analysis and Behavior modification

Hi,
I wanted input back on merging the articles ABA and Behavior mod., as the former is a new term for the latter.
See here: .
Thanks!
ATC . Talk 04:37, 30 November 2012 (UTC)
 Oops, ATC, sorry-- you asked me long ago and I never got back to you.  But Cas asked the same I would ask ... are you sure the two are the same?  I'm not.  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 22:15, 30 November 2012 (UTC)
 Some sources say it's a &quot;former expression&quot; for it and others do not. Also, if you are just reinforcing behavior it's now called Positive behavior support (PBS, a form of ABA). A clinical psychologist who studied, work for, and was personal friends with Lovaas prior to opening up her own clinic said &quot;Behavior modification is what we used to called it in the old days.&quot; How are they different? If Cognitive-Behavior Therapy (CBT) used to be called Cognitive-Behavior Modification, I don't fully understand. And people still refer to behavior modification when I think they are referring to Behavior therapy which includes Applied Behavior Analysis (a form of behavior analysis) and psychotherapies such as CBT. Under the umbrella of ABA is the Lovaas/UCLA model for autism (or Early intensive behavior intervention (EIBI) for young children) and Positive behavior support; the latter of which is used for various things to reinforce behavior NOT just autism. ATC . Talk 21:01, 4 December 2012 (UTC)
 I found a journal explaining the controversy over the terms. See here: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2223172/. It states as follows: &quot;A New Science? [section] Perhaps there is a tendency to draw pejorative contrasts between PBS and ABA in order to bolster claims about the status of PBS as a new and distinct science or discipline (e.g., Bambara et al., 1994; E. Carr, 1997; E. Carr et al., 2002; Knoster et al., 2003; Sisson, 1992). There may be disagreement among PBS leaders on this point. On the one hand, for example, Horner (2000) stated that 'Positive behavior support is not a new approach. … [It is] the application of behavior analysis to the social problems created by such behaviors as self-injury' (p. 97). He further stated, 'There is no difference in theory or science between positive behavior support and behavior modification. These are the same approach with different names. If any difference exists, it is in the acceptance [by PBS] of much larger outcomes and the need to deliver the global technology that will deliver these outcomes' (p. 99). Other writers have referred to PBS as an 'extension' of applied behavior analysis (e.g., Turnbull et al., 2002, p. 377). ATC . Talk 21:54, 7 December 2012 (UTC)

Request For Comment on Koro (Penis Panic) regarding 1 sentence inclusion of Peyronie's Disease explanation


rfcquote|text=
Re: Adding / Removing a sentence on Peyronie's Disease in the introduction of this article.

I added a clarification to the top of this page that Koro (a psychological condition) should not be confused with the biological condition with the same symptoms (early stage Peyronie’s Disease).  I cited 2 sources, The Journal of Urology (peer reviewed) and the National Kidney and Urologic Diseases Information Clearinghouse (NKUDIC).  Then, “OhNoItsJamie” (an admin whose reputation for speedy &amp; unhelpful deletions has driven people off wikipedia - just google his screen name) immediately deleted this change and cited WP:SYNTH.  He did not post on the talk page or clarify this any further.  Deleting my sentence due to WP:SYNTH was not an accurate application of that guideline.  So, I sent him a detailed explanation of why I made the change &amp; why WP:SYNTH did not apply.  He simply replied in 1 sentence that all information has to be sourced &amp; reliable (apparently ignoring the fact I cited the leading journal in the field of urology the first time)... I suppose he saw me state that I have a MA and PhD and immediately assumed I was injecting my own personal experience.  The reality is I AM using my perspective &amp; knowledge of these topics to draw the information from the sources (peer reviewed journals) - and that is the point of wikipedia (multiple people coming together with different sets of knowledge).  Some people are going to know more about topics than others, and having rules applied by people who are ignorant of the topics just makes the articles worse.  

Therefore, I would like to keep my statement as it appears in the edit, which simply stated “This psychological condition should not be confused with Peyronie's Disease which is a urological condition in which the penis shrinks in size due to scar tissue.”  I also added &quot;Peyronie’s disease&quot; to the “see also” section (which OhNoItsJamie also deleted for unknown reasons).  So, I want to add that back as well.  His complaint that I am not citing sources makes no sense, given that I cited 2 prominent sources.  As far as talking about 1 disease in an article where another disease is mentioned goes (the WP:Synth complaint), that is not a violation of WP:SYNTH.  Every disease that is related to another disease gets discussed on Wikipedia articles.  And, I am only asking to add 1 very short (but important) sentence - not an entire section on Peyronie's disease.  Additional information is on the Koro talk page.  I would really appreciate people from this project to please help on this issue.  thank you. Angelatomato (talk) 02:04, 7 December 2012 (UTC)
 Neither of the articles you cited connect Koro with Peyronie's; you making the connection is plainly /.  Please take the time to read those policies. OhNoitsJamie Talk 05:27, 7 December 2012 (UTC)

Here's a DIRECT source that connects the two which is not &quot;original research&quot; or &quot;synth&quot; as you (OhNoItsJamie)want to insist: http://connection.ebscohost.com/[scratch that - it appears I copied the wrong link...hence the argument below...sorry]. If you cannot access empirical journals (usually only through universities or libraries) to see this, google google &quot;koro and peyronies disease&quot; so you can see previews where they are mentioned without having access. This is a RARE condition so you will not see 1000s of sources, but here's one.  Since the symptoms of the two are identical in the early phase, it was just an obvious statement not requiring a reference - but here you go anyway.

OhNoItsJamie - Please just accept that I am trying to improve the article and move on.  Your application of wikipedia guidelines is incorrect (wp:synth is not violated and it is a flexible policy - go read it again yourself).  I am asking for other opinions from people with actual science / medicine backgrounds since you have you missed the point of what I wrote &amp; of the citations entirely.  You are making irresponsible edits that harm the quality of the content and other users for some reason that I cannot fathom.  I have a PhD in psychology &amp; your issues are obvious, but I won't even go there...I've read complaints about you all over the web.  People have stopped using wikipedia because of you. Google your screen name &amp; count the number of people you've driven off this site with your bizarre power trip behavior.  I've published in peer reviewed journals &amp; responded to 30 pages of criticism which have been easier to deal with than your behavior...I'm leaving it up to others to add their opinions.

Uh...I have a PhD, and you don't think I can tell an article from a keyword? I was trying to make it easier for people who are not at a university (or other library) to read articles because they won't have access to medical journals.  Sorry for that.  If two (both extremely rare) disorders have identical symptoms, it is virtually impossible to find an empirical article about them at all - let alone connecting them.  That's just how it is.  Nobody is going to publish it and no journal editor will let it in.  If you do not have experience publishing in empirical journals, you won't understand &amp; I do not expect you to.  Just use your common sense.  If I want to say that the early stages of a heart attack should not be mistaken for a panic attack (supposing they had the same symptoms) - it would not require a citation to say they are frequently confused with each other.  Rather, common sense would allow someone to say &quot;here are the sympoms of a heart attack&quot; and &quot;here are the symptoms for a panic attack&quot; and &quot;there may be confusion between the two&quot;.  — Preceding  comment added by Angelatomato (talk • ) 15:17, 7 December 2012 (UTC)

This is not &quot;original thought&quot; - the lists of the symptoms for both are the same - and those are published (and what I cited).

 The burden of proof is on you to prove that there is a published connection.  None of the abstracts I saw mentioned them.  Googling both terms pulls up articles related to one or the other, but not both. If you fail to understand Wikipedia policies, you should move on to another encyclopedia.

 You said &quot; I'm done discussing the matter with you (i.e., any further posts on my talk page by you will be removed). Feel free to continue your crusade on other venues&quot;... So why are you back?  Anyway, yes I do understand wikipedia policies &amp; am acting within them.  You are not - and that is why I have opened this up for other opinions under wikipedia guidelines that allow me to ask editors for other perspectives.  Nothing is &quot;done&quot; - I just opened the rfc last night.  And, that was a published source...my point (above) was that if you are not in a library (or have online access), it probably will not open (without permissions - empirical journals just show abstracts).  So, I gave people keywords (who did not have library access) - and then I was told that I didn't know the difference between keywords and articles.  Joy. And all this over 1 sentence...amazing.

I did not do a thorough literature search through every psych and urology journal - so there may be something - and we'll see what happens.  Regardless, that one tiny little sentence still does not violate any of those policies (as if every sentence on wikipedia is cited? Not to mention, nobody - in any discipline - cites the obvious).  Because you disagree, I have asked for other opinions and we will see what they say.  You are interpreting the guidelines incorrectly, and therefore the guidelines suggest I put out a request for comment, which I did. If every rule on earth was so back and white, we wouldn't have millions of lawyers and judges, would we? Sorry we are seeing this completely differently, but I doubt this is the first time it happened on here. Look at your talk page - first I asked you to work with me to come up with a sentence that satisfied your interpretation of the guidelines &amp; the information that is published...but you decided against it...so I posted the RFC &amp; per the RFC &quot;promotion&quot; guidelines, I put it in the medicine section, which you then called a &quot;crusade&quot;...it appears you are only interested in deleting the sentence and being right - and not improving the content at all.

Asperger's Syndrome: re-evaluation by APA

Paedophilia epidemiology

There are major issues on the paedophilia article regarding its prevalance. I am wondering if anyone here is interested or knows how to resolve this problem? The problem is as follows. According to wikipedia 1 in 10 men approximately are fixated on prepubescent kids. To me this is obvious nonsense. I suspect that either sources have been misinterpreted, such as prevalance rates in prison samples have been extrapolated across into the general population or else adolescentophilia, particularly hebephilia has been included in these statistics without informing the reader. The big problem is that for obvious reasons there are no solid estimates as to the prevalence rate of DSM IV-tr paedophilia in the general population but I just know it is not 1 in 10 men! People with access to full text medical articles are particularly needed. The discussion is here for all who are interested, .--MrADHD | T@1k? 20:13, 7 December 2012 (UTC)

I don't see a claim in the article that 10% of men are pedophiles.  Can you tell us exactly which sentence concerns you?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 22:37, 7 December 2012 (UTC)
The prevalence section says estimates range from 3-9 percent of people have paedophilia with 5 percent suggested as an average. The 10 percent comes from two places. Half of the population is male, and almost all paedophiles are male, thus the 5 percent statistic needs to be doubled or almost doubled for men as the article does not state that it is talking about men only. Even 5 percent of men seems way way off to me. The other thing is the estimate ranges up to almost 9 percent, which if you double that up you could argue our wikipedia article is saying up to almost 18 percent of males are paedophiles as the article currently states from 3 percent and up to 9 percent of the population are paedophiles.--MrADHD | T@1k? 22:45, 7 December 2012 (UTC)
Unsurprisingly, the figures are being misused. The relevant passage from the first cited Seto article is: Some of this is closely paraphrased in the article, with some fairly important qualifiers having been removed. Delicious carbuncle (talk) 22:58, 7 December 2012 (UTC)
Okay, well probably what they are detecting with the wording of those questions is mostly non-paedophiles who at some point in time have on occasion allowed their mind to wander into perverse thoughts about prepubescent children, probably when they were highly 'sexed'/horny for want of a better expression. They probably could have detected similar rates of sexual thoughts involving the elderly, if they asked the same questions regarding the elderly but that doesn't mean 3-9 percent of men are gerontophiles. As the author states, only some of these people would have prepubescent fantasies recurring and dominating their sexual thoughts, so yes the source(s) have been grossly misquoted. Thanks for digging out the source content!--MrADHD | T@1k? 23:19, 7 December 2012 (UTC)
The article says that &quot;is estimated to be lower than 5% based on several smaller studies with prevalence rates between 3% and 9%&quot;, not that it is estimated to be 5%. I've clarified, and used the opportunity to remove a primary source while I was at it.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 23:05, 7 December 2012 (UTC)
Ah my bad memory, I didn't quote article text correctly. Thanks for helping with the article. :)--MrADHD | T@1k? 23:19, 7 December 2012 (UTC)
WhatamIdoing, did you mean to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pedophilia&amp;diff=526940895&amp;oldid=526919393 remove the SetoReview refname]? The 5% part looks unsourced without that beside it. And shouldn't we keep the fact the 5% is based on several small studies? As for the &quot;prevalence rates between 3% and 9%&quot; information, is removing it better than rewording it in some way? Flyer22 (talk) 23:22, 7 December 2012 (UTC)
Especially since the information has been somewhat misrepresented? Flyer22 (talk) 23:26, 7 December 2012 (UTC)
Yea, it is a review article; just needs to be better summarised so as to not misrepresent the source.--MrADHD | T@1k? 23:33, 7 December 2012 (UTC)

IMO SetoReview ought to appear only once in that sentence.  Where in the setence is not terribly important to me.
I do believe that it is appropriate to remove the 3–9% claim, since that detail is basically unimportant and tends to de-bunk the conclusion of the review, which is that the prevalence is less than 5%.  I can go either way about including &quot;based on several small studies&quot;, but I removed it because we don't normally want to call out the details of how a review article arrived at its conclusions per .  WhatamIdoing (talk) 23:37, 7 December 2012 (UTC)
In this case I feel that we need to convey to the reader the nature of the prevalence evidence. The review author states themselves that only some of the 3-9 percent of people reporting ever fantasising sexually about prepubescents would be actual paedophiles; that doesn't sound like this review author believes that anywhere near 5 percent of men are sexually fixated on prepubescents. I feel we either need to briefly explain the origin of the statistics and that the review author felt that only some of the sample would actually be paedophiles or else exclude the 3-9 percent and the below 5 percent of men statistics. Otherwise we are going to have lots of readers with a warped view of reality and a warped view of the review authors thoughts, regarding the incidence of paedophilia and male sexual thoughts.--MrADHD | T@1k? 00:05, 8 December 2012 (UTC)
Okay, as always, thanks for the reply WhatamIdoing. I'm aware of , but I've seen too many cases where, even when the reference is placed earlier on in the line, the rest of the line is thought to be unsourced because it doesn't have a reference at the end of it. But that way of thinking makes sense because there's no reason to place the reference near the beginning or middle instead of at the end of the line. Other instances, though, such as one reference supporting an entire paragraph at the end... It irks me when editors don't realize that the entire paragraph is supported by that one source, and then place a citation-needed tag somewhere in the paragraph. It's understandable when they don't have access to the source, especially since there are cases where a source at the end of the paragraph doesn't support all of the paragraph's text, but people should always check the source(s) before adding a citation-needed tag. I've even seen cases that are the reverse of the SetoReview example, where even with the reference at the end of the line, an editor will think that first part of the line is unsourced because the line is talking about two different matters. Anyway, end of rant. I've gone ahead and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pedophilia&amp;diff=526951263&amp;oldid=526940895 duplicated the SetoReview refname to the end of the line.] 

MrADHD, I definitely don't feel that the above statistics information should be excluded altogether. Flyer22 (talk) 00:31, 8 December 2012 (UTC)

(outdent) Suggested text: Anonymous surveys of adult males have found that 3-9 percent men admit to having ever as adults sexually fantasised about prepubescent children, however, it is likely that only some of these men would be paedophiles. Anonymous surveys of the general public asking questions regarding age related sexual preference or exclusive interest to obtain an accurate picture of the number of paedophiles in the general public has not yet been carried out. From what is known the incidence of paedophilia in men is believed to be below 5 percent.--MrADHD | T@1k? 00:41, 8 December 2012 (UTC)
You're probably aware of this but Seto has a 2012 article where he again reviews the evidence for prevalence rates - available [http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10508-011-9882-6?LI=true#page-1 here]. That source appears to be a little more detailed on this question and it's not cited in the article. Personally, I think it would be important to state that current estimates are based on non-representative samples. I'd also be inclined to follow Seto's wording that the 5 per cent figure is an upper limit. Also is James Cantor still active on Wikipedia? FiachraByrne (talk) 01:27, 8 December 2012 (UTC)

MrADHD, yes, that wording is fine. I feel that the initial wording of &quot;The prevalence of pedophilia in the general population is not known&quot; that is in the article should stay, though. Also, keep the spelling consistent with the article's spelling, per ; &quot;fantasised&quot; should be &quot;fantasized,&quot; &quot;paedophiles&quot; should be &quot;pedophiles&quot;...and &quot;paedophilia&quot; should be &quot;pedophilia.&quot; 

FiachraByrne, MrADHD is new to this topic area, as stated on the Pedophilia talk page (by MrADHD). So I'm sure that he didn't know about that 2012 article. Thank you for presenting it; we should definitely use it, especially since it's a fairly recent review of the same material. The thing about trying to follow 's recommendation of &quot;Look[ing] for reviews published in the last five years or so, preferably in the last two or three years.&quot; for the Pedophilia article is that recent material is not always coming out for every aspect of pedophilia; this is why WP:MEDRS also states that its instructions about up-to-date material &quot;may need to be relaxed in areas where little progress is being made or few reviews are being published.&quot; Some of the sources in the article, though old by WP:MEDRS's standards, are the most up-to-date for the information they are supporting. And, yes, James Cantor (James Cantor) is still active on Wikipedia. Flyer22 (talk) 17:01, 8 December 2012 (UTC)
I also still feel that it should be stated that the above statistics are based on only several small surveys. So I would prefer the above proposed text begin with &quot;Several small anonymous surveys.&quot; And &quot;would be pedophiles&quot; should be &quot;are pedophiles.&quot; And a comma should be placed after &quot;From what is known.&quot;  Flyer22 (talk) 17:18, 8 December 2012 (UTC)
Sounds good to me. I have no objections to the suggestions made. So, who is going to do the honours and update the article text? I could give it a try but I am not experienced in this topic area.--MrADHD | T@1k? 21:40, 11 December 2012 (UTC)

Does pseudoscience in Psychiatry merit an Alternative Medicine category and WP:SPADE info that it is integrative medicine?

Is Psychiatry integrative medicine? 
Related discussion of whether DSM is MEDRS is here[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Identifying_reliable_sources_(medicine)#Is_DSM_MEDRS.3F].


Discover Magazine just named this story as &quot;Top 100 Science Stories of 2012&quot; - [http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/80beats/2012/07/13/the-bible-of-psychiatry-faces-damning-criticism-from-the-inside/ The &quot;Bible of Psychiatry&quot; Faces Damning Criticism—From the Inside]
From that story - 
&quot;...the most recent attack comes from within the DSM-5’s ranks. Roel Verheul and John Livesley, a psychologist and psychiatrist who were members of the DSM-5 work group for for personality disorders, found that the group ignored their warnings about its methods and recommendations. In protest, they resigned, explaining why in an email to Psychology Today. Their disapproval stems from two primary problems with the proposed classification system: its confusing complexity, and its refusal to incorporate scientific evidence.
That is the very definition of pseudoscience in out article on the topic.
The resigning doctors are quoted as saying - 
&quot;The proposal displays a truly stunning disregard for evidence. Important aspects of the proposal lack any reasonable evidential support of reliability and validity. For example, there is little evidence to justify which disorders to retain and which to eliminate. Even more concerning is the fact that a major component of proposal is inconsistent with extensive evidence…This creates the untenable situation of the Work Group advancing a taxonomic model that it has acknowledged in a published article to be inconsistent with the evidence.&quot; 

Part of psychiatry is clearly evidence based and is science. But the field integrates this with pseudoscience and worse (forensic psychiatry and its associated fraud). Per the WP arricle, integrative medicine &quot;integrates&quot; evidence based medicine with the other stuff. Does  apply here, or must there be a secondary source calling the spade a spade? 


Does the clear pseudoscience in psychiatry merit an &quot;Alternative Medicine&quot; category in the article, and WP:SPADE info that it is thereby integrative medicine?

Yes it does meet MEDRS.

Comment: I agree with the AfD that the article should be deleted, and have said so there. But I am puzzled by the comments above. Do we have a policy or a general feeling here, to retain unacceptable or unencyclopedic articles temporarily as a favor to students doing assignments?

Then we, or any of the regular patrollers at AFC, could review them, and accept or reject them as normal.  Zad68 19:52, 5 December 2012 (UTC)
That would be better. It would also &quot;protect&quot; the essay as written - give the student  of their work, as is not the case on Wikipedia mainspace. What happens to their assignment if someone comes along and does a major edit or rewrite - which they have to accept as a possibility when they post here? --MelanieN (talk) 20:17, 5 December 2012 (UTC)

Whether or not someone wants to let empathy temporarily delay a deletion request is not expected (nor is it desired according to any Wikipedia guideline I'm aware of as it would be preferential treatment), but it is of course a personal one and I respect those who take either side of the issue.

And how do you deal with the student's  of their work if it is in mainspace? I would really urge you (and the professor) to have such articles posted to AfC in the future as suggested by Zad68.

Melanie, I don't think it really hurts us to have an article on a borderline-notable topic hang about for a few extra days.  Being a little less quick with the deletion button is one thing we can do to improve editor retention.

Leaving this case aside, I would like to see any policy anyone has ever written on uploading media content for pathological samples versus various levels of risk of that media file being linked to the identification of any particular person. So far as I know there is not one.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 20:30, 11 December 2012 (UTC)
This image is not of a &quot;person&quot; as anecephaly is never technically alive per the definition of brain death. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 20:32, 11 December 2012 (UTC)
Okay. Leaving this case aside, I am curious about any policy of sharing anyone's embarrassing broken bone x-ray or tumor. I would be in favor of getting access to hospital archives and sharing lots of media if possible. The variable of interest might be the extent to which the image identifies a particular person. A pathological sample, for example, may be unique enough for someone to recognize it as having come from a particular person who could be identified.   Blue Rasberry (talk) 20:53, 11 December 2012 (UTC)
As long as no person is identifiable from the image or caption than there is no concern. If the person is identifiable than signed consent is needed either from the person in question if they are competent or from their next of kin if they are not (as in a child). I have already been legally accosted by another Wikipedia on these matters and it went to a legal review. This was more of less the determination. This is also the conclusion of the medical literature.
I had someone ask my a while ago if this was their father [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Elevated_JVP.JPG]. It was not but I guess their necks look similar. One cannot identify someone from their x ray or a slice of their cancer (maybe the pathologist who originally saw them and took the picture could but then they know them anyone). If we want the academic community to join us we need to use image guidelines similar to the academic press.  Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 21:08, 11 December 2012 (UTC)
I like the idea of adopting the established policies of academic press.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 21:24, 11 December 2012 (UTC)
Great similar images to the one we are discussing here can be found in academic textbooks and journals. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 21:27, 11 December 2012 (UTC)
The argument seems to be that those with anecephaly are living humans and thus their consent must be obtained before their images are used. The majority of those with this condition however are stillbirths and the majority of the medical community would consider them to be brain dead and thus never alive. The image does not identify the parents and thus would be anonymous with respect to them. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 23:17, 11 December 2012 (UTC)

Please see [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Patient_images Commons:Patient images], which is an essay. Started by another Wikidoc, I expanded it with guidelines drawn from various sources. Medical journals take an &quot;if there is any chance at all that the patient might be identified&quot; stance. Many UK professional bodies, including the GMC, have dispensed with the notion of whether the patient can be identified or not: you need consent to take a picture of someone's left pinky. In addition, doctors can't just go around snapping photos of patients or their bits using their cameraphone. ([http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/insrv/graphicsandmedia/advice/clinicalphotography.html See the end of this page]).

As far as this picture goes, I think the &quot;never alive / not a person&quot; argument is a fairly clinically/legal-minded response that fails the duck test. Many people would regard this as someone's tragically dead baby and worthy of the same respect. I think the doctor behaved unethically in taking this picture, if he did not have the parent's consent, and believe he should have written formal consent before uploading it to WP. Without an assurance on this point, I think WP should delete it.  If the consent was achieved, then the image is acceptable. I'm no expert, though. I suspect if any UK doc had asked their professional body about whether they needed consent for this picture, they would be told yes, even if that yes was erring on the side of caution. So should we. -- Colin°Talk 19:39, 12 December 2012 (UTC)
Yes verbal consent is required from patients when you are taking pictures of them but not of pathological samples or histology slides. Many people want a whole bunch of images removed from Wikipedia including ones dealing with religion and sex. The physician who took this image would not need consent from the parents and there is no identifiable human being in the image. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 21:26, 12 December 2012 (UTC)
I do not think this discussion should continue without references. Academic journals, governments, and various organizations have published guidelines for this. The least surprising way to settle this issue is to follow guidelines which already exist. Discussions in medicine have the benefit of being able to be built from a large amount of published, citable, precedent. If anyone wants to give input in the appropriate forums then  and the  would be better places than here to centralize the permanent record of discussion.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 21:51, 12 December 2012 (UTC)
(ec)I don't think everyone will agree with you that &quot;there is no identifiable human being in the image&quot;. Describing this as a path sample is pretty heartless, sorry James. In the UK, we're rather sensitive about unauthorised use of human tissue, especially our dead babies and there are legal issues surrounding these, including display. Hence the The Royal College of Pathologists guidelines that consent is recommended. This Act came about from doctors just regarding this as so much random human tissue to do what they like with -- like taking photos with their mobile phones. And the change of attitude was intended &quot;to foster the underlying assumption ... that all human bodies, body parts and tissue ... be treated with appropriate respect and dignity&quot; ([http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4772739.stm source]). This absolutely isn't a NOTCENSORED issue. Nor is it about legal definitions of human life. It is just about respect and medical ethics. Perhaps the culture is different across the pond. -- Colin°Talk 22:05, 12 December 2012 (UTC)
Colin, I shared the links you gave on both the Commons page and the Wiki Med page. Thanks - these are important and relevant.
The following is not directed at any preceding commenter, but rather to anyone who joins this conversation: This is not the place for deciding which region's culture is best, but it is the place for providing links to explanations of what a particular culture's practices are. The laws, customs, and ethics of one place may be different from those elsewhere and that does not necessarily make them less valid or right.  when anyone shares a perspective here. Asking for references to descriptions of professional precedent whenever someone speaks on behalf of their culture is a productive way to manage conversation.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 14:23, 13 December 2012 (UTC)
I'm friends with James so I'm sure he's fine with my robust description of his POV :-). Some of this is documented, some of it isn't. For example, the GMC guidelines are relatively recently catching up with the Internet and previous guidelines on consent were written in an age when it was assumed that medical photographs only went in medical journals and textbooks and couldn't really be seen by joe-public. Wikipedia, Commons and Flickr take the public exposure of these images to a new level, well beyond the &quot;for educational use&quot; that patients or doctors may have considered the photographs to be consented for. We can make our own standards, or even lead the way.
I agree that different folk have different views on this and that no one view is more &quot;right&quot; but the most permissive view wrt hosting images isn't necessarily the one that should &quot;win&quot; by default. Whenever ethics comes up on WP or Commons, there's a tendencey to reduce the argument to what is legal (which is a low bar) and to be deliberately insensitive to any religious or emotional concerns.
Here's some duck tests:
#If this was a normal live baby born in the maternity ward and was taken away to be cleaned up, would it be acceptable for the doctor to take snaps with their mobile phone and upload to the net to share? If the baby had been born without any legs would that change the ethics? If the baby had been born without a kidney would that change the ethics. This baby was born without much of its brain. Does that change the ethics? The law may see a distinction, but would the parents?
#Would the doctor have done this in front of the mother? If they had, what might be the mother or father's reaction to having their stillborn baby photographed on some doctor's mobile phone?
Colin°Talk 15:32, 13 December 2012 (UTC)
Thanks Colin. I encourage other people to respond as they like. I am withdrawing from this conversation. I would be interested to talk with anyone by phone or Skype about these things but I feel that text in forums is not preferable to voice when having casual exchange on controversial issues.

During university we had access to human babies in jars with varying major genetic abnormalities. The University of Calgary also has many similar ones on displace at their medical museum.

There would be no parent with this case who can distinguish this case of anecephaly from any other. This IMO this image would be anonymous. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 16:44, 13 December 2012 (UTC)
I am happy to have these frank conversations. Colin and I do come at this from different perspectives and I respect his opinion. If a baby was born with no legs than yes I would feel taking pictures of their lower extremities (which are not identifiable) would be legally and ethically okay. I take pictures of identifiable people (see Cleft lip and palate) for example among others. I however get signed consent for release under an &quot;open license&quot; and onto Wikipedia when the infant is identifiable. Now would I take this picture in front of the mother? I have delivered similar cases and the mother realized that this was the case long before. This was before I got involved with Wikipedia but my bet is that she would have bee okay. My experience is that most are happy to provide consent for these sorts of images and the doctor in question may even have gotten such permission. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 16:53, 13 December 2012 (UTC)
Ah, I should have made clearer that the doctor would be doing these things without consent or even asking. Just doing it.  If the doctor asked in a tactful way, I'm sure the situation would often be different. But there's no indication on the photo page that the doctor asked for or got permission, and I'm sure if he had then he'd have said so.  So would you have just whipped out your iphone and started taking pics? Colin°Talk 16:59, 13 December 2012 (UTC)
I do not list that I have received signed / verbal consent for the images I have taken even though I always get consent (signed if identifiable, verbal if not identifiable). I guess may be I should start. I do not see this as any different than discussing the possibility of organ transplantation. You are offering the family the opportunity to do a little good with a bad situation. I have shared the signed consent with my college but will not give these consents to anyone at Wikipedia / Wikimedia as I did not get permission for that. The physician in question may have gotten consent. Why are we assuming that he has not? Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 17:13, 13 December 2012 (UTC)
I've spent the last few months trying to clean out .  Given the  I've seen in categorization and descriptions, I'd assume nothing at all about a failure to say &quot;Yes, I did get consent from the patient/parents for this picture&quot;.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 21:08, 13 December 2012 (UTC)
As I noted on the deletion discussion, we routinely ask uploaders to explicitly confirm an image is &quot;their own work&quot; or &quot;where they got it from&quot; -- we delete images with unknown provinence. Similarly, if consent is required for an image, I think the image description page should have a statement from the uploader that appropriate consent for WP/Commons was received. Colin°Talk 09:31, 14 December 2012 (UTC)
The consent for medical photography forms in my neck of the woods ask for specific levels of consent for what the pics will be used for: i. for use in the patients own case records and nothing else, ii, for local teaching use (i.e. stays within hospital), iii. for use in academic journals and presentations. I am thinking that many patients would not tick a box that said &quot;for use on wikipedia&quot;, that would probably scare them a bit. It 's popular domain, not some &quot;dusty&quot; academic journal that laypersons do not significantly access...My Q is that to be fair and transparent, is it necessary to inform the patient exactly what use the pic will be put to? lesion (talk) 19:17, 13 December 2012 (UTC)
Yes I tell them I am an editor of Wikipedia, that the image will be used on Wikipedia and will be under an open license and thus can be used anywhere on the internet. Only one person I spoke to was not comfortable, the rest where happy. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 20:16, 13 December 2012 (UTC)
Have a read of the patient images page on Commons. My research shows that standard UK consent forms do not have an option that would allow for use on Wikipedia/Commons. There is an issue here that images without the necessary consent for Commons will be uploaded from open-access journals and other sources if they have the necessary free licence. Commons generally does not give a damn about &quot;non-copyright&quot; issues as they are a matter for the subject and the photographer only. I think James is right that a consent form drafted to allow WP/Commons use can be presented to patients with success. The issue of consent is one of respect. Colin°Talk 09:31, 14 December 2012 (UTC)

discharge summary

I was very surprised to find that WP doesn't have an article on discharge summary [http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/discharge+summary] (or a disambig page epicrisis). It seems this term is the most common one used in both UK and US English, whereas medical case summary seems to be an insurance and legal term for a different kind of document. The terms referral feedback, final patient report, and patient report seem to be much less common and perhaps also refer to other documents. --Espoo (talk) 18:14, 12 December 2012 (UTC)

Primary research

There is an attempt to force primary research into the article on cystic fibrosis. Comments appreciated Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 23:36, 15 December 2012 (UTC)
Watchlisted. Commented at article talk and user talk. Hopefully they discuss and refrain from reverting again. Biosthmors (talk) 00:22, 16 December 2012 (UTC)
(this case aside) There is a tendency to downplay the usefulness of primary sources. Many primary sources begin with a background section, which is like a mini-review of the topic. Personally, I feel it is not a problem to ref the background section of a primary source. As long as the original research parts of the sources are not referenced too much... lesion (talk) 04:58, 16 December 2012 (UTC)
Those background sections tend not to be as neutral as a proper review article.  They tend to be summaries of those parts of the background that support the research at hand.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 07:48, 16 December 2012 (UTC)
Yes, and for that reason they don't help support  much. Cystic fibrosis is a major genetic disease: there's no need to be using scraps for this topic. Colin°Talk 08:32, 16 December 2012 (UTC)
I see your point, but I think this is not all the time, a good quality background will summarize all the available literature, including those previous findings that counter the coming arguments. Also, as per  a section covering contemporary research should be included. I think  is overused...primary research should be mentioned in a &quot;research section&quot;. To include the contemporary research is just as important as the history section. Human understanding of any medical topic is just a model that tends towards reality, as our understanding is refined, the model is adapted. I would like to see editors think rather than just undoing edits of (usually inexperienced) newcomers. Instead of putting them off at the start, can the primary source be mentioned briefly in a research section? lesion (talk) 14:23, 16 December 2012 (UTC)
If we included all primary research on a topic in a &quot;Research section&quot; that section would be thousands of kb long. This is an encyclopedia, not a repository for every single research study ever done.  Important research and primary studies can obviously be included, if they are mentioned as important by secondary reviews. Yobol (talk) 15:35, 16 December 2012 (UTC)
Basic contemporary research can be mentioned in an article but with appropriate weight, and for that you need secondary sources. Wikipedian's have a tendency to search PubMed or read the Daily Mail and try to include all sorts of weird, wonderful and often dead-end basic research as though it has huge clinical significance and confidently state cancer is already cured by eating, or avoiding, grapefruit or whatever. For example, in my own pet subject,  (online [http://www.frontiersin.org/Neuropharmacology/10.3389/fphar.2012.00059/full here]) provides an up-to-date summary of the state of research in the ketogenic diet beyond epilepsy. But in contrast, the background section of a paper researching in rats the ketogenic diet for Alzheimer's disease might only include supportive studies that agree with the researcher's proposed mechanism-of-action. And we need to be careful who the audience of these research papers is: not the general public, but other researchers and grant awarding bodies. So they will have a tendency to big-up the importance of their petri dishes. And while the intended audience know fine well this is just puffery, our Wikipedia readers may not. Colin°Talk 15:42, 16 December 2012 (UTC)
I think this issue comes up frequently enough for us at WP:MED that I'll write an essay on it. As of now, I have the sentence &quot;In 2012, two studies found a clinical benefit in taking aspirin to prevent recurrent VTE&quot; in DVT#Research directions. I sympathize with lesion's point, but I feel like the burden of thinking/researching about the appropriateness of a primary source should be on the person who added it. We can help by having an essay to refer people to. Just saying &quot;see &quot; after (something I've done myself) may be perceived as too y. Biosthmors (talk) 16:34, 16 December 2012 (UTC)
TRIPdatabase.com is probably the best site to help people find secondary sources.Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 19:09, 16 December 2012 (UTC)
So you are saying only to include mention of contemporary research if secondary sources mention it, and not cite the primary research...and also only to cite the most significant/promising contemporary research in the article rather than every study on the topic. 
In the example given I would simply say simply &quot;the role of a ketogenic diet in the etiology of Alzheimers has been investigated.&quot; ...nothing wrong with that right, no POV, just factual really. You can usually find review papers of topics like this. lesion (talk) 19:17, 16 December 2012 (UTC)
Yes I have managed to write about 20 good articles and never used a primary source. Primary sources are only needed if you wish to push fringe views or breaking research neither of which IMO we should be doing. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 19:28, 16 December 2012 (UTC)
If you can find review articles, use those, not primary articles. Good review articles place the primary research in proper context to mainstream thought as well as how productive/useful that line of research is. Yobol (talk) 19:19, 16 December 2012 (UTC)
@lesion,  allows the careful use of primary sources if no secondary sources are available, and there is no blanket prohibition against them. I just think it takes some wise editorial judgement and a dedication to the article. If one is going to add primary sources, then one should also be ready to replace those references to secondary sources when they become available. Biosthmors (talk) 19:33, 16 December 2012 (UTC)
Hmm, I vaguely remember the last time someone said that, their suggested appropriate use of primary sources turned out to either have problems or was replaceable by secondary sources. There may be a good reason why no secondary sources mentioned the research: it turned out to be irrelevant or mistaken, and nobody wants to fill a review with all the non-notable dead ends. There is a tendency on Wikipedia to throw in everything to an article, when our readers would thank us for a bit more editorial control. Colin°Talk 19:42, 16 December 2012 (UTC)
True, which is why I like WP:MEDREV. See my example above for DVT where I've cited a couple recent NEJM studies to support one sentence. I agree that editorial judgement is important, and I don't want to encourage people citing dead ends. But I also don't want to discourage them from improving the encyclopedia. Biosthmors (talk) 20:12, 16 December 2012 (UTC)
I think the use of randomized controlled trials published in a high quality journal like NEJM in a research section would be a good example of what is a good example of appropriate use of a primary study; however, most of the time we get low quality retrospective observational studies/case studies/case reports/animal studies, published in low quality or non MEDLINE indexed journals that are used to rebut secondary sources.  Good high quality primary studies that deserve to be mentioned are by far the exception, not the rule. Yobol (talk) 20:21, 16 December 2012 (UTC)
And that is if we are lucky. Much of the primary research stuff I see is from petre dishes. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 16:12, 18 December 2012 (UTC)
Something that actually &quot;summarize[s] all the available literature&quot; on cystic fibrosis is going to be book-length, or at least a long chapter in a book.  Half a dozen paragraphs of summary in a primary source can't do that, no matter how hard the authors try. 
I generally agree that we want to avoid citing the primary literature whenever possible.  I am not convinced that articles are improved by a long series of statements like &quot; is being researched in this disease&quot;.  And when you consider major diseases, like breast cancer, you would indeed get a very long list of such statements, even if you restricted the list only to those things that had already seen multiple papers published on it.  The best approach is to find someone else who has already written about the state of research (&quot;Whither ____?&quot; articles are not usually that hard to find) and use their summaries instead of whatever happened to catch our eyes.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 22:07, 16 December 2012 (UTC)

Agree as well...  that's been my rule of thumb.  First, no primary research.  Second, no primary research.  Third, if there must be primary research, it has to be referenced specifically by a secondary source, and only used in conjunction with and in the context of the use of that secondary source in the article.  I think  is probably overdue for an update.  The way it is written isn't exactly how it is being applied/enforced by the  folks.   should probably be updated to make its de facto &quot;enforcement&quot; official.

I think the term &quot;primary research&quot; is confusing. Note that  is all about sources, not content. A discussion over what to cover in articles is more of a  thing, which already briefly discourages discussing individual studies in detail.  In fact, one could write an essay on Wikipedia's over use of &quot;A study .... found that ... However, another study .... found that...&quot; non-encyclopaedic text. It comes from folk taking news and putting it into an encyclopaedia, or from too much reading PubMed abstracts and not enough reading reviews and books.  There is a place to discuss studies in some articles: the history or the research sections are appropriate places. But we should try very hard not to discussing them in an indications section for example. Colin°Talk 17:25, 18 December 2012 (UTC)

Wouldn't that contradict  and discourage people from citing the two recent trials published in NEJM highlighted above in DVT? Biosthmors (talk) 19:21, 18 December 2012 (UTC)

 It is interesting that you have chosen to quote RCTs from the New England Journal of Medicine as evidence to support the use of primary sources. In my opinion, the NEJM is the highest quality medical journal. RCTs published in it are the best primary sources, often better than many secondary sources.

 According to , we aren't supposed to consider the quality of a paper before using it as a reference; we can only consider the type of paper. For example, an RCT published in the NEJM has the same weight as an RCT published in Homeopathy: the journal of the Faculty of Homeopathy. (I have argued with WhatamIdoing about this matter before, regarding secondary sources.) Axl ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 20:56, 18 December 2012 (UTC)
The quality of the publication isn't mentioned as something that should be ignored:  &quot;Do not reject a high-quality type of study due to personal objections to the study's inclusion criteria, references, funding sources, or conclusions.&quot;  The reputation of the journal itself doesn't seem to fall into this list of exclusions.  Things like sample size might, but the publication itself isn't really about the type of study, is it? WhatamIdoing (talk) 22:29, 18 December 2012 (UTC)
 Do you believe that the general quality/reputation of a journal is helpful when deciding its suitability as a source? Axl ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 22:32, 18 December 2012 (UTC)
Sorry WAID, but &quot;Do not reject a high-quality type of study due to personal objections to the study's inclusion criteria, references, funding sources, or conclusions&quot; is just terribly confusing grammar. While I can parse past the triple negative, I shouldn't have to. When you then add &quot;doesn't seem to fall into this list of exclusions&quot; it just gets more confusing. How about &quot;A high quality study in a reputable journal may be acceptable even if you have personal objections to its content, inclusion criteria, references, funding sources, or conclusions&quot; instead?LeadSongDog come howl! 23:32, 18 December 2012 (UTC)

I have been talking with a designer for a while. If anyone else is designing a logo then I would like to be aware of it. I have no proposals just now. See  - the Wikimedia Foundation has asked that people do not use their logo. Their statement leaves me with a lot of questions, but what I would like to see is that chapters have their own base logo which is free for anyone to use and then individual chapters can make variations of that. To affect this there would need to be a lot more people in the conversation. Right now, there is no free logo for community use. I am not sure if the WMF really wants the community to fork off and brand something new, but definitely the community needs to be able to use some kind of logo. Also that link says not to use the term &quot;Wikimedia&quot;. I am not sure what that means.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 15:26, 19 December 2012 (UTC)

First off, gently make sure he's aware of . Second, point out that Scheuermann's disease is a only a -class article (well, maybe it should be Start-class) that won't be a lot of help to him. While he is of course welcome to work on improving the article as he learns more about the subject, consider cautioning him about possible NPOV and COI, and then watchlisting both the article and his talkpage.

Global burden of disease and &quot;Top&quot; importance

I put  as a &quot;Top&quot; importance article, as it seems to be concept we implicitly use to judge whether or not articles are Top importance and the most empirical way (the study) used to estimate this. Public health is listed as Top importance. Shouldn't Global health be, to be consistent? Biosthmors (talk) 21:28, 20 December 2012 (UTC)
I moved Global burden of disease to mid importance because this article is about one of the most important research projects in qualifying the global burden of disease, and not the concept of &quot;global burden of disease&quot; itself. That concept is in, as you suggest, Global health, and I did just change that project from high to top importance.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 14:35, 21 December 2012 (UTC)

additional eyes at Aspirin again

Hi,

I am hoping to get some additional eyes on my recent edits to this article, as I continue to work through the medical uses section. As I mention on the , a bleary-eyed deletion of the entire &quot;hypothesized uses&quot; section might have been a bit too bold and not consistent with the consensus process, so I would appreciate additional comment there or reversion as necessary.

The article received GA status quite some time ago (under less strict MEDRS standards, from what I've gathered), and I'm wondering whether it should be reassessed (either now or once I've worked through the remainder of the medical uses section)? Any thoughts on whether this would be a good candidate for a FA?

-- UseTheCommandLine (talk) 17:58, 21 December 2012 (UTC)
It would be good to have as an FA, but in its current state, would not be a good candidate for FAC. I see quite a few primary sources used; none should be needed for an article with this much literature. Sasata (talk) 18:41, 21 December 2012 (UTC)

medicine in popular culture?

Hi,

So in chatting with a couple other wikipedians the other day we came up with an idea that seems like it might be kind of neat -- put together lists of the medical terms used in medical TV shows (ER, Gray's Anatomy, House, Scrubs, et al) so that there are convenient links to the medical vocabulary for each episode. I notice that the page List of ER episodes has about 12k hits in the last month. This might be used as a potential point of entry for newer editors, though there are clear concerns about .
Thoughts? -- UseTheCommandLine (talk) 22:14, 24 December 2012 (UTC)
And as I check more current series, the list of grey's anatomy episodes has 300k hits in the last month. -- UseTheCommandLine (talk) 22:19, 24 December 2012 (UTC)
See  for the list of most popular pages. The article for the United States television show Grey's Anatomy ranks between [http://stats.grok.se/en/latest/Grey%27s_Anatomy 200-300 by pageviews] among Wikipedia's 4 million articles, putting it within the top 0.1% of Wikipedia articles by popularity. This television show is a medical drama which in every episode introduces medical conditions. Perhaps people watching the show are hearing the names of medical conditions and searching for them on Wikipedia. They are certainly searching for more information about the show.
 is organized enough to have made List of Grey's Anatomy episodes a featured list and created many articles about the show. It might be a good idea to reach out to this group and encourage them to have Wikipedia articles on show episodes link to the Wikipedia articles describing the medical conditions the shows are depicting, if this is not already happening uniformly. Pop culture entertainment media could be a way to make more people aware that we welcome people at all levels of expertise to participate in the development of articles on medicine, and perhaps also members of this WikiProject should be aware of major pop culture depictions of medicine.

my understanding of the copyright here is that attribution must be given. Outside of the legal arguments and instinctive reaction to someone plagiarizing your hard work, perhaps we could take this as indicator of the article quality?

the Public domain is entirely different than the CC-BY-SA license wikipedia content carries, and i would caution against conflating the two. i also dont think that simply because someone is willing to plagiarize easily-accessible content this means that they are competent to evaluate the quality of the material thus plagiarized. -- UseTheCommandLine (talk) 00:33, 26 December 2012 (UTC)

The case study case report article is (almost) purely medical.

The (social sciences) case study article has little or nothing to do with a clinical case report. &quot;Case report&quot; is the common name for the clinical variety and is good as it stands.
