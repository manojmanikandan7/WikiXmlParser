*l|List of countries by prevalence of genital cutting
After some of the usual type of kerfuffle at ircumcision (the article is now protected), I notice the recently created article ist of countries by prevalence of genital cutting. The &quot;map&quot; from this is being proposed for use at ircumcision. This seems problematic from a P:V point of view: it's not exactly clear what the data sources are but they appear to straddle quite a time period, giving us a map of a state of the world that never was, and which certainly does not appear in any P:RS. The topic looks to me to be intrinsically OR/SYNTH as presented. Thoughts? ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 03:51, 17 October 2019 (UTC)

The RS data is broken down in 0 to 14 and 15 and above. One could calculate the overall prevalence from demographic data, but that would be P:OR.

The point is the statisticians at the WHO are qualified to deal with such time differences and sift and refine their data use. We Wikipedia editors are not. This looks to me like a piece of original work built from an editor's synthesis of primary data - we are meant to be citing secondary sources, not creating them anew. As for verifiability we have a problem. For example, clicking on any link to the &quot;The DHS Program&quot; take me to a web site landing page[https://www.dhsprogram.com/Data/] which does not verify the data used. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 04:32, 17 October 2019 (UTC)
(Add) There also seems to be an issue even where content is apparently verifiable. So the figure for South Korea is given as 81.6% for male circumcision at &quot;15+&quot;, yet the cited source says &quot;Currently the age-standardized circumcision rate for South Korean males aged 14–29 is found to be 75.8%&quot;, and the 81.6% does not appear in the text. What is going on? ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 04:52, 17 October 2019 (UTC)
I agree with Alexbrn. ser:Flyer22 Reborn|Flyer22 Reborn (ser talk:Flyer22 Reborn|talk) 05:06, 17 October 2019 (UTC)

q2|The point is the statisticians at the WHO are qualified to deal with such time differences and sift and refine their data use. We Wikipedia editors are not. No statistical analysis involved here. The table literally quotes the sourced data, as WHO (2007) and Morris et al (2016) also do (Morris et al (2016) does some analysis for countries they don't have survey data with religion demographics, but we don't attempt that, and simply quote their finding). Other than that, they don't do any adjustment for 'time straddling', and we quote the data from the various sources just like any other list article does (e.g. ist of countries and dependencies by population). No P:OR involved at all. 
q2|As for verifiability we have a problem. For example, clicking on any link to the &quot;The DHS Program&quot; take me to a web site landing page[https://www.dhsprogram.com/Data/] which does not verify the data used.

The source for the South Korean data is PMID 23227923. How does it support your &quot;81.6%&quot; figure?

Actually I had a similar question some time ago for another article, and I've seen nothing in the image policy that prevents making a diagram to illustrate. In fact, it advises to make new diagrams that are unlike anything published elsewhere for copyright reasons ikipedia:Image_use_policy#Diagrams_and_other_images. That's what I did with this image for example [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-alcoholic_fatty_liver_disease#/media/File:NAFLD_liver_progression.svg], which is mainly inspired by another image, but also partly from others and foremost by the textual sources. As long as the image is illustrating data found in the sources, I guess it's OK, isn't it? Else how could we manage with copyright issues? --ser:Signimu|Signimu (ser talk:Signimu|talk) 05:38, 17 October 2019 (UTC)

In point of fact the article is nearly all yours (94%), and it was you who added the Korean reference, at a time when the figure was (mysteriously) 77%. What are you doing?

Yes, I contributed the lion share of that article, that doesn't mean own it, though. We don't own anything at Wikipedia, it's T&amp;C are pretty clear about that.
I haven't looked into the SKorean figure yet, but if you say I changed it when I introduced the reference, it stands to reason that I corrected it when I did that. If you believe it's wrong, just go ahead and correct it. Or at least discuss it in the article's talk page.

Not sure about &quot;whinging&quot; - it's important surely that care is taken when adding medical content to Wikipedia? So, the second country I spot checked was nited Kingdom. This gives the &quot;0-14&quot; prevalence as &quot;3%&quot;, yet the source [https://www.nct.org.uk/baby-toddler/everyday-care/circumcision-boys] says this is the &quot;post-neonatal&quot; figure? ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 03:10, 18 October 2019 (UTC)
Yes, 0 to 14 is &quot;post-neonatal&quot;. Either way, the P:CENTRAL place to discuss the article's content is it's own alk:List of countries by prevalence of genital cutting|talk page, not here. ser:Guarapiranga|Guarapiranga (ser talk:Guarapiranga|talk) 03:30, 18 October 2019 (UTC)
q|&quot;0 to 14 is &quot;post-neonatal&quot; &lt;- Do you P:CIR|seriously think so?

Sorry, we are truly through the looking glass here. You have put an entry in a table for prevalence of circumcision in the UK for ages 0-14 (i.e. from birth to aged 14). You have put &quot;3%&quot; in that table. You say above you strictly engaged in no re-interpretation of the data. Yet the cited source for this says the &quot;post-neonatal therapeutic circumcision&quot; UK prevalence is 3% (i.e. all therapeutic circumcision not of newborns). And you are seriously claiming these two sets of people are identical? ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 04:15, 18 October 2019 (UTC)
Ahh, so now your problem is with the therapeutic qualifier, not with the age bracket anymore… Swiftly moved the goalpost, I see.
However, you may be right about that one. OTOH, Morris et al (2016) estimate it at 0.2%, and the primary source they quote (Cathcart et al, 2006)ite journal|last1=Cathcart|first1=P.|last2=Nuttall|first2=M.|last3=Meulen|first3=J. van der|last4=Emberton|first4=M.|last5=Kenny|first5=S. E.|date=2006|title=Trends in paediatric circumcision and its complications in England between 1997 and 2003|url=https://bjssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bjs.5369|journal=BJS|language=en|volume=93|issue=7|pages=885–890|doi=10.1002/bjs.5369|issn=1365-2168 estimate it at 3.1% for overall prevalence (as they too confuse the annual rate cited in their source with population prevalence). So you can move it back to 3.1% (no need to cite the source, it's already cited on that cell). — ser:Guarapiranga|Guarapiranga (ser talk:Guarapiranga|talk) 05:15, 18 October 2019 (UTC)
The issue is the therapeutic tag and the age bracket. If you truly believe that &quot;age 0-14&quot; and &quot;post-neonatal&quot; describe identical sets, I would say you are not competent to be editing any medical data-based articles and need to be topic-banned. So where in Cathcart et. al. is this 3.1% figure for prevalence in ages &quot;0-14&quot; (strictly without &quot;interpretation&quot; remember). I'm not seeing it. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 05:32, 18 October 2019 (UTC)
Here: q2|The proportion of boys who would undergo circumcision by their 15th birthday if the circumcision rates observed in a reporting year remained unchanged fell from 3·9 per cent in 1997 to 3·1 per cent in 2003. You're funny, Alex, first you say q|Wikipedia editors are not (competent), now you say they need to be. You contradict yourself every handful of words. — ser:Guarapiranga|Guarapiranga (ser talk:Guarapiranga|talk) 10:10, 18 October 2019 (UTC)
So a couple of issues here. First, &quot;0-14&quot; and &quot;0-15&quot; are different age groups, and secondly Cathcart et. al. is confining itself only to &quot;paediatric medical circumcision&quot; whereas other data you are using includes non-medical circumcision. Editors are not expected to be &quot;competent&quot; in interpreting and analyzing data (indeed that is P:NOR|prohibited) but they are expected to be competent in reading, comprehending and conveying material in sources into our articles. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 11:01, 18 October 2019 (UTC)
1. If you see something that needs fixing, P:FIXIT.
2. q|By the 15th birthday is 0-14 (i.e. it includes 14 years and 364 days old).
3. Yes, the source does exclude ritual circumcision from their analysis, and only looks at circumcisions done in hospital. You could include the ritual ones they exclude, and rework their numbers, but that would be P:OR. If you have a better source for the number, go ahead and improve the article. P:BEBOLD
4. Your P:PERSONALATTACKS are unnecessary and constitute P:HARASSMENT.
— ser:Guarapiranga|Guarapiranga (ser talk:Guarapiranga|talk) 12:31, 18 October 2019 (UTC)
Guarapiranga is correct that &quot;by the 15th birthday&quot; means &quot;age 0 to 14&quot;.  
I'm not sure that including ritual circumcision rates will make much difference.  The Jewish population is just 0.5% of the people in the UK, and the Muslim community is about 4.5%.  In the UK (and in most developed countries), the Jewish mohel is normally also a licensed healthcare provider and the ritual is performed in the clinic.  The only requirement for the person performing an Islamic circumcision is that he be a properly trained healthcare provider (e.g., he need not be Muslim).  In the absence of reliable sources that directly contradict this claim, I think it's reasonable for us to assume that this source is correct, as most of the circumcisions in the UK will be performed in a healthcare facility and therefore captured in this survey.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:11, 18 October 2019 (UTC)
The source is no doubt &quot;correct&quot; but it explicitly excludes ritual circumcisions that have taken place in a clinical setting, so it would be wrong to use the figure to represent all-UK circumcision. This rather illustrates the problem of stretching primary sources rather than relying on expert sources that can sift those primaries for us. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 16:48, 18 October 2019 (UTC)
Morris et al (2016) is one such &quot;expert sources&quot;, but unfortunately they screwed this one up, citing the 0.2% annual rate as prevalence. The actual number in the primary source is 0.21%, and it's not even a flow rate, as it's number of circumcisions in a year divided by the whole 0-14 boy population, not over a single age cohort, like the annual rate of neonatal circumcision. So, yeah, the best estimates for the UK are 3.1% (Cathart et al, 2006) and 3% (National Childbirth Trust, 2019)ite web|url=https://www.nct.org.uk/baby-toddler/everyday-care/circumcision-boys|title=Circumcision in boys|last=Trust)|first=NCT (National Childbirth|date=2019-08-04|website=NCT (National Childbirth Trust)|language=en|access-date=2019-10-19 (one more reliable, the other more recent, both excluding ritual circumcision, and both providing pretty much the same number). ser:Guarapiranga|Guarapiranga (ser talk:Guarapiranga|talk) 08:08, 19 October 2019 (UTC)
The 3.1% figure is implausible. But we're not on Wikipedia to bungle around with &quot;interpretations&quot; of data. Come back when we can reference something which directly supports the content. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 06:21, 20 October 2019 (UTC)

Article name
I attempted to make the articles title more precise: ist of countries by prevalence of circumcision and female genital mutilation but Guarapiranga has moved it back to ist of countries by prevalence of genital cutting. This is something we see from anti-circumcision activists all the time, an attempt to elide circumcision alongside FGM as &quot;genital cutting&quot; in a way RS generally doesn't. More widely, the munging together of these two statistical sets into one table is inherently POV. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 07:08, 17 October 2019 (UTC)
As I told you in the edit summary, |Alexbrn, genital cutting is not an q|activist term; it's the official term used by the [https://www.uscis.gov/fgmc US government], by the [https://www.cdc.gov/immigrantrefugeehealth/guidelines/domestic/general/discussion/female-genital-cutting.html CDC] and also by the [https://www.britannica.com/topic/female-genital-cutting Encyclopaedia Brittanica]. — ser:Guarapiranga|Guarapiranga (ser talk:Guarapiranga|talk) 08:41, 17 October 2019 (UTC)
Those sources speak to FGM also being known as genital cutting, not male circumcision. ICD-10 uses [https://icd.who.int/browse10/2016/en#/Z91.7 FGM] – though it does list &quot;cutting&quot; as a synonym. Given ICD-10 is one of the specified preferred sources for P:AT by P:NCMED, m|I prefer ist of countries by prevalence of circumcision and female genital mutilation as the page deals with both. ser:Little pob|Little pob (ser talk:Little pob|talk) 09:12, 17 October 2019 (UTC)
Exactly: this whole ploy looks like a POV push to suggest equivalence between FGM and circumcision and get the &quot;genital cutting&quot; wording into Wikipedia, and this dishonesty over terms is just an aspect of it.

Not generally. Search results are not RS and can be very unintelligently touted.

e|Alexbrn Ah you're right, I hoped the quite precise search criteria I used would overcome Google's filtering bubble, but well apparently not if you can't see the pertinent results (from the 2nd entry for me).

How can you say &quot;female circumcision&quot; is the ICD term when the link you give[https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en#/http://id.who.int/icd/entity/1459051663/mms/unspecified] has &quot;female genital mutilation&quot;? ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 03:52, 18 October 2019 (UTC)
I repeat: &quot;ICD11 considers &quot;female circumcision&quot; an alias of &quot;female mutilation&quot; (I don't know how to link that, search in ICD11 search bar to see it)&quot;. I can post a screenshot if you have difficulties seeing the alias (that's not ironic, I simply do not exclude browsers differences that might prevent you from seeing aliases on their arguably raw interface). --ser:Signimu|Signimu (ser talk:Signimu|talk) 05:30, 18 October 2019 (UTC)
You put female circumcision was one of the &quot;accepted terms&quot; (whatever that means). But - regardless of synonmys - you agree, though, that the actual term (GC51) in ICD11 is &quot;female genital mutilation&quot;[https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en#/http%3a%2f%2fid.who.int%2ficd%2fentity%2f1459051663] right?
I agree it's both since &quot;female circumcision&quot; is shown as an alias. It's not a synonym I make up, they accepted it. But I agree this is not the main presentation they accepted, &quot;female genitalia mutilation&quot; has a slightly higher precedence. But if you go that way, &quot;male circumcision&quot; is even less accepted than &quot;female circumcision&quot; per ICD11, since &quot;male circumcision&quot; has no exact match (the only other entry being &quot;QB82 Contact with health services for routine or ritual circumcision&quot;, which suggests this pertains to both female and male circumcision!). So per ICD11, &quot;female circumcision&quot; is more supported than &quot;male circumcision&quot; that is not even recognized (and I know this sounds ridiculous, but apparently that's how it is). --ser:Signimu|Signimu (ser talk:Signimu|talk) 06:13, 18 October 2019 (UTC)
The term is the term and stands alone. &quot;Female circumcision&quot; is what the WHO used to call this (as explained in our FGM article) which is, I suppose, why it's kept as a synonym. But that old usage is deprecated and considered unacceptable in most forms of discourse today. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 06:21, 18 October 2019 (UTC)
That's edging on P:OR, there are many reasons why ICD may contain aliases, and not necessarily because the term is deprecated (BTW I'm sure we can find several examples of changing priorities between aliases as changes in terminology by specialists happen over time). Anyway, a better argument would be that the article title should cover both circumcision and female genital mutilation as to cover the two accepted and most frequent terms, even if that includes some semantic redundancy, and to that I can agree, hence my support (albeit light because I'm external). --ser:Signimu|Signimu (ser talk:Signimu|talk) 15:33, 18 October 2019 (UTC)
Side-note: IMO the biggest cause of the whole issue here is trying to mix up circumcision (female or male) and female genital mutilation, the latter being politically loaded (that's at the root of its inception according to emale genital mutilation) and more importantly a disease according to ICD11. These should be separated, as is strongly suggested by the fact that ICD11 does not even consider &quot;circumcision&quot; as an entry (the closest one being only about the contact to professionals practicing it). --ser:Signimu|Signimu (ser talk:Signimu|talk) 15:38, 18 October 2019 (UTC)
Agreed, the article is trying to make an equivalence between circumcision and FGM, which is POV. At least some of the wording doing this has now been toned down. It's an activist move and our ircumcision ar5ticle is under fairly steady attack from activists wanting to rename it (e.g.) &quot;male genital mutilation&quot;. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 15:51, 18 October 2019 (UTC)
 e|Signimu Let's be clear about this: the common names used currently in reliable sources are &quot;circumcision&quot; for males and &quot;female genital mutilation&quot; for females. The procedures are not equivalent in the way that they are viewed by mainstream medical practitioners, nor in their consequences. An attempt to use a single term for both is an attempt to indirectly draw an equivalence between the two, and a step towards legitimising the abhorrent practice of FGM. Wikipedia should not be supporting attempts to do that, and we should be strongly defending the distinction that exists. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 16:19, 18 October 2019 (UTC)
 Yes, and the very existence of an article that juxtaposes circumcision and FGM is a kind of OR/POV problem as other editors have noticed[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:List_of_countries_by_prevalence_of_genital_cutting&amp;diff=913272965&amp;oldid=913268533].

 As I said, I have limited knowledge on this topic, so I have based my reasoning solely on the academic articles above and ICD, but when reading the [https://www.britannica.com/topic/female-genital-cutting Encyclopaedia Britannica] linked above by Guarapiranga, it appears clearly that all 4 types of female genital cutting are mutilations, contrary to male circumcision. Given this and ICD, it appears clear that both of these practices should be separated (including in the maps/tables as Alexbrn suggests), and if there still remain doubts for some editors, I can bet that it's possible to find several serious academic sources clearly distinguishing these two practices.RexxS: After reading EB, I also find FGM abhorrent, but my opinion is irrelevant for WP, anyway the sources clearly make that distinction ) --ser:Signimu|Signimu (ser talk:Signimu|talk) 18:32, 18 October 2019 (UTC)

 Lassa fever re-check 

See ikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine/Archive_124#Lassa_fever_lead_check|/Archive_124#Lassa_fever_lead_check for earlier discussion on same article

There is a WikiJMed article on Lassa fever (oi:10.15347/wjm/2019.002.2|link). On its initial publication, multiple issues were detected (ikiversity:Talk:WikiJournal_of_Medicine/An_overview_of_Lassa_fever#Post-publication_peer_review|discussion); Primarily copyvio problems, but also medmos issues, since the article was also intended for wikipedia-integration.
The article has been subsequently overhauled and published under oi:10.15347/wjm/2019.002.2 (had the author not been able to address these issues it would have been simply retracted). The copyvio issues have been fully corrected, and I believe that it is now also MEDMOS-compliant. 
*If anyone is able to check the article for MEDMOS-compliance, that would be extremely valuable.

To avoid similar problems in future for WikiJMed articles intended for wikipedia integration, I also propose a couple of items.
# We've added a short MEDMOS primer in the :WikiJournal_of_Medicine/Publishing#Articles_intended_for_Wikipedia_integration|author guidelines. Feel free to give feedback or directly edit.
# We could also add a :WikiJournal of Medicine/Potential upcoming articles|processing step to post articles in review to this talkpage during the peer review process.

It would be better IMO if authors would work initially directly on the articles on Wikipedia and than publish from Wikipedia into Wiki Journals.
Copy and pasting stuff into Wikipedia after the fact does not work very well. This results in a lot of formatting issues and does not allow feedback from the community as things are worked on.

 Need 3rd opinion on addition for ntermittent fasting 
ile:intermittent_fasting.svg|thumb|right|100px|Intermittent fasting is a strategy for meals timing scheduling.
Hello ) I'd like to add a mention in the Mechanism section of the 2 major hypotheses for the health/biomarkers changes observed with fasting: is it only because of caloric restriction, or is there something special with fasting? These hypotheses are covered in nearly all the literature about intermittent fasting or (long-term) fasting. Here is what I proposed to add:

Alexbrn, it seems you have a bad habit of assuming failed verification when you simply did not take the time to properly check the source. I can gladly present excerpts to save you time, it would simply be nice if you could ask that in a nicer way )
* 1stref: &quot;How Does Calorie Restriction or Fasting Work? After decades of research, scientists still don't know why calorie restriction extends lifespan and delays age-related diseases in laboratory animals. Do these results come from consuming fewer calories or eating within a certain timeframe? Are the results affected by the diet's mix of nutrients?&quot;
* 2nd: &quot;This latter choice derived from the idea of studying conditions simulating as much as possible a condition of fasting, whose benefits, proven by animal studies, seem to depend on the shift in metabolism from glucose utilization and fat synthesis/storage towards reduced insulin secretion and fat mobilization/oxidation [30, 31]. [...] The hypothesized benefits of IER, extensively studied in animal models, included the use of fats during severe energy restriction with preferential reduction of adipose mass, the stimulation of browning in white adipose tissue, increased insulin sensitivity, lowering of leptin and increased human growth hormone, ghrelin and adiponectin circulating levels, reduced inflammation and oxidative stress [30]. The trigger of adaptive cell response leading to enhanced ability to cope with stress [...] At present, many of these adaptive mechanisms have been demonstrated in animal experimental models but not in humans, thus more research is still needed.&quot; [NB: 30 and 31 are refs about the flip switch hypothesis)
* 3rd: it's in the title, the article is a review which concludes with the flip switch hypothesis.
* 4rd: &quot;It would seem plausible that the unfavorable physiological changes synonymous with energy restriction and weight loss could be offset by intermittently raising energy intake to meet weight maintenance energy requirements, rather than a continuous and ongoing energy restriction.&quot;
About P:OVERCITE and P:REDFLAG: I note that P:OVERCITE is an essay, and P:REDFLAG is irrelevant and conflicting with P:OVERCITE (or could you quote the exact sentence you think applies here?). According to P:REDFLAG: «surprising or apparently important claims not covered by multiple mainstream sources [is a red flag]», that's exactly the opposite case here: multiple reliable sources are provided to show that both of these hypotheses are widely considered in this scientific community. Initially there were less, but I added more following Zefr comments. Four does not seem overciting to me, but feel free to propose which source to trim, but then claiming that this is not supported by enough reliable sources would be a moot point ink If you have any additional question, I'll be glad to clarify and save you time ) --ser:Signimu|Signimu (ser talk:Signimu|talk) 19:04, 22 October 2019 (UTC)
Well I did read the source, and despite your helpful provision of an extract I still cannot see how the first source supports the &quot;weight loss vs 'flip switch'&quot; dilemma the article text sets up - and I don't see that caveat mentioned that the source refers to &quot;laboratory animals&quot;. If you're saying the text is a P:SYNTHESIS of the four sources, then that could be problematic. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 19:22, 22 October 2019 (UTC)
Flip switch is the name given to the hypothesis that there is something specific going on with fasting. The first source does not mention nor references it directly, but it mentions exactly the same hypothesis, just not named. Other sources do the same (eg, the 2nd one, but there is a reference to the flip switch paper/review). Unfortunately the first source provides no list of references, so that's why I am always wary of using it (it's not a scientific statement like the AHA). However, all the other sources do either mention explicitly the flip switch, or add a citation to the 2 flip switch articles. And yes, when mentioning the mechanism, most sources mix up animal and human studies, as the flip switch hypothesis is investigated in both. Since this is not a result, but a question of scientific interest, I see no problem that reviews of this hypothesis are not only focused on human studies. What matters for MEDRS is whether this applies to humans, and for this the sources are clear and unanimous: we don't know. And this information is what I think is pertinent to add. So to summarize: if you really think this is problematic, I see no problem in either removing the first ref for this sentence, or removing the name &quot;flip switch&quot; (the sentence still carries the same info without). --ser:Signimu|Signimu (ser talk:Signimu|talk) 19:32, 22 October 2019 (UTC)
NB: Please note the sources are not in order of pertinence but simply the same order as in the mainspace entry, that's why the NIA source is first although it's not explicitly naming the flip switch theory (but it still discusses the hypothesis without naming) ) If you want an order of pertinence, I'dd say: sources 3, 2, 4, 1. --ser:Signimu|Signimu (ser talk:Signimu|talk) 01:07, 23 October 2019 (UTC)

Please note also the commentary I've added as a lay-summary of source 3: [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/oby.22384]. This is dealing with recent studies on humans about the metabolic switch hypothesis, so this hints at not only how to interpret the hypothesis, but also that there are active research on it, another confirmation this hypothesis is taken seriously by scientists in the field. --ser:Signimu|Signimu (ser talk:Signimu|talk) 01:16, 23 October 2019 (UTC)

I think the P:OVERCITE issue leads to such information loss from those sources that we are into improper P:SYNTHESIS territory. The NIA source is used in a way that fails P:V - and it contains the caveat that &quot;More work is needed to determine which, if any, types of fasting diets have long-term benefits&quot; which problematizes the proposition as worded here. Similarly PMC 6304782 has &quot;Therefore, unlike the very promising data on animals, evidence is not sufficiently robust to suggest the superiority of intermittent vs. continuous caloric restriction regimens on the main cardiovascular factors in humans&quot; and numerous deep caveats about the data used, which readers couldn't know from the way it is summarized.

The proposed text still seems rather adrift of the sources. PMID 28214525 has &quot;there are no studies of IER diets  in  humans  which  have  reported on major  health  events, focus  has  instead  been  on surrogate  markers,  so  it  is  still  uncertain  whether  the  benefits  of  fasting  seen  in  rodents can translate across to humans&quot;. Thos doesn't fit well with the proposed text for the article. It seem to me the upshot of these sources is that there is no good evidence of any particular effect of intermittent fasting on human health. I shan't respond to further proposals, but that does not mean endorsement. Perhaps other editors can comment? ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 17:42, 23 October 2019 (UTC)
 Alexbrn, I think that is a different issue, whether intermittent fasting has any effect on human health. This is already covered in ntermittent fasting#Applications, with a scientific statement from the AHA, which recognizes IF short-term (we are talking up to 6 months here) effects on weight loss[https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000476]: ollapse|1=&quot;Body weight decreased significantly in all studies by 3% to 8% after 3 to 24 weeks of treatment. [...] There is evidence that both alternate-day fasting and periodic fasting may be effective for weight loss, although there are no data that indicate whether the weight loss can be sustained long term. In addition, both eating patterns may be useful for lowering triglyceride concentrations but have little or no effect on total, LDL, or HDL cholesterol concentrations. These protocols may also be beneficial for lowering blood pressure, but a minimum weight loss of 6% may be required to see an effect. Intermittent fasting may also be effective for decreasing fasting insulin and IR, but fasting glucose remains largely unchanged. Future work in this area should aim to examine whether these effects still persist in longer-term (&gt;52 weeks) randomized, controlled trials. [...] Intermittent fasting approaches appear to be feasible to help patients lower calorie intake consistently. More data are needed on longer-term outcomes for weight reduction and risk factor modification.&quot;
 And one of their recommendations is: &quot;Include intermittent fasting approaches as an option to help lower calorie intake and to reduce body weight&quot;
 Furthermore, although what you write about PMID 28214525 is accurate (and note it does write that studies on surrogate markers, what I name &quot;biomarkers&quot;, on humans exist), it would be a bit cherrypicking without reading the rest: &quot;The same authors found that IER and CER diets are equally effective for weight loss, with about 5%–8% body weight loss achievable across 8–12 weeks with both diets.60 Thus, IER is not superior to CER on average, but offers an alternative to conventional dieting approaches.&quot;
 Hence, all recent reliable sources agree on three things: 1. intermittent fasting has similar results to calorie restriction for weight loss, 2. we only have data up to 6 months, so we don't know if it's sustainable (and there's also no reason to believe it's not, we just don't know yet), 3. we don't know the clinical/general health relevance of the changes induced in biomarkers, whether in humans (as reported by AHA and this systematic review[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116995] and ntermittent_fasting#Weight_loss_and_health_biomarkers|others already in the entry) or animals.
 Point 1 and 2 are already covered in the entry. My addition aims to explicit the 3rd point, which is not really covered in the entry. --ser:Signimu|Signimu (ser talk:Signimu|talk) 18:40, 23 October 2019 (UTC)
Can another editor give us an opinion on this new proposition please? ) The big question is whether it is encyclopedic to mention the two major biological hypotheses proposed to explain IF? Please let me know, so that I know if I should continue my efforts to amend or just drop this ink (it's been dragging since 3 weeks on other talk pages...). --ser:Signimu|Signimu (ser talk:Signimu|talk) 18:37, 24 October 2019 (UTC)

 Access to reliable medical information 

Hello everyone 
I am a medical student and i have started a project that aims to be a social/encyclopaedic network for physician, patient, medical students,  researchers  health professionals and other various curious minds
The project is named TheAderal referring to the  well known and misuse amphetamine based drug.

The website require two mains ressources : 
-First of all reliable medical information,  so far we have access to information from MayoClinic, Medline, WHO ,Jensen, Genbank which represent a massive amount of data for a start  this is why finding and scraping the starting database is quite simple considering the ridiculous amount of data online. 
-The challenge is to vet it by a  crowd of all kinds informed potentials members cited above. Which i hope can be some of you. The participation of all the protagonist of medicine to communicate is vital for the development of this limitless project .

The first purpose of this talk is to ask the following questions : 
How to access all the medical-related articles of the wikipedia without breaking any laws and if possible in a alphabetical order so it can fit the website that's being currently built? Can i have access to every pictures/schemes.. of all the Medical sciences once again in an alphabetical order? 

Wikipedia inspired this project from the start we share the same ideals of giving free access of information to everyone asking for it which brings me to the second purpose of this message : to &quot;trow a bottle at the sea&quot; hoping some of you might be interested in helping in any way possible to carry this project to it's full potential.


Thank you for your support, without your help this project couldn't still exist.

Oh sorry! I'm the one who asked for the ICD-11, I did not know it would be so complicated! I tried to read the doc to find a way to lookup from the code. I've found the following bits of info:
* The URI system is made on purpose and unlikely to change, because it's a way for them to assign a permanent ID that will never change in future versions of ICD. The URI is the endpoint of the ICD-11. Thus, it's unlikely the URI is calculated from anything, be it the disease name or code, it's likely a random number assigned permanently: &quot;Each ICD11 entity has an exclusive identity linked to a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) and back-end web services to provide easy access to up-to-date ICD content. Links to external terminologies can also be facilitated using the URIs. The URI remains attached to a single entity, regardless of any subsequent updates.&quot;[https://icd.who.int/docs/ICD-11%20Implementation%20or%20Transition%20Guide_v105.pdf]
* There is a way to lookup the URI from a code, but it necessitates creating a OAUTH account to use the API[https://id.who.int/swagger/index.html]. Example for obesity: t|http://id.who.int/icd/release/11/2019-04/mms/codeinfo/5B81
* In the Browser &gt; Info &gt; Spreadsheet file, there is a list of all URIs and their associated code, so this can be used for lookup without the API.
* In the Browser &gt; Info &gt; ICD-10 / ICD-11 mapping Tables, there are tsv files mapping the ICD-10 codes to ICD-11 codes and URIs, so it should be possible with a bot to automatically update all WP entries with a ICD-10 to also include the respective ICD-11 code and URI.
Given all of these infos, it seems the intended use of ICD-11 is through URIs, so in fact we should maybe include the URIs too and not only rely on the codes? --ser:Signimu|Signimu (ser talk:Signimu|talk) 17:22, 23 October 2019 (UTC)

For now can we just provide both the code and the URI? ser:RexxS basically want something that takes:
CD11|149403041|5B81

Were the second number is what is displaced and the first number is used within the url below

WD has a property for ICD-11 codes: [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P7329 P7329]. Is it worth (me) proposing a property to cover the URI side? This would allow l|medical resources to call the URI for the external link, but use the P7329 property to display the code. Does anyone more familiar with WD, see any issues with having to rely on calling two properties? ser:Little pob|Little pob (ser talk:Little pob|talk) 12:23, 25 October 2019 (UTC)
 I've tweaked the code a little, so that it can still be used without the link, for use in bot runs, etc, until the link is known. Storing the connection between the ICD-11 code and the linkID (i.e. the number at the end of the url) on Wikidata is an attractive idea. In the meantime, I might simply compile a lookup table that does the mapping and use it until we get a full import into Wikidata. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 13:16, 25 October 2019 (UTC)

I realised that |Signimu had found a spreadsheet that defines the mappings from ICD-11 codes to the linkID, which is exactly what we needed. After a bit of manipulation, I transformed that into a table in a Lua module, odule:ICD11. There are over 32,000 items to look up, and I'm not sure what impact it may have on performance, so treat this as provisional for now. Anyway you can now just use the ICD-11 code like this:
* CD11|5B81 → CD11|5B81
* CD11 | 5B81  → CD11 | 5B81 
I've programmed it so that spaces don't matter in this case. Entering an invalid code just links to the &quot;Not found&quot; page on the ICD-11 website, so you can search from there:
* CD11|ABCD → CD11|ABCD
If we get complaints that the mapping from ICD-11 code to linkID is copyright, then we can still use the manual method of supplying both parameters as a fallback position. Any thoughts? --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 15:35, 25 October 2019 (UTC)
 Awesome! Thank you all very much, that's working very well! About the copyright, when reading the doc it seems pretty clear reusage by third-parties for linkage purposes is intended and encouraged, but if clarification is deemed necessary, contacting them to ask them to add an open license to the mappings will probably fix the issue ) --ser:Signimu|Signimu (ser talk:Signimu|talk) 02:09, 26 October 2019 (UTC)

 Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis

 It's probably spam, but there may be truth in it. The real problem is that [https://www.theexpresswire.com/ The Express Wire], a non-notable paid aggregator of press releases is about as far away from a P:RS|reliable source as one could get. I've flagged it as such in the article. It doesn't appear anywhere else in the encyclopedia, thankfully, so if anybody agrees with me, please remove it all from the article and hope that an independent reliable source can be found for the info in the future. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 14:40, 23 October 2019 (UTC)
The reliability of a press release depends upon its publisher, not upon its aggregator.  If Market Reports World is reliable for statements about business, then we can use l|cite press release to format the link.  
Also, because the press release comes from Market Reports World, which is not part of ynthon BV, it's already an ikipedia:Independent source about whether Synthon BV is the largest manufacturer of this drug.  And because we're talking about a report that analyzes the subject matter, it's secondary, too.  It's a perfect example of the fact that P:Secondary does not mean good.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:12, 23 October 2019 (UTC)
The problem is that we do not know if this report says Synthon BV is the largest manufacturer as the report is 3000 USD. ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk · pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 16:37, 23 October 2019 (UTC)
Oh, that claim's not directly in the press release.  P:PAYWALL is the official policy for the report, and we are generally quite callous about complaints that the ikipedia:Reliable sources/Cost of a source is too high.  But the theory behind the paywall rule is that, although &quot;I&quot; might not be willing or able to get that source, if necessary, at least one other editor will be able get a copy of the source. 
It might be possible to work around this by changing the content to provide similar but not identical business information, e.g., &quot;The following companies are licensed to manufacture it&quot; (sourced to something else) instead of &quot;The biggest one is...&quot; ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:15, 24 October 2019 (UTC)
 e|WhatamIdoing q|The reliability of a press release depends upon its publisher, not upon its aggregator No, it doesn't. The reliability of a source depends on factors like &quot;a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy&quot;, independence, and editorial process. Of course, press releases fail every single one of them, and that goes double for the practices of fly-by-night aggregators who charge a company to publish their press release. The Express Wire is a cast-iron example of everything that goes into making an unreliable source, and we shouldn't be making excuses for them. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 18:18, 24 October 2019 (UTC)
Press release aggregators are not publishers.  They're distributors.
If we said that the reputation of the aggregator matters, then we would be saying that a press release posted by a company on their corporate website had a different reliability than exactly the same words posted by the same company on the aggregator's website.  This does not seem reasonable.  Surely exactly the same words, written by exactly the same people, and made available to the public at the direction of exactly the same people, will have exactly the same reliability in Wikipedia terms.
If, on the other hand, we decide that the distribution method is key, then we would also be saying that a wire service news story was reliable when it was reprinted by a newspaper, but not when exactly the same story was copied by someone to an internet forum.  This does not seem reasonable to me. 
Press releases are self-published, non-independent sources.  They are reliable for relatively little, and they are desirable for even less.  But I can't agree that the reliability of a corporate press release depends upon where editors find it.  (This particular press release can be found in more than one place.)  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 19:05, 24 October 2019 (UTC)

 The entity that publishes content on the internet is the publisher, by definition. To call them &quot;distributors&quot; is to try to make a distinction without a difference. Press release aggregators are publishers.
 Of course the reputation of the publisher matters, Our theory of P:RS|reliable sources is based on it. Do you really think that [http://www.metropolis2.co.uk/demo/rex.htm this] would not be considered reliable if it were published by the ashington Post, rather than by [http://www.metropolis2.co.uk/ a PR and marketing agency in Birmingham]?
 It is perfectly reasonable to put some trust in an established publisher that has a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy, especially if they have a process of editorial oversight that shows they take due diligence when reporting facts that they have gleaned from elsewhere. Surely &quot;exactly the same words, written by exactly the same people, and made available to the public at the direction of exactly the same people&quot; will have completely different reliabilities ascribed when they are published in the Lancet from when they are published by Lulu.
 We have not decided that any factor is key to the extent that it can be generalised. Nevertheless, if the ew York Times picks up a wire story and does its expected due diligence in checking the story before publishing it, then a Wikipedia editor could have far more confidence in the reliability of that source than they could possibly have in the story displayed on an internet forum. Quality newspapers would no longer exist if they added no value to the stories that they publish.
 I completely agree with your assessment of the reliability of press releases as non-independent, self-published sources. However, if a company (or their PR agency) release the news that they have won &quot;the biggest ever contract to supply widgets to Turkmenistan&quot;, we would naturally take that with a pinch of salt. but if the story subsequently turned up in the inancial Times, I have little doubt that it would be considered reliable enough for inclusion in a relevant Wikipedia article. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 01:20, 25 October 2019 (UTC)
I've seen disputes that claim exactly the opposite:  If a fact in a newspaper article matches something in a contemporary press release, then some editors yell hurnalism and claim that neither the article nor the press release is reliable (or reliable enough&quot;). 
(Your example involving Lancet doesn't match the pattern:  That's exactly the same words, written by exactly the same people, but made available to the public at the direction of an independent group of people [i.e., Lancet's staff].  Also, nobody fact-checks wire service articles.  The point of subscribing to them is that you're paying the wire service to do the fact-checking for you.)  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 13:28, 28 October 2019 (UTC)
 No matter how many times a claim is made, it doesn't become fact. Having editors yell doesn't make it a fact either. Sure, if some two-bit tabloid or pop magazine reproduces a press release, we don't trust it. But that's a massive difference from the same facts being published in a quality newspaper with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy. That's because the publishing process adds a layer to the original source, and we put our trust in quality publishers.
 It seems we have different understanding of &quot;at the direction of&quot;. You could just as well say that the aggregator is &quot;an independent group of people&quot;, i.e. the aggregator's staff. You know as well as I do that we trust what the Lancet publishes by default, but when a company is paying an aggregator to publish its press releases, (my idea of what &quot;at the direction of&quot; means) then we're never going to consider that a reliable source.
 As for q|&quot;nobody fact-checks wire service articles&quot;, I simply don't believe you. The quality publishers have too much reputation at stake for them not to be checking stories before they publish. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 14:54, 28 October 2019 (UTC)
I think you're assuming that editors are always approaching sources with a genuine desire to figure out reality, rather than a desire to have the &quot;right&quot; POVs in the article. 
Wire service stories are fact-checked by the wire service (Reuters has some [http://jobs.thomsonreuters.com/ShowJob/Id/371716/Desk-Editor/ relevant job openings], and not by the newspapers that run the stories.  It wouldn't make much sense for Reuters to pay someone to fact-check stories, and then for each of their thousands of paying media customers to pay even more money to separately fact-check the stories all over again. (Also, I don't think you could, as people who were quoted would stop answering the phone and start resolving to never speak to any wire service staff ever again.  Can you imagine how annoying it would be, to have hundreds of newspapers contact you to re-verify the same quote?)
I still don't see the logic in saying that the reliability for these two actions is different:
* I write a press release, and I hire a PR person to post it on my corporate website.
* I write a press release, and I pay a business to post it on their website.
The utility in those two cases should be equally low.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 00:31, 29 October 2019 (UTC)

 Are descriptions of metabolic pathways forbidden on medical articles? 

Hello, sorry to bother again, but I have rewritten the &quot;Mechanism&quot; part of the ntermittent fasting entry to include all observed metabolic pathways changes induced by intermittent fasting in humans and referenced solely with reviews, systematic reviews and meta-analyses[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intermittent_fasting&amp;diff=923444806&amp;oldid=923407549]. One such review is this one, published in a journal with an impact factor &gt; 10[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31116995]. |Zefr reverted with comment &quot;speculation based on primary research; unencyclopedic&quot;[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intermittent_fasting&amp;diff=923444806&amp;oldid=923407549].

Yes, but I reworked to not be mainly about the hypotheses, but the pathways, which is arguably more pertinent and puts the hypotheses in context.

 Medieval Medicine 

Hello!

I have recently made a Wikipedia account and created a page for homas Morstede, an English surgeon who served Henry IV, Henry V and Henry VI. He was particularly important throughout all of their reigns and has been described by many scholars such as Theodore Beck as 'not only the most eminent English surgeon of the fifteenth century but also the most financially minded and socially successful'. It would mean a lot if you could have a look at my page for Thomas Morstede and let me know what you think, any feedback is welcome!

I also wanted to come on the talk page to discuss medieval medicine on Wikipedia in general. I have found it personally to be rather played down. There are the larger pages (page length and number of contributions) on epidemics such as the Black Death from 1347-1351, but individual practitioners have been for the most part, not written about. I found it most concerning in pages which write about the many battles in late medieval England, surgeons are excluded as being part of the Campaign. An example for this is he Battle of Agincourt page where prior to my edit, it reported that Henry took with him an army of 12,000 and up to 20,000 horses. But the page did not mention the team of surgeons and makers of surgical instruments who also accompanied Henry.

Do you agree that medieval medicine has a gap within Wikipedia and Why is this so? I was also just curious to know what motivates you to edit Wikipedia and what does being part of the Wikiproject Medicine mean to you?

Thank you for reading and I am very excited to be a part of the project!

Possibly a bit out of scope for Wikiproject Medicine, but definitely an encyclopedic topic. Wikipedia articles tend to be written by people with an interest in the specific topic, so we have lots of gaps in things like medieval medicine, and plenty of articles on footballers. I find medieval medicine more interesting than footballers myself, but I focus on underwater diving and marine conservation. Welcome to the gaps, and have fun filling them. There are still plenty to go around. Cheers, · · · ser:Pbsouthwood|Peter Southwood ser talk:Pbsouthwood|(talk): 14:59, 30 October 2019 (UTC)
Welcome to Wikipedia, ser:ChocolateOrange1|ChocolateOrange1.  I think that the main reason that we don't happen to have these articles is because nobody thought about writing them.  Now that you're here, I hope you'll be able to fix that.  This is an interdisciplinary subject, so you can get help and meet interested people here, at ikipedia:WikiProject Military history, and maybe ikipedia:WikiProject Biography.  I'm looking forward to hearing what you do next.  Good luck,  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:26, 30 October 2019 (UTC)
Welcome, and nice work on the article! Thanks for contributing to this under-represented topic area.  As far as feedback goes, the only major issue I can see is that some paragraphs don't have a citation at the end. Ideally you should cite a source for every paragraph even if the same source is used in the following paragraphs (see P:INTEGRITY). If you want to get more views and feedback on your article, consider nominating it for the P:DYK|Did you know section on the main page. (The rules say that articles should be no more than a week old, but they'll probably be willing to waive that requirement since this is your first article). Again, great work and I hope to see more articles about medieval physicians soon. :) ser:SpicyMilkBoy|SpicyMilkBoy (ser talk:SpicyMilkBoy|talk) 23:07, 30 October 2019 (UTC)
Thanks for contributing to this underdeveloped side of Wikipedia! Medieval sciences are often underdeveloped because understudied, there is simply not as many experts (funding goes to &quot;hard&quot; sciences...) or people interested into it compared to other domains, and that's a shame because we miss on a lot of great developments that were born during these times, which contributes to the inaccurate widespread view of Medieval times as a &quot;dark age&quot;. So thank you again for taking up this task and I'll be happy to provide help (although History isn't my forté )). --ser:Signimu|Signimu (ser talk:Signimu|talk) 03:20, 31 October 2019 (UTC)
Thank you all so much for your responses ser:Pbsouthwood|Peter Southwood, ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing, ser:SpicyMilkBoy|SpicyMilkBoy and ser:Signimu|Signimu. I have seen your help in tidying up my Thomas Morstede article and really appreciate it. Also just thought I would let you know I think I have nominated my article for the Did you Know section on the main page now- took me a little while as I am still quite new. I find all your opinions about the gap of medieval medicine/ individual practitioners very interesting. I did have a worry that by writing the article in the first place I was inflicting a point of view that I thought it should exist! Which goes against the Wiki rules. I will let you know of any other articles I either create or improve on as I go along! ser:ChocolateOrange1|ChocolateOrange1 (ser talk:ChocolateOrange1|talk) 17:49, 31 October 2019 (UTC)

With this sort of &quot;perennial&quot; content, we usually find that it's effective to acknowledge the myth/errors/similar problems directly (whenever we can source it, of course).  When a less experienced person doesn't see an interesting story present, then it's easy to assume that it's just an simple oversight, and that adding it would be a helpful thing to do.  But when the story is mentioned and rejected (&quot;There's a common misconception that...&quot;), we see much less pressure on the articles.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 12:50, 1 November 2019 (UTC)

 Is this source usable? 

Hello ) I'm wondering if this source is usable: [https://bpac.org.nz/2019/weight-loss.aspx]. Their about page[https://bpac.org.nz/about.aspx]. Anybody heard of them (the Best Practice Advocacy Centre New Zealand (bpacnz))? They use sound sources that could be used instead, but this one provides a nice overview with the slightly added value that it synthetized some disparate infos that WP editors could hardly do per P:SYNTH. So can it be used or should I just use its references directly? Thanks in advance D --ser:Signimu|Signimu (ser talk:Signimu|talk) 04:59, 1 November 2019 (UTC)

 Minimal residual disease 

Hi, I was looking at the minimal residual disease page and it read a little oddly so I checked it using the Earwig copyvio check thingy (results here - https://tools.wmflabs.org/copyvios/?lang=en&amp;project=wikipedia&amp;title=Minimal+residual+disease&amp;oldid=&amp;action=search&amp;use_engine=1&amp;use_links=1&amp;turnitin=0).  I can't think of a way of telling whether the slideshare talk used bits of wikipedia or vice versa.  Can anyone think of a way of telling, and are there any templates that need to be put on the article.  I know the wiki way is to be bold and change but it looks like it would be a lot of work and I have no time before Christmas to do anything major.  ser:Redfiona99|Red Fiona (ser talk:Redfiona99|talk) 23:06, 31 October 2019 (UTC)
Slides were published Apr 18, 2017 account to [https://www.slideshare.net/appyakshay/minimal-residual-disease the slideshare] site, while the earlier [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Minimal_residual_disease&amp;oldid=766844194 February 2017 Minimal residual disease] page shows the matching text. This suggest, as usual, that the slides liberally borrow from Wikipedia.

 MEDRS sourcing required for non-biomedical information 

On irtuin[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sirtuin&amp;diff=924062926&amp;oldid=924060935] and irtuin 1[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sirtuin_1&amp;diff=924064508&amp;oldid=918617012], some paragraphs and sources were deleted or rewritten by |Zefr based on MEDRS, or adding l|medref. I don't think they are biomedical claims and thus should not be under MEDRS, and that here we are deleting pertinent content. He doesn't agree[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sirtuin#Please%20don't%20apply%20MEDRS%20blindly]. I don't want to pursue this discussion further to avoid any mingling with an ongoing request between us, so I'll leave it up to anybody else who might be interested in retaining molecular biology content. --ser:Signimu|Signimu (ser talk:Signimu|talk) 17:45, 1 November 2019 (UTC)

I can see why there would be uncertainty here as this is getting into a grey area, but I would say this is not covered by MEDRS. There is no treatment proposed or discussed; it doesn't meet the criteria described at P:MEDRS. This is just science. ser:Bondegezou|Bondegezou (ser talk:Bondegezou|talk) 18:44, 1 November 2019 (UTC)

I can't necessarily comment more generally, but another example for comparison might be the ikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Serpin/archive1|FA review of Serpin. In that case, any section that made human medical claims was considered covered by MEDRS, but not sections on e.g. function in mice or genetic association studies. ser:Evolution and evolvability|T.Shafee(Evo&amp;Evo)ser talk:Evolution and evolvability|talk 23:12, 2 November 2019 (UTC)

Very interesting, thank you. It's a sensible thing to separate human and animal content in different sections, although I can't see if this is a requirement in MEDRS. For the case at hand, here's the Sirtuin entry before the other editor's intervention[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sirtuin&amp;oldid=923959452], there was no Ageing section, the content was in DNA repair section and clearly about animals, the editor renamed the section to Ageing, introduced a MEDRS ref about Resveratrol (so not even directly related to Sirtuin) and removed all animals refs. Following your example, it would have made more sense to just create another separate section about human health claims. --ser:Signimu|Signimu (ser talk:Signimu|talk) 02:25, 3 November 2019 (UTC)

 Very large tables of human genes 

I have a technical problem that I mentioned at T:MCB#Problematic links in the wikitables pertaining to ikipedia:WikiProject Molecular Biology/Molecular and Cell Biology/Human protein-coding genes1 and ikipedia:WikiProject Molecular Biology/Molecular and Cell Biology/Human protein-coding genes2|Human protein-coding genes2, which I am considering moving to the article space.  I was wondering if anyone else had a simpler solution than the one I proposed (i.e., building a custom tool and parsing the content of thousands of gene articles).

Also, I realize that the content in those tables is only marginally related to this WikiProject. I'm just posting this here because it's a fairly large/active WikiProject and I'm looking for an alternative solution to more technical problem that I described in that thread; specifically, I'm looking for one that might only take seconds to minutes to implement and act on (e.g., something analogous to the dablinks tool, which I can use to quickly fix the first problem I mentioned about DAB links in the table) as opposed to what will likely take hours of processing time if I were to build the tool I proposed (I expect that to only take like 15 minutes for me to program though). ser:Seppi333|Seppi333 (ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert 2¢) 01:41, 5 November 2019 (UTC)
