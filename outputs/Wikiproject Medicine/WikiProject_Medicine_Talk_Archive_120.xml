 Discouraging see also sections 

The MEDMOS says &quot;See also: Avoid the See also section when possible; prefer wikilinks in the main article and navigation templates at the end.&quot; Can someone explain why this is? ser:Natureium|Natureium (ser talk:Natureium|talk) 15:33, 4 January 2019 (UTC)
There is a general prejudice against SA sections, which tend to get cluttered up with either links that are already in the main text, or things that are barely relevant. If it's that relevant, say so (and why) in the text. A bare link is usually not very informative.  Some people oppose any SA links at FAC, which I think is a bit draconian myself. ser:Johnbod|Johnbod (ser talk:Johnbod|talk) 20:42, 4 January 2019 (UTC)
 In addition to Johnbod's good points, MEDMOS prefers conveying information with good context. A list of bare links has little of that, but P:SEEALSO does encourage annotations of links if they are not obvious. What might be a more acceptable alternative is to create a &quot;related topics&quot; section that embeds the links in prose that gives context. --{{u|ser:Mark viking|Mark viking}} {ser talk:Mark viking|Talk} 21:12, 4 January 2019 (UTC)

I think that MEDMOS's advice might need to change.  If memory serves, the general thinking was that redundant links were often bad, and long lists were usually bad, and that the use of navboxes was rising.  (Yes, it's actually that old.)  But now we've got another situation, namely that navboxes are invisible for more than half of our readers.  
As a first thought on the Related topics section, it sounds like a prose version of See also with decent descriptions (which ought to be more widely used), and it might be hard to shoehorn in all the links into sensible prose.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 19:05, 6 January 2019 (UTC)

Harrison's 2015 unreliable?

 Expression of Mouse Interleukin-4 by a Recombinant Ectromelia Virus Suppresses Cytolytic Lymphocyte Responses and Overcomes Genetic Resistance to Mousepox 

Greetings, wanted to ask for comments on something that might be worthy of its own article.

I did just read [https://jvi.asm.org/content/75/3/1205.short this publication] and it is a pretty straightforward and unremarkable laboratory experiment.

However, [https://scholar.google.ch/scholar?cites=8247223163115606540&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=0,5&amp;hl=de some of the sources citing it mention it as an example of how dangerous pathogens may be accidentally created in laboratories]. I wonder if one could write an article on this topic (say ccidental creation of dangerous pathogens or something more specific such as nterleukin-4 transduced ectromelia virus experiment) or whether there is a more general topic on accidentally engineered biohazards. Thoughts? ser:Jo-Jo Eumerus|Jo-Jo Eumerus (ser talk:Jo-Jo Eumerus|talk, pecial:CentralAuth/Jo-Jo Eumerus|contributions) 20:43, 7 January 2019 (UTC)

 Engineering a virus to express an anti-inflammatory cytokine to suppress the immune response sounds extremely dangerous.  There is a section of an article (lobal_catastrophic_risk#Biotechnology) that already cites the above mouse pox source. Perhaps that section could be expanded.  An article on nterleukin-4 transduced ectromelia virus experiment seems a bit too specialized and narrow. ser:Boghog|Boghog (ser talk:Boghog|talk) 21:20, 7 January 2019 (UTC)

The ocial media addiction article needs attention from editors well-versed in MEDRS.

 Summarizing new articles from ADA on low carb diet page 
ile:Kale-Bundle.jpg|thumb|alt=A bundle of curly kale leaves.|90 px|Vegetables/low in carbohydrate.
I am having an issue with updating the ow-carbohydrate diet#Diabetes entry.

Recently the ADA released the &quot;2018 consensus report on Type 2 Diabetes by the merican Diabetes Association (ADA) and the uropean Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD)&quot; ite journal| author=Davies MJ, D'Alessio DA, Fradkin J, Kernan WN, Mathieu C, Mingrone G et al.| title=Management of Hyperglycemia in Type 2 Diabetes, 2018.

These two documents mark a sea-change in ADA policy toward low carb diet. It is now included as an option for Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT), which is recommended by the ADA. 

What's happening is that any attempt to accurately summarize these articles as they relate to LC diets is being instantly reverted or edited in very biased and slanted manner. The editor I am having this disagreement with suggested I request help here.

Here is the talk page: alk:Low-carbohydrate diet

Thank you, ser:CarbShark|CarbShark (ser talk:CarbShark|talk) 04:28, 22 December 2018 (UTC)

Let me just say I admire the fact you are trying to update this article. But unfortunately I think you are taking out of context what is in these sources, I could be wrong about this but the user you talk about is an experienced editor and warned you about this [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Low-carbohydrate_diet&amp;diff=874289657&amp;oldid=874289416]. I think the best thing to do would get the opinion of e|Doc James. ser:MatthewManchester1994|MatthewManchester1994 (ser talk:MatthewManchester1994|talk) 22:25, 18 December 2018 (UTC)

So I had a look at these references and this is interesting:

uotebox|Studies have demonstrated that a variety of eating plans, varying in macronutrient composition, can be used effectively and safely in the short term (1–2 years) to achieve weight loss in people with diabetes. This includes structured low-calorie meal plans that include meal replacements (72–74) and the Mediterranean eating pattern (75) as well as low-carbohydrate meal plans (62). However, no single approach has been proven to be consistently superior (76,77), and more data are needed to identify and validate those meal plans that are optimal with respect to long-term outcomes as well as patient acceptability.

(my bold). Can you explain how this fits your claim that there is &quot;a sea-change in ADA policy toward low carb diet&quot;? I am not seeing any long-term health benefits from this diet in relation to diabetes, and the ADA contrary to what you claim on the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Low-carbohydrate_diet#Lifestyle_Management:_Standards_of_Medical_Care_in_Diabetes_2019 talk-page] is not specifically recommending this diet. ser:MatthewManchester1994|MatthewManchester1994 (ser talk:MatthewManchester1994|talk) 22:37, 18 December 2018 (UTC)


Yes, certainly. First it is a sea-change in that prior to this release the ADA has regarded Low Carb diets as dangerous and promoted a low fat diet for years. In this paper, while they have not completely reversed course and recommended LC diets above all others (which I never claimed) they included low carb diets in the discussion of Medical Nutritional Therapy. And excluded the low fat diet. 

In the section on diet where they make their recommendations they recommend diets or eating patterns that meet a set criteria. Then in the descriptions of those diets they indicate that LC diets (and others) meet the criteria they established. They added caveats for LC diets (which IMO are not justified, that's just me) and those should be mentioned in the article. 

Do you agree that the edits and reverts following my summaries of these two papers were biased against LC diets?

I don't believe I'm being unreasonable nor am I insisting that it has to be my version. If there is an issue (for example, I didn't distinguish between T1 and T2 diabetes in part) then that can be collaboratively edited to correct that issue, rather than entirely discard the edit or replace it with something far more biased in the other direction. ser:CarbShark|CarbShark (ser talk:CarbShark|talk) 22:53, 18 December 2018 (UTC)

You are correct the user is an experienced editor, and yes, he has warned me. He suggested I bring this issue up here to get someone with medical expertise and fresh eyes to look at the page.

This is a truly major change for that organization, and we need to revise some articles in response.  I think it will be important to present the information in context (e.g., &quot;one of several acceptable diet plans&quot;, without implying that it's the best option or the only recommended option), but it should be added.  The magnitude of the change for that org can be dealt with at the article about that org.  Articles on Type 2 diabetes and low-carb diets need, at minimum, to be revised to remove any mention of their opposition, and some of them should probably be revised to say that the ADA accepts them.  (Also:  Note that their acceptance of low-carb diets in general is not the same thing as them supporting every single low-carb or no-carb diet that's ever been devised.)  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 02:11, 20 December 2018 (UTC)
That is reasonable. The ADA recommends MNT, and lists criteria for MNT eating plans, and then says LC diets (and other diets) meet those criteria. But, yes, they do not specifically say they &quot;recommend low carb diets.&quot; It should also be mentioned that they have caveats for LC diets that they do not for other diets (although in my opinion those caveats also apply). It should also be pointed out the ADA indicates LC diets have shown the potential to reduce the need for medications for T2 diabetics, which they do not indicate for other diets.

Your opinion is that the ADA Standard of Care carries more weight, but in fact, that's not a judgement for Wikipedia editors to make about article text (it may be a judgement to make in deciding which sources to include, but that's a different issue). Find an independent reliable source that says it carries more weight and the point can be made in the article, sourced to that independent source. Otherwise, I'm afraid that it's necessary to follow P:NPOV and neutrally report what was stated by ADAnd after all, the citation will link to the the ADA Standard of Care, so we wouldn't be hiding anything from the reader, just treating the source in the same way that we would any other. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 10:43, 22 December 2018 (UTC)
ser:RexxS|RexxS it is clear and obvious that the ASA Standard of Care carries more weight than a random editorial published by the ADA. This follows from P:MEDRS where we are required to &quot;summarize scientific consensus&quot; and regard &quot; practice guidelines issued by major professional medical or scientific societies&quot; as being some of the very very best sources for WP. Have a look at [http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/42/Supplement_1/S1 Introduction: Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes—2019]. It is hard to read that without thinking that this represents a gold standard of sourcing and a body whose opinions and recommendations are justified by quoting with direct in-article attribution. I have always found that the documents produced by consensus conferences or by these sorts of practice guidelines, which grade the evidence and clearly annotate their recommendations with the power of evidence behind them, to be excellent resources. Our articles should use them as foundation blocks. The claim you make &quot;Find an independent reliable source that says it carries more weight&quot; is misunderstanding of P:WEIGHT, a false hurdle, and making an opponent jump through hoops that no editor here would be expected to have to jump through.
P:WEIGHT doesn't require an explicit reliable source saying &quot;ADA Standards of Care carries weight&quot;. Weight is a concept we care about, but like fame or power, many quality sources simply assume the reader knows this, rather than feel the need to mention it. Indeed you will probably find more sources explicitly praising charlatans than praising experts. Instead, WEIGHT is actually something determined by Wikipedians who are familiar with the quality sources on the article topic. Wikipedians are the ones that should know if ADA Standards of Care is widely cited in the literature and is considered authoritative -- they will know this by reading that literature and being familiar with the topic. Now, for such a huge disease as diabetes, it is not hard to find coverage explicitly and implicitly stating how important the ASA Standards of Care are. But I'm more concerned that your argument might be applied by some to rarer diseases or treatments. On such subjects, such consensus conference documents or clinical guidelines reports, are often worth quoting or paraphrasing and in-text attributing, because they really are what neurologists, etc use when deciding how to care for a patient or what drugs are recommended, when and how often to perform MRI scans, etc. They are far, far more important than some random review or a random article by a professional body, which often by definition are just the views of a few authors. It would be simply impossible to find a source explicitly praising such a guideline for a rare disease, except perhaps on a charity website, which may not be regarded as a great source. Some common sense required and acceptance that there are some editorial decisions that Wikipedians must make for themselves. We have ability to recognise an authority that speaks for medical scientific consensus and indicate that to our readers. Should, and only should, there be a disagreement in reliable sources about whether this authority is respected or represents consensus, then we consider further evidence necessary. -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 12:32, 22 December 2018 (UTC)
 |Colin, you've failed to read what I wrote, and have not grasped what is required for us to write neutral text. You may think it &quot;clear and obvious&quot; that a particular statement caries more weight than another, but that's just your judgement, and the moment we allow editors to impose their judgements on the text of an article, we give the POV-pushers free rein to spin articles to their purpose.
 You have completely failed to understand the difference between the process of deciding which sources are the highest quality and most important to include in an article, which is the subject of P:WEIGHT, and what is needed to write text based on what the sources say, rather than an editor's interpretation of them, which is the subject of P:OR.
 WP:OR couldn't be clearer: q|&quot;all material added to articles must be attributable to a reliable, published source&quot; and if I challenge text that explicitly draws attention to the weight due to ADA Standards of Care, then I expect the source that drew that conclusion to be produced, not some vague hand-waving about q|&quot;Wikipedians are the ones that should know if ADA Standards of Care is widely cited in the literature and is considered authoritative.&quot; The job of Wikipedia editors in that area is to evaluate what sources to use, not to impose their own interpretations on the article text.
 So it is nonsense to put forward the straw-man that q|P:WEIGHT doesn't require an explicit reliable source saying &quot;ADA Standards of Care carries weight&quot;. Nobody is asking for an third-party source to establish whether a particular source is good enough to use. But once you start writing text that contains the implication that 'ADA Standards of Care' carries more weight than another statement, you're going to have to back that up with external sourcing.
 It does no favours to our articles to have experienced editors like yourself giving new editors a green light to write text that pushes their own POV, rather than sticking to what can be neutrally summarised from the best sources. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 13:07, 22 December 2018 (UTC)
ser:RexxS|RexxS, could you take your helmet and battle fatigues off for a minute and and just go read P:WEIGHT and re-read exactly what you wrote. I'm not really interested in having an argument with someone who has done neither. Arguments about he said, no you said, no you said, no he said, are beyond tedious, and a waste of my time. I suspect you are making general claims (which I'm arguing against), while in your head think you are making specific claims about some specific point you disagree on and are engaged in a righteous battle for TRUTH against all who may destroy Wikipedia (which I could not care less about, frankly). In order to argue your specific point, you are making claims that are wrong and misleading. I have seen before editors make arguments that may just about get away with on a huge topic like diabetes or cancer, but prove inconvenient to the point of paralysis when working on minor subjects.
P:WEIGHT is about the weight of statements, opinions, viewpoints, etc in article text. But you now claim that deciding sources to include in an article is the subject of WEIGHT. It isn't. That's the job of P:V and parts of P:MEDRS. NPOV says &quot;All encyclopedic content on Wikipedia must be written from a neutral point of view (NPOV), which means representing fairly, proportionately, and, as far as possible, without editorial bias, all of the significant views that have been published by reliable sources on a topic.&quot; The job of deciding those POV to include and the weight/proportion to give them in articles is completely down to Wikipedians - that's why we are called editors. We make those choices by being familiar with the quality literature on a topic and a deep understanding of the article subject. We are guided in making those choices by policies/guidelines.
We in-text attribute viewpoints and recommendations of consensus committees or standards bodies or professional bodies all the time. Whether that's the DSM for psychiatry articles at one end of the scale, or the 'Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Diagnostic Criteria Update: Recommendations of the &quot;2012 International Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Consensus Conference&quot;' at the other end of the scale. The specific point/opinion that you are fighting some battle about isn't my concern here. I don't want to have to face some editor who knows nothing about Tuberous Sclerosis Complex or the literature, demand that I find an independent source that those consensus conference recommendations carry weight (or tediously, that each and any recommendation is explicitly sourced to another independent source verifying its weight) -- because frankly the &quot;2012 International Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Consensus Group&quot; who developed it and is composed of &quot;79 specialists from 14 countries, was organized into 12 subcommittees&quot; probably includes most of the specialists publishing in that field. So I'd be hard pressed to find someone &quot;independent&quot; who wasn't perhaps some maverick. This is my concern. The decision about what to include in various articles is down to Wikipedians who are familiar with the reliable professional literature and article subject. It isn't a simple job that can be done by a drive-by editor who is neither, and considers other editors to be opponents. I am not giving any editors green lights. -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 15:07, 22 December 2018 (UTC)
 Give it a rest, |Colin. it's blatantly obvious that you're talking nonsense yet again. P:WEIGHT is about whether to include viewpoints in articles or not, and the extent to which they are covered, as you'd know if you had bothered to read the policy. It's really ridiculous to pretend that it encourages editors to use their own opinions to ascribe importance to one source over another. It simply doesn't. The only criterion for giving prominence to one viewpoint over anothernd and note that applies to viewpoints, not sources, as you mistakenly believend is the extent that they feature in published, reliable sources. There is no article on Wikipedia where it is appropriate for an editor to decide that source A deserves more prominence than source B simply on their own say-so. You really are getting tendentious in your efforts to promote that sort of spin.
 We've all seen POV-pushers attributing views that they disagree with, rather than stating uncontested views as factual in Wikipedia's voice. The POV-pushers know that by attributing, they imply the possibility that there may be unstated disagreement among other equally valid sources. In this particular case, a new editor who is unaware of P:ASF thinks that a source titled &quot;Standard of Care&quot; will carry more weight with the reader, and attempts to attribute the conclusions of that source in the belief that it gives their own views more weight. The solution in every case is to apply our normal standards: uncontested statements are simply presented in Wikipedia's voice; and differing statements are attributed as the respective source's opinion.
 If you could just get your head around the difference between inclusion of a viewpoint (WEIGHT) and attempting to elevate the significance of a particular source on no other grounds than you think it's more important (OR), we wouldn't have to waste our time refuting straw-man arguments that you insist on producing. When it comes to cases like the 'Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Diagnostic Criteria Update: Recommendations of the &quot;2012 International Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Consensus Conference&quot;', it's quite right to argue that their conclusions should be included in a relevant article (WEIGHT). But when you start summarising those conclusions into the article in such a way that you imply they are more important than differing ones found in some other high quality reliable source, solely because of your opinion of the source's importance, then you're going to find your opinion is quite rightly challenged, and others will ask for independent proof. Your insistence that you know better than other editors makes you an enabler of every POV-pusher on the wiki, who will immediately take the same line in order to promote their pet theories. That's the green light you're giving to them all. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 18:11, 22 December 2018 (UTC)
I would really appreciate if you could argue without all the personal abuse and complete misrepresentation of what I wrote. As I said, I have no wish to spend my evening arguing over what I said vs what you claim I said, or over what you said, vs what you claim you said, particularly when each response only exponentially increases the misrepresentation and misunderstandings. I do wonder if you could perhaps view WP as less of a battleground, and other editors (myself included) as not just opponents to be insulted and swatted at with WP: links. Could you perhaps find a way to reach agreement with others rather than seeking to topple them? My views are far from minority let alone tendentious, but actually reflect those editors who know how to write articles, whole articles, and who approach editing by immersing themselves in the literature of an article subject, and gaining a comprehensive grasp of the topic.
Btw, there is much research into low carb diets for diabetes, with dozens of papers on the subject this year, and this is an area where guidelines are in flux and likely to change. A Wikipedian interested in article building, rather than fighting editors with insults, would find much to write about. The best way to ensure a topic is covered properly on Wikipedia is to write a comprehensive and accessible article with great sources. If one is only interested in preventing crappy edits to a crappy article, one fines oneself fighting and reverting rather than being able to say, for example: we already cover that point, better, and with better sources. The LCD diet article is incomplete and crappy, and editors fighting each other at it will only ensure it remains incomplete and crappy. -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 18:37, 22 December 2018 (UTC)

The ADA were recommending low-carb diets for weight loss back in 2008.[http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/31/Supplement_1/S61.full] Has their position really changed that much? ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 03:42, 24 December 2018 (UTC)
Yes it has ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn. Weight loss and T2D are two different things. There is a lot of academic research on &quot;TOFI&quot; (thin outside fat inside) who are thin people and have T2D, so weight loss is not needed at all. There is also a lot of literature on very obese who have no T2D and are metabolically healthy. Weight loss and T2D have never ever meant the same thing.
The fact that the ADA specifically suggests that the LC is now recommended for a particular population, specifically for T2D, is a huge change. Additional points of interest (quotes from 5. Lifestyle, same session as discussed above--I bolded new stuff): 
&quot;5.12 Carbohydrate intake should emphasize nutrient-dense carbohydrate sources that are high in fiber, including vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains, as well as dairy products.
5.15 People with diabetes and those at risk are advised to avoid sugar-sweetened beverages (including fruit juices) in order to control glycemia and weight and reduce their risk for cardiovascular disease and fatty liver and should minimize the consumption of foods with added sugar that have the capacity to displace healthier, more nutrient-dense food choices...&quot; (note that this is the first time they suggest that carbs have anything to do with cardiovascular disease)
Under Carbohydrates section: &quot;...monitoring carbohydrate intake and considering the blood glucose response to dietary carbohydrate are key for improving postprandial glucose control... For people with type 2 diabetes or prediabetes, low-carbohydrate eating plans show potential to improve glycemia and lipid outcomes for up to 1 year...both children and adults with diabetes are encouraged to minimize intake of refined carbohydrates and added sugars and instead focus on carbohydrates from vegetables, legumes, fruits, dairy (milk and yogurt), and whole grains. The consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (including fruit juices) and processed “low-fat” or “nonfat” food products with high amounts of refined grains and added sugars is strongly discouraged...&quot; and under Nonnutritive Sweeteners section: &quot;...some research suggests an association with weight gain...&quot;
I would say these changes are more than enough to update the LC page to reflect some of the changes. The new guidelines recommend low carbs diet, goes to great details on reducing carbohydrates fr glycemic control, specifically discusses refined carbs, starches and fruit juices. They should be incorporated as the 2019 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes by the ADA recommends the LC diet short term. ser:Astanton|Astanton (ser talk:Astanton|talk) 23:08, 2 January 2019 (UTC)Astanton
I don't think it would be accurate to say the ADA are making a &quot;recommendation&quot; for low-carb diets. They do countenance it as an option, but say &quot;no single approach has been proven to be consistently superior&quot;. They make the point that the kind of carbohydrate in a diet should be wholesome, and highly-refined/sugary stuff avoided - but that's not really &quot;low-carb&quot; so much as &quot;right-carb&quot; dieting. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 06:20, 3 January 2019 (UTC)

Best not to make &quot;judgment&quot; over what the ADA &quot;may think&quot; when they clearly write in the new manual what &quot;it is that they are recommending&quot;. That is what is in the 20119 reference guideline for diabetes care. Perhaps you should read it before criticizing based on your beliefs. It is in section 5, under &quot;Eating Patterns, Macronutrient Distribution, and Meal Planning&quot; look at the sentence attached to citations 62-64. It is as clear as it gets--and they are citing the very article I wanted to cite originally. This is a secondary source. From what I understand, Wikipedia regulations recommend the use of secondary or review citations. The ADA 2019 dietary guidelines are both. note: they are dietary guidelines for diabetes care and are low carbs. They meet the definition of Wikipedia in every respect.

Wrt P:ASF, it is not clear cut, black and white, what is an opinion and what is a fact. The decision to include specific types of diet in a management nutrition therapy is based on opinion. That it is included in ADA's choices of MNT is a fact. That's ADA's report looked at various diets and discussed their efficacy is a fact. That one diet is better than another is an opinion. The efficacy, safety, cost-effectiveness and relative attractiveness (first-line, second-line, etc) are all opinions -- were the trials large/good enough? What is the cost to society/health-service vs treatment (likely varies from country to country). What is the cost of a therapy (e.g. hiring dietitian support, paying for drugs). An &quot;indication for&quot; is just a medical opinion, though if it appears to be universally held, we may not bother with direct attribution and merely state it as a fact in Wikipedia's voice. Sometimes, though, it helps or is necessary to indicate that it is only &quot;indicated&quot;/recommended in some countries or by some bodies or some authors. That's why familiarity with the literature is needed.

Please note that this is the International English version of Wikipedia, read by people globally, so the convenience/popularity of a diet in Western English-speaking countries doesn't necessarily translate to other countries that have different eating patters or even religious restrictions on eating (something noted in the Ketogentic diet article). A quick search finds two examples: &quot;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30441982 the low carbohydrate diet is not recognized in Czech diabetology]&quot;; &quot;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30104491 All the three randomized controlled trials showed better glucose management with the carbohydrate restricted diet (vs energy restricted). Our study revealed that there is very little evidence on diets, particularly in Japanese patients with diabetes, and that the energy restricted diet, which has been recommended by the Japan Diabetes Society in the sole dietary management approach, is not supported by any scientific evidence.]&quot;.

I am a bit concerned that the ow-carbohydrate diet article currently says [the ADA report] &quot; found that a low-carbohydrate diet was not as good as a Mediterranean diet at improving glycemic control&quot; [my bold]. I have looked at [http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/42/Supplement_1/S46 this report] and cannot find any direct comparison between the two diets. Could someone point this out to me?

A look at [https://www.bmj.com/content/361/bmj.k2234.long this BMJ article] suggests to me we should make more use of it in the article, which currently only uses it to highlight the difficulty of how to classify &quot;what is a low carbohydrate diet&quot; (again, another opinion). The paper notes that there's no one low carb diet -- they vary in quality and approach to what fats to include. Its key message says there is controversy over whether to prefer a LCD for type 2 diabetes, but that &quot;there are calls to review this in light of emerging evidence on the potential benefits of low carbohydrate diets for weight management and glycaemic control&quot;. There are likely more guidelines and reviews that should be considered, not just the ADA. As P:WEIGHT guides, a deep understanding how of we, as editors and writers, should include and what proportion to include, comes from familiarity with the body of literature on the topic. It does not come from finding or arguing over just one source or just one other source. -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 09:30, 23 December 2018 (UTC)

I happened to look at ow-fat diet and what I found was alarming.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Low-fat_diet&amp;oldid=872907093] This is further evidence of how diet nonsense has spilled into our content. The page was emblazoned with a warning that &quot;Recent research has not supported the efficacy of low fat diets in lowering cholesterol and weight&quot; and the second sentence informed readers that low-fat diets &quot;have been shown&quot; to cause obesity (with misrepresented source as a supporting citation).

 rythropoiesis and eticulocytopenia 

Dear medical experts:
I was reading the article rythropoiesis, and when I came to the part about vitamin deficiency I clicked on the link to the article eticulocytopenia.  According to the first article, vitamin deficiency can lead to Reticulocytopenia, but the second article doesn't mention this, instead discussing only scarier causes. I was just being nosy, but if someone whose doctor has actually told them they have this health problem reads the article it might worry them needlessly. Should the Reticulocytopenia article included a sentence or two about vitamins, and if so, can someone who can express it clearly and can find an appropriate reference please make this change?
Thanks.—ser:Anne Delong|Anne Delong (ser talk:Anne Delong|talk) 16:20, 8 January 2019 (UTC)

Thank ser:Anne Delong|you for the interesting question.  I took a quick look, and I think that these are actually different.  AFIACT with a quick look, the term (which ought to mean &quot;not many new RBCs for any reason at all&quot; according to its name) is actually used specifically to mean &quot;sudden stop in RBCs production due to infection with arvovirus B19&quot;.

I'll take a look at the articles in question when I get a chance, but aplastic crisis is not specific for parvo B19 infection, and can also describe a halt in RBC production associated with ickle cell anemia and other conditions. Similarly, &quot;reticulocytopenia&quot; (relative reduction in RBC production) is descriptive rather than specific to a cause. — ser:soupvector|soupvector (ser_talk:soupvector|talk) 22:53, 9 January 2019 (UTC)

 What are 'primary sources' and why are they unacceptable? 

I've noticed that 'primary sources' are being frowned upon. I'm trying to write a stub of erebral folate deficiency. As far as I understand, the majority of research into cases of CFD (allegedly) caused by antibodies to the folate receptor has been carried out (and was pioneered) by a group led by Ramaekers et al. Would the inclusion of their papers as references be incorrect? Do I need instead rely on reviews written by other scientists? --ser:CopperKettle|CopperKettle 13:06, 7 January 2019 (UTC)

For this situation, I think the key sentence in MEDRS is going to be t|&quot;These instructions are appropriate for actively researched areas with many primary sources and several reviews and may need to be relaxed in areas where little progress is being made or where few reviews are published.&quot;  
MEDRS has a blind spot for rare diseases.  P:N declares something with just a few journal articles to be worthy of a separate article, but a strict reading of MEDRS won't let you put anything in that article.  So keep in mind that while primary sources are generally discouraged, they're not outright prohibited.  MEDRS is written so that a new editor can find out what to do when updating an article like ypercholesterolemia.  It is not written to help you find out how to update culodentodigital dysplasia (which has ~100 patients worldwide, which is five times as many known cases as CFD).  If you're working with a rare disease, please get as close to the ideal as you can – but you also need to write an encyclopedia article with the sources that actually exist, and we need to back off and let you do that.  Blanking apparently accurate and sourced information &quot;per MEDRS&quot; in such a situation harms the project.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:38, 7 January 2019 (UTC)
Remember also that &quot;secondary source&quot; is not the same thing as &quot;MEDRS compliant&quot;. There are a lot of people who use &quot;primary source&quot; as &quot;not MEDRS source&quot; among many other incorrect interpretations, too, so be careful what they are actually referring to. ser:Jo-Jo Eumerus|Jo-Jo Eumerus (ser talk:Jo-Jo Eumerus|talk, pecial:CentralAuth/Jo-Jo Eumerus|contributions) 17:47, 7 January 2019 (UTC)
An excellent and important point, Jo-Jo.  If something like en's Health (British magazine) were to run an article telling readers how to decide if they should discuss CFD with their doctors, it would be ikipedia:NOTGOODSOURCE|secondary, ikipedia:Identifying and using independent sources|independent, and completely unusable for any medical claims whatsoever.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:59, 7 January 2019 (UTC)
Thank you for all the explanations! The problem with CFD is that in some studies (autism, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27523499 depression], even [https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1096719214003114 schizophrenia]) a sizeable proportion of treatment-refractory patients have been found to meet the &quot;low CSF 5MTHF\anti-FRa antibodies&quot; criterion for CFD, which might make it much more common, if confirmed. However, as the history of psychiatric research tells us, this may turn out a dud. I'll look for secondary sources on that count then - but here again, what if a review is written by the same Ramaekers who pioneered the majority of studies? Will [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23314536 such a review] be acceptable per MEDR? Less controversially, CFD has been reported in mitochondrial diseases, especially in the earns–Sayre syndrome, which alone increases its prevalence beyond 20 persons/world. --ser:CopperKettle|CopperKettle 18:50, 7 January 2019 (UTC)

This looks like a reference work by emos Medical Publishing, which should be reliable for most purposes.  A book written by a physician specifically patients can be a weaker source (unless you're writing patient-centered content, in which case it may be stronger than an academic paper).

 Adding an educational video on 3 rare diseases 

I tried adding an educational video link on creatine deficiencies (a group of three rare diseases) to the pages relevant with the reference and everything. I am told I cannot add the same video to multiple pages because it is considered spam. The video covers the symptoms, signs, and diagnostic of all three diseases. These diseases are massively under diagnosed and most of the times it takes years until families find a doctor that knows what they are so the video reference is very important for families and for medical professionals.  

From my perspective it seems to make sense then to have the video linked in the independent conditions (rginine:glycine amidinotransferase|AGAT, uanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency|GAMT, reatine transporter defect|CTD) and the main erebral creatine deficiency|creatine deficiency article. I had added it to the main creatine page under the creatine deficiency section and I can see how that might be too much to list it there. What about the rests?

I am the parent of child with one of the rare diseases so yes I do want this information to be available to other parents like myself who looked on wikipedia when they got a diagnostic.

To address ser:Natureium point, there's the umbrella diseases called creating deficiencies, the three rare diseases it represents, and the three genes + creatine itself.

Is the video too much there? Regardless of the answer, perhaps we can then get some help to improve the gene pages (like LC6A8) for creatine deficiencies too to be more complete and include information for pathology and function?

I have watched the video. It follows the TV documentary approach of having several parent's vignettes about their sick children, and several talking heads of doctors who presumably are specialists in this condition giving some information about it. It concludes with a short advocacy section encouraging the adoption of testing babies around birth to identify those affected. I don't think it counts as a reliable source. Btw the master and child articles are:
*erebral creatine deficiency
*reatine transporter defect
*rginine:glycine amidinotransferase deficiency
*uanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency 
The master article (and the above discussion) wrongly links to rginine:glycine amidinotransferase which has a sub-section on the deficiency that arguably could be trimmed to be a short summary and link to the deficiency article. The three child articles seem quite well developed, if a bit technical and non-parent-friendly. The merit of including the external link seems lowish, perhaps for the master article at present while it remains stubby. If there is anything the doctors mention that isn't in the article, I don't think it would take someone long (with access to sources) to remedy that. If there is comprehensive information created by a charity, I'd rather link to that bit of the website, than directly to you YouTube video. Less likely to go stale too. -- ser:Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 11:44, 9 January 2019 (UTC)
ser:Colin Are gene articles supposed to have links on the pathology?  I see pages that do and one of my points above is that we can perhaps try to bring the three creatine deficiency genes to the same standards. Do you agree? ser:Auract|Auract (ser talk:Auract|talk) 14:47, 9 January 2019 (UTC)
I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;gene articles&quot; here. Did you mean rginine:glycine amidinotransferase, which is on the enzyme? There isn't a problem discussing some aspects of deficiency in that article, but really the rginine:glycine amidinotransferase deficiency article is where to go into detail. Wrt the video, I'd have to watch again but I don't recall video being a vital component of showing signs and symptoms in real children -- some children featured but to be honest they could have any number of conditions, which I guess is why it was hard to diagnose. Wikipedia is a text-based encyclopaedia at heart, so we really want to explain all these things in text. Pictures of visible things like MRI scans or physical visible symptoms can be useful if appropriate. A short video clip of a feature of the disease, such as a seizure, can be useful. But while I agree &quot;different individuals digest information in different ways&quot; the way you're going to get information from Wikipedia is mainly by text.

I very clearly stated I did not view the video and was therefore taking no position on if it was appropriate (I did not comment on &quot;relevant&quot;). Based on those who have commented on the content, I now oppose linking in P:EL or similar, but obviously no objection to someone using the content to find P:RS for writing article content. ser:DMacks|DMacks (ser talk:DMacks|talk) 23:25, 11 January 2019 (UTC)
I don't think it is right to take a stance one way or the other on a specific video that you haven't watched.  I think it is appropriate and relevant to the three specific disease pages and the overall CCD article.  My personal plan for the year is to get those articles to GA status, due to increasing interest as GAMT deficiency starts being included in routine ewborn screening around the world.  Since Wikipedia is usually the first google hit, we are providing a service by having the encyclopedia be accurate and up to date.  However, given that the video is also accurate and up to date, providing the opportunity for likely worried families to absorb the information in a different media seems appropriate.  I'm open to holding off on adding the video until the pages have been further expanded, so it doesn't appear to have undue weight on articles which are right now somewhat short.  ser:Canada Hky|Canada Hky (ser talk:Canada Hky|talk) 15:31, 12 January 2019 (UTC)
ser:Canada Hky|Canada Hky, the relevant policy for whether to include the video is P:EL. I think if you get those articles to GA status (comprehensive, well sourced, etc) then the video will as a consequence clearly fail WP:EL. That's my opinion and others may disagree. I think there is a stronger argument for the video while it contains relevant information an article lacks. Sorry, but there are specific rules about links from WP and they go beyond being &quot;educational&quot; and meeting preferences of people who like videos vs text, etc. There is simply too much of the internet that could be linked to, and we have Google and relevant charities/health bodies who can do that job. DMacks was clearly originally only commenting on the text that appeared on the article alongside the link, but I agree that I don't think he should &quot;vote&quot; oppose the link based on secondhand comments (even if mine). -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 10:57, 13 January 2019 (UTC)
Agree to disagree.  I see nothing on the External Links policy that would forbid the video in question.  ser:Canada Hky|Canada Hky (ser talk:Canada Hky|talk) 13:54, 14 January 2019 (UTC)
ser:Canada Hky|Canada Hky, I believe ser:Colin|he meant that (in his opinion), the video &quot;merely repeat[s] information that is already or should be in the article&quot;, which according to P:ELNO#EL1 is exactly the kind of link that isn't normally wanted. 
If I may make a more procedural (and optional) suggestion, at this point, it might be more appropriate to continue these conversations on the article talk pages with anyone who is interested enough to watch those pages, or to take it to the ikipedia:External links/Noticeboard if normal talk-page discussions aren't able to resolve the question. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 14:17, 14 January 2019 (UTC)
ser:Auract|Auract, I'm glad you are keen to work on improving the articles, and hope you can work with Canada Hky on that. I would like to be in a position to help you but my circumstances make it hard/unfair for me to promise you anything. I have very limited free time for article work, already have a commitment to work on uberous sclerosis, and don't have direct access to the medical research/review papers and books you will need. I suggest that this section has got bogged down discussing the video and you'd be better starting a new section on article improvement. You could start by reading the main and related articles on these conditions, and noting down issues you find on the article talk pages. For example, if there is information missing, note that what is missing. You can mention stuff on the talk page without having to find WP:MEDRS sources -- then someone can help with that bit. And if you think the text is too hard for a parent to read (which is the &quot;general reader&quot; Wikipedia is aimed at) then mention that too and make suggestions. Keep doing that as you get braver to edit the article itself. If there are disagreements, discuss on the talk page rather than reverting. As for searching for sources and getting access to papers from journals, there's a whole WP:Medicine project here who can help. Books are harder, as I know professional books can be very expensive, but if you or someone here has access to a university or medical library, then they might be able to help with specific requests. So, I think you should start with the article talk pages and then create a new section here to request help from WP:MED members to help with the improvements you seek. Btw, Auract, if you put something on your user page, it will no longer be a &quot;red link&quot; and you may find that gets a better response -- it make it look like you are here to stay. No need to reveal any personal stuff, just perhaps your interests on WP. -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 10:57, 13 January 2019 (UTC)

 Does erebral folate deficiency merit a separate article? 

I've read several dozen research articles and reviews on erebral folate deficiency. I'm thinking of starting a separate article with that name. Do you think it's worth it, or is it better to add first a section in olate deficiency? ---ser:CopperKettle|CopperKettle 06:03, 6 January 2019 (UTC)
P.S. I've read the olate deficiency article and I'm now certain that Cerebral folate deficiency should have a separate page. I quote: &quot;Cerebral folate deficiency (CFD) may be defined as any neurological syndrome associated with a low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5MTHF) in the presence of normal peripheral folate metabolism (Ramaekers and Blau 2004).&quot; --- Hence it's better not to muddle the issue by heaping them together. --ser:CopperKettle|CopperKettle 13:32, 6 January 2019 (UTC)

*I think not - those authors seem to be alone in their assertion of this as a separate entity. Perhaps FWIW (not a MEDRS) [https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200508183530721 this exchange of letters in the NEJM regarding primary vs secondary]. It appears that the deficiency described by the Ramaekers and Blau responds to folinic acid supplementation. Absent secondary MEDRS from other authors, I would add some material to the existing olate deficiency article. — ser:soupvector|soupvector (ser_talk:soupvector|talk) 14:44, 6 January 2019 (UTC)
*But there are other authors. When I started reading about the syndrome, I started two MS Word documents, in one of which were only articles by Ramaekers et al., in the other, papers published by other groups.

I've also been doing further reading and have amended my earlier objection. This quotation embedded in the text of a systematic review may be helpful (and possibly support a separate article, though I think it's better incorporated into the current one): q|5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) is an essential cofactor for methylation reactions in the brain and other organs via S-adenosylmethionine. It participates, for example, in the catabolism of dopamine to its final metabolite HVA. Cerebral folate deficiency (defined as low CSF 5-MTHF values with normal blood folate status) has been described as associated with different neurogenetic and environmental conditions (Pérez-Dueñas et al. 2011) and specifically to some mitochondrial disorders (Garcia-Cazorla et al. 2008a).ite journal|last1=Batllori|first1=Marta|last2=Molero-Luis|first2=Marta|last3=Ormazabal|first3=Aida|last4=Montero|first4=Raquel|last5=Sierra|first5=Cristina|last6=Ribes|first6=Antonia|last7=Montoya|first7=Julio|last8=Ruiz-Pesini|first8=Eduardo|last9=O'Callaghan|first9=Mar|date=2018-07-04|title=Cerebrospinal fluid monoamines, pterins, and folate in patients with mitochondrial diseases: systematic review and hospital experience|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29974349|journal=Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease|volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=1147–1158 |doi=10.1007/s10545-018-0224-x|issn=1573-2665|pmid=29974349|s2cid=49684709 ite journal|last1=Pérez-Dueñas|first1=Belén|last2=Ormazábal|first2=Aida|last3=Toma|first3=Claudio|last4=Torrico|first4=Barbara|last5=Cormand|first5=Bru|last6=Serrano|first6=Mercedes|last7=Sierra|first7=Cristina|last8=De Grandis|first8=Elisa|last9=Marfa|first9=Merce Pineda|date=2011|title=Cerebral folate deficiency syndromes in childhood: clinical, analytical, and etiologic aspects|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21555636|journal=Archives of Neurology|volume=68|issue=5|pages=615–621|doi=10.1001/archneurol.2011.80|issn=1538-3687|pmid=21555636ite journal|last1=Garcia-Cazorla|first1=Angels|last2=Duarte|first2=Sofia|last3=Serrano|first3=Mercedes|last4=Nascimento|first4=Andres|last5=Ormazabal|first5=Aida|last6=Carrilho|first6=Ines|last7=Briones|first7=Paz|last8=Montoya|first8=Julio|last9=Garesse|first9=Rafael|date=2008|title=Mitochondrial diseases mimicking neurotransmitter defects|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18558519|journal=Mitochondrion|volume=8|issue=3|pages=273–278|doi=10.1016/j.mito.2008.05.001|issn=1567-7249|pmid=18558519
Note that peripheral blood folate levels can be challenging to interpret - I encounter this often in clinical practice and teaching - because they fluctuate significantly with changes in dietary intake and often don't represent tissue levels. RBC folate measurement can be more useful if done carefully, but has specific demands for sample handling and analysis that may be challenging in settings where these issues often arise. Our current olate deficiency article could benefit from expansion on this topic. Here's a relevant quote: q|When combined with a clinical picture of megaloblastic anemia and additional results of cobalamin levels, the serum folate concentration is the cheapest and most useful initial biochemical test to diagnose folate deficiency  (see Table 39.2 ). The serum folate level is highly sensitive to folate intake, and a single hospital meal may normalize it in a patient with true folate deficiency. Rapidly developing nutritional folate deficiency first leads to a decline in the serum folate level below normal (less than 2 ng/mL) in about 3 weeks; it is a sensitive indicator of negative folate balance.  However, isolated reduction of serum folate level in the absence of megaloblastosis (i.e., false-positive result) occurs in one-third of hospitalized patients with anorexia, after acute alcohol consumption, during normal pregnancy, and in patients on anticonvulsants  ; unfortunately, these are the very groups at high risk for folate deficiency and the people who exhibit low serum folate levels when they become folate deficient.  Conversely, in 25% to 50% of cases (predominantly alcoholics) with folate-deficient megaloblastosis, the serum folate levels may be below normal or borderline (2 to 4 ng/mL).  The serum folate level alone should never dictate therapy. It is important to consider the clinical picture, peripheral smear, and bone marrow morphology and also to rule out underlying cobalamin deficiency.ite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1001961209|title=Hematology : basic principles and practice|others=Hoffman, Ronald, 1945-, Benz, Edward J., Jr.,, Silberstein, Leslie E.,, Heslop, Helen,, Weitz, Jeffrey I.,, Anastasi, John|isbn=9780323509398|edition=Seventh|location=Philadelphia, PA|oclc=1001961209|chapter=Megaloblastic anemias (chapter 39)|date=2018 
*Thank you for the links! I've read that cerebrospinal 5-MTHF levels can be also hard to interpret, because the normal range is a &quot;moving target&quot; - in one study the authors write that in normal persons the levels decrease with age, so they adopted several normal ranges for several different age groups. And 5-MTHF can variate with time in persons with anti-FOLR1 antibodies. I'll make a stubby version, and will try to read up later. --15:44, 6 January 2019 (UTC)
The article doesn't seem neutral with respect to mechanism, e.g. the sources I cited above note that: (i) serum folate levels aren't a reliable measure of total-body folate stores due to wild fluctuations, (ii) response to supplementation suggests that the purported block in transport is at most a relative block. The problem is pervasive in the article, starting with this sentence in the lede, q|The numerous causes of the syndrome disrupt folate transport via the choroid plexus.

 Might've wasted 30 minutes forming this small &quot;symptoms&quot; section... 

Hey. Sorry -- I'm relatively new to editing Wikipedia and I have a very huge interest in medicine. I saw est Nile virus and was eager to add a symptoms section to a seemingly under-developed article. Little did I know, there was a est Nile fever article, which contains an extremely thorough section explaining the symptoms of the WN Fever... 

Though I personally believe est_Nile_virus#Symptoms|my section on symptoms for the WNV shouldn't really be removed because it seems to be a simpler explanation of the symptoms (such as the prevention section on the WNV page) and the WNV page receives a lot more views than the WN Fever page (so, people wanting to find symptoms on the West Nile virus can easily fulfill their need by checking the symptom section I wrote).

But alas, I'm new to this whole &quot;Wikipedia-editing&quot; business, so, I'm asking the WikiProject Medicine community on this. Thanks for the comments. --ser:Atcovi|Atcovi ser talk:Atcovi|(Talk - pecial:Contributions/Atcovi|Contribs) 18:30, 15 January 2019 (UTC)

 The Global Burden of Disease is a massive database of diseases with epidemiological figures: Should it be on Wikipedia? 
ile:Emoji u2695.svg|thumb|70px
From the GDB website you can get an enormous set of data for diseases where you can get their prevalence, incidence, sex ratio, age distribution for almost all countries in the world.
You can have a visualization tool to get the scale of the project: https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-compare/

And best of all, all these data are under the Open Data Commons Attribution License (http://www.healthdata.org/about/terms-and-conditions).

In fact, most of these data are already inside Wikipedia, because links to this site are often found in the &quot;epidemiology&quot; section for a great number of disease pages on Wikipedia.
But I'm asking myself about a more complete use of these data. What about a massive table with all the prevalence for each country for example, with sex ratio? or one about incidence?

Thanks for your opinon about this! ser:Linuxo|Linuxo (ser talk:Linuxo|talk) 20:20, 4 January 2019 (UTC)

If you wanted to copy the database, or to come up with an automated way to extract specific bits of information from it for use, citing the GDB as the source, then you probably need to be talking to :|Wikidata.  (Why, oh, why don't they have a well-documented API?)

 I have met Peter Gøtzsche. He is a man of very deep principles and there is little doubt that he is morally outraged by what he sees as fraud in these studies. However, this has led him to form a point of view on the actual scientific question that  is well out of line with mainstream thought (it's a lot closer when he is talking about psychotropic drugs, by the way, where he is also courageously outspoken). Gøtzsche is given to... robust statements of his opinion. His statements on psychiatric drug trials and the effects of these drugs on patients speak of anger and disgust, which are not the usual currencies of scientific discourse. I can see why a body that guards a reputation for measured and dispassionate analysis would be likely to fall out with Gøtzsche. I do not think this will be a big deal for them in the long term, but then, I thought Trump would lose in 2016 and Britain would vote Remain.

The summary is one page, and the full response is 27 pages!  I agee with previous contributors: in 5 years we will probably look back at this as a 'storm in a teacup'; Cochrane sets out, and works to, pretty rigorous and open standards; Peter Gøtzsche is indeed impressive on a personal level, and is not afraid to speak truth to power, sometimes more passionately than most, and we can all be wrong about some things (I am not judging this particular statement, but making a general observation)! ser:Kitb|Kitb (ser talk:Kitb|talk) 18:10, 21 January 2019 (UTC)
In many situations the only RCTs are industry funded. When one does a review one needs to use what is avaliable.

Yes, I've looked at raft:Penile Reconstructive Surgery. 

I [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Flyer22_Reborn&amp;diff=879726325&amp;oldid=879725957 noted] on my talk page that, as we know, newer research can conflict with older research. It can also be incorrect. So this is where P:Due weight comes in. In cases where the anatomical research is in conflict or is inconsistent, we report both or all sides...unless the other side or one of the sides is too much of a minority view to mention. For example, we give different reports on the urogenital diaphragm in the rogenital diaphragm article because the literature is not consistent on it. We mention the dispute regarding the limbic system in the imbic system article. For penile articles, I am concerned that Orangelioncat will prioritize eng Long Hsu's and his colleagues' work over what the literature generally states. ser:Flyer22 Reborn|Flyer22 Reborn (ser talk:Flyer22 Reborn|talk) 00:41, 23 January 2019 (UTC)

 Orphan medical stubs 

Hello friends, once again I'm looking for help with some medical stubs that are also orphans. 

Can yocytolysis be merged somewhere, perhaps to yocardial infarction or yocyte? Or should it remain its own article? Like a lot of the medical stubs I've found, it feels like the kind of thing that would work better as a paragraph in a larger article that can give it more context.

In a similar vein, alleolar canal looks like a it could possibly be merged to lexor retinaculum of foot or alleolus. 

As always, I'm happy to do the legwork, I just like to be pointed in the proper direction. ♠ser:Premeditated Chaos|PMC♠ ser_talk:Premeditated Chaos|(talk) 05:59, 22 January 2019 (UTC)

 P:CLOP? 

I was approached by an ser_talk:Atcovi#Copying_licensed_material_requires_attribution|administrator on my talk page for apparently copying licensed material in lkhurma_virus#Epidemiology (the paragraph which describes Saudi Arabia's process to combatting the Alkhurma virus). This admin added an attribute statement, which I removed since I didn't copy word-from-word but rather I tried my best to put it into my own words. I asked the admin for her response/review, but no response was given. So, I'm going here to simply double check to make sure my section in this article is acceptable to WP guidelines and policies. I'd like to make it clear that I did my best to put it in my own words by changing the sentence structure and substituting a lot of words with synonyms.

Diannaa is an absolute expert on copyright matters.  If she says that you have a problem, then you may safely assume that you do.  
This kind of thing isn't easy for all of us, but one &quot;trick&quot; that might be helpful is starting with two or three sources, and combining them, rather than trying to re-arrange one.  This makes it easier to get out of the mindset of the one source and avoid close paraphrasing problems.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:45, 22 January 2019 (UTC)
