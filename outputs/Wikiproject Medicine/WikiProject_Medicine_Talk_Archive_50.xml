Hello WP:MEDICINE. This article (maybe not exclusively medical topic) needs expert attention. Thanks to anyone willing to check and verify. -- ( / ) 07:42, 14 June 2014 (UTC)
I very much get the feeling there is a separate term for this phenomnenon, which likely is a larger article. That this is a stub feels very unlikely to me, though this notice would be placed better under . -- [[User:CFCF|CFCF]] ( ·  · ) 02:58, 15 June 2014 (UTC)
A number of similar articles which could well do with a merge:
*Genetic heterogeneity

*Allelic heterogeneity

*Locus heterogeneity
Similar articles:
*Pleiotropy - only one that could be under 
*Homogeneity and heterogeneity (main article on non-medical term)

I suggest these articles be merged into a single larger article, possibly: Geneity (medicine) or Heterogeneity (Currently a redirect). -- [[User:CFCF|CFCF]] ( ·  · ) 03:07, 15 June 2014 (UTC)
Thanks for your help and suggestions, , I'll notify also . -- ( / ) 06:29, 15 June 2014 (UTC)
The first four are not encyclopedia articles on topics. They are . They should be converted to redirects, and their content grouped together (to make it easier to grasp the differences among them) in some genetics article. I suggest genetics, unless we already have some more specialised article on the relationships between genes, alleles and phenotypes. The fifth is a far more general topic, and the article seems fine to me – anyway, it is of no concern to this project.  () 08:44, 15 June 2014 (UTC)
If you do decide to group the first four together into an article, I suggest it should be called &quot;genetic heterogeneity&quot;, or &quot;heterogeneity (genetic)&quot;. There is nothing specifically medical about the terms.  () 08:57, 15 June 2014 (UTC)
As correctly explained at Genetic heterogeneity, &quot;pleiotropy&quot; has a very different meaning to the others, and should not be merged in.  Note that [http://mic.sgmjournals.org/content/148/2/345.full this] article, linked from Phenotypic heterogeneity, defines phenotypic heterogeneity in essentially the opposite way to our article.  Phenocopy is another somewhat related term. (•) 14:06, 15 June 2014 (UTC)

A phrase for &quot;Bad things in health care&quot;
After some discussion and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine/Archive_48#Is_anyone_from_this_project_watching_the_.22Iatrogenesis.22_article.3F some prodding] from  I think there is no word for &quot;bad things in health care&quot; so I made an article called  for every bad thing in health care. I derived the subsection titles that article from lists of problematic outcomes described in health care quality evaluations.

I thought that medical harm or iatrogenesis might mean &quot;bad things in health care&quot;, but I have come to see literature say that iatrogenesis is the same as medical error so I started a merge proposal at . &quot;Medical harm&quot; is not a term consistently used anywhere, but where it is used, it too means medical error, so  started a deletion discussion at .

There is definitely a concept called &quot;health care quality&quot; and a lot of culture and research about that concept. I think there are no terms for what health care quality tries to produce - good health care? - and now I just made up a phrase for what it tries to eliminate - . If anyone has better ideas for what terms should be used to describe the point of health care management then please share. [[User:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ]][[User talk:Bluerasberry|(talk)]] 17:02, 12 June 2014 (UTC)

Sometimes the best available treatment still carries unwanted but unavoidable harmful effects (or a risk thereof). Think necessary amputations, for instance, or radiation-induced nausea in cancer therapy. One would not normally call this error, yet it still is harm which one would seek to minimize. The distinction is useful, though I'm not sure about the best terminology.  [[User talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl!]] 17:55, 12 June 2014 (UTC)

On looking at Bluerasberry's &quot;Bad things in health care&quot; page I was surprised not to find a link to Harm (Medicine); then I saw the  All rather unfortunate, imo. There's actually a 2014 MeSH term for 'patient harm' [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/68064406]. 'Harm' is also a key concept in risk-benefit analysis. For example, my understanding is that there is no rationale to implement a screening (or treatment) programme unless the health benefits can be shown to outweigh the potential for harm, however inadvertent.  () 19:18, 12 June 2014 (UTC)
We have morbidity but that is slightly different. [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 00:30, 13 June 2014 (UTC)
Or adverse effect perhaps? At least, that's the measure used in the [http://www.books.google.co.uk/books?id=s7R-MLMyEgwC&amp;q=number+needed+to+harm+(nnh) Number needed to harm] entry in the Dictionary of Epidemiology (which doesn't contain a separate entry for 'harm'). In its broadest sense I think the term 'harm' may be extended to largely imponderable adverse effects of screening programmes such as anxiety and loss of sleep. (Fwiw, the new 'patient harm' MeSH term currently retrieves only 9 articles: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=patient+harm%5Bmh%5D http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=patient+harm[mh]]).

* Propose creating a redirect for Harm (medicine) to Adverse effects (in the plural).  () 13:02, 16 June 2014 (UTC)
Hello 86. What you say sounds reasonable to me but for the past few days, I have been unable to find any literature using this kind of terminology. Also I have gotten some pushback about including some things like expected side effects, medical debt, and societal discrimination against certain patients as anything to be related with the terms &quot;health&quot; or &quot;medicine&quot;. Also &quot;adverse effects&quot; is a term with a history of usage, and means something more nuanced as a technical term than just the literal meaning of the words &quot;adverse effect&quot; even though literally that is the meaning I want to convey. Thanks for the feedback and thanks for the link. It is helpful to know that &quot;patient harm&quot; is a MeSH, term, and that it is new, and that it is not being used much, and that it seems to not be used as a technical term in that literature to which you linked. [[User:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ]][[User talk:Bluerasberry|(talk)]] 13:43, 16 June 2014 (UTC)

Hello Blue Rasberry. ... While trying draft a nuanced response, I actually stumbled, via Google, on a page named redirect for &quot;Medical harm&quot; to &quot;Medical error&quot;, which I don't think is altogether appropriate. I now think Harm (medicine) should redirect there, and we should add a dab header to the more generic (and somewhat sketchy, imo) page called &quot;Harm&quot;.  () 15:50, 16 June 2014 (UTC)
Hello 86 - just earlier today, &quot;medical harm&quot; was its own article. It was just deleted at . The major argument for deletion was that no one had identified any source which defined the term &quot;medical harm&quot;, and that all sources used in that article were referring to &quot;medical error&quot;. While I agree that &quot;harm&quot; is a more general concept, Wikipedia is supposed to be a summary of what has already been published and not what people intuitively believe. If I found a source which used any word to mean all kinds of &quot;harm&quot; in medical contexts, then I might make an article on that concept or apply or combine the term with what I am calling &quot;&quot;. I have not found that term or any book or paper which combines the idea of &quot;medical error&quot; with intentional harms, like known side effects or anticipated and chosen harms which go with expected treatment. If the literature uses &quot;medical harm&quot; and &quot;harm&quot; seemingly exclusively to mean &quot;medical error&quot;, then Wikipedia guidelines recommend that Wikipedia also use the word in that way. For that reason, it is difficult to make the argument that the &quot;harm&quot; article should be used as you suggest. I initially also wanted to use that article in this way, and that is why I am trying to sort out the correct terminology for these things. I will put up DABs and all the other navigational aids when we are closer to consensus about correct terms. Right now also there is , if any, between iatrogenesis and medical error. [[User:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ]][[User talk:Bluerasberry|(talk)]] 16:56, 16 June 2014 (UTC)

Fwiw, this was the response I was drafting, before I stumbled on that redirect: A synonym for &quot;Bad things in health care&quot;? The standard term, as I understand it at least, is &quot;harm&quot;. See various, though not all, of the article titles [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=harm%5Bti%5D here] (eg [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24460532] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24368639] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23955467] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23581549] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=number+needed+to+harm%5Bti%5D] etc). Of course &quot;harm&quot; has other medical usages too, as in &quot;self-harm&quot;, which is a separate topic. Nevertheless, given the relevance of the term in the meaning you proposed I feel we should probably have a redirect available for Harm (medicine). Technically, I feel adverse effects would be appropriate, although the scope of the topic may be broader.   () 17:14, 16 June 2014 (UTC)
* Adding: I think the CONSORT extension on reporting of harms in RCT [http://www.consort-statement.org/Media/Default/Downloads/Extensions/CONSORT%20Extension%20for%20Harms.pdf] by itself demonstrates the notability of Harm (medicine). In their glossary, the CONSORT group defines &quot;harms&quot; as The totality of possible adverse consequences of an intervention or therapy...  () 18:06, 16 June 2014 (UTC)

External links in infobox

Issue: The  is a widely used template that contains various important links related to a particular disease to which the page belongs. DiseasesDB, ICD-9, ICD-10, MeSH, OMIM etc. are internationally accepted codes that are used to define the disease. On the contrary MedlinePlus, (proposed) patient.co.uk, (earlier) eMedicine etc. provide links to external sources  which might or might not contain data not included in the present Wikipedia article. Since the infobox is right at the top of the page, many people may click on these external links and leave without reading the Wikipedia article.
Proposal: I propose moving all such links into the  section and retaining only the defining codes within the infobox disease. Please sign to support or oppose the proposal or feel free to discuss the issue in greater detail. Please note that there have been multiple earlier discussions about splitting the Infobox.

# A generally good site may not be that good on a particular disease and therefore should not routinely be added to infoboxes (or to External links, of course).  Such sites need to be vetted in each case and, if good, be added to External links.  -- () 00:55, 17 June 2014 (UTC)

Oppose
Oppose I think the infobox links are a good feature seeing as they add relevant information for professionals and patients alike. ICD/OMIM etc. codes are very useful for a professional and may actually be a driving force for someone to come here, and having these at the bottom of the page defeats much of the purpose of the infobox. I would personally suggest a hidden-by-default section of the infobox with professional information instead, and an open-by-default section for patient information links. We have to think about what our goal is, and it is not to simply have all our content read but to bring the mass of medical knowledge to the world. To provide the best medical knowledge available we need to both link to other high quality sources as well as curate our own content. Default style links in the infobox ensure we link to sources that have been accepted and vetted by the mass of editors here at WP:MED. Having everything under an external links section makes it easy to add a poor source among high quality sources, and it makes it much harder for us to have oversight. -- [[User:CFCF|CFCF]] ( ·  · ) 06:05, 15 June 2014 (UTC)

Oppose Agree with CFCF's views. From usage I put a lot more trust in info box content than I do in 'external links' which very often contain a lot of dead links anyway.  Also I feel info at top of article is a lot more helpful.  () 14:46, 16 June 2014 (UTC)
*Oppose I think having pubmed or at least a couple of links in the infobox is a good idea. Pubmed is a simply overview of the disease. Usually much simpler than us. I would be supportive of adding DMOZ or a DMOZ like site and getting rid of the EL section most of the time.

Discuss
Following the [http://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content/ Eye-tracking pattern] of users, if a Wikipedia article is small i.e. belonging to the Stub or Start class, there might be a greater requirement of going to a suitable external link that might contain some valued resource, the page being short. But if a page is long, leaving an external link at the bottom and not above the fold automatically reduces the probability of it being actually visited unless the user is that desperate to read more. [[User:Diptanshu.D|Diptanshu]] 07:44, 14 June 2014 (UTC)

One of the main reasons that these were moved to the infobox back in the day is that putting the commonest ones in the infobox meant that we could frequently get rid of the
External links
section altogether, which in turn reduces the amount of spammy links that get added.  (If there's no existing section for it, then people don't add external links as often.)  I wonder if people think that risk has gotten better or worse in the intervening years.   () 18:23, 14 June 2014 (UTC)
External Links sections are a headache I must admit. I have no huge preference on this really otherwise.  ( · ) 21:38, 14 June 2014 (UTC)

I'd support linking to a readable, reliable article from the infobox (selected by the article's editors - not mandated by a template parameter) while our article is below  quality. Once an article has reached FA we should, per the , avoid providing external links to any site that provides no more than we would expect to find in an FA. -- ( ·  · )  03:24, 17 June 2014 (UTC)

FDA Issues Guidance on Pharmaceutical Company Correction of Misinformation on Social Websites

Interesting example from the guidance:

Example 11: A firm finds a webpage about its product that was written by an independent third party on an Internet-based, interactive, collaboratively edited encyclopedia. The firm may choose to contact the author of the webpage and provide corrective information to the author.

FDA recognizes that a firm cannot control whether an independent third party refuses to correct 288 the misinformation, or corrects only a portion of the misinformation even though the firm 289 provided complete corrective information, or declines to include the respective required labeling, 290 or declines to remove misinformation, or does not correct all the misinformation in one clearly 291 defined part (if the firm sought to correct more than one piece of misinformation). Accordingly, 292 FDA will not hold a firm accountable for an independent third party’s subsequent actions or lack 293 thereof.

Central theme of the guidance is that any corrective communication must contain corrections to both positive and negative misinformation, and may not be selective toward negative misinformation.  

When a firm voluntarily undertakes the correction of misinformation in a truthful and non-misleading manner pursuant to the recommendations in this draft guidance, FDA does not intend to object if these voluntary corrections do not satisfy otherwise applicable regulatory requirements, if any. If a firm chooses to provide information outside the scope of this draft guidance, the firm should ensure the information it provides complies with any applicable requirements related to labeling or advertising. Information considered to be outside the scope of this guidance includes information that does not meet criteria listed above. 

FDA does not expect firms to submit corrections to the Agency when correcting misinformation \pursuant to this draft guidance; however, FDA recommends that firms keep records to assist in \responding to questions that may come from the Agency. The records should include, for \example, the content of the misinformation, where it appeared, the date it appeared or was \located, the corrective information that was provided, and the date the corrective information \was provided.

The USFDA may now be maintaining files on Wikipedia.  Interesting thought.

Both of these are &quot;medical&quot; articles in the sense that people here are willing to support the articles.  They should therefore be tagged with  (on the talk page) as being within our scope.
Some parts of these articles are &quot;medical&quot; in the sense that they make statements about biomedical information.

Ayurveda

On Ayurveda. A view of charity is being over used and overrated.

And this same thing is added on the subsection on subsection but without any quotes, thus violating copyright. Previously, it was only on the subsection as &quot;According to Cancer Research UK, &quot;there is no scientific evidence that Ayurvedic medicine can treat or cure cancer any other disease.&quot; Because it is the view of only one &quot;Charity&quot;. Discussion has been opened there. To me this whole edit seems like a  and non-neutral POV, other 2 editors have objected too .  () 17:10, 20 June 2014 (UTC)
 This focusses on the use of the quote from CRUK. I've expanded the intro to the Efficacy section to give more of a flavour of what the CRUK statement says and eliminate the over-close paraphrasing. The CRUK source is MEDRS-compliant (&quot;position statements from nationally or internationally recognised expert bodies&quot;) and seems to represent the mainstream scientific view, so there cannot be any doubt that its inclusion is justified. In my humble opinion, the quote used in the lead is  and needs to be there so that the mainstream view is properly represented. Perhaps a few more eyes on the disagreement would be useful. -- () 19:49, 20 June 2014 (UTC)

I beleive that easy understanding is more important than brilliant prose. This requires us using short sentences and simpler words. The body of the text can be more written with more complicated language. We need to keep in mind our readers and that many of our readers do not speak English as a first language. Those who love and excel at complicated language usually have excellent access to high quality medical content / advice and do not need us anyway.
I guess this is why I do not write featured articles :-) [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 20:33, 17 June 2014 (UTC)
James a sentence with two short clauses is not complicated language.  ( · ) 21:21, 17 June 2014 (UTC)
 Not sure about all the differences, but I do agree with [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cervix&amp;diff=613239924&amp;oldid=613239568 this simplification and the accompanying edit summary]. Yes,  editorial context does matter. Imo, emphasis on the need for &quot;brilliant prose&quot; throughout FA could be contrary to Wikipedia's core values of providing reliable information that is freely available to everyone. Especially so in topics that may be of practical use in the real world to people who aren't native speakers of English. Per James's remarks above, it's hard enough to work up a  that is both technically correct and comprehensible to our , without being micromanaged into brilliance.  () 22:02, 17 June 2014 (UTC)
This is, with all respect, a stupid thing for two such wonderful editors as you (both of you) to get excited about.  Since it is purely a stylistic issue with no effect on the validity of the article, both of you should step back and allow other editors to choose which variant to use.  () 22:50, 17 June 2014 (UTC)
I agree that this one sentence is a minor issue as both versions are fairly simple. But the issue of simplification generally I view as exceedingly important, especially with respect to the lead. [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 23:06, 17 June 2014 (UTC)

I can't follow who's on which side of the argument, so if I offend either James or Cas Liber - sorry.  I'm a strong believer that the articles should be written in simple english with short sentences.  I've written articles that I thought were simple only to have my non-medical (university educated) friends tell me they are unreadable.  With respect to the opening sentence, the &quot;...and hence...&quot; is cumbersome in my opinion. My preference is for 2 sentences.  () 01:07, 18 June 2014 (UTC)
I was just about to say I think the &quot;hence&quot; is unnecessary.  Personally, I'd contextualise first, thus: &quot;In the female reproductive system, the cervix () or cervix uteri is the lower part of the uterus.&quot;  Just my 2c. (•) 01:30, 18 June 2014 (UTC)
Yeah I like that.  ( · ) 04:05, 18 June 2014 (UTC)
It may be better to think about the entire first paragraph, rather than just trying to rearrange this line as presented as the question here. I would start the introduction with an anatomical statement something like; &quot;The uterus consists of two parts; its lower tubular part is the called the cervix (cervix uteri) and its upper and broader part is called the body of the uterus (corpus uteri).&quot; I think that this first line will orientate readers about the anatomy especially as the cavity of the body of the uterus is included in the introduction after this.  There are many right ways of writing a clear line about the anatomy, not only my suggestion, including dividing my suggestion into three sentences. The fact about the cervix being part of the female reproductive system should be easy to write into the introduction elsewhere, and need not be part of an orientating line about the anatomy. Actually, it the cervix is a fascinating medical topic and I am sure that many WP Med editors would find it interesting, even if the peer review page is getting rather long.  () 06:45, 18 June 2014 (UTC)
I am of the opinion that the bolded text / topic of the article should usually begin the first sentence to key the reader that they are indeed on the right page. [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 07:53, 18 June 2014 (UTC)
What about: &quot;The cervix (cervix uteri) is the lower part of the uterus and the body of the uterus (corpus uteri) is the upper part of the uterus. A slight narrowing of the circumference of the uterus at the base of the cervix demarcates the junction of these two parts.&quot; Wordsmiths will be able to enhance this. Some extra referenced text would be needed in the article to support this. It is perhaps a little to soon to refine the introduction, at this juncture.  () 08:44, 18 June 2014 (UTC)

I couldn't care less, personally, about FA or GA. Though they matter, compared with accuracy, clarity and completeness, beauty of expression, punctuation, spelling and even the manual of style are utterly inconsequential. Neither GA nor FA is any guarantee of an article's accuracy or completeness. -- ( ·  · )  10:44, 19 June 2014 (UTC)

Nothing against discreet and judicious copyediting. Everyone likes clean and readable text (and James always invites people to feel free to fix his typos, etc). But surely there's always a delicate relation of respect between editor and writer? James's preference for simple but correct language in the lead is a reasoned editorial choice that is broadly in line with . And, fwiw, I think Casliber was right to bring the question here in a respectful way.  () 11:55, 19 June 2014 (UTC)
 - almost every single article I've taken to GAN or FAC has been improved in some way by the process (I think maybe one passed GAN without any suggestions). And the way they were improved was by  accuracy, clarity and completeness, beauty of expression, punctuation and spelling.  ( · ) 13:44, 19 June 2014 (UTC)
I could have phrased that better. My only GA was vastly improved by the process. But if the process is toxic, and it can sometimes be toxic at both FA and GA, then I think having a distinct process that just focusses on an article's accuracy and completeness - involving genuine subject-matter experts - may be a useful one for those who feel they are (or actually are) being bullied and harassed over beauty of prose, MOS and other less-critical elements of quality. -- ( ·  · )  13:54, 19 June 2014 (UTC)

GA I've found far too random, as it's all down to one reviewer (normally), and the criteria are interpreted very variably. FA is super-nitpicky, and often concentrates on MOS &amp; tidiness as the reviewers don't have specialized knowledge. Of course some suggestions need resisting, but I would say the article is always improved by the process.  One can always withdraw.  It's important that those who do have expertise post reviews, if only to say the content is ok (or not).  There's an unfortunate tendency, now I think growing, for nominators to insist on all the examples of a general problem being produced by the reviewers, which should be resisted.  The former management used to resist this effectively.   () 09:36, 23 June 2014 (UTC)

Nurse anesthetist

I believe this article should have its name changed to Nurse anesthetist (United States) because of the lack of worldwide view of the subject. A separate article on this would be notable and have sufficient information to have independent from a Nurse anesthetist (if it was made). What do you Wikipedians think?
 () 01:10, 23 June 2014 (UTC)

I am leaving

There is a toxic atmosphere on WP in which bullying and name-calling are accepted and sanctioned in the name of factual integrity. I have seen too many times instances where editors are willing to disagree instead of compromise, and very few instances where editors themselves intercede when arguments become too heated. In order to defend myself at any instance I am expected to master the hundreds of guidelines and guideline subsections and trawl through hundreds of diffs. WP is biased towards users who have developed relationships outside of article space, including on WPocracy, email, or by meeting in person. These methods circumvent the principles of openness and collaboration and make it hard for users such as myself who just want to 'get by'. WP has an atmosphere built around confrontation and the only groups this suit are young and middle-aged white men. I don't want to be part of this culture, and I certainly wouldn't recommend anybody I know participating on Wikipedia.

As James says, &quot;It is unfortunate that one needs such a thick skin to edit Wikipedia.&quot; I think WMF needs to take a strong lead in viewing Wikipedia as a real, if in many ways unusual, work environment. Many of the processes can feel like booby traps. Irrespective of innate skin type and all our many contingent life factors, everyone who commits energies here is ultimately vulnerable on an individual level.  () 08:07, 17 June 2014 (UTC)
The thing is that we are a self governing project. The WMF has little authority over the community. [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 10:36, 17 June 2014 (UTC)
I realise that and also realise that the WMF is aware of the issues. I believe our self-governing community needs, collectively, to get the message that occupational health (in the broadest sense of the term) needs to be a priority here. Not easy... But prevention can be more than just cuddly cats and cookies. One thing I feel the WMF might try is to encourage academic OH research groups and peer-review journals to take an interest and [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=occupational+health[mh]+OR+work+environment[mh]+AND+wikipedia start out on independent study] of Wikipedia as an online volunteer work environment.  () 11:05, 17 June 2014 (UTC)
I don't really know anything about it myself, but I've heard that the Dutch Wikipedia made this kind of a cultural change a few years back,  I believe it involved a series of conversations, a decision that they wanted to be more welcoming, and a decision to kick out some editors who were unable or unwilling to be kind to other editors, even if they were &quot;good content contributors&quot;.  Maintaining that culture requires a lot of community policing:  you can't have that unless people are willing to publicly speak their disapproval of unfriendly comments, and it can't always be the same person. Strangely, this probably is the cause of the dispute over our efforts to improve their articles:  their community norms seem to care more than ours about respecting other people's contributions, even to the point of not replacing someone else's mediocre efforts with a better version overnight.   () 15:53, 17 June 2014 (UTC)
Interesting. The suggestion I'm trying to make is different though, and is very much geared to the medium-/long-term. Backpedalling a bit... OH research is a multidisciplinary field which looks at many jobs, but may miss some relevant ones (for instance, I haven't encountered anyone who disputes that housework is highly relevant but very little studied). Given broad the social impact of Wikipedia today, I don't see why the voluntary work conducted online by Wikipedia contributors shouldn't be a legitimate, and perhaps even appetizing, topic of study. But looking at PubMed, there appears to be [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=occupational+health[mh]+OR+work+environment[mh]+AND+wikipedia next to no occupational health peer-review publications dedicated to Wikipedia as such]. I realise that a lot of work goes on internally on Meta and elsewhere. But I feel that WMF could be encouraging, or even commissioning, research from university groups off-wiki (while of course also providing the appropriate background support in clarifying our many quirky ways).  () 16:26, 17 June 2014 (UTC) 

+1 to the toxic atmosphere notion. I hope LT910001 has a well earned-break, and then may choose to return as a dynamic IP. This is a most effective measure against WP's bullshit, since activity is reduced to just occasional relaxed editing (a bit like how most editors started perhaps). You are insulated from confrontation by essentially opting out of the bullying culture. If you find as an IP you cannot edit certain pages, well then ask yourself it is worth the stress to work on a controversial topic anyway? You can always keep a manual watchlist (i.e. a list of articles outside wikipedia), and check in on them every once in a while if you feel the need. 

With regards the whole &quot;wikipedia is broken&quot; thing, IMO, the bureaucracy needs to be rigorously de-bloated, and there needs to be much condensing of the 100s of rules into a realistic, approachable and unified editing rulebook. Not to mention getting rid of those admins who really should not be admins, etc.  () 13:28, 17 June 2014 (UTC)

Just to clarify, when pointing to the relevance of studying the &quot;work environment&quot; here from an occupational health perspective I'm not sure I was specifically intending any prior restriction to &quot;toxic atmosphere&quot; notions. OH research that is ultimately geared to prevention has a big methodological toolkit, but takes time, specialist knowledge, human resources, and, perhaps ultimately, funding. Adverse outcomes can happen even when, as in this case I think, committed editors with varying backgrounds and individual characteristics are all striving to improve Wikipedia content in what they each believe is the most appropriate way, doing their best to follow due process. I suspect FA and GA nominations are particularly susceptible venues for such grief, but there are many other at-risk processes too, including ANI (as in the recent loss to the project James mentioned above)... Or even, as you imply just working on controversial topics. Fwiw, I too have found an IP strategy to be a useful expedient to survive in the environment. And, damn it, what was that essay called about ? Oh, and btw, you can tell I don't really belong or I would have found that WP:CREEP link immediately... and known the best ANI tactics... and how to survive GAN/FAN... and a whole load of other esoteric . ...ranting away into the distance...

 Gosh, that wasn't really quite what I was intending to suggest... Rather, perhaps for WMF to put the word around to academic OH research groups that we and our work environment are here to be studied from various inter/disciplinary perspectives (e.g. epidemiological, social, psychological, engineering, etc). That despite the apparent dearth of outside academic interest hitherto,  we do actually constitute a legitimate and potentially worthwhile area of study. For example, information (including that already accrued) on &quot;who we are&quot; may be highly relevant. And how about our processes, culture, etc, etc? What sort of interventions might be identified acceptable and feasible within the context of our self-governing community? Which interventions are effective? I realise that people within the WMF are probably addressing some of these questions already in their own ways, and I certainly wouldn't want to belittle their work. But I can't see any reason not to encourage outside research with an occupational focus (as distinct, for example from study primarily focused on content/quality). My thought was that WMF might eventually want to commission specific work, as and when the Foundation identifies particular areas for specific in-depth study. But a first step might be to invite interest more generally.   () 18:41, 17 June 2014 (UTC)

WMDE's community grant program had a proposal accepted a couple of years ago to hire professional facilitators to handle some of the emotional labor involved in settling on-wiki disputes - it ended up falling through when the volunteer involved had to pull out, but struck me as quite interesting.

First, I want to say that no one ever wants to see a good productive editor leave the project because of an unfriendly environment, and I would love to see the problematic editors removed as much as the rest of you. I acknowledge I don't edit much in the way of the sciences (although I did minor in and get a foundation scholarship for astronomy in college) because of the obvious difficulties I see in the more subjective humanities articles. The support services project strikes me as a great idea and to the degree I can be useful there (which probably isn't much) I will try to help.

I will try to get together some listing of what they cover in the next few months, which I think might be as useful in getting a sort of prospectus for OH content together. It might take a few months though, and the lists of articles and subarticles will almost certainly be somewhat outdated, but it might be at least a point to start from.  () 22:58, 17 June 2014 (UTC)
 While putting in another (perhaps superfluous) voice in favour of replacing &quot;victim support&quot; with &quot;editor support&quot;, &quot;contributor support&quot; or somesuch, I'd also like to say that this seems to me to be an interesting proposal. On a somewhat related topic, I've always been a bit perplexed by the quasi-disciplinary associations that  seems to acquire on Wikipedia. Imo, most of us here may stand to benefit at some time from thoughtful informal mentoring, at least in particular areas we find more tricky... as well as from some plain Jane human support.

In the novel Food of the Gods HGWells describes the appearance of a nest of giant wasps outside a small English countryside town.  The villagers are terrorized by the wasps, and after some weeks send a message to the Royal Society requesting help.  The society sends out a team of scientists who spend the next several months documenting various aspects of the wasps' physiology and behavior while they continue to terrorize the village.  Frustrated, the mayor requests assistance from the Royal Academy of Engineers. The engineers pile wood around the nest, set the wood on fire, and return to London the same day with the problem solved. Similarly, I wonder if we need to study this problem further, or simply enforce the rules.  () 12:23, 18 June 2014 (UTC)
Err, enforce which rules?  ( · ) 13:19, 18 June 2014 (UTC)
Well, I thought we had some rules on civility, if we don't, maybe we should. There are editors here that have long track records of responding to nearly every disagreement with personal attacks, accusations of bad faith editing, etc. They wouldn't last a month with that sort of behavior in a corporate environment.  I realize I'm oversimplifying the situation a bit, but as a relative newcomer, I don't understand the extent to which the senior people here tolerate that sort of behavior while wringing their hands about the low female participation and general exodus of editors.  I wouldn't work at a company that tolerated such behavior.  () 13:38, 18 June 2014 (UTC)

Absolutely, but we clearly have a healthy population of fully differentiated versions of both phenotypes.  Why is it so difficult to deal with those who are clearly frogs?  I was involved in a discussion on the Admin's notice board a few weeks back in which the subject was engaging in clear cut personal attacks of a very personal sort right there on the board and daring the admins to block him.  Outcome: no consensus for any action.  Sometimes its like a party that anyone can attend, and no one can be asked to leave no matter how obnoxiously they behave.  You end up with beer cans all over the neighbor's years, broken furniture, and fistfights breaking out in the back yard.  Having rules and enforcing them just makes a better environment for everyone.  () 18:43, 18 June 2014 (UTC)

WPMED A-class article?
My 2 cents is that GAN/FAN process creates significant conflict. I know that I've found it an unpleasant side of WP - not sure what others think. Few medical editors seem to take issue with having academic debates or building consensus around content.  But you can put tens or hundreds of hours into an article to have it sit for months on the list, only to be reviewed by someone that is largely disengaged with the actual content of the article.  If we're to make a change in the near term, my suggestion would be in the GAN/FAN process (which seems unlikely) or to de-emphasize it's importance to the medical community.  () 00:55, 18 June 2014 (UTC)
We are about providing high quality medical content to the world. The GA and FA process are not that important in doing this. [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 01:07, 18 June 2014 (UTC)
I completely agree.  However, many of us look for validation of the effort, and quality assurance.  How do you systematically recognize effort and provide feedback when requested?  It seems that the quality of the articles has increased over the years (e.g. FA articles from years ago that would never make it now), what (if anything) could the community replace it with? Peer review?  () 01:15, 18 June 2014 (UTC)

We have existing processes of Peer Review and FAC - both are helpful and complement each other. FA status can be used as a consensus/stable version to refer back to after articles undergo (inevitable) article erosion. GA is pot luck - if an article is reviewed by an inexperienced reviewer then articles with glaring errors or gaps can easily be listed. My preference in the first instance is use existing processes and (1) be on the watch for GA nominations of medical articles at , (2) make generous use of Peer Review - it has been very fruitful for cervix, (3) this then maximises chance of success at a rigorous review place like FAC, which then gives us a stable version. I agree that we don't have enough activity to warrant A-class review, which seems to be bureaucracy-creep anyway.  ( · ) 04:18, 18 June 2014 (UTC)
*Creating an &quot;A&quot; class has been discussed in the past. Most recently,  and  discussed this at , which could be converted to &quot;A-class review&quot;. Other related information is at  and . [[:Category:A-Class medicine articles]] is empty and intentionally unused. WikiProject Medicine has never had a regular community of sufficient size to do assessment.
No one is maintaining all these assessment projects. It could happen that all WP:MED assessment could be condensed from considering GA and FA and only do in-house assessments of A with judgments on quality of health information and supporting our community of editors rather than sending people into GA and FA reviews where there could be more conflict. Even if we did this, it is not certain that we have enough people on hand to give reviews when requested. I do not know what the solution is to this except that it would be nice if there were same way that WikiProject Medicine contributors could get their content reviewed for medical accuracy on request. [[User:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ]][[User talk:Bluerasberry|(talk)]] 16:29, 18 June 2014 (UTC)
What about scheduling volunteers for a month at a time (or 1 week or 2 weeks, depending on workload/number of volunteers) to do the reviews?  If you know you're only on for a week or two at a time, the workload seems less daunting. How many active editors participate at WP:MED projects?  30 or so?  () 18:48, 18 June 2014 (UTC)
Part of my pitch to mid-career scientists and medics, too busy to get in to serious editing (or that's what they think, heh heh) is to encourage them to keep an eye on here (or their appropriate project talk - eg molecular biology) and to do FA &amp; GA reviews from a content point of view. I haven't done this sort of presentation to medics yet.  () 19:05, 18 June 2014 (UTC)
Back in the old stone knives and bearskins days of the project I used to do some Biography A-class review although I acknowledge that I know damn little about medicine and almost certainly wouldn't be useful here. One thing that might be useful though might be trying to get together some lists of recent specialist reference books like I've started for some of the humanities projects at [[:Category:WikiProject lists of encyclopedic articles]] and what topics are covered substantially in which books to use as a baseline indicator for which content types to include in which articles here. Those sources might tyhen be used by even someone like me in the &quot;first stage of A-class review&quot; or rough review and then maybe getting someone other than the article writers/developers who knows the field in for a &quot;second stage of A-class review&quot; to determine how current the specific details included in the articles are?  () 19:10, 18 June 2014 (UTC)
Since it's not being used for anything, perhaps we could use A-class to denote articles that have passed review for accuracy and completeness by named subject-matter experts (with a prominent link to the version that passed review) - sort of  Wiki CRUK John's suggestion, above, but without having to meet the other criteria for FA. This way, interested experts could comment on (and hopefully eventually pass) any article that takes their fancy and not be limited to just the tiny few that make their way to FA nomination ... more like John Carter's second stage. -- ( ·  · )  09:42, 19 June 2014 (UTC)
I think this is an excellent suggestion, and it might be easier to get reviewers than editors (as for reviewers of publications many see it as an obligation, and rarely say no).

As an update, I've started a page at  borrowing from , though I doubt we need quite so many templates. It is sort of bold except that (1) A-class review is an existing process so we're not doing anything not covered by existing policy and (2) it isn't compusory, so folks can ignore if they wish.

Alternative cancer treatments

There is discussion about the section heading &quot;Ineffective treatments&quot; as not being NPOV in the article Alternative cancer treatments. I think some input from knowledgeable experienced editors could be helpful. - -  () 03:19, 25 June 2014 (UTC)

It can be NPOV if it reflects the sources. Neutral Point of View does not mean neutral content, it means the content reflects the published sources as due, see .

As I understand the OP, it's not entirely clear that all of them are actually &quot;ineffective&quot;.  For a few, the efficacy may be unknown (but implausible); for at least one, it may work in a small number of minor cases, but with a much lower efficacy rate than modern conventional medicine and much worse side effects.  (That one, by the way, was considered &quot;conventional medicine&quot; back in the day.) 
I don't oppose
Ineffective
(the OP proposed
Ineffective and unproven

No wonder we have problems with fringe theories

I was idly reviewing the materials at  and I watched the video [[:File:Verifiability and Neutral point of view (Common Craft)-600px-en.ogv|Verifiability and Neutral point of view]] on the  page. I was interested to hear the following:
* 
So far so good, although I would have hoped that the authors had heard of MEDRS and either avoided a medical claim as an example, or explained that for medical claims, a &quot;reputable source&quot; is not sufficient in itself. The BMJ is a reputable source, but still publishes primary research that falls short of MEDRS.

But then the video continues:
* 
WTF?? No wonder we have problems with fringe theories. The training material intended for students is telling them to stuff articles with views diametrically opposed to the mainstream view because it &quot;helps to balance the article&quot;. The  of that video should be kept in detention and made to write out 100 times:
;Fringe theory in a nutshell: To maintain a neutral point of view, an idea that is not broadly supported by scholarship in its field must not be given undue weight in an article about a mainstream idea. More extensive treatment should be reserved for an article about the idea, which must meet the test of notability. Additionally, when the subject of an article is the minority viewpoint itself, the proper contextual relationship between minority and majority viewpoints must be clear. - 
Sometimes my mind boggles. -- () 18:06, 25 June 2014 (UTC)
 The video includes the caveats &quot;major opinions&quot; and &quot;reputable source&quot;. Also, it is supposed to be a short, generic overview of the principles of editing. It is not intended to be an in-depth analysis of the application of WP:NPOV. [[User:Axl|Axl]] ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 18:28, 25 June 2014 (UTC)

 But presenting &quot;all the major opinions without endorsing one over the other&quot; surely doesn't mean giving each equal weight if the one 'major opinion' has 90% support in the scientific community while the other has (up to) 10%.  -- () 19:06, 25 June 2014 (UTC)

 I endorse RexxS and Hordaland's concerns.  Per Okrent's Law: &quot;The pursuit of balance can create imbalance because sometimes something is true.&quot;  Implying that we should always Teach the controversy rather than evaluating the quality of sources is an abdication of our responsibility as editors.
 While I agree with the principle of offering a 'short, generic overview' accompanied by real-world examples, when we do so it is important to choose examples that are amenable to an abbreviated presentation.  There's no need to choose a politically-charged, emotionally-fraught example.  Pity it's part of a video presentation; compared to text, video is extremely difficult to edit.

CRUK review of Esophageal cancer
As at  (see above) I've written up as best I can the results of an initial review of Esophageal cancer at .  This is by the internal person who recently reviewed and revised the CRUK (cancerhelp section) pages on this, with the most useful recent papers, which I have her working copies of. The idea is to sort these points out in the article before sending the article for review by other outside specialists. I don't want to waste the time of a top expert by sending them the article as it is. It is basicly accurate but some of the refs are over 5 y.o. (actually its better than Pancreatic in this respect). I'm hoping this is enough to go on for one of the medics here to revise the article, with me helping as I can.

Leaflet needs work

The last paragraph of your [https://wikimania2014.wikimedia.org/wiki/Project_Leaflets#WikiProject_Medicine Wikimania leaflet] says that &quot;Personal physicians will always be invaluable, but everyone has the right to learn enough to make their own informed health choices and ask their doctor questions.&quot;  I think that this is a terrible, terrible, peasant focus that undersells Wikipedia and your project, and seems to focus right at the one area - medical advice - that you can't or won't really give.

I would suggest replacing it with:

&quot;Wikipedia should do the best it can to help patients, students, and medical professionals find information with a solid scientific basis that can better their understanding at every level of technical detail.  We can provide a neutral and productive basis for people to make better-informed decisions in everything from personal behavior to political action by making these matters easier for anyone to learn about for themselves.&quot;

 () 23:31, 26 June 2014 (UTC)

 Agree.  Particularly removing &quot;personal physicians&quot;, whatever that is.  There are many other health workers who also are &quot;invaluable&quot;.  Midwives, for example, in most countries.
 I'd pare down your suggestion some, by removing these words:  &quot;of technical detail&quot;, &quot;and productive&quot;, &quot;better-&quot;, and maybe &quot;for themselves&quot;.  
 In fact I think the last sentence could be made stronger by shortening it to &quot;We can provide a neutral basis for people to make informed decisions in everything from personal behavior to political action.&quot;
 -- () 02:47, 27 June 2014 (UTC)
The &quot;pretty&quot; version is just a sample of what it will look like.  The actual text is supposed to be updated to match what's given (in plain text) in the table:   
I'd rather say that we're trying to help &quot;people&quot; instead of &quot;patients&quot;, because we seem to help a lot of people who are not patients.

Hordaland's suggestions seem reasonable.

Draft FDA guidelines for social media 
I'm reposting parts of a section of the  talk page here, as it seems even more relevant here.  ([[User talk:Smallbones|smalltalk]]) 17:49, 25 June 2014 (UTC)

A piece by Ed Silverman on the Wall Street Journal website [http://blogs.wsj.com/pharmalot/2014/06/17/tweet-this-fda-finally-proposes-social-media-guidelines/ Tweet This: FDA Finally Proposes Social Media Guidelines] (17 June 2014) contains relevant advice for manufacturers of prescription drugs and medical devices from the US Food and Drug Administration. According to Silverman, 

Quote|For third-party websites, such as Wikipedia, the draft guidance suggests that companies should feel free to correct misinformation, but that any correction must include balanced information and the source of the revision or update must be noted, Abrams explains. This means a company or company employee or contractor should be credited with any additions.
“The information should not be promotional and should be factually correct. This is not an opportunity for a company to tout its drugs,” he says. “The information [being added or revised] should be consistent with the FDA-approved [product] labeling and for it to be effective, you want it posted right by the misinformation.”

The draft guidance itself is [http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM401079.pdf here]. Wikipedia is not mentioned by name, but there are references to &quot;an interactive website&quot; and &quot;an Internet-based, interactive, collaboratively edited encyclopedia&quot;. 

I think this is the first time I have seen a US government authority advise companies to go on interactive websites like Wikipedia to correct user-generated content related to their products. As an alternative to companies editing the information themselves, it mentions the possibility of contacting the author of the user-generated content (cf. examples 7 and 11 in the draft guidance).  [[User_Talk:Jayen466|JN]] 09:59, 25 June 2014 (UTC)
It's along the same vein as the FTC requirements, that it be done in a transparent way.  The subtext there is that if they do take control of the content directly, they'll be subject to the full FDA requirements for advertising communication, which are extensive.  () 17:10, 25 June 2014 (UTC)

This is indeed an interesting and timely development.  First it should be noted that prescription drugs and FDA approved medical devises are one of only a couple exceptions to FTC regulation of ads in the US.  FDA ad regulation was, and still would be, done on a case-by-case basis; the FDC consulting with the potential advertiser. Note that the proposed guideline are more or less similar to the FTC rules, e.g. the paid edits would have to be disclosed.

The only other exception I know of to FTC regulation of ads in the US is for *some* financial firms, e.g. all communication re: newly registered stock offerings (sales) is strictly regulated by the SEC.

Note that there is a 90-day comment period on this (until Sept. 17, 2014?).  It would be useful if Wikipedia editors got together and make their own comments to the FDA. I'll suggest this be coordinated by , but there may be conflicting views, so I'll suggest that folks with different views just send in their own comments.

It may even be the case that the WMF board or WMF legal might want to send in their own comment - after all they do possess better legal knowledge, and do speak for the the entire movement.  Even so, I think they'd like to hear from Wikipedia editors with the comments made in some organized fashion. (that's up to them of course)  

I'll repost this in several places, but will probably concentrate my efforts at WP:Medicine.

If we are going to send a message to the FDA it should be to point out that due to the collaborative and open source nature of Wikipedia, there is no one &quot;author&quot; for a page that can be contacted in most cases.  We should educate them on how our talk pages work.  () 17:32, 25 June 2014 (UTC)
And I'd generally like the pharmas be limited to the talk pages, except to remove dangerous information, perhaps identify &quot;off-label&quot; uses with a simple sentence and ref. Make it clear that disclosure is required -but the draft guideline already does that - and probably indicate that the &quot;promotional labeling&quot; information shouldn't be included anywhere (I think the draft guideline does that but it wasn't entirely clear). Education about Wikipedia, via our comments, via the final guidelines would be the strategy.  ([[User talk:Smallbones|smalltalk]]) 17:40, 25 June 2014 (UTC)
With respect to &quot;off label use&quot;, this is an USA legal thing. We are a global encyclopedia. We want what the best available literature says. The position of regulators can go in the section on society and culture.
With respect to replying I am not sure what we should say. Having had some very negative runs in with industry here on Wikipedia I am inclined to see those being paid to promote a product limited to the talk pages.

I'm not sure its that much to worry about. My read of the Guidance was that it was more about requesting changes than about doing actual editing.  I'm not privy to the details of Doc's experience with pharma interference with Wikipedia, or and how much of it was official vs. lone wolf activity by a small percentage of the million or so pharmaceutical industry employees worldwide, but I certainly didn't get the impression that the Guidance would start any sort of stampede to edit Wikipedia articles.  BP simply assigned someone the task of &quot;coordinating&quot; with Wikipedia, and we've all seen how that played out in the press.  The Guidance does not require social network sites to make requested changes nor to change their rules about who can actively edit, nor does the FDA have statutory power to pass those sorts of rules. 

Like Cochrane, NICE, the Institute for Safe Medication Practices, Public Citizen, the CDC, the major medical professional societies, and scores of other groups, the FDA is a nominally disinterested third party that independently evaluates medical data and attempts to draw some sorts of conclusions.  Like the aforementioned organization, their independence and neutrality is never absolute.  And their decisions are sometimes constrained by the Agency's enabling legislation.  But if you look through a couple of recent approval summaries on the Agency website, they dig into the clinical and preclinical data on new drugs to an extent that is far beyond the capabilities of most organizations.  I don't understand why their opinions would be limited to the Society and Culture section.  They've made some bad calls, but so has everyone else.  () 22:19, 25 June 2014 (UTC)
I guess I should clarify. IMO we should not organize the &quot;medical uses&quot; section into FDA approved uses and &quot;off label uses&quot;. While I agree that the FDA is a good source, it is not the only source. If one wants to create a list of &quot;approved&quot; versus &quot;off label&quot; uses as this is a US legal definition it should be in the society and culture section. Other ways of presenting stuff from the FDA can go in the &quot;medical uses&quot; or other sections. [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 22:29, 25 June 2014 (UTC)
Actually, this is not about including information from the FDA. It's about the FDA's ability to regulate what pharma companies can say on social media, and incidentally on Wikipedia.  So the draft guidance says that a pharma company's employees must disclose if they make an edit here.  It even says somethings about people that they just have some influence on. So we might send the FDA a comment on their proposed guidance that educates them about how Wikipedia works (it's pretty obvious they only have a vague idea) and then say we recommend that employees of pharma and the people they influence should, e.g.;
*disclose their employer, client, and affiliation for each edit 
*Only edit on talk pages
*disclose if they have been paid for specific research that they cite.

Or whatever else we want paid pharma editors to do or not do. This will likely be our only chance to send in this info to them for a decade or so.

([[User talk:Smallbones|smalltalk]]) 00:54, 26 June 2014 (UTC)

On our end, I think that there is some danger of assuming that the COI-related rules for the English Wikipedia are the rules for every wiki.  Our rules here don't even apply to other languages of Wikipedia, much less to the smaller, non-Wikipedia &quot;interactive, collaborative encyclopedias&quot; out there. 
About the pharma companies editing, my main concern is that they might believe that this requires them to remove off-label information, which we don't want them to do anyway, but which could also be a nightmare if they decide that the EU requires them to add X and the US requires them to remove X.   () 16:10, 26 June 2014 (UTC)

 Having them stay on the talk page and off the article page should be very safe for everybody involved.  I think allowing companies to remove dangerous information on drugs in articles is a real good idea.  Focusing on en:WP doesn't seem like a bad idea for US FDA regulation.

From just a quick reading of a brief article on this paper, it looks ok and actually reflects reasonably well on Wikipedia.  The only thing I would have preferred is some sort of alternative considered, e.g. is there another site that updates the info more quickly? another form of media that gives detailed info to more people more quickly?
As far as the above section on FDA guidelines, I'd think that we can recommend that drug firms bring this information asap to the talk pages, and remove any information in the article that has been shown by the FDA announcement to be dangerous.

If you really wanted to keep drug companies from editing articles directly (personally I think that preventing potential damage to readers' health is a pretty good case for the application of  policy), you'd have to have a well-oiled central noticeboard that promptly responds to input. Until such time, I would prefer it if companies (disclosing their affiliation per ToU) corrected harmful misinformation in article space on sight, as envisaged in the FDA draft guidance.

CRUK review of Pancreatic cancer

At  I've written up as best I can the results of an initial review of Pancreatic cancer by the internal person who recently reviewed and revised the CRUK (cancerhelp section) pages on this, and listed the most useful papers, which I have her working copies of. The idea is to sort these points out in the article before sending the article for review by other outside specialists. I don't want to waste the time of a top expert by sending them the article as it is. It is basicly accurate but many if not most of the refs, except the recently added World Cancer Report, are over 5 y.o.. I'm hoping this is enough to go on for one of the medics here to revise the article, with me helping as I can. Please say at that section (Discussion bit) if you would like to take this on, or otherwise comment. Access to the sources will be key I think. Esophageal next - see a few down.

Issues with alt med articles

We are having issues with editors using &quot;review articles&quot; from journals with low impact factors to contradict or instead of reviews from high impact journals at the acupuncture article among others.

For example in this edit [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Acupuncture&amp;diff=614662606&amp;oldid=614662062] this review [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=24761171] from a journal with an impact factor of 1 [http://aim.bmj.com/] was added instead of this Cochrane review [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23904069] which has an impact factor of 5.78 [http://www.cochrane.org/news/news-events/current-news/revised-impact-factor-announced-cochrane-database-systematic-reviews].

Do we need more methods to exclude poor quality sources? [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 22:53, 27 June 2014 (UTC)

If a journal has been found to be by consensus faulty or unreliable and reported, we should make a note of that on one of our sourcing pages. Next best thing is when material is added, try our best to find other higher-quality sources (like Cochrane etc.)  ( · ) 00:09, 28 June 2014 (UTC)

That sounds like the most reasonable approach to me. I do not think we should necessarily label all journals with lower impact factors as unreliable or faulty, but a list of journals that are regarded as such would be useful for medical editors IMO. However, I do think it is important that we discuss what criteria will be used to consider a journal unreliable prior to establishing this list.  () 01:26, 28 June 2014 (UTC)
Sometimes these fringe journals can be used for mundane claims. For strong claims it is best avoided.

This is the sort of reason I call this &quot;your project&quot;.  I am not at all pleased with people going off into a huddle and coming up with an ever-flexible list of journals to exclude based in no small part on their POV.  I want to see the pro-acupuncture people have the freedom to present their view of things.  Prestigious sources should be given a little halo of explanation, but I find the way that the article chants the mantra &quot;systematic review&quot; literally seventy-one times (though 41 of those are in the references) to be absolutely ridiculous.  I remain skeptical of this whole fad of claiming that you can review a broad field accurately by following a rote procedure.  But when you then deliberately depart from the &quot;systematic&quot; approach by picking and choosing the journals you like ... what do I call that?  Wikipedia should allow more than just the most powerful opinion-makers to have a say.  () 04:17, 28 June 2014 (UTC)
As regards use of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized comparative trials as the highest level of evidence [http://www.patient.co.uk/doctor/different-levels-of-evidence][http://www.essentialevidenceplus.com/product/ebm_loe.cfm?show=oxford] for clinical efficacy, this is not a &quot;fad&quot; and the acceptance of this approach within the scientific community is in no way influenced by Wikipedia or any POV of this project. Of course, a homespun alternative for Wikipedia might be to leave the doors wide open for claims by the most powerful opinion-makers (rather than collaborate with a highly scrupulous non-profit organization like Cochrane).Regarding traditional medicine in general, when the best available evidence from systematic reviews etc supports claims of efficacy, we need to say that. When it doesn't we need to say that too.As to the question of grading journals (by impact factor or in other ways), while recognizing the practical issues I share the concerns raised in the past by  (eg [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Identifying_reliable_sources_%28medicine%29&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=565630091]). Fortunately, such questions do not affect our recognition of the general reliability of Cochrane reviews.  () 08:39, 28 June 2014 (UTC)
That second source includes some important caveats: &quot;Systematic review (with homogeneity) of Level 1 diagnostic studies; or a clinical decision rule with 1b studies from different clinical centers.&quot;  It has to be Level 1, there has to be homogeneity... my feeling is that if you have a lot of great data that all agrees there's not going to be an argument anyway.  But the magic words &quot;systematic review&quot; can be spotted as low as 3a on their chart, and even then with the caveat that it has to be with homogeneity and of 3b-grade studies, i.e. even with no systematic review any one such study would be nearly as good evidence.  That's not the same kind of fetishism as I'm seeing here.  Documents like [http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/painres/download/whatis/syst-review.pdf] emphasize that systematic reviews can be done badly, and that they may conflict with large single studies.  But I feel like that paper is still too credulous, because even if a single review of a particular issue (clot busters in 1992) would have come to a better conclusion and saved lives, the statistical power of such 20/20 hindsight is really very poor, and it's pretty much impossible to do a proper control for it where an independent expert goes back and does a narrative review of the old literature to see if just having any other person take a crack at it would have got it right.  () 12:22, 28 June 2014 (UTC)
To be honest, I have no idea where you're getting this idea that WikiProject Medicine sees the phrase &quot;systematic review&quot; in a paper and doesn't bother to evaluate whether it is a systematic review of a handful of case-control studies or several dozen prospective studies / randomized controlled trials. From my read of what you're saying, which isn't very clear at least to me, it seems that you're trying to describe a problem that just doesn't seem to exist. Yes, MEDRS is written broadly and I too think that there are places where it can be overspecific. But I'm not seeing what you want changed. Are you saying that you want editors to be able to use other Level 1 evidence to refute systematic reviews?As an aside, systematic reviews are a huge pain for researchers and clinicians to do properly, and at least in the area of my professional interest, simply do not exist for a number of rather important clinical issues. Individual research groups can try to remedy that, but it comes at a time and financial cost of doing more interesting research elsewhere and I can guarantee there is no way we would have started on what we are working on now if it weren't absolutely necessary for another project. We would have gone with using other evidence that has been published in journals—prospective, longitudinal studies or large RCTs. But that would have been the suboptimal option. [[User:NuclearWarfare|NW]] ([[User talk:NuclearWarfare|Talk]]) 15:00, 28 June 2014 (UTC)
 Yes, agree with NW. And it is true that the specific wording of MEDRS needs more work. For instance, we really do need to specify that for efficacy studies, we're looking for good systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses of randomized-controlled trials, not of cohort or case-control studies. The precise wording needs work (though that can sometimes be difficult in the presence of destructive critiques).  () 21:09, 28 June 2014 (UTC)
The levels of evidence page might be expanded and we can simply directly users to use the highest quality evidence available. For example, let's take the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, which I admittedly I know little about, has this nice table[http://sites.jbjs.org/reviews/reviews_author_instrux.html#LevelsofEvidence] detailing levels of evidence stratified by type of study (RCT, prognostic, diagnostic, economic). It isn't perfect, as a level 2 systematic review will many a time beat level 1 studies for our purposes, but it's a nice way to start. [[User:NuclearWarfare|NW]] ([[User talk:NuclearWarfare|Talk]]) 23:37, 28 June 2014 (UTC) 
 
I'm ambivalent to creating such a list, because as mentioned above, it would be a herculean task. An alternative is to simply create a list of journals that aren't up to scratch?

The difficulty with going purely on impact factor is that many smaller field-specific journals have low impact factors, not because they aren't high quality, but because they are so specific in their focus. There are numerous cancer, immunology, physiology etc. journals that have an impact factor under 2, but are still very relevant to the field. 

Could the solution be to make impact factor ratings the go-to solution for ? Any disputed statement needs to come from a journal with a high impact factor? To be frank this issue isn't only relevant for alt-med, but has been up on Electronic cigarette, where Cochrane's reviews were being replaced by some lower quality ones, and where we had nothing in  to lean on when disputing the edits. -- [[User:CFCF|CFCF]] ( ·  · ) 09:18, 28 June 2014 (UTC)
I don't think we should use impact factor as the sole criterion to determine what journal should be used as a reference for a disputed statement.  () 15:51, 28 June 2014 (UTC)
I'm not sure that we should use impact factor at all.  It systematically disadvantages specialist journals and rewards journals that publish popular things rather than good work.
I think that a better solution is for editors on both sides of these disputes to accept that there really are multiple POVs, and that we're supposed to include all of the significant POVs.  If you can find actual reliable sources (not just blog postings) saying that a journal is dubious (see Medical Hypotheses for an example), then certainly skip it, but otherwise, I think that you should accept both the pro-acupuncture and anti-acupuncture review articles, without playing the game about &quot;my journal is better than your journal&quot;.  There's room in that article for more than one POV, and we can even say things like &quot;Reviews have come to opposite conclusions about...&quot; when there is disagreement.  () 23:14, 28 June 2014 (UTC)
Yes we do have issues with journals which do everything they can to increase their &quot;impact factor&quot;. And thus would agree it is far from a perfect measure. [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 03:36, 29 June 2014 (UTC)
Real evidence levels versus Wikipedia cultism
Above I was directed at [http://www.essentialevidenceplus.com/product/ebm_loe.cfm?show=oxford], and thinking about it ... without putting it in particular on a pedestal, that list illustrates what is wrong with Wikipedia's overbearing policies on medical articles.  Specifically, what's not on the list:

* Five years.  That number, however deeply enshrined in the Wikimedical faith, still smells to me of the ass some editor pulled it out of.  Nothing in the third party list suggests that a properly done experiment or systematic review just goes away after a little while.
* Secondary sources.  Even a systematic review, with significant caveats, ranks only a little better than the underlying studies that went into it.

I need not add that impact factors and homemade lists of &quot;good&quot; journals aren't even a cloud on their horizon!

So here's my question: can Wikipedia obtain third-party opinions about, or directly assess, levels of evidence according to some standard similar to this one I was pointed at?  And can we agree to blow a hole in our policy that allows editors to ignore the made-up Wikipedia special rules and include data from high-level sources?  () 12:43, 28 June 2014 (UTC)

The 5 year thing (MEDDATE), is pretty much ignored presently. There are very many source on medical articles &gt; 5 years old. If there is a good secondary/tertiary source older than 5 years, use it imo. It's probably going to be better than the previous source anyway (some health information website often). But it's nice to be up to date in an ideal world. Would suggest replacing the old and terrible sources with at least not terrible sources (but maybe old) as a priority first however. 

With regards your ranking of systematic reviews &quot;only a little better&quot; than primary sources, I think you are missing the whole idea and point of systematic reviews. If the underlying sources are full of flawed methodology, all kinds of bias, etc., a good systematic review will conclude this rather than perhaps following the same petri dish conclusions of each individual primary source. It might conclude &quot;there is not enough evidence until someone does some proper research&quot; whereas the primary sources are saying &quot;Our results suggest this this and this&quot;. In this respect a systematic review is far more reliable than primary sources. Anyway, the whole secondary source thing is encyclopedia-wide (RS not just MedRS), so you would have to convince more people than just this wikiproject. 

Here are more examples of external &quot;evidence levels&quot;, Evidence-based_medicine#Assessing_the_quality_of_evidence. It might be interesting to see such things formerly laid out in MedRS, although to be honest, it is largely the same in spirit already.  () 16:53, 28 June 2014 (UTC)

The problem with meta analysis is that the complexity and sheer volume of information and decision-making involved in deciding which trials to include and how to process the data greatly undercuts the ability of readers to make their own assessment of the author's decisions.  In criticizing the recent Cochrane review on neuramidase inhibitors in the BMJ, I was recently challenged by Trish Groves to review and publish my own analysis of the Roche clinical study reports.  Its a nice rhetorical challenge (which she has offered to virtually everyone who criticized the study), but the problem is that to do so would take 6 months, and unlike the Cochrane researchers, I'm not being paid a salary while I do it. To my mind,this lack of transperancy and the &quot;accept our conclusions or quit your job and spend 6 months doing your own analysis&quot; attitude is the core of the problem. 

The opportunity for the authors to incorporate their own personal biases is made clear by the stream of industry-sponsored meta analysese comparing their own new drugs to older ones (which consistently find for their own drug). That this is not just an industry problem is shown by the consistency with which those on both sides of the statins-in-primary-prevention issue are able to continue to publish meta analyses upholding their long-held and opposing viewpoints as more and more trial data becomes available.  

The rules here are that the meta analysese are the most reliable sources, and if you find one that claims to have examined data that others didn't include, its pretty much a trump card irrespective of the readily apparent biases of the authors.  Given that the biases of the investigators shine through the analysis, one can usually find one that agrees with one's own position on any controversial topic. It's not really that different than cherry picking primary research papers, and to an extent, I'd argue that most meta analyses ARE primary research.  I don't like it, but that's how things are done here. 

The intrinsic lack of transperancy of the process flies in the face of traditional scientific publishing, and results in publications that are little more than carefully reasoned editorials.   () 18:48, 28 June 2014 (UTC)

The &quot;5 year thing (MEDDATE)&quot; was introduced in [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AIdentifying_reliable_sources_%28medicine%29&amp;diff=225638781&amp;oldid=225008386 this &quot;Revision as of 18:00, 14 July 2008&quot; by Eubulides, after a discussion]. It is actually rather mildly phrased &quot;Here are some rules of thumb for keeping an article up-to-date while maintaining the more-important goal of reliability. These guidelines are appropriate for actively-researched areas with many primary sources and several reviews, and may need to be relaxed in areas where little progress is being made and few reviews are being published. ... Look for reviews published in the last five years or so, preferably in the last two or three years.&quot; I expect a good deal of current medical content predates it, and another large % met it when the passage was written, but has not been revised, and now does not merely because of the efluxion of time, as the lawyers call it. It is not so much ignored, in many articles, as very hard to keep up with with present resources. / () 02:18, 29 June 2014 (UTC)

A key phrase in the wording there is &quot;rule of thumb&quot; (no Mozartean quips invited!). Yes, the 5-year cut-off is arbitrary, but it's not rigidly enforced, especially when recent updates are not available. That duration is cited to encourage inclusion of up-to-date information—a major issue for us, as John notes.  () 10:54, 29 June 2014 (UTC)

 The problem I have with your claim that a good systematic review will exclude a bad primary study is that ... how do you know it's a good systematic review?  Personally I feel more confident looking at a primary publication and seeing that it's a major lab with good public funding coming out in a solid research journal publishing experiments that make sense, than trying to tell whether a systematic review covered all the sources fairly.  I understand that's a personal bias, but the bottom line is that I don't like the implication that it's OK to pick up just about any self-described systematic review and trust that it points to good studies, but not to point to the research result directly trusting that.  And indeed that's not far from where the discussion began above, by casting aspersions on a pro-acupuncture systematic review.  Now my preferred ugly solution to the conundrum is simply to cast a wide net, allow a lot of stuff in even knowing that some of it may be a little dodgy, on the basis that it's better for the reader to sort through too much data than too little.  But it may be that we can come up with another solution that includes cross-checking between systematic reviews and primary research they acknowledge, so that we can make a greater range of opinion known by citing all the articles that pass the filter you suggest of a systematic review recognizing them.  Definitely though I don't want ad hoc solutions that chuck out whole library stacks full of articles based on a couple of people going &quot;hmmm&quot; at the name of the journal.  () 23:47, 28 June 2014 (UTC)
We simply don't have the ability to do that. We can't have the accountable expertise. NOR plus ANYONECANEDIT means we need someone else to decide what primary sources matter, we can't trust the judgement of pseudonymous wiki editors.  [[User talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl!]] 03:25, 29 June 2014 (UTC)
Is it really that much easier for editors to assess whether a source is &quot;secondary&quot; or a &quot;systematic review&quot; than it is to have them decide if a study was controlled, prospective, was a cohort study, used a good reference standard?  (not all of these things would have to be determined either)  We're telling editors that they don't have the independent judgment to apply the real standards used in the industry, then turn them loose into endless plastic-toy debates over the more irrelevant terms they are allowed to judge.  () 05:20, 29 June 2014 (UTC)

Considering how few know how to distinguish 1o, 2o and 3o sources currently, I would say asking people to be able to recognize other details of the study methodology would be asking too much. For most people on Wikipedia, any source which is presented as a scientific publication will appear very reliable, whether it is a primary source, original research in vtiro study or a meta analysis. () 11:16, 29 June 2014 (UTC)
Agreed, the likelihood a secondary source is low quality is much lower than a primary source is. It is far from an ideal solution, but we cannot enforce anything else. We aren't speaking of &quot;allowing a few sub-standard sources in&quot; but about opening the flood-gates completely if we get rid of this clause. There are times when it isn't enough, but being able to rely on this significantly decreases the amount of work needed to argue against poor edits. The whole Wikiproject will fall if we were to allow primary sources indiscriminately, as each single shoddy statement would need to be analyzed in full, and each single source would need to be read in full. It just isn't viable. 
Additionally, just as 188 says, the simple fact that a user can find a secondary source implies a form of understanding of both what  aims for, and that they are sufficiently knowledgeable in the field. -- [[User:CFCF|CFCF]] ( ·  · ) 11:36, 29 June 2014 (UTC)

Agree that MEDRS facilitates more focused dialogue on talk pages. I don't think anyone's claiming that the wording of the guideline can't be improved. But despite it's technical limitations it's a valid defence against pov (or simply naive) editing. And it also provides a useful starting point for informed gf editorial reasoning. In short, yes it can be polished, .  () 12:00, 29 June 2014 (UTC)

Yes:  You tell them to find it on PubMed, click the &quot;Publication Types and MeSH Terms&quot; heading, and see whether the word &quot;Review&quot; is there.  In most cases, it requires zero judgement and much less skill than writing the wikitext formatting for the citation.   () 16:42, 29 June 2014 (UTC)
Ugh.  I've seen this kind of decision making... the problem is that on one hand, a &quot;review&quot; is not uncommonly a professor writing an overview of four or five papers by himself and his collaborators, with some sympathetic citations; on the other, a &quot;primary article&quot; often contains useful review in its introduction and discussion.  If we're going to have a no-thought criterion, the best such criterion to have is to include everything.  () 21:52, 29 June 2014 (UTC)
I agree it isn't perfect, but it is primarily about applying quality control. What suggestions do you have Wnt? We need something that is easy to: comply with, enforce &amp; understand, etc. ; and which does not rely on third party judgement. Any ideas off the top of you head?-- [[User:CFCF|CFCF]] ( ·  · ) 22:07, 29 June 2014 (UTC)
&quot;Include everything&quot; is simply not possible.  There are over a million academic journal articles published each year.   () 23:35, 29 June 2014 (UTC)
* Start with the fundamental inclusionist principle.  Wikipedia is an encyclopedia without any looming limit on what it can hold.  I like to think of it like my image of the Smithsonian, filing away practically any serious submission of material in a drawer somewhere for future generations to examine.  So generally speaking, any editor who can find  (a low standard) and accurately summarize the information they provides should have a right to house that information somewhere on Wikipedia.  I know people will point at some exceptions, but this is the principle toward which we should strive.
* Now you can say it's impossible to summarize a million articles a year.  To begin with, I doubt that's true.  We have three million articles, most of which have many references.  They're not all science, of course, but we're not that many orders of magnitude away from doing it.  But the other thing is that ... if we can't do it, we don't have to worry about preventing it from happening.  The editors will, by virtue of not doing everything, apply a filter that promotes the more important articles more often than the less important articles.  Now that's a subjective decision, but when subjective decisions are made by tens of thousands of editors they are fairer than when they are made in a star chamber where a few people decide what is OK to use.  The more hierarchy and power in the process, the easier it is for a biased group to take control of it.
* Dealing with  does not involve suppressing material, but properly filing it.  We have a place for the Flat Earth Society.  But we must not confuse &quot;fringe&quot; with merely &quot;wrong&quot;.  It is useful for Wikipedia to refute wrong ideas, and suppressing material makes that impossible.  To make a parallel, when a famous person is wrongly accused of a crime in the papers, it is better for us to cover their exoneration than to delete all mention of the incident, because people would forever be asking after it in the talk page.  We'd be giving the impression we were covering up the crime when instead we could be delivering compelling evidence of innocence.  We should only exile fringe material from an article when there's not much reason people would take it seriously to begin with.
* We do have an obligation to make it clear when one point of view is winning the battle for scientific opinion.  We can do that by describing reasons to take one point of view more seriously, i.e. large studies, systematic reviews, prestigious journals, supporting opinions.  We could figure out many different kinds of things for editors to look for, which are straightforward and verifiable, which give indications of quality; use them not as rules to have the editors decide who is right behind the scenes but rather ways to cue the reader in on who is winning.  For example, one criterion I've seen published is that studies with public support are more reliable than those funded by the company whose product is being tested - obvious, but  still specifically bans discrimination against those studies and certainly doesn't encourage it, despite my attempt to get that changed.  Systematic reviews are indeed one way of signifying quality but there are many others.
* To me people here seem to assume that Wikipedia should provide &quot;information for patients&quot;.  There are sites that provide information for patients, meant to be used alongside medical treatment, but Wikipedia should strive to the higher goal of simply providing information -- for high school students, medical students, reporters, political activists, officials, and scientists - and yes, of course patients too, but regarding them as our equals, not our wards.  Fundamentally, an encyclopedia by its nature expresses a belief that any reader should have the right to know everything - not filtered by occupation, caste, or social role, but purely for the love of knowledge itself.  This perspective is why I generally feel we need to cast a very broad net for all the possible ideas out there, rather than intentionally suppressing all but those judged most likely to deliver effective treatment.  I should add that I suspect the utility of our articles follows a sort of Zipf's law, where the impact of a single reader (perhaps a researcher or activist) may form a significant fraction of the total benefit an article can have.  () 00:53, 30 June 2014 (UTC)
Sarcasm doesn't do well on the internet, I'm sorry.
* Point 1 &amp; 2 have essentially the same problems. Editors who concentrate on medical articles here on Wikipedia are counted in the tens, and you suggest we should be able to summarize 1,000,000 articles. That amounts to, even very optimistically: 10.000 articles per editor, or ~27+ articles a day.
* Yes, indeed sometimes there is need to suppress fringe ideas. There aren't enough editors to go around to check each and every last homeopathy article so that it doesn't state anything about a miracle cure.
* These are often murky waters, and you aren't always going to immediately tell who supports a study. Do you suggest we only cite publicly funded sources? The shit-storm there is bound to be even greater.
*Wikipedia does not assume that. What we assume is that a patient reading the content should not be subject to missinformation, or information that is largely dubious for whatever reason. 
The guideline is not going to be changed in this regard, and I will not waste more time on this discussion. I suggest you go read Jytdog's essay  -- -- [[User:CFCF|CFCF]] ( ·  · ) 06:29, 30 June 2014 (UTC)
The model of &quot;add whatever interests you, because then only (mostly) important papers will get added&quot; is a nice idea, but it doesn't work in practice.  How about I add whatever interests me, which happens to be my own publications about my grand new theory?  I believe we had a case of that related to complications of vasectomies a while back.  How about I add whatever interests me, which happens to be anything saying that this one surgery is worthless?  I ran into a case of that on a sympathectomy:  the only editor interested in that subject &quot;just happened&quot; to be someone who ran a website trying to get the surgery legally banned.  If we were all just innocently interested in information, then this might work, but in practice, &quot;add wahtever interests you&quot; is a boon to POV pushers.   () 15:51, 30 June 2014 (UTC)
That can be disturbing, yes; but someone bent on a biased agenda can break the rules no matter what they are.  I think the key is that we take the inclusionist approach to disputes where you fix biased/limited viewpoints by adding and covering the better-supported ones more.  This is not a special thing for medicine - any other kind of politics can be just as heated.  It isn't uncommon for people with strong political views to edit political articles - and if people can only be inclusionist and add stuff instead of constantly reverting the last person's work, that can be a quite productive way to write an article.  (and in this case, honestly I don't think someone critical of a procedure not so different in concept from a lobotomy should really be regarded as supporting a fringe point of view)  The bias produced by the filter of individual editors is not random, since of course companies can be prowling around pushing their POV, but it is relatively easily opposed by editors (as yourself) who get offended when an editor is not being neutral.  It is harder to fix systematic bias that emerges when, say, a group of people in a special wikiproject come up an arbitrary list of journals that shall not be used.  Individual bias is more usually flagrant, unsophisticated, heartfelt, honest; that's why I prefer it so much to the alternative.  () 20:23, 30 June 2014 (UTC)

Synthetic routes in drug articles - style guide?

I've noted the recent addition of detailed chemical synthetic routes to many of the drug articles in Wikipedia.  I don't see this as a positive thing, as it is difficult for me to imagine that more than 1-2% of our readers is able to understand and appreciate this content.  In most cases the synthetic route provided is a randomly selected procedure from among many published in the literature, and there is no citation showing that the particular route illustrated is used for production.

Also, without meaning to be a prude, I note that the proliferation of synthetic routes and references to detailed synthetic procedures has been particularly rapid for drugs of recreational interest.  We have detailed synthetic routes and literature references now for many drugs that are rarely if ever used therapeutically, including Fencamfamine, bromadol, metenolone, MDMA, methamphetamine, and mescaline among many, many others.  

I would like to propose adding to both the medicine and pharmacology style guides a statement along the line of &quot;Detailed information regarding the method of chemical synthesis of pharmacologically active substances should not normally be included in articles, as it is outside the scope of a general interest encyclopedia. The inclusion of references and detailed schemes for the synthesis of psychotropic drugs with high abuse potential is particularly discouraged&quot;. 

Most importantly, I think the inclusion of synthetic routes is out of scope and too specialized.  Secondarily, while the synthetic routes for drugs of abuse are widely available on the web, I don't see any reason for Wikipedia to participate in its dissemination. The routes are really outside our usual scope in any case.

Just my POV. Any thoughts from others?   () 22:02, 21 June 2014 (UTC)

I doubt that the community will agree to this.  The first objection will be that Wikipedia is not meant to be an encyclopedia solely for general interest.   () 22:19, 21 June 2014 (UTC)

Hmm, off to a poor start.  By &quot;general interest&quot; I'm referring to non-specialist.  I see a lot of articles with commentary pointing out that the level of technical detail should be reduced to an appropriate level for a general audience.  () 23:12, 21 June 2014 (UTC)

 I have mixed feelings about this.  I agree that including an arbitrarily chosen synthesis of a drug is not appropriate.  If included, the synthesis should be how it is produced industrially or perhaps how it was first synthesized, but certainly not the 10th &quot;novel route to drug X&quot; synthesis. In these cases, a separate article on &quot;synthetic routes to drug X&quot; might be appropriate.  Concerning illicit synthesis, Wikipedia is neither a how to guide nor is it censored.  Furthermore if the illicit synthesis of a drug is wide spread, that increases the notability and therefore the justification for its inclusion.  IMHO including a general description of the synthesis is fair game, but regardless if the synthesis were ethical or illicit, it would not be appropriate to include experimental details. Finally, wouldn't it be more appropriate to have this discussion ?  () 08:45, 22 June 2014 (UTC)

If a compound article is tagged with + and , then the MOS layout for that page needs to include all relevant sections laid out in the MOS for those projects.   indicates including a synthesis section.

Seppi333 makes an interesting point about the chemistry style guide.

I'm a PhD chemist, and I routinely blow past these detailed synthetic schemes.  Which makes me wonder how many of our readers find them of interest (or comprehensible).  () 13:04, 22 June 2014 (UTC)

* I welcome the inclusion of information on synthesis. Wikipedia has thousands of articles on very specialised topics and even if only a few readers find them of interest that is okay. Wikipedia is not a general interest encyclopedia. Accept that specialized content exists. We are talking of pages dedicated to a single compound. That is already very specialized. The &quot;adverse effects&quot; section in Fencamfamine is all jargon that I do not understand and is of no interest to me but a understand that other people do find it interesting to read. If the topic is published synthetic methods then it is irrelevant if any of the methods have commercial value. State it as a fact: such and such methods have been reported. Valuable information to me. Move the section to the bottom of the page if you have to. Synthetic routes are within scope especially when it comes to recreational drugs. Wikipedia should not censor this information. A meth cook is only interested in concentrations used, cook time and crystallisation method, the sort of detailed information that does not belong in Wikipedia.  () 18:59, 26 June 2014 (UTC)

It was my criticism that prompted JMH649's query.  My prior remarks were unnecessarily confrontational, and I apologize for this.  But my concerns are as follows:
* This is not a traditional journal that accepts submitted manuscripts from independent authors, sends them to independent referees, and then makes publication decisions based on the input of those referees.  As described below, it is a self-published product by a group with non-mainstream views.
* In part because of the above, it is not a widely accepted source.  According to this [http://www.scimagojr.com/journalsearch.php?q=21758&amp;tip=sid&amp;clean=0 website], the average Prescrire article gets cited only 0.18 times, and half of these are self-citations.  Put another way, only one in every 11 Prescrire articles ever gets even a single citation in the mainstream medical literature. This puts it neck-and-neck with the following journals:
* Homeopathy
* Alabama Nurse
* The Australian Journal of Medical Herbalism

For comparison, respected specialty journals such as the Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology get about 3.5 cites per manuscript, and minor generalist journals such as Southern Medical Journal get about 1.2 external citations per article, about a 10-fold difference.

Prescrire's home page is full of troubling, [http://english.prescrire.org/Docu/Archive/docus/HowReviewsProduced.pdf dismissive] references to other journals such as the Lancet. Quotations marks are placed around phrases like &quot;medical journal&quot; and &quot;referee&quot; to express skepticism about the processes of these sources, along with adjectives such as &quot;so called&quot;.  In recent years it has written moderately to highly negative reviews of many drugs that are mainstays of professional medical association treatment guidelines, including thalidomide for multiple myeloma and most of the anti-MRSA, anti-VRE antibacterials that have been approved since 1990. 

Prescrire's [http://english.prescrire.org/Docu/Archive/docus/HowReviewsProduced.pdf own description of its review preparation protocols] makes it clear that the selection of editors to write articles, the writing of the articles themselves, the selection of the &quot;referees&quot;, the decisions regarding which referee comments will be incorporated, and approval and publication of the final draft are all conducted tightly under the control of a single person, the journal's excecutive editor.  There are no independent authors, editors, or referees.  

Respectfully, this is not a source that should be used to support broad statements about the safety and efficacy of any medical intervention.  It is not mainstream, is not truly peer reviewed, and the lack of citations of its content after 20 years of existence shows that it is not widely respected.  It is  and probably can be considered .  It is not a scientific journal in the usual sense of the term, nor does its editorial processes incorporate the usual quality control and peer review processes that are normally associated with reliable sources.

I'd never heard of this journal before about ten minutes ago........  ( · ) 13:59, 29 June 2014 (UTC)

Just to add one more point, my understanding is that our emphasis on secondary sources is to show mainstream acceptance of medical ideas and conclusions.  How can one do that by citing a journal that gets only 0.09 citations per published article?  I believe this flies in the face of the principles underlying MEDRS.  () 14:16, 29 June 2014 (UTC)
We need to present all the (significant) POVs, not just the mainstream one.  Using secondary sources helps us figure out what is important enough to include in a concise summary.  Using them in DUE proportion helps us present the mainstream view as being mainstream (not as being the only one that exists).   () 16:48, 29 June 2014 (UTC)
I'm in full agreement. In the present case, however, this source was used to make a summary statement about the risk/benefit ratio of the drug, not to present a minority viewpoint that was identified as such. And with respect to signficance, Prescrire is less cited than the journals Reanimation, Gastroenterologia del Peru, The Nebraska Symposium on Motivation, and the Journal of the Tennessee Dental Association.  I'm just having trouble seeing this.  () 18:05, 29 June 2014 (UTC)
I've got no opinion on this journal, but the &quot;statistics&quot; approach is troubling.  What drives citations is often things like the age of the journal, the proportion of articles that are open-access (which means, in part, the proportion of articles reporting work funded by the US government), and media attention/marketing savvy.  I don't have the citation, but I've read that the most effective way to reach American doctors and researchers is to get your study mentioned in The New York Times, not to get it published in a good journal.   () 19:08, 29 June 2014 (UTC)
In general I agree with you its a pretty limited approach.  But when a journal has been around for 20 years publishing reviews on topics of broad interest, and no one is citing those reviews, there has to be some explanation.  Mine is that the journal is not highly regarded. I'm open to hearing others.  () 19:29, 29 June 2014 (UTC)
Do you know of other publications that style themselves as &quot;continuing education&quot; journals that are widely cited? There are some, I think, but perhaps not that many; the [http://www.current-opinion.com/default.aspx Current Opinion] series has a somewhat similar editorial role, I think. Perhaps it's worth noting that although this (originally government-sponsored) journal also publishes an English edition, there's a major editorial need for continuing-education medical literature in other languages for the benefit of the many medics who have difficulty reading the scientific lingua franca of English.  () 08:32, 30 June 2014 (UTC)

Prescrire international is pubmed indexed and to be indexed it must be peer reviewed from what I gather. Many of its conclusions are inline with other reviews such as this 2014 review on treating mildly elevated BP [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24860904]

With respect to the effectiveness of peer review, we all know that it is far from a panacea. While I am very supporting of using reviews from the Lancet, their financial structure does leave them open to concerns. For example this review states with respect to tPA in stroke &quot;although some patients might benefit up to 6 h after stroke&quot; [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22632907] in the interpretation yet if you read the paper in full the data only support up to 3 to 4.5 hours. Journals that rely on advertising and reprints must be exceedingly careful regarding what they publish. Critical position can go missing due to financial concerns.

The Prescrire funding model is based on subscriptions rather than advertising or reprints. It is also mostly French and presents the evidence within the context of France. It is just one position I agree and it is an opinion that is not tied to the pharmaceutical industry. It is a member of the International Society of Drug Bulletins an organization support by the World Health Organization.

I can't see any strong a priori reason why content from this French journal shouldn't be considered potential MEDRS. I find the arguments put forward here regarding impact factor / citation index  unconvincing, especially in view of the editorial characteristics of the journal.  () 09:11, 30 June 2014 (UTC)

Medical Hypotheses is Pubmed indexed but not peer-reviewed, so I think there is an incorrect assumption here.  () 15:00, 30 June 2014 (UTC)

(Not sure what &quot;assumption&quot; Looie is referring to here.) Good quality textbooks are considered potential MEDRS, even though they're not usually peer-reviewed in the conventional sense. Prescrire outlines the peer-review procedure it follows [http://english.prescrire.org/Docu/Archive/docus/HowReviewsProduced.pdf], which incorporates a somewhat unusual process for reviewer selection. (Fwiw, my experience with submissions to Current Opinion suggests to me that their peer-review process focuses primarily on formal concerns.)  I suppose a more substantial concern might be the way Prescrire entrusts the writing of articles is entrusted to &quot;editors&quot; rather to outside experts in the particular field.  () 16:35, 30 June 2014 (UTC) [previously  86.128.169.211]
 From the indentation level, Looie was responding to Doc James, so it's probably safe to assume that James' comment &quot;to be indexed it must be peer reviewed&quot; was Looie's target. As for concerns that editors rather than outside experts write our articles, the proof is in the pudding. Britannica and Nupedia both used variations on that model and there's no evidence that they've produced better content than Wikipedia (with the possible exception of readability of the text). I wouldn't lose much sleep over concerns like that. -- () 17:28, 30 June 2014 (UTC)
*  Actually, I was referring to Prescrires editorial system. Sorry RexxS if that wasn't clear.  () 18:14, 30 June 2014 (UTC)

Prescrire is an interesting one. It is quite unconventional and a bit iconoclastic, perhaps more so than other European counterparts such as the Drugs and Therapeutics Bulletin (UK) and the Geneesmiddelenbulletin (NL). My intuition is that I would not use it alone because of concerns about , but I would be happy to support it as a source where there are corroborating sources available.  |  19:23, 30 June 2014 (UTC)
Yes it was used in this edit [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Duloxetine&amp;diff=615003130&amp;oldid=614863598] and its conclusions are in line with other sources. [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 23:38, 30 June 2014 (UTC)

So the Prescrire summary is that it is a &quot;drug to avoid&quot;. What Cochrane said in 2014 is &quot;the NNTB of 8 in fibromyalgia and depression is not an indication of substantial efficacy. More trials (preferably independent investigator led studies) in these indications are required to reach an optimal information size to make convincing determinations of efficacy. Minor side effects are common and more common with duloxetine 60 mg and particularly with 120 mg daily, than 20 mg daily, but serious side effects are rare&quot;  This is certainly less that a ringing endorsement, but I'd hardly call it supportive of &quot;drug to avoid&quot;.

In essence, the precedent being set here is that I can hire some people who share or are willing to defer to my opinions to write articles about medical subjects, pick some like-minded referees to review the articles that my hand picked employees have written, make decisions about which referee's comments to incorporate, and publish articles expressing opinions that have not had any truly independent input or evaluation from anyone.  And when the world shows its opinion by completely ignoring my self-published journal, it can still be used a &quot;reliable source&quot; in Wikiipedia.  () 01:28, 1 July 2014 (UTC)
It is a number of French academics who are financially independent from the stuff they are studying, at least somewhat endorsed by the World Health Organization and have convinced nearly 35,000 people to buy a subscription that funds the efforts, looking at the available treatments and considering that this one has some concerns compared to others available.
I agree it is different than the usual situation where a multi billion dollar company pays a couple of staff members to do a &quot;trial&quot;, than pays a scientific article writing firm to write it up, then pays some &quot;well respected experts&quot; to donate their name to the article in question without having any involvement in its production, than promising a journal that they will buy 10,000 re-prints if they publish it / send it out to people they know will be lenient for peer review. Plus of course the journal needs to ignore the fact that the primary end points changed halfway through the trial. And if the journal does not tow the line without putting up a fuse they do not need to threaten to pull their advertising from said journal as this is just understood. This then continues with misinterpretation of said trial in the advertising material produced and giving lavishly to guideline producer to make sure those are favorable. Not to mention doing half a dozen of these trials and burying the one they do not like before the publication process with journals is even started.
The company then finishes this with having their head of marketing activity edit Wikipedia along with half a dozen of the docs / meat puppets in the companies pay. Followed by send threatening emails to a Wikipedian with 60 or so of their colleagues cc'ed implying that they are killing people.
I think there's room for both these perspectives. [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 09:12, 1 July 2014 (UTC)

Doc, I am very familiar with the problem of conflict of interest in publishing. But I disagree both with both of your implicit conclusions: 1) That conflict of interest problems in publishing justify lowering standards in other areas, and 2) That the pharmaceutical industry is the main source of publishing COI.  

Physicians control every aspect of the medical publishing process, including most of the manuscript preparation, the referee process, and editorial decisions. Physicians and physician-controlled enterprises form the vast majority of the subscriber base. It is inevitable that the content of these publications consistently reflects their financial and political interests. Empirical support for this this observation is provided by the following:

* In-hospital deaths from medical error, estimated by the IOM at 100k per year, and more recently in two other publications estimating the rate at over [http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/11856.php 300K].  Upon checking into a US hospital in 2014, one's risk of dying from medical error is nearly 1%, but you won't see much discussion of this in the literature. This ongoing issue gets less coverage than the decade old Vioxx story.
* In the late 1980s and early 1990s, multiple studies estimated that up to 30% of US surgeries (which US surgeons recommend and then perform on a &quot;per service rendered&quot; basis) were unnecessary, resulting in another 10-15,000 deaths per year.  A relative handful of more recent publications show vast differences in procedural rates depending on physician ownership of ASCs, private vs. public insurance coverage, and other issues that reflect provider financial interests rather than medical considerations.  Are these deaths less important than those caused by pharmaceutical company malfeasance, or is there another issue in play? 
* 100,000 deaths per year from HAI, but most studies indicate that only 50% of physicians routinely wash their hands between patients. When publications occur, instead of talking about criminal responsibility for patient deaths, they benignly discuss how to &quot;persuade&quot; physicians to stop killing their patients.

So yes, I am very familiar with the role of COI in controlling what is published by medical journals.  You cant' put a stop to it, but independent review is a minimal first step to keeping some sort of a lid on it. 
I've blanked my user page and will not trouble you further.   () 14:13, 1 July 2014 (UTC)

*Per &quot;That the pharmaceutical industry is the main source of publishing COI.&quot; They have an obvious financial conflict of interest to produce positive results with respect to medications.

Low-fat diet could use review and expansion

The question of whether low-fat really is or is not such an important thing to focus on for weight loss does seem to be very much in the Zeitgeist at the moment -- for example The Times (London) ran a long cover-piece in its features section yesterday, &quot;The full-fat diet — why it’s not as unhealthy as you think&quot; [http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/health/article4135690.ece] (paywalled) reviewing the history of low-fat diet advice contrasted with some more recent research, and Time magazine ran a cover story ten days ago, &quot;Ending the war on fat&quot; [http://time.com/2863227/ending-the-war-on-fat/] (paywalled).

Our article Low-fat diet is pretty limited at the moment, and reflects none of this discussion.  Considering that this is a major lifestyle issue for so many people, it could use some review and expansion by qualified folks from appropriate sources.  () 11:34, 3 July 2014 (UTC)

A statement on Alternative medicine and Wikipedia editing

As Project Medicine has recently lost two valuable editors from an unfortunately small pool, I am heartened to see a considerate and polite discussion occurring on the talk page of the Alternative medicine article. It has helped me develop some thoughts on WP editing and attitudes towards alternative medicine topics. Some key points are: 1) There is a strong policy position in support of evidence based medicine and mainstream medicine. 2) I feel this is echoed and reinforced by the editorial position of many members of this project. 3) This means emerging support for alternative ideas face a staunch wall of resistance. 4) This also means ideas from the alternative community are subject to a higher level of scrutiny/opposition than those from the mainstream community.

An important point to consider is the amount of accepted mainstream medical practice that is not supported by evidence. I certainly understand the arguments based on plausibility and long term unmeasured success (and common sense). Still it is of interest to think, &quot;What if every practice of 'modern medicine' was subjected to the level of scrutiny and the bar of evidence was raised to the level required on WP to make statements about alternative medicine?&quot; and &quot;What if every avenue of exploration endorsed by the mainstream was subjected to the level of hostility exhibited towards ideas from those who lack that endorsement?&quot;

At this point I will own my personal position. I consider Ernst, Barrett, Sampson and Hall heroes. I strongly object to quackery on deep ethical grounds. I have and will work hard to prevent WP from being a vehicle for the promotion for those who profit by the exploitation of those who suffer illness. That said some honesty regarding Bad Pharma and the fact that mainstream medicine is a profit driven industry that uses many unproven treatments is also in order.

While I think WP's policies and guidelines are excellent and promote encyclopedic validity in the presentation of biomedical information, I also think there is room for improvement in our community. I propose we temper our participation with consideration that some alternative medicine advocates are sincere and some honesty in recognizing the high ground we hold is not as lofty as we might think. I propose we present our positions (POV albeit with sound basis) with compassion, consideration and respect. I think we should balance our frustration (RTFM MEDRS etc) with an understanding of a potential underlying motive to benefit suffering human beings, likewise our outrage at support for &quot;predators&quot;. I think some humility at the modesty of the measure of success (per some IOM and WHO reports) that modern western maintstream medicine has achieved is in order.

Again I own my POV that skepticism and a high bar of evidence is the way to make progress. I hope that in my drive towards that I conduct myself honestly, ethically and compassionately with respect for the dignity and worth of all who would improve the lot of humanity.

In conclusion I would like to remind everyone that editing WP should be a rewarding experience to all who seek to improve the encyclopedia. Two aspects of participation in WP I hold as ideals are fun and camaraderie. I hope the members of this project can help foster these ideals.

With a deep sense of loss for those editors driven away by feelings of alienation and a sincere hope that diversity of opinion can be encouraged and engaged, I offer the traditional closing,

Best wishes and happy editing.

 Thanks, Mr Bill.  I'm often frustrated by the effort that some people make to exclude acceptable sources because the primary author is a chiropractor or the journal is dedicated to evidence-based reviews of altmed—even when the source is saying that there's no evidence for the altmed treatment!  It's especially bad to tell new people that they need to find a review article, and then when they do, tell them that their review article doesn't &quot;count&quot;.  If we could get some of that scrutiny turned towards common conventional practices (which are far more widely used), that would be helpful.  It would also be helpful for people to remember that  for getting  about quackery in the encyclopedia, and that those &quot;POV pushing quacks&quot; are good-faith humans who are usually trying their best, just like the &quot;POV pushing anti-altmed&quot; editors are also good-faith humans who are usually trying their best.  Even simple steps like being &quot;too busy&quot; with Real Editing™ to reply instantly can help calm down difficult discussions.

Acupuncture and pseudoscience

see also: 

At , I'm engaged in a debate with another editor over the sentence &quot;TCM is largely pseudoscience, with no valid mechanism of action for the majority of its treatments.&quot; and whether it needs to be attributed (TCM=traditional Chinese medicine). We seem to have no likelihood of consensus, so I'd be grateful if any other editors would be willing to contribute their opinions on the issue. Thanks -- () 20:07, 5 July 2014 (UTC)

 For context, there was previous consensus to include the text in question, but only with in-text attribution. Multiple editors rejected presenting the text as fact (without attribution) because 1. It came from an editorial, and was an off-hand dismissive remark in that editorial rather than the thesis statement of a paper focused on answering a question like &quot;what is TCM?&quot; and 2. TCM does not present itself as a science, but rather a 2000 year old traditional medicine, rendering the pejorative label &quot;pseudoscience&quot; inaccurate. Now, recognizing that the opinion that TCM is a pseudoscience is a notable and popular one, I and others agreed to compromise and include the text as long as there is in-text attribution (&quot;An editorial in Nature characterized TCM as pseudoscience, with no valid mechanism…&quot; I support sticking with the previously agreed upon consensus version. () 06:13, 6 July 2014 (UTC)
 When I make a neutral request for other editors to look at a debate, I don't expect to have you arrive to deliver a mendacious one-sided presentation of your biased view of the discussion. But if you insist on re-opening the debate here, I'll oblige. The fact is that there was no previous consensus to attribute the text. That is simply untrue.
 Editors don't get to change policy at a whim, and  is clear about attribution:
* Avoid stating facts as opinions. Uncontested and uncontroversial factual assertions made by reliable sources should normally be directly stated in Wikipedia's voice. Unless a topic specifically deals with a disagreement over otherwise uncontested information, there is no need for specific attribution for the assertion, although it is helpful to add a reference link to the source in support of . Further, the passage should not be worded in any way that makes it appear to be contested.
 But you think it shouldn't apply to articles where you edit - which is effectively two as over 100 of your 138 edits to articles are on acupuncture or TCM. You simply want to attribute any statement you disagree with in an attempt to weaken its conclusion and cast acupuncture/TCM in a more favourable light. We don't make amateur analysis of reliable sources - that's the job of secondary sources, not Wikipedia editors. The rest is just your opinion with its obvious bias and carries no weight at all.
 This is the sort of problem we find ourselves dealing with every day from SPAs on alt med topics, so if any WPMED editors can find a few minutes to make an neutral judgement on the issue at , we could at least lay this one to rest. -- () 12:50, 6 July 2014 (UTC)
On the other hand, the statement that traditional medicine is &quot;pseudoscience&quot; (rather than, e.g., not modern science at all) is neither uncontested nor uncontroversial, so your quotation from the policy doesn't apply.   () 23:22, 6 July 2014 (UTC)
 Well, the &quot;Uncontested and uncontroversial&quot; actually means uncontested and uncontroversial in reliable sources, not uncontested and uncontroversial by Wikipedia editors, so I think it might be reasonable to expect to see these dissenting reliable sources, don't you? If they exist, let's summarise and attribute the opinions as we always do; but in their absence, surely we should be asserting the sourced statement as simple fact. -- () 15:24, 7 July 2014 (UTC)

Barnstar



I have just discovered that the WikiProject Medicine barnstar has been changed from the Rod of Asclepius to the caduceus. Can we have the Rod of Asclepius back please? [[User:Axl|Axl]] ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 11:45, 7 July 2014 (UTC)
By pure coincidence I was the one who changed it, and I've reverted it. Looking for a Rod of Asclepius svg alternative, the old image is a bit fuzzy.  P.S. Thanks for the barnstart :)  -- [[User:CFCF|CFCF]]  () 12:24, 7 July 2014 (UTC)

Help reviewing “Editing psychology articles” handout for student editors?

(Apologies for the cross-post.) Introducing myself for those of you I haven’t interacted with before — I’m LiAnna Davis, and I’m in charge of communications for the Wiki Education Foundation, the nonprofit that runs the Wikipedia Education Program in the United States and Canada. One of my goals this year is to create a series of discipline-specific support materials for students and instructors participating in our program. Given the challenges some psychology students have had in the past, I’m starting with psychology, and I need some help. I’ve created a  explaining more about what I’m trying to do, and then added an outline of the preliminary content I’d like to include. 

Since psychology is not my specialty, I would really like to get feedback from experienced content contributors in psychology to make sure I’m providing accurate advice to students. I’m looking for several people who’ve contributed content to psychology articles to  and offer feedback — please help if you can! I need all comments by Monday, July 14. Please leave comments  rather than here so they’re all in the same place. Thanks! --  () 22:08, 7 July 2014 (UTC)

We have unfortunately lost the person who has written much of our autism content. [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 03:30, 7 July 2014 (UTC)
If you know a more appropriate alternative to &quot;allistic&quot;, please add it, because &quot;without autism&quot; doesn't make any sense and we have already determined consensus on person-first language.
&quot;Normal&quot; is not a diagnosis and is frankly presumptuous. There is no reliable source to say those individuals were normal. Neurotypical is an accurate medical term whose inclusion makes the article more informative. Replacing &quot;controls&quot; with &quot;neurotypicals&quot; similarly clarifies who we are talking about. If there's a strong reason to keep the word control, call them neurotypical controls to differentiate from a possible control group of more autistic people.
A person on the autism spectrum is autistic. That's why it's called the autism spectrum. &quot;Person with ASD&quot; should be replaced with &quot;autistic person&quot;, as per the consensus determined on .  () 06:40, 7 July 2014 (UTC)
Lets gets other opinions on these word changes.  
ASD includes both autism and Aspergers syndrome thus changing it to just autism is not exactly correct. Yes the DSM 5 have merged these diagnosis into autism spectrum disorder but that is still not simply autism. 
There was weak support for changing &quot;person with autism&quot; to &quot;autistic person&quot; and I am fine with that. However that was not the only thing you have been changing in your edits thus the reverts. [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 06:55, 7 July 2014 (UTC)
 In this context, by &quot;autism&quot; you mean &quot;classic autism&quot;. ASD, classic autism, and Asperger Syndrome are all forms of autism. The fact that old references use outdated terminology is not a good reason to prevent Wikipedia from updating. Wikipedia has its own style guide and does not latch onto references like a chameleon. If I see something wrong while working on a different issue, I'm inclined to correct both of them. If you have a problem with only one part of an edit, you can change that part, or revert and reintroduce the &quot;good&quot; changes. Just reverting is disruptive. At the very least you could provide an explanation of which parts were problematic, I'll check my notifications and put the &quot;good&quot; parts back. () 07:02, 7 July 2014 (UTC)
Can you direct me to the Wikipedia guideline page that mentions &quot;private language&quot;? Given that articles on Deaf culture use &quot;hearing person&quot;, &quot;allistic&quot; is not unprecedented.  () 07:02, 7 July 2014 (UTC)
Have changed the article on Deaf culture. Hearing person is poor English but at least a person can figure it out. Allistic gah.
If you are planning on more controversial changes best to get consensus before hand. [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 07:22, 7 July 2014 (UTC)
That response did not answer the question. Is there a guideline page explaining &quot;private language&quot; or did you just make the controversial change from &quot;hearing person&quot; to &quot;person with normal hearing&quot; without getting consensus first?  () 07:44, 7 July 2014 (UTC)
Use of the term 'neurotypicals' without wikilinking it is very hard to justify as it's against  and in the context of an experimental design 'control' is a much better description of their role. The Andrew_Wakefield example should use the same terminology as Wakefield does, because it's talking about a person's beliefs and the further we take it from their terminology the more OR it is. The Autism changes just look wrong --- I still have no idea what the &quot;ability to demonstrate&quot; change is about.  () 07:12, 7 July 2014 (UTC)
I believe you are referring to an example in which the word neurotypical was wikilinked earlier in the article. I figured there was no need to link it twice. &quot;Ability to demonstrate comprehension&quot; is a more accurate description as comprehension itself is immeasurable except through self-reporting; this applies in more contexts than just autism. Do we really need to have disputes and consensus over every minute change in wording? If that's the case, we should set up a lock an all articles so that all edits need administrator approval.  () 07:30, 7 July 2014 (UTC)
Added RFC tag because an interest in &quot;other opinions&quot; was expressed.  () 07:30, 7 July 2014 (UTC)
My opinion is that the  dicussion, which didn't mention other pages and was closed with a &quot;a relatively weak consensus&quot; is no basis to change a the language in a large number of articles.  () 08:04, 7 July 2014 (UTC)
 Muffinator has also brought this to ANI [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Administrator_Doc_James_obstructing_improvements] [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 08:29, 7 July 2014 (UTC)
Autism is at the very least the most popular article about autism. More importantly, consensus is consensus. If you have an issue with the discussion being deemed a consensus, take it up with the user who closed the discussion.  () 08:41, 7 July 2014 (UTC)
*Re: RFC: Could it be clarified what exactly opinions are being sought for? The four items at the top of the discussion, or more/other than that? In terms of &quot;allism/allistic&quot;, that is clearly inappropriate -- it's a confusing, very obscure neologism with no widespread official acceptance at all; it wasn't even &quot;added&quot; to WP or Wiktionary till a few days ago, and even then without a single source. The neurotypical vs. normal debate has more basis in definitive usage, but even then, Stuartyeates' recommendation that WP use the terminology of the cited articles makes a good degree of sense; I don't personally see any real basis for confusion what &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;control&quot; means here. &quot;Autism&quot; is not the same as ASD, that much should be clear to anybody -- one is a spectrum, the other is a specific (autism is always classic autism unless otherwise noted).

Strongly agree with Softlavender, and even if it wasn't for those strong arguments there is no consensus for such a broad change. -- [[User:CFCF|CFCF]]  () 10:07, 7 July 2014 (UTC)
&quot;Allistic&quot; is clearly a neologism without clear definition or wide linguistic acceptance in the English language. It would be inappropriate to insert the word into wide use on Wikipedia without significant discussion and broad community consensus.  () 10:17, 7 July 2014 (UTC)

Having written extensively on ASD:
# &quot;allistic&quot; is an inappropriate term and should not be used
# &quot;neurotypical&quot; is the most correct term in lieu of &quot;normal&quot; (because normal cannot be defined)
# &quot;ASD&quot; is more correct than &quot;autism&quot;, unless you're talking the rare cases of full-bore, far end of the spectrum Autistic
# &quot;matched controls&quot; is a scientific term, and must be kept for scientific consistency
So in short, the changes are mostly wrong, but one might just be right [[User talk:EatsShootsAndLeaves| the panda  ɛˢˡ”]] 11:32, 7 July 2014 (UTC)
* Or simply &quot;matched controls&quot; (the matching is an aspect of the study design).  () 13:40, 7 July 2014 (UTC)
Allistic is POV jargon.  Neurotypical is unhelpful to people who are unfamiliar with the subject.  Non-autistic or people without an autism diagnosis (because not all allegedly neurotypical people actually are neurotypical) is a better choice. 
One other reason for avoiding neurotypical is that it's based on a false dichotomy:  a person can have neurological problems that are not ASD-related.  A person with schizophrenia or multiple sclerosis is, as a matter of physical facts, neurologically atypical, even if that person has no significant ASD-related symptoms at all.   () 15:29, 7 July 2014 (UTC)
 Support for 'non-autistic'.  -- () 16:26, 7 July 2014 (UTC)
Agreed, 'non-autistic' seems like the correct phrasing, which neither places value judgments nor assumes.  () 18:59, 7 July 2014 (UTC)
If you are going to use a word like &quot;neurotypical&quot; on wikipedia, you will need to define it at the first instance in the article using brackets. Since that definition will probably use the word &quot;normal&quot; it seems a bit pedantic to me, but I am unfamiliar with the topic. If hte literature uses the term then support.  () 17:59, 7 July 2014 (UTC)
We should be using plain English as much as possible. [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 18:28, 7 July 2014 (UTC)
I agree with Doc James on this one.   () 19:00, 7 July 2014 (UTC)

Writing as a layman, ie., an editor without any medical credentials, the first three of the four changes mentioned above (from &quot;children without autism.&quot; to &quot;allistic children&quot;, from &quot;normal individuals&quot; to &quot;neurotypical individuals&quot;, and from &quot;matched controls&quot; to &quot;matched neurotypicals&quot;) confuse the sentences they appear in.  If it is important for precision of language to distinguish (eg) between &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;neurotypical&quot;, an extra sentence or two should be added to make the distinction.   () 20:59, 7 July 2014 (UTC)

*Has any organization which advocates for the autism community every published a manual of style for journalists? Has any such manual of style been identified or sought? , do you know anything about this? Can you recommend any organization which might have published guidance on this that we could copy instead of developing it ourselves? [[User:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ]][[User talk:Bluerasberry|(talk)]] 14:36, 8 July 2014 (UTC)
*The Autistic Self Advocacy Network and the Autism Women's Network are prominent advocacy groups which advocate for Autistic-first language.  () 14:43, 8 July 2014 (UTC)
In my view that doesn't justify it as the de facto terminology for Wikipedia. Just as the National Stroke Association pushed for brain attack, a patient group organization can not simply change our vocabulary. Wikipedia should use terminology used by the most prominent sources, and not that of patient groups, however noble their motives. Wikipedia is not the place to drive a crusade for or against use of any terminology. At best we could state that portions of the autistic community choose to use this terminology.-- [[User:CFCF|CFCF]]  () 07:35, 9 July 2014 (UTC)
The fact that certain terminology is used by the relevant groups may not necessarily be a reason for Wikipedia to adopt it, but the fact that certain terminology is more accurate and more neutral than what was previously used is a reason for Wikipedia to adopt it. I offer these two groups as sources for what  requested.  () 08:05, 9 July 2014 (UTC)
 {u|Muffinator I wrote to ASAN asking if they had a manual of style for journalists. They publish a statement on why they use [http://autisticadvocacy.org/identity-first-language/ &quot;Identity-first language&quot;], but at the bottom of that statement, they list other activists in the field who use &quot;people-first language&quot;. Regardless of what scientific sources say, I would rather use what the community itself uses if we can establish that this community has consensus among the people who talk about such things. Because of the diversity in viewpoints on this topic, it seems undecided. I will see how they reply to my email about their recommendations for writing. If there is a recommended way in the ASD community, then I think we should follow that, but if there is a lot of controversy in the community, then I would say that Wikipedia cannot take a strong position. , it is my opinion that the strongest argument that you could make is listing which organizations use language you suggest. I see no such list anywhere, but such a list would be the evidence that Wikipedians would want to see. Whatever ASAN says I will share also.

Crick after DNA

After Crick's success in understanding the secret of life (see his autobiography What Mad Pursuit), he naturally turned to the next open problem: consciousness, which he worked on for the rest of his life. His collaborator, Christof Koch, completed their last paper together  Now, 10 years later, Mohamad Z. Koubeissi MD, et al. (2014), Journal of Epilepsy and Behavior, while seeking to cure a woman's epilepsy, have learned that electrical stimulation of the claustrum reversibly turns off her consciousness, while leaving her wakefulness intact. Turning off the electrical stimulation returned her consciousness. Crick and Koch point out that the claustrum enjoys reciprocal connections to the rest of the brain, including V1, in the visual system.

From the viewpoint of scientific method, the Crick &amp; Koch 2005 paper contains a cautiously worded hypothesis, while Koubeissi, et al. 2014 constitute a crucial experiment, because the Koubeissi experiment describes a reversible method, while Crick &amp; Koch describe a theory which will likely prove fertile for decades, just as the DNA story has proven. The length of the fertile period exemplifies the Lakatos criterion for the 'strength of a scientific programme'.

My question for the MED project is: although Crick &amp; Koch 2005 is labelled a 'review', and therefore a secondary source, does it qualify as MEDRS? What is needed for the concepts which are implicit in Koubeissi , et al. 2014  to qualify? --   09:51, 8 July 2014 (UTC)
Crick's hypothesis [http://books.google.com/books?id=GvccAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA299&amp;dq=claustrum+crick&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tcS7U6jcK-vs0gW67IGwAw&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=claustrum%20crick&amp;f=false seems to be] noteworthy enough to be covered, though the hypothesis itself is primary material so is best approached through secondary sources. The current claustrum article is not in the best shape.  || 10:20, 8 July 2014 (UTC)
The cautious observation I refer to (p.6 of the 10 page pdf) is &quot;There are remarkably few microelectrode investigations of claustral receptive-field properties and almost none in awake animals.&quot; -- Crick and Koch 2005, which Koubeissi 2014 has kindly supplied. --   10:42, 8 July 2014 (UTC)

*In my view, the Crick &amp; Koch paper meets MEDRS, but the views in it are admittedly speculative, so if they are referred to in Wikipedia, it should always be with wording such as &quot;Francis Crick and Christof Koch proposed that ...&quot;.  In other words, it should be made clear that these are the views of specific people rather than mainstream ideas.  As a source of background information about the claustrum the paper can definitely be used, although in a few respects it is already out of date. A better source for background info is http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3983483/. The Koubeissi paper is absolutely a primary source.  My personal opinion is that their findings are not nearly as important as some people make them out to be, and in any case they were obtained from a single human subject and certainly need to be replicated.  () 13:04, 8 July 2014 (UTC)

Note: I've commented more extensively on this on my personal web site, see [http://weskaggs.net/?p=5004 Comments on Koubessi et al.: Have we learned anything new about the role of the claustrum in consciousness?] if you are interested.  () 15:11, 8 July 2014 (UTC)
