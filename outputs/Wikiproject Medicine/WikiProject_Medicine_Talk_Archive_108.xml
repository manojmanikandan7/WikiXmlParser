 Dangerous Wikipedia prostate suite of articles 
 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29406053 PMID 29406053, March 2018 review]

 rostate cancer — rostate cancer screening — rostate-specific antigen

So, here I sit, in between radiology and surgery.  Never imagined I would fall prey to grossly outdated, poorly written Wikipedia artcles, but here I am.  And I cannot deal with an unfavorable cancer prognosis and fixing Wikipedia artcles at the same time. If this suite of articles cannot be updated and written with the accuracy warranted for a condition that will affect one man in six, then these articles should be gutted. At minimum, the biased and outdated preferencing of poor information regarding PSA screening should be removed.  I tried and have been reverted, even though there are MANY more journal reviews and professional guidelines than the one I listed above. For years, Wikipedia has preferenced the USPSTF information in the entire suite, and has completely left out multiple other guidelines. This is bias of the dangerous kind. And this is costing men’s lives.  For years, medical editors have tried to patch up articles, but the finger in the dike approach to the repair needed in this entire suite is not adequate.  Please, either dedicate the resources this topic deserves, or gut the articles to remove the dangerous and outdated sections.  PSA screening saves lives.  A lack thereof, thanks to one guideline bias, results in advanced prostate cancer, that is harder to treat.  Please join me in at least alarm, if not sadness.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  16:32, 27 February 2018 (UTC)
Very sorry to hear this news. Health editing on Wikipedia is largely a damage limitation exercise. It was a situation which paralleled yours which first interested me in editing medical articles.

 so sorry I did not ping you, Alexbrn .... probably forgot others, hard to edit from iPad.  I accept that wikipedia has problems, but again, as always has beeen the case, we could solve it by treating biomedical content like a BLP.  If we cannot provide decent content, then the articles should be gutted.  No info is better than faulty info.  There are good sources out there for prostate info. Our information is horrible. ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  17:24, 27 February 2018 (UTC)
I am sorry for the situation you are in SandyGeorgia; i figured something like this was going on based on your edit notes.  I will get back to this, this week. I don't know that our articles are so bad.  That state of the science and commercialization for prostate screening and diagnostics, is bad.   PSA remains a very bad screening test - it drives zillions of unneeded biopsies and those are positively medieval.  &quot;Here i will stick a bunch of needles in you multiple times and then only really examine some of the tissue that is extracted, and we will see what we can generalize from that.&quot;  No good blood test,  no good medical imaging for this.

I'm sorry to hear that things are complicated, Sandy.  
I haven't read the review linked above, but the abstract is not convincing.  ead time bias, improved treatment (which usually means no treatment for most men with prostate cancers), and other biases can all lead to the perception of &quot;decreased mortality&quot; without actually saving any lives that were actually threatened.  This is exactly the sort of thing that breast cancer patients have been dealing with. 
It looks like the NHS is working on a large-scale trial for PSA testing, with almost half a million men enrolled.  That's the sort of trial that finally demonstrated that reast self-examination didn't actually save any lives in average-risk women. (NB:  BSE provides some net value for high-risk women.)  We should be watching for those results, and updating the articles as soon as we have them.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:52, 27 February 2018 (UTC)

On the worries about readers:  Most internet users prefer to look at multiple sites, as a way of making sure that they've got the whole story.  So they're going to read our articles plus articles such as [https://www.webmd.com/prostate-cancer/news/20130408/most-men-dont-need-psa-tests-doctors-group-says#1 this from WebMD], which mostly discourages it, [https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/why-i-wont-get-a-psa-test-for-prostate-cancer/ this from Scientific American], which discourages it, and [https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prostate-cancer/in-depth/prostate-cancer/art-20048087?pg=2 this from the Mayo Clinic], which mostly recommends it.  They don't necessarily read the scientific literature, but people who are seriously looking for information don't read just one webpage and assume that it's correct, either.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 19:09, 27 February 2018 (UTC)
 Yes, we have had that argument before.  Our article, and our approach to editing, is still wrong.  At minimum, as Casliber points out, we could focus on getting screening info correct, so people will know when to consult further.   I cannot answer all of this from iPad, but will when I am home.  Not only are there plenty of reviews, and guidelines left out (how about NCCN), but I will address the faulty logic about why we (Wikipedia) are wrong in our cherry picking.  We do not get to choose to preference one biased guideline, and ignore or downplay the rest.  More when I am next home from hospital. Well, yes, there is no rush for our case ... we are already too late to pay attention to screening.  One thing is life expectancy— another thing is quality of life.  When women lose their breasts (which can possibly be reconstructed) are they looking at a lifetime of urinary or fecal incontinence or reduced sexual function, even if they survive the cancer?  Apples and oranges.   ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  19:20, 27 February 2018 (UTC)
I understand that, after comparing all of the apples and oranges, the worldwide ALYs for breast cancer are approximately two to three times worse than the DALYs for prostate cancer.  None of which matters in individual cases, of course.
I do think that we should name multiple significant guidelines for common conditions like this.  The NCCN's earlier guidelines were a significant cause of PCa overdiagnosis and overtreatment (they were derided at the time as &quot;test early, test often, biopsy many&quot;), so I'm not particularly attached to the idea of including their new one (although I don't actually object to including it, either).  I wish that NICE had one, because I think it's particularly valuable to have a non-American POV (I couldn't find one, and I spent about half an hour searching for it).  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 23:36, 27 February 2018 (UTC)
Indeed, the emperor is wearing no clothes. Perhaps we can come up with a list of health screening articles to attack.

 BINGO.  PRECISELY!!  And given that I cannot deal with a chronic condition and have time to also fix the article, I hat-noted one article, that was removed, and the article was not fixed.  Can this piecemeal semi-fix approach please stop?  And there are so many MEDRS sources that are just ignored.  I have a one-hour trip each way to hospital, and am too tired today to write more.  The sources are out there to do this right, and most of you have better access to full-text of recent journal articles than I do.  I do not have time or energy to fix this.  The idea that we have any excuse for such bad text about a screening issue-- one that has kept physicians and patients alike from paying attention to valid combinations of PSA and DRE-- should be set aside, as we have a clear example of an entire suite of articles that is important and needs work.  One in six men will get prostate cancer, PSA screening saves lives, and we have an anti-PSA-screed which amounts to cherry picking of one source, and poor contextual framing on other sources. I should not have to tell the personal details of how this came about in my case-- this should only be about reliable sources, and they are there.  But I will come back another day and share the personal part so more of you might understand just how misleading our content is. Perhaps before I do that, some more medical editors will have taken the time to actually look up the dozens of recent reviews I was able to find, and get the full text of them. ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  23:22, 27 February 2018 (UTC)
Sandy, in your honor and understanding the frustration of not being able to improve vital info when you can't, I'll take a stab at the other articles. Feel free to leave a 'to-do' list on my talk page that will help me prioritize those improvements that you feel are necessary. I feel like you have the 'bigger' picture and I don't.

Screening for prostate cancer using the DRE or PSA is controversial. Some reviews state it reduces mortality.[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29406053] Others do not.[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23440794][https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/UpdateSummaryFinal/prostate-cancer-screening]


The 2012 USPSTF specific recommended against it.[https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/UpdateSummaryFinal/prostate-cancer-screening] It appears they are softening that position in 2017/2018 but this remains in a draft.[https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/draft-recommendation-statement/prostate-cancer-screening1]

By the way cancer.org says as of Feb 6th 2018 &quot;The issue of prostate cancer screening is controversial. In the United States, most prostate cancers are diagnosed as a result of screening, either with a PSA blood test or, less frequently, with a digital rectal examination. Randomized trials have yielded conflicting results.[16-18] Systematic literature reviews and meta-analyses have reported no clear evidence that screening for prostate cancer decreases the risk of death from prostate cancer, or that the benefits outweigh the harms of screening.[19,20]&quot;[https://www.cancer.gov/types/prostate/hp/prostate-treatment-pdq#link/_2090_toc]

 Made more terrible when diagnosis was delayed for four years because GP did not pay attention to regular and valid screening tools and information, meaning the cancer had time to progress when it could have been detected at a curable stage.  (I put my personal story on Anthonyhcole's talk page, as it should not be part of this discussion.)  There has long been MEDRS reliably sourced objections to the USPSTF (review posted at head of this section is useful-- please read full text).  The real issue here is the cherry picking and bias throughout out poorly written prostate cancer suite of articles.  Wikipedia outright preferenced one source (a controversial one), to end up with an article that is an anti-screening essay, while ignoring many other reliable sources.    Besides, that the main points of how to screen, when to screen, who to screen, how to correctly combine PSA and DRE into patient recommendations, are poorly covered to inaccurate. I hope you all are concerned, but past experience tells me ... to expect something different.  I do appreciate any and all attempts to clean up these articles for the next guy.  One in 6 men gets prostate cancer, so it will affect several of you here.  Good luck. ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  15:18, 28 February 2018 (UTC)
Ok, ready for an informal review of rostate screening. Over 300 of you have already taken a look. It would be great to have all the comments above related to this topic appear on the article's talk page. I haven't been able to locate the &quot;who to screen&quot;, &quot;when to screen&quot;, and the combination of screening practices. From what I got from the sources is not crystal clear on this (no algorithm). If one type of screening indicates that there may be an issue, then screening continues to rule out prostate cancer or at least to stage it.

I think that this group (taken as a whole/not every individual) appreciates the science-only POV of the USPSTF.  One criticism of the USPSTF's recommendation is that it doesn't answer the &quot;But now what?!&quot; question.  By law, they're not supposed to care whether they produce a recommendation in favor of anything.  They're only supposed to say what has been proven, to a certain scientific standard, to work.  When the answer is &quot;nothing&quot;, then they recommend against everything.  But if you're the clinician, &quot;can't do anything – nothing is proven to work!&quot; isn't functional.  USPSTF's model is that if there are no double-blind randomized trials of parachute use, then they have to recommend against using parachutes due to insufficient evidence.  This is why the USPSTF and clinician groups produce different guidelines.  They're both right:  the evidence for PSA tests alone is weak, the harms from testing are substantial – and &quot;always do nothing for all men everywhere&quot; isn't necessarily the best response.  That kind of situation is why hared decision-making in medicine is a thing.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:19, 28 February 2018 (UTC)

 I cannot tell you all how much I appreciate the work.  I disagree that USPSTF is &quot;science-only&quot;-- as the review I posted above indicates, their position is more likely driven by the economics.  I understand there are a lot of Gleason 6 men running around hysterical, and a lot of unscrupulous practitioners willing to milk that cash cow, but that is NOT our situation.  And I am in no (emotional) position to be involved in fixing these articles-- I am living the failure.  We have yet to celebrate our fifth wedding anniversary.  Four years ago, PSA screening DID detect my husband's cancer, and four years ago, his cancer was most likely treatable if not curable.  Today, it is not (based on a number of factors and features, but I digress-- it was curable when GP ignored PSA).  BOTH PSA and DRE DID DETECT the cancer, which GP ignored, because he was following USPSTF bullshit.  All I ask is that our articles use all sources to cover the issue correctly and completely-- not cherrypick and overrely on one source.  You will not find a urologist who discounts PSA screening to the extent that USPSTF recommendations advocated.  USPSTF was a player in my husband's prognosis.  Our articles can do a better job of covering the whole matter, and our articles did not do that previous to now.  It would be much too upsetting for me to look in on those articles now, and I appreciate anyone who is trying to help.  Wish I did not now understand prostate cancer as well as I do, but I do.  As a patient living the nightmare, and as an editor with knowledge of our medical sourcing and neutrality policies, I find that our articles are (were) horrible.  For a condition that will affect one in six men, that should bother us.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  16:55, 28 February 2018 (UTC)
The screening article now contains info on a variety of other diagnostic procedures.

[https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Name/uspstf-and-cost-considerations &quot;The Task Force does not consider the costs of a preventive service when determining a recommendation grade (A, B, C, D, or I). While the Task Force has congressional authority to review evidence related to cost-effectiveness, it excludes costs from its determination of the benefits and harms of a clinical preventive service. This deliberate decision was made to maintain a clear focus on the science of clinical effectiveness (i.e., &quot;what works&quot;), and not consider cost, in part to avoid any misperception that the Task Force's purpose is to limit health care based on cost.&quot;] 
I understand that the USPSTF's position is that the test hasn't been proven to have any net value and therefore shouldn't be performed (without individual reason, e.g., symptoms or family history). I don't believe that they've said the results should just be ignored after you've already run two tests and both came back positive.

*It seems to me that part of the problem is that rostate cancer screening, which refers to mass testing in a way that is currently not standard anywhere as far as I can see, is the only article, or decent section, that we have on the detection and diagnosis of prostate cancer.  Indeed that article begins &quot;Prostate cancer screening is the assessment and detection of prostate cancer in men&quot;, which is surely not a correct definition?  That article is very largely about the pros and cons of having screening programmes, with very little about the interpretation of the results and follow-up.  The diagnosis section at the main PC article seems pretty thin, and rostate-specific antigen covers in some detail the use of PSA levels after a diagnosis (D'Amico Criteria etc), but has very little on how PSA contributes to diagnosis, just: &quot;PSA levels between 4 and 10 ng/mL (nanograms per milliliter) are considered to be suspicious and consideration should be given to confirming the abnormal PSA with a repeat test. If indicated, prostate biopsy is performed to obtain tissue sample for histopathological analysis.&quot; ser:Johnbod|Johnbod (ser talk:Johnbod|talk) 15:14, 1 March 2018 (UTC)   
* Another problem right now is that the prose at rostate cancer screening is quite problematic, borderline unintelligible in several places.  There are multiple instances where I have no idea what the lead is attempting to say.  I cannot outline those—I have been at the hospital every day this week, and am heading back.  But there are significant enough prose problems that anyone should easily see them. I continue to say that articles on a highly traficced website that cannot present a minimum level of reliably sourced and decently written medical content should be gutted, so that readers will move on to the large numbers of reliable sources available.  Wikipedia is not able to systematically produce reliable medical content.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  17:08, 1 March 2018 (UTC)
I appreciate the feedback, but the definition is difficult to nail down because the sources all say: &quot;PSA&quot;=rostate cancer screening. Since there are other screening tests and exams available for detecting prostate cancer, I balk at the definition being only about PSA. All efforts to help with the article are appreciated.

Lets review rostate cancer:

*Current wording: 

Prostate cancer screening is controversial.[10][3] Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing increases cancer detection but it is controversial regarding whether it changes the risk of death from the disease.[10][11] Informed decision making is recommended when it comes to screening among those 55 to 69 years old.[12][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prostate_cancer&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=828281600&amp;oldid=828147305]

* Previous wording:

Early detection of prostate cancer via prostate cancer screening may help with prognosis and treatment before disease advances.[10] Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing increases cancer detection but also increases unneeded subsequent testing and procedures due to false positives.[1][3] As of 2013 it was unclear whether results of PSA testing change the risk of death from the prostate cancer.[11] Broad use of prostate cancer screening resulted in a reduction in mortality.[12] Informed decision making is recommended when it comes to screening among those 55 to 69 years old.[13][https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prostate_cancer&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=828281600&amp;oldid=828147305]

* The word controversial does not tell the reader much. Stating &quot;controversial&quot; even once is too much for the lead. It looks like a mini anti-screening essay is staying in the lead without any wiggle room for improvement. ser:QuackGuru|QuackGuru (ser talk:QuackGuru|talk) 17:22, 1 March 2018 (UTC)

This should really be taking place at the article on prostate cancer not here. Yes prostate cancer screening is controversial. Some well respected organizations recommend against screening. Others shared decision making with screening and no screening both being options as it is not clear what effect screening has. 
This sentence is vague &quot;Early detection of prostate cancer via prostate cancer screening may help with prognosis and treatment before disease advances&quot;. Many excellent sources says it is &quot;unclear&quot; if prostate cancer screening improves prognosis. 
We often give US government sources a great deal of weight. In this instance we are giving weight to NCI and USPSTF. These conclusions are also supported by a bunch of review articles and the WHO.
Yes in the last couple of years some in the US mostly have advocated that we simple let patients decide if they want or do not want screening. The argument is not that screening would not help anyone (yes it would help some people) but it also harms some people. So at a population level it is unclear if it helps or harms more people. ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk · pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 11:26, 2 March 2018 (UTC)

What does that mean when I initially read it? It means testing for prostate cancer is controversial (not really necessary). Skipping testing is dangerous (and life-threatening). ser:QuackGuru|QuackGuru (ser talk:QuackGuru|talk) 23:10, 2 March 2018 (UTC)
Again, &quot;testing&quot; and &quot;screening&quot; are not the same thing.  Testing is dangerous for some individuals (possible infection or damage from blood draws; needless biopsies in healthy people), and skipping testing is dangerous for other individuals (the fraction of people with cancer that would be discovered earlier by the test and that early discovery would change the actual outcome).  Screening asymptomatic people, nearly all of whom don't have a given condition (and therefore have no possibility of receiving any benefit) can have more harms than benefits.
I think that some people might be interpreting the word controversial as meaning &quot;bad&quot;.  I don't think that's a fair interpretation, but it might be common.

Doc James, you mention this discussion should be occurring at article talk.  I maintain that it belongs here, because it highlights the long-standing systemic failure of Wikipedia to produce accurate, reliable, unbiased, updated, well-written content -- not even on an important article about a condition that will affect one in six men.  A week and hundreds of edits later, the article has not significantly improved, reflects multiple instances of medical misunderstanding and confusion, is still POV, and still has garbled prose in the lead.Is there anyone participating in the editing of this article who has experience with cancer, other than Johnbod (whose [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=828265921 post at 15:14, 1 March 2018 UTC] indicates a real understanding of the problem?) Has anyone who is participating in editing the article actually read the full text of the March 2018 review I posted above?  I see three direct quotes from the article abstract have been added, but no overall correction to the article based on a read of the full text of the review.  The appearance is that someone grabbed quotes from the abstract without reading full text.  Doc James, have you read the full text of the review, because your statements here (and WAID's) continue to advance points that do not indicate that you have digested the review. You continue (on this talk page) to advance positions taken by government entities that have been shown to be wrong and dangerous. If you intend to ignore the review, knowing it clearly states that PSA screening reduces death, then please state so clearly and take responsibility for such a dramatic position. I don't believe that they've said the results should just be ignored after you've already run two tests and both came back positive.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:59, 1 March 2018 (UTC)  How are you using the term, come back positive?  What, in your view, is a &quot;positive&quot; PSA test?  Do you have some understanding of when to watch PSA levels, when to advise followup, when to make sure a good DRE is done, when to refer on to urology, etc?  Screening for prostate cancer is not a matter of a binary outcome (positive or negative test). Testing is dangerous for some individuals (possible infection or damage from blood draws; needless biopsies in healthy people) ... WhatamIdoing (talk) 01:34, 3 March 2018 (UTC)  These arguments are not persuasive: we have MEDRS sources.  Have you read the full text of the March 2018 review I posted?  There are many that say the same. BTW, when a man gets a physical, he has blood drawn anyway.  If unscrupulous or uninformed physicians are performing unneeded biopsies, because they don't know how to interpret PSA and DRE, or nervous men are incorrectly educated about how to interpret PSA and demand unnecessary testing, that is a separate (education) matter.   ... and skipping testing is dangerous for other individuals (the fraction of people with cancer that would be discovered earlier by the test and that early discovery would change the actual outcome).  WhatamIdoing (talk) 01:34, 3 March 2018 (UTC)  I hope you are not equating the unlikely &quot;possible infection from a blood draw&quot; with the serious issue of missing cancer.  We have a March 2018 review which explains how the USPSTF got it so wrong, and states that When correctly interpreted, the data are clear:  PSA screening significantly reduces suffering and death from PCa(ncer). Screening asymptomatic people, nearly all of whom don't have a given condition ... WhatamIdoing (talk) 01:34, 3 March 2018 (UTC) &quot;Nearly all of whom&quot; is misleading-- one in six is a significant number of men with cancer. The current lead asserts that: &quot;It is not clear whether early detection reduces mortality rates.&quot;  Catalona March 2018 disagrees, and clearly states that PSA screening reduces death.  The second sentence of the lead asserts bias as fact.&quot;Screening for prostate cancer may include the use of the digital rectal examination (DRE), during which the prostate is assessed manually through the wall of the rectum or the measurement of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the blood.&quot;  People.  Really?  This is the lead!  Unconvolute the wording, and add punctuation.  &quot;The evidence remains insufficient to determine whether screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) or digital rectal exam (DRE) reduces mortality from prostate cancer.&quot;  Again, referencing government sources to assert a statement as fact, when Catalona (and many others) lay out the problems clearly.  PSA screening reduces death from prostate cancer.  &quot;A 2013 Cochrane review concluded it results in &quot;no statistically significant difference in prostate cancer-specific mortality between men randomized to the screening and control groups.&quot;&quot;  Cochrane 2013, Catalona 2018.  Sloppy preference for Cochrane, and again, it appears that editors have not read Catalona.   &quot;The American studies were determined to have a high bias. European studies included in this review were of low bias and one reported ... &quot;  WHAT American studies?  This is the lead of the article, and the issue of the American v European studies has not even been introduced yet.  How is the reader to know WHAT American studies are being referenced?  (Hint, the ones that were misinterpreted.)&quot;Others recommend screening with a PSA ... &quot; Others WHO?  The previous sentence referenced studies ... who is doing the recommending here?  This lead is full of garbled prose.  Besides, it is a non-sensical sentence.  &quot;Others recommend screening with a PSA test or DRE who are at high risk and anticipate a long life expectancy.&quot; So, hundreds of edits later, the article is still not only biased-- the writing is horrible.  I will check back in a few days, and tag the article POV or whatever it still is if these items are not corrected (throughout the prostate cancer and PSA articles).  Catalona specifically details the FLAWS in the USPSTF recommendations, and yet we have Wikipedia editors still referencing those deadly mistakes, while ignoring other sources. A big enhancement to the article and the lead would be an understanding and mention of indolent tumors. &quot;Screening for PCa has been challenged because of concerns about the risk of triggering unnecessary biopsies and the over diagnosis and over treatment of screen-detected, indolent tumors with possible untoward side effects&quot;.  We really don't need to be suggesting on this talk page that the issue is possible infection from a blood draw, when we are comparing to cancer.  If two editors want to ignore sources, then please say so outright and take responsibility for the information you spread on a highly trafficked website.  There are already enough stupid doctors out there a) ordering biopsies when they shouldn't, or b) ignoring valid prostate cancer screening.  Maybe Wikipedia can get it right.   PS- there are NO urologists or oncologists on the USPSTF panel, but anyone who read Catalona would know that. I suspect that anyone saying the flawed USPSTF recommendation was science-based, and not economic-based, did not read the review I posted.  Are we not ashamed?  Or is the problem here that this is an issue affecting men v. women?  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  09:57, 3 March 2018 (UTC)
I was referring to the article on rostate cancer not rostate cancer screening. The first article's lead accurately reflecting NCI/NIH/CDC/USPSTF, Cochrane, and the WHO.
We have some sources that say PSA screening reduces prostate cancer specific mortality and others that say it does not. The more important question though is does it reduce overall mortality when used as a screening test? 
This is not a significant concern &quot;possible infection from a blood draw&quot;. What is a concern is that if a PSA comes back positive people often than go for biopsies and if the biopsies come back positive people can end up with fairly extensive surgery when the cancer in question was unlikely to have caused them any problems. 
Catalona is NOT the only source. We have a 2018 draft from USPSTF and we have a Feb 2018 NCI review. Both are also reasonable sources. ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk · pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 14:19, 3 March 2018 (UTC)

Here is rates of cases of prostate cancer and mortality from prostate cancer in the USA.[https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/prost.html]
We see a huge drop in prostate cancer cases between 1992 and 2014. Why because screening has decreased.
We also see a steady drop in deaths from prostate cancer from 1992 and 2014. It results in the death of 2 per 10,000 males per year. And current rates of death are lower than at any time since recording began in 1975. 
For screening tests one is looking for independent epidemiologists not urologists who hold patents in the test in question.

The World Cancer Report in 2014 says &quot;Screening for prostate cancer is controversial. Screening with serum PSA level has increased detection of all prostate cancers, including indolent prostate cancers. PSA emerged as one of the most-used serum tests to screen for cancer, particularly in the USA but also in Europe. Recent data from the Prostate, Lung, Colon, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial showed no benefit to screening, and the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer showed a 20% reduction in relative risk of cancer-specific mortality, which translated into an absolute reduction of prostate cancer-related deaths of 0.71 per 1000. Each trial has criticisms that may or may not have affected power and outcome, although the rate ratios comparing screening to not screening are similar. Definitive evidence for or against screening is still lacking [15].&quot;
&quot;The detection via screening of both clinically significant and potentially clinically insignificant prostate cancer has created a dilemma as to which patients should receive aggressive treatment [16]. Overtreatment of screen detected tumours is a major concern. In the USA, most men with screen-detected cancers undergo aggressive treatment. Such treatment is unlikely to yield a survival benefit in those with indolent disease or in men older than 65 years, but it can result in a considerable decrease in quality of life as a result of potentially persistent urinary, sexual, and bowel dysfunction [16].&quot;ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk · pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 14:42, 3 March 2018 (UTC)
You wrote &quot;The more important question though is does it reduce overall mortality when used as a screening test?&quot; That question is not the right question to ask.

Suitability of primary sources

;Suitability of primary source material that is in collective agreement when secondary sources are lacking or absent on a subject that had its genesis in high-quality, medical literature for 1-2+ years ago.

It’s disheartening to see when all of one’s efforts for bringing a collection of primary source knowledge to the table that points to the same thing when there has been no secondary source material on it for a very long time (1-2 years or longer), is quickly taken away, leaving the edit one has made a husk of its former self when it comes to accurate and comprehensive referencing or gone entirely. As mentioned, my concern relates specifically to areas where primary sources through many independent teams of researchers conducting studies on a common research subject all point to the same thing on a subject that had its genesis in high-quality, medical literature for 1-2+ years ago. I have quoted some passages from P:MEDRS partly on the feasibility of primary sources in this situation.
Quoting from P:MEDRS: “Text that relies on primary sources should usually have minimal undue weight, only be used to describe conclusions made by the source, and must describe these findings clearly so that all editors even those without specialist knowledge can check sources.” ” Keeping an article up-to-date while maintaining the more-important goal of reliability is important. These instructions are appropriate for actively researched areas with many primary sources and several reviews and may need to be relaxed in areas where little progress is being made or where few reviews are published.”
I think that edits with primary sources that qualify for the inclusion made by these terms and the title of this topic should be allowed to stay. Right now I’m trying to discern the suitability of a number of primary sources, and one secondary source, for updating the schizophrenia page on the well documented effect of negative symptom improvement from several (if not all) atypical antipsychotics. This has been known for decades for medicine like clozapine and has become more relevant with some more modern antipsychotics like asenapine and cariprazine. I have to say that finding secondary sources and an umbrella reference for this area, as with many other medicine articles, has proven to be like finding a needle in a haystack. The sources I’m interested in adding to the schizophrenia article are listed below. Meanwhile many articles are mouldering away with outdated medical information because of a lack of up-to-date secondary sources and because of unnecessary deletions of primary sources that point to the same thing on a subject where secondary sources have been absent for a long time. Would like to hear some opinions on the subject. ser:Reixus|Reixus ser Talk:Reixus|[Talk] pecial:Contributions/Reixus|[Contribs] 08:03, 9 March 2018 (UTC)

*From a policy point of view I think the issue is that &quot;primary source knowledge&quot; is a contradiction in terms. Material in primary sources is more information, which only rises to the level of knowledge when subject to analysis and synthesis in secondary sources. The information in primary sources is often wrong - building content on it effectively makes Wikipedia an ersatz secondary source; we should be a tertiary source building on (yes) 'knowledge' embodied in secondary sources.

*I oppose any further laxness with evidence on the schizophrenia article. The fact that this information hasn't been reviewed over a period of several years is likely a red flag that it is controversial in the scientific community — and thus does not belong in our article. This provision to allow primary sources exists primarily for rare topics, such as lström syndrome, where we allow a &quot;case report and review&quot; article (there are some other things that should be removed from that article though). There is no reason to think that information on Schizophrenia should be locked away, with hundreds of reviews being published every year. It's another thing when there is one review article on a disease every five or so years... In fact I support stricter rules for major diseases such as Schizophrenia, because narrative review articles are equally plagued by nonsense. Here is a narrative review that argues that Schizophrenia is caused by possession by evil spirits: MID|23269538, Schizophrenia or possession?, Journal of Religion and Health Jun. 2014Quote from the abstract: alkquote|Demonic possession can manifest with a range of bizarre behaviors which could be interpreted as a number of different psychotic disorders with delusions and hallucinations. The hallucination in schizophrenia may therefore be an illusion—a false interpretation of a real sensory image formed by demons. A local faith healer in our region helps the patients with schizophrenia. His method of treatment seems to be successful because his patients become symptom free after 3 months. Therefore, it would be useful for medical professions to work together with faith healers to define better treatment pathways for schizophrenia.
This is ostensibly peer-reviewed, PubMed-indexed, and a review article. Let's not open the flood-gates more than they already are.

 Re: The quote from Neuroskeptic: Many thanks for this, I think that's important information that we should probably add to the corresponding wiki pages. I added the effect size of the Cipriani study yesterday to the pages on SSRI and antidepressants.

Thanks for your original post.  There are reviews from the past few years.  It appears that you are trying to use primary sources to build a mini-review argue against these actual reviews.  This is not what we do here per P:MEDREV.  We are editors, not authors. ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 23:38, 9 March 2018 (UTC)
Thanks, I also appreciate the views expressed by you all. My position was based not on an argument against the reviews but a support of them. I'm trying to show that several primary sources, in addition to one secondary/primary source, all reached a conclusion about one or another (or in one case all collectively) atypical antipsychotic: that according to their studies, the atypical antipsychotics mentioned in them effectively reduce negative symptoms of schizophrenia. However, with what you just linked, I see now that my idea prospect fits in this category from P:MEDREV and means that this prospect I had is a no-no: &quot;Primary sources should not be cited with intent of &quot;debunking&quot;, contradicting, or countering any conclusions made by secondary sources.&quot; Moreover, I agree with the process many of you spoke to the effect of. The idea of scrupulously analyzing results of multiple backgrounds to glean the the gems from the rough when making a secondary source. A little bit skeptical of the suggestion by ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn that information in primary sources is often wrong. What if all the primary sources analyzed and synthesized through a secondary source were wrong, would that make the secondary source right? Another thing I found that makes things a bit confusing is this information on WP:MEDREV: &quot;Primary sources may be presented together with secondary sources.&quot; Can the primary sources then by proxy of the secondary source be used to debunk, contradict, or counter another secondary source? Well, it's not that important. The key thing is that I'll now be judicious about striving to strictly find secondary sources for making edits on biomedical information, save for the few rare exceptions mentioned for primary sources.

While an essay, |Jytdog's ikipedia:Why MEDRS? is a good explanation why MEDRS sources are preferred on medical articles. Secondary sources are often less reliable than primary sources for raw facts since they tend to be secondhand information and thus oversimplified, but that is more a concern in popular culture and in non-medical science. Worth noting finally that &quot;secondary source&quot; and &quot;MEDRS compliant source&quot; are in no way synonyms, there are plenty of sources that are q|an author's own thinking based on primary sources, generally at least one step removed from an event.

Atypical Antipsychotics
For starters, I find it hard to take seriously any scientist who uses this term with a straight face, given that the side effect profiles of both first gen and second gen psych drugs are so wildly different that many are more similar to each other than their own &quot;group&quot; (eg: chlorpromazine, olanzapine, clozapine are highly anticholinergic, and risperidone, amisulpride and haloperidol have virtually no anticholinergic activity but do have parkinsonian effects.). They'll push the serotonin activity...but amisulpride has none and aripiprazole has little (ironically my personal experience is that these two have the most effect on negative symptoms (after clozapine) but that is completely anecdotal). The [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17675172 Grayson paper] has so many assumptions in it is funny - e.g. (a) that PCP intoxication is chemically equal to psychosis, (b) that rat and human brain chemistry are similar enough to make an assumption, (c) that the rat's non-recognition was not simply a spot of bradykinesia from haloperidol, that (d) clozapine and risperidone are waving the banner for the &quot;atypical class&quot; and hence an assumption about the &quot;group&quot; can be made. But never mind, I have seen this study quoted at meetings as to why typicals are toxic and atypicals are neuroprotective....ser:Casliber|Cas Liber (ser talk:Casliber|talk · pecial:Contributions/Casliber|contribs) 13:11, 11 March 2018 (UTC)

The study showed a 50% PANSS score superiority of asenapine 5 mg 2x/d versus 3 mg/d risperidone. What is your take on the dosing used? Hard to argue with asenapine's binding profile too. Almost all atypical antipsychotics are sedating (something solved for most of them just by taking it at night, the H1 receptor effect desensitizes after a while and D2 antagonism (and in somes cases partial agonism leaning more towards the antagonistic side) has also been shown to be sedating) and result in weight gain.
Err, no - not many antipsychotics are sedating. In the highly sedating category we have CPZ, olanzapine, quetiapine and clozapine. In practice, just about everything else falls in a somewhat mildly (but not often, but occasionally alot) sedating - haloperidol = asenapine = risperidone = lurasidone = ziprasidone = paliperidone, and then there are amisulpride and aripiprazole which can be either like that bunch or quite activating. Anyway, that's my take after prescribing all these drugs for hundreds (if not thousands) of people over the past 25 years. ser:Casliber|Cas Liber (ser talk:Casliber|talk · pecial:Contributions/Casliber|contribs) 10:43, 12 March 2018 (UTC)

Was talking about the negative symptom reduction in the two groups. Yeah, EPS is often very problematic with high potency antipsychotics like risperidone and haloperidol. High potency antipsychotics tend to have &quot;tight and long&quot; binding to the D2 receptor which can lead to EPS becoming very problematic, whereas lower potency antipsychotics like clozapine and quetiapine tend to have a more rapid dissociation from the D2 receptor (which last long enough to produce an antipsychotic effect), and this rapid dissociation property is postulated to reduce these side effects. ser:Reixus|Reixus ser Talk:Reixus|[Talk] pecial:Contributions/Reixus|[Contribs] 10:03, 14 March 2018 (UTC)

What I think would work best is if it followed a plan like ikipedia:WikiProject Dinosaurs/Dinosaur collaboration - namely that there is no time limit.

I think that the overall difficulty is that relatively few people want to collaborate, once they realize that &quot;collaboration&quot; means &quot;intentionally work on articles that I don't necessarily care about&quot;.

I don't think that's it either. To be honest, I think the project halted on ransverse myelitis because of how rare that disease is. Many editors, including me are motivated by people reading and being helped by our edits. If we want to resurrect the project I would suggest sticking to the 1000 top articles at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:West.andrew.g/Popular_medical_pages], at least for starters. Some of the articles there are still really low quality, even those on comparatively much more common diseases.

I volunteer in Articles for Creation and ran across this draft: raft:King-Devick technologies, inc. (King-Devick Test)

It is extremely, very comprehensive, down to paragraph after paragraph citing the details of specific studies with positive conclusions for the Test.

Could someone more savvy let AFC know if this is a really legit new article, or if this is a self-serving POV advert? Please feel free to just post your thoughts directly at the top of the page itself so other AFC reviewers can see it, or discuss here and ping me, as you like.

See P:PROJSCOPE.  An article is in scope if the participants want to support it (even if you think they shouldn't) and it's out of scope if they don't (even if you think they should).
My guess is that the folks here are going to be interested in un violence and un violence in the United States, but less interested in andgun, and much less interested in irearms.  Does anybody have a different POV? 
Also, in the future, please don't remove WikiProject tags just because someone outside of a group has complained about them.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 05:36, 15 March 2018 (UTC)

I notice that un violence in the United States is missing some medicine-specific information, such as Florida banning physicians from even gently inquiring about whether families were leaving loaded guns within reach of kids (there was an exception for suicidal kids).  (The law was [https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/02/17/515764335/court-strikes-down-florida-law-barring-doctors-from-discussing-guns-with-patient finally overturned] last year as an unconstitutional infringement on physician's free speech rights.)  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 06:14, 15 March 2018 (UTC)

irearm and andgun should definitely not be. I am more sympathetic to un violence which has a significant public health perspective.
I tried to think of some parallel examples, so I looked at sbestos (analogous to firearm) and ealth impact of asbestos (kind of analogous to gun violence), expecting the former not to be in WikiProject Medicine, but the latter to be. I was surprised that they both are. oad traffic safety is also in WikiProject Medicine. omestic violence is too. Those examples would support including un violence. ser:Bondegezou|Bondegezou (ser talk:Bondegezou|talk) 16:24, 15 March 2018 (UTC)

I find that I agree with ser:Bondegezou|Bondegezou.  Natureium, those subjects might be dominated by another discipline in the real world, but it's not a distinct group of editors on this wiki.  WikiProject &quot;Medicine&quot; doesn't restrict itself to a narrow definition of medicine (or a consistent one:  we reject all articles about hospitals, which are clearly part of the structure of conventional medicine, but we accept articles about nursing, chiropractic, and altmed, all of which are also distinct disciplines).  Also, this &quot;categorization&quot; isn't visible in the article, so if it's meant to be a &quot;political statement&quot;, then it's a very ineffective one.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:35, 15 March 2018 (UTC)

Doing that is just opening up the door to drive-by-tagging abuse.

This is a quite normal technique - finding l|citation needed tags, and replace them with some document on the server which you want to spam.  Specifically, find articles in your attention area - say a medical technique - find those with a missing citations, and then just spam your site there.  To the untrained eye the references look to-the-point and appropriate, and there is a significant chance that your spam stays.  Often it involves blogs or small (very localized) companies.  See P:REFSPAM.

In case of doubt, post the spammed links to T:WPSPAM - if only to create a record, all others can quite directly go for blacklisting on T:SBL.  As it often includes SEOs (which tend to use multiple IPs/accounts) and persistent editors, all other methods of mitigation do not really help, the links are generally not suitable anywhere (except for primary data on own articles, if notability is reasonable - which can easily be handled by whitelisting).  Please don't waste your time keeping reverting or removing this stuff (if possible, look for cross-wiki problems and go to the meta blacklist, but COIBot will take care of showing that).

Regarding the blog, I will blacklist material that is offered for paid spamming, even if it wasn't spammed yet if it is along material that was spammed.  --ser:Beetstra|Dirk Beetstra ser_Talk:Beetstra|T pecial:Contributions/Beetstra|C 07:49, 18 March 2018 (UTC)

The claim, that these videos are exempt from sources/citations per P:LEAD is false. As ser:SlimVirgin notes above, these videos are not leads, and WP:V applies. See the discussion at alk:Epilepsy#Osmosis video. In particular both ser:CFCF|CFCF and ser:Doc James have made claims that these videos are &quot;near-exact copies of the ledes&quot; or qualify as leads as they summarise the article. This is a level of falsehood, easily demonstrated to be bogus. See alk:Epilepsy#Does the video summarise the article for just one example. Other editors have noted above that videos they examined are not equivalent to the article either, and make separate claims and present separate facts.

Doc James is now edit warring (again) on this subject.

*I [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Epilepsy&amp;diff=832872503&amp;oldid=832153553 removed the video from epilepsy] and opened a discussion on talk  citing P:V as the reason.
*James [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Epilepsy&amp;diff=832903228&amp;oldid=832872503 restored this without gaining consensus] and made false claims that WP:V did not apply per WP:LEAD.
*Graham [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Epilepsy&amp;diff=832903885&amp;oldid=832903228 removed the video again] as no consensus had been reached.
*James [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Epilepsy&amp;diff=832904578&amp;oldid=832903885 restored the video again] and notes consensus is required to revert Doc James, not the other way round

The edit warring, justified by false claims, and reasoning that the rules apply to other people, I'm asking interested parties to examine this dispute. Others such as ser:Clayoquot|Clayoquot agree they are not leads. ser:SlimVirgin, our resident expert in P:V says they need sources and citations to sources, and the epilepsy video has none. The video is not a summary of the article in the slightest -- it is a training video for medical students drawing on different material.

The video should be removed again from pilepsy and all other articles per WP:V.

*Oppose a topic ban for anyone (at least at this time). I've just read this entire discussion from the top, and it seems to me that editors ought to separate two topics: (1) what is good content, and (2) whether anyone has engaged in disruptive conduct, should really be treated entirely separately. I think that there needs to be a community-wide RfC about such videos, because all that is happening here is two entrenched camps. And instead of having the RfC ask &quot;do we want Osmosis videos or not?&quot;, there should be some legwork done first. Editors should devise a list of requirements that any such video must meet in order to be used on Wikipedia. I bet most of you can actually agree in principle about that. After that, the community should be asked to approve, or disapprove and revise, such requirements. Once there is a community consensus about the minimum requirements for a video to be included on a page, then those requirements should be enforced: no non-compliant video will be allowed at en-Wiki. Editors can ask Osmosis to change videos to satisfy the requirements, and if Osmosis does so (which they seem to be willing to discuss), then that's good – and if they do not cooperate fully, then no video on the page. --ser:Tryptofish|Tryptofish (ser talk:Tryptofish|talk) 20:33, 28 March 2018 (UTC)
*Support the proposed topic ban.  In the past, James has driven away an expert on the subject who clearly had much to offer. He has a cavalier attitude to the core principles of Wikipedia and collaborative contributing. He seems to think &quot;consensus&quot;  means agreeing with him and never considers for a second that he might be wrong. His arrogance knows no bounds. He is difficult to work with, often doesn't bother with edit summaries - an example of his arrogance - and he has an appalling grasp of prose.  He once ripped an FA to shreds  without any prior discussion. I admire his enthusiasm and the time he has given to the project, but we cannot  allow him to become a law unto himself. With regard to Colin's seeming lack of  activity, this is irrelevant to this discussion, but for what it is worth, James's attitude is almost certainly entirely responsible for our losing Colin's reviews of medical articles at P:FAC; he is one is  of our best FA reviewers.  It seems to me that James strives to dumb down Wikipedia when others strive to improve it as a solidly reliable source. Our policies on verification and so forth  have done us proud. James's hard work and apparent popularity must not be used undermine and negate our core principles. Colin and I have had our disagreements, but the outcome of our listening to one another has always been productive. James needs to learn some humility.  He needs us more than we need him.  ser:Graham Beards|Graham Beards (ser talk:Graham Beards|talk) 20:38, 28 March 2018 (UTC)

*Support.Comment.  I think it is pretty clear that Doc James should be seriously encouraged to step back from the video topic, but there is no chance (given what this Project has become) of that realization happening on this particular page.  For all of us, who worked together for years to create MEDMOS and MEDRS and quality content, it is very sad to see years of work and content creation undermined and endangered in the interest of external efforts.  Would there be a chance that some could see that's how others see it?  On this page (unlike in the broader community discussion at Jimbo's) we are only seeing more entrenchment.  I would certainly hope we could find a way to work towards seeing this video infringement and entrenchment from different sides, and understand how much these actions undermine MEDMOS, MEDRS, and everything this project built and stood for for so many years.  Of course I want Doc James to stop edit warring problematic content back in. I will support this if I must, but I will still plead for understanding. I also don't want to see the med project, with pages I helped build and promote, be the next Infobox clowns.  That is where we are.  Please, Doc, do not force me to Support this; please listen to what is being said.

What, instead it is to bring a discussion to half a dozen venues and throw mud? Comments have been made basically to the affect that no one supports these videos but me. A RfC is useful to at least show that this over the topic rhetoric in incorrect. Are the videos perfect? No definitely not. But Wikipedia is a work in progress and is far from perfect itself.

&quot;Uncollaborative&quot;? Let me get this straight? You commission a video from a private firm and insert it in an article. An editor complains about something in the video but is unable to edit it to fix it. They complain about it and remove the video. You then reinsert the video without discussion or consensus. You then make promises that you will ask Osmosis to fix the problem. Months pass. Osmosis fix some of it but not all, because to do that would require too much work and doesn't fit their target audience (medical students). Editor give up. What in any way shape or form does that represent collaborative editing on a wiki. James, would you please, please, take this Citizendium nonsense to another project.

This is the final straw in what Graham describes on this page as your cavalier arrogance.  Everyone opposed to what is going on here held off on tossing up an RFC, so that a responsible, neutral, unbiased RFC could be drafted, that would not waste community time, would truly resolve the matter, and would allow us to move forward as collaborative colleagues.  You decided, unilaterally (just as you did with this video venture) to launch a biased RFC.  Yes, you should be topic banned from the video situation.

Are Doc James and CFCF going to edit war on those too? If not, why not? I would be interested to know what policy grounds they have for why I should not remove some more. None of them meet WP:V. -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 20:29, 28 March 2018 (UTC)
They do meet P:V and are based on articles. The specific cases you've linked have all been challenged individually, which is vastly different from simply removing videos without so much the prospect of discussion. I have not looked into the specifics of those cases, but would imagine some solution could be found. Simply removing things without discussing the issues is P:DISRUPTIVE, P:NOTCONSENSUS and indicates P:NOTHERE because it is not in the search of a solution. Also note that for the time being, especially with the current ongoing discussion any individual challenges you make are likely to be interpreted as P:DISRUPTIVE, as they are based on your opposition to videos and not specific issues. Blanket removal can only be possible with community-wide consensus. ser:CFCF|Carl Fredrikser talk:CFCF| talk 20:35, 28 March 2018 (UTC)
ser:CFCF|CFCF They are not &quot;based on articles&quot;. You have made this claim twice now (&quot;been near-exact copies of the ledes&quot;). These statements are quite easily demonstrated to be false. Not even a tiny bit false, but great big Trumpy pants-on-fire false. You've been challenged on this, have had opportunity to check again and correct yourself, and instead repeat the false claim. CFCF, you forget that the onus is on the person adding material to show it meets WP:V and other policies. Any editor, in good faith, can challenge and remove material they believe to fail that. That you are now knowingly restoring the material puts you in an extremely dodgy position and if you keep doing it, a block is likely. -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 20:50, 28 March 2018 (UTC)

 4th P:FAC nomination of -Hydroxy β-methylbutyric acid 
esolved
ile:Beta-Hydroxy beta-methylbutyric acid.svg|thumb|120 px|Beta-Hydroxy beta-methylbutyric acid
Since this article is now a GA, I re-nominated this article at FAC a little under 2 weeks ago: ikipedia:Featured article candidates/Beta-Hydroxy beta-methylbutyric acid/archive4. 

It would be very helpful and very much appreciated if other editors from this WikiProject would comment and review the article against the P:Featured article criteria.  It is incredibly difficult to get a pharmacology article promoted at FAC, and unless editors who are familiar with the subject matter (i.e., editors from P:MED/P:PHARM/P:MCB) review and comment on a pharmacology nomination at FAC, it very likely will not be promoted. For instance, mphetamine required five consecutive featured article nominations before being promoted in P:Featured article candidates/Amphetamine/archive5 for that very reason.

So, if you're an active editor at WT:MED and edit drug articles on a somewhat regular basis, your input at the this nomination would be invaluable. Moreover, if any of you intends to nominate a drug article at FAC at some point in the future, reviewing another pharmacology nomination as well as reading the reviews by other editors at that nomination will give you a good idea of what to expect and prepare for at your own FAC nomination(s). 

For those who haven't reviewed an article at FAC before, ikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2008-04-07/Dispatches|this is the &quot;FAQ&quot; page for reviewing articles at FAC.  ser:Seppi333|Seppi333 (ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert 2¢) 03:38, 2 February 2018 (UTC)
|Seppi333, I did the GA review on orepinephrine but I couldn't do an FA review on my own for the first time. So I would be glad to help with the review and think if we could find another co-reviewer then this could really happen. I know there are biochemists in the project but can't recall who they are at the moment. I have created articles on medications, a degree in chemistry and coursework in pharmacology. I can't evaluate the referencing of an article because, well, I'm not the best editor for this task. The guild of copy editors might like to help. I would really be thrilled to see this happen.

The main difference between reviewing a FAC and a GA candidate is that there's no official reviewer or structured process for reviewing and the reviewers aren't the ones who decide whether or not the article is promoted or fails the FAC process, although there are structured review criteria.  To review a FAC, you basically just add your comments about the article's compliance with the FA criteria to the FAC nomination page and, if the nomination has received sufficient support within 2 months of the nomination date, the FAC coordinators will promote it; otherwise, the nomination is archived (i.e., the article fails). 
Just to clarify: the FAC coordinators decide whether or not an article is promoted based upon their assessment of the consensus among reviewers about its compliance with the FA criteria.  If 3 reviewers oppose for a stupid reason (e.g., &quot;P:I just don't like it|I just don't like it&quot;) and 5 support it after extensively reviewing the article against the criteria, the coordinators will probably promote the article to FA status. ser:Seppi333|Seppi333 (ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert 2¢) 02:55, 5 February 2018 (UTC)
