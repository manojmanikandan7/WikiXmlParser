		<segment id="id17903339">Childhood obesity

I've just merged a redundant article into childhood obesity.  It contained some unreferenced medical claims.  The studies cited in the existing text may also confuse correlation and causation.  It would be very helpful if someone familiar with the state of scientific consensus on these issue reviewed the article for accuracy.  Thanks, Beland (talk) 22:29, 28 May 2008 (UTC)

Mmmm, spammy

But there's still value, so I'm throwing this before the court of medical opinion.  , latest round is adding a link to a website.  There's value, perhaps as an EL, but is it enough?  Hm...  Advise, guide, delete, block, I'm throwing this in the lap of whoever's in the lounge.  WLU (talk) 22:57, 28 May 2008 (UTC)

The images seem copyrighted and are watermarked, I would be inclined to delete them and revert for spamming. Don't believe the 3D effect adds enough to deserve external link, because it lacks a general educational context. Wouldn't directly block, just engage in discussion -it's probably well intended. --Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 23:05, 28 May 2008 (UTC)
Linking WikiProject Medicine to Wikisurgery

I am an editor of Wikisurgery - a free wiki with a focus on operative detail. 

The detail takes the form of operative scripts.

A script consists of an unlimited number of very small operative steps, each backed up by an unlimited amount of expert information.

A script may contain 10 times or more the information in an operative textbook or in a &quot;How I do it&quot; article.
http://www.wikisurgery.com/index.php?title=Aortic-aneurysm-graft-Operationscript 

The scripts may form an experience equivalent for the trainee. 

For the trained surgeon, they should provoke discussion, argument and ultimately, progress in operative technique.

Surgeons can produce their own variants of the scripts to suit their exact preferences.

Derivatives of the Wikisurgery scripts include operative training programs for basic surgical skills and basic laparoscopy.
http://www.wikisurgery.com/index.php?title=Scalpel_07_How_to_use_a_scalpel
 
http://www.wikisurgery.com/index.php?title=Basic_laparoscopy:_Cholecystectomy_07.08.00_On-patient_equipment_preparation_and_checks

There is also detailed customisable information for patients undergoing the operations described in Wikisurgery scripts.
http://www.wikisurgery.com/index.php?title=Aortic-aneurysm-graft-PatientInformation

I think that your users would benefit from this new, very detailed, but loosely formatted and ever changing information.

One problem is how to connect with the precise, referenced style of WikiProject Medicine.

Rather than constraining Wikisurgery information into the WikiProject Medicine format, I suggest that simple links between the two 

systems would be beneficial to both.

The content of Wikisurgery is to be peer reviewed and articles (over 1000 at present) are to be &quot;Approved&quot; as in Citizendium.

http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/DNA. 

Wikisurgery and its sister publication, the International Journal of Surgery, have editorial boards of very high surgical standing.

Would WikiProject Medicine consider treating Wikisurgery as a reliable source of information suitable for linking?

Michael Harpur Edwards  (talk) 10:36, 28 May 2008 (UTC)

Thanks for engaging in a general discussion over these links, vs just inserting into multiple articles. Generally  nor , and we certainly do not give instruction to readers or specifically advise looking off site as per [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vasectomy&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=214624950 this edit]. However a few external links are used in such templates as  &amp; , but there is no infobox (yet) used on articles to do with operations or procedures. Perhaps other project members might like to comment on that too.
You state &quot;is to be peer reviewed&quot;, does that mean that they are not yet peer reviewed, if so then that IMHO is problematic:
* A wiki would generally count as either original research, or if of an encylopaedic nature (such as Wikipedia itself) then a tertiary source (see  )
* Without clear peer review, then also need to consider  with its caveats of what helps make a particular case a .
David Ruben  Talk  14:09, 28 May 2008 (UTC)

 I just had a look around your Wikisurgery website. I'm not a surgeon, but I see that it could become very useful for trainee surgeons, and potentially even senior surgeons. At the moment, the quality is rather variable, with some pages containing long blocks of text. This makes difficult reading. Similarly, the referencing is variable. At present, I do not consider the site to be sufficiently reliable for Wikipedia's standards. I wish your contributors good luck with your endeavour. Axl (talk) 15:58, 28 May 2008 (UTC)
Had a look at the Aortic-aneurysm-graft-Operationscript link that you suggested above - huge amount of detail and clearly shows potential for Wikisurgery as a tool for surgeons. That level of detail though is not appropriate to link to for a general readership from Wikipedia (in similar vein to Wikipedia not having links for a particular car to its online garage maintenance manual). The Aortic-aneurysm-graft-PatientInformation.pdf link though seems better, although information is very specific as an info sheet for one hospital
* eg the how to complain gives details for that one hospital
* clinical information also seems very specific - is time in ITU, maintenance on epidural analgesia, stay in hospital etc fairly uniform between hospitals or is there considerable variation that the hospital-specific infosheet might mislead patients due to be operated at other hospitals ?
Final query, you mentioned script generated material, but the wikisurgey links I've seen all have empty wikipages with links to fixed PDF format documents - could you clarify this :-)
I applaud the wikisurgery concept and the willingness for specialists to offer their expertise in a freely accessible wiki format with logical hierarchical &amp; comprehensive layout... I'm just not sure of appropriateness to cross link (certainly not for surgeon's material, and as for patient infosheets... see  &quot;Not professional advice -- If you need specific advice (for example, medical, legal, financial, or risk management) please seek a professional who is licensed or knowledgeable in that area.&quot; and the wording of the) - lets see what others think. David Ruben  Talk  21:30, 28 May 2008 (UTC)

I don't see why we couldn't link to Wikisurgery from articles on surgical procedures if the article on Wikisurgery is of good quality. I would treat this on a case-by-case basis. The questions is also: how could Wikipedia benefit from a collaboration with Wikisurgery, apart from just links? --Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 22:58, 28 May 2008 (UTC)

MHE asks, Would WikiProject Medicine consider treating Wikisurgery as a reliable source of information suitable for linking?
&quot;Reliable source&quot; is used here as a , and I thinnk that the question here is actually just about external links, not about using it as a reference in an article.  Generally, I could imagine a link to some Wikisurgery pages in articles about techniques, but not probably not so much in articles about diseases and conditions.  So &quot;How to hold a scalpel&quot; might be an interesting external link with encyclopedic value in Scalpel, but I probably wouldn't link &quot;How to remove a gallbladder&quot; to Cholecystectomy, because I don't think it will have encyclopedic value (e.g., of interest to non-professionals and non-patients).  
Other editors might make other choices, however, and I don't think we want to make a general rule at this time.  
What you might do:  Please don't add links to the articles yourself, because you technically have a  problem.  Please pick a couple of your best articles (the ones with the most &quot;encyclopedic&quot; information), and propose them, one by one, on the talk pages for relevant articles.  If any regular editor agrees with you, then s/he will add it to the article for you.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:18, 29 May 2008 (UTC)

Thanks for the comments and suggestions about links between wikipedia and Wikisurgery. I'll make a reply later today.

List of open tasks

Does anyone here ever look at our official &quot;list of open tasks&quot; and try to address them?  I've been wondering for some time whether we should replace it with a suggestion to post a note on this talk page instead.  What do you think?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 03:42, 30 May 2008 (UTC)

I look at it sometimes, and I have even tried adding a few pet tasks to the list, but I have not found it very useful.  To use the list requires I visit the article's talk page to see what exactly is needed, which is an extra step and often does not reveal what exactly is needed.  I prefer to read and often respond to the thoughtful, to-the-point appeals for help posted here on this talk page. --Una Smith (talk) 04:29, 30 May 2008 (UTC)

Proposal : clinical journal club

Hi all,

one of the things I find interesting about editing Wikipedia is that you can learn about new developments in medicine and write an article about them at the same time. I'd like others to share in this experience, and I'd like to set up a kind of journal club for this.

The idea is that anyone can suggest Wikipedia articles on current 'hot topics', or subjects you believe that some of your colleagues might find interesting or may not have heard of yet. The article should be of a reasonably good standard and length and it should be well referenced, so that others could also retrieve any relevant articles.

Participants in this journal club would get regular suggestions of topics they might be interested in. We might also have a discussion about this topic, although this might end up in comments which might be more useful in a designated WikiProject subpage. It might become our regular virtual teaching moment.

To prove the topic is hot, there would have to be some references from recent articles (although the definition of 'recent' might vary according to the subject; it could be a concept that only emerged during the last 10 years, and is still gaining momentum slowly). These references could also be used to improve the article. I imagine it to be something more dynamic than could supplement the current . Of course, it's also a way to attract others to your articles and get them to copy-edit.

Some of these ideas might be integrated with , although I fear that this might deter some of you from participating. As an example of journal club articles which are possibly relevant to many doctors but haven't received much attention from others yet, I would suggest two articles I recently worked on: healthcare-associated pneumonia and cystatin C. I could imagine that other articles such as Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors or coronary artery calcium might also be developed into useful learning activities for many of us.

Thoughts?

--Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 23:48, 28 May 2008 (UTC)

 I think this is a great idea.  I would volunteer to handle various physical medicine articles; that is my area of specialization.  It would great if we could get a multidisciplinary approach as well, incorporating the best evidence of each so all POV are covered and add overall depth and breath to the material.  Thoughts? CorticoSpinal (talk) 05:09, 29 May 2008 (UTC)


 Hello.  I'm not a member here and am not medically trained, but self-taught in the area of Circadian rhythms because of my own disorder.  Sleep medicine seems to be a stepchild, with all too many doctors unable to diagnose (or even guess, in order to be able to suggest an appropriate specialist) beyond depression, apnea and narcolepsy.  There have been tremendous advances the last years, but I don't know if the subject is &quot;hot&quot; enough for you, or perhaps it's too wide a field?

 Anyway, for my own use in trying to work on related articles, I've created a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Hordaland/Sandbox Sandbox] page which just might be of interest to others wanting to coordinate some of the material on Wikipedia.  (And competent people are welcome to fix any misunderstandings I may have introduced into pertinent articles!)  --Hordaland (talk) 03:08, 29 May 2008 (UTC)

Hi Steven, I'm unclear on the nature of the beast.  How is this different from MCOTW (for group work) and posting current projects or interesting links here?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 19:10, 29 May 2008 (UTC)

Posting interesting links per se is not promoted here (unless for GA review and such). It differs from MCOTW in that the accent is not on editing but on learning and maybe editing in the process. The idea is to use Wikipedia as a vehicle for keeping up to date with new evolutions and hot topics in medicine. --Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 16:34, 31 May 2008 (UTC)

Cite journal now has PubMed Central parameter

 now has a pmc parameter to link to PubMed Central's repository of free full-text versions of articles. 

See discussion at , I'm still in favour of linking a paper's title using the pmc where no url is yet specified - but after doi linking dispute (and doi is not always to full article but often just an abstract like pmid) also apparently a view of not linking huge amount to single website, which I can sort of understand.

Hence:

cite journal














→ cite journal

Can PubMed Central be mined in the same way that PMID can be to get all the xml information to fill in a full  template ? Do we need ask Diberri whether to provide a new PubMed Central option, as well as the PubMed PMID, for filling out the cite journal template ? 
Finally, I for one have used PMC up until now as an extra within ref tags, hence &quot;&quot; - could a bot find and edit these or is this a manual job ? David Ruben  Talk  23:44, 5 June 2008 (UTC)

Diberri has kindly upgraded his tool to use pmc article numbers to generate full cite journal markups too (see [http://diberri.dyndns.org/cgi-bin/templatefiller/index.cgi?ddb=&amp;type=pubmedcentral_id&amp;id=137841 example]) :-) David Ruben  Talk  22:55, 6 June 2008 (UTC)

C-ANCA positive (Wegener's) granulomatosis

Copy-paste move from Wegener's granulomatosis with no further edit history, which I am about to delete... should we be thinking about a proper move? I realize eponyms with negative associations are a significant point of contention (e.g. Reiter syndrome vs. reactive arthritis) so this is, IMHO, a valid concern and not just some misguided editor. Any thoughts, here or over at ? Fvasconcellos (t·) 01:28, 10 June 2008 (UTC)
By the way, if anyone's interested, [http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/335/7617/424 here's the BMJ feature that gave rise to the controversy], with some interesting arguments against eponyms :) Fvasconcellos (t·) 01:32, 10 June 2008 (UTC)

Support returning name to Wegener's granulomatosis.
*While indeed such a proposal, likewise similar suggestion for removing possessive &quot;'s&quot; from say Grave's Disease, Parkinsom's disease (these were not the diseases afflicting these doctors themselves), yet wikipedia uses the 's in most instances (vs Parkinson disease).
*Similarly BMJ paper's proposal not been subsequently widely accepted. 
*Even if one agreed to the renaming, the mixed form of &quot;C-ANCA positive (Wegener's) granulomatosis&quot; is never going to be what a reader types in to look for the article
*Finally I've never heard anyone refer to &quot;C-ANCA positive granulomatosis&quot;, but every medical student (and most GPs if they have not entirely forgotton what was taught at medical school) has heard of Wegener's.David Ruben  Talk  19:48, 10 June 2008 (UTC)

Arguments aside,  suggest that we should be using recognized names, not &quot;correct names.&quot;  Common usage is a moving target, and my guess is that if there's an unresolvable dispute between an eponym and a description we should probably go with the description, but given that the sources seem to agree on calling it Wegener's, we should follow their lead.  Somedumbyankee (talk) 04:00, 11 June 2008 (UTC)

There has been no formal decision with regards to Wegener, and much of the evidence of his misbehaviour is circumstantial. The article covers the controversy quite well. Most articles appearing on the condition (e.g. ) continue to use the eponym. JFW | T@lk 11:19, 11 June 2008 (UTC)

Looking for a peer review

Blood donation just failed GA for reasons that remain extremely unclear to me.  I am growing impatient with the reviewer and am disagreeing with many of the things that he/she wants to include since I feel they are incompatible with  and .  Mostly I'm looking to see if the article is clear, if there are any remaining unsourced statements, or any sourced statements that aren't correct.  

The major sticking point right now is exactly what level of detail should go in the article.  Blood donation practices have substantial variations globally, and I'm trying to limit the article to the intent of the practices rather than the details of the practices, which leads to questions of if the article is &quot;too vague&quot;.

Anyone interesting in history of condoms?  Reviews and copyedits requested.

I obtained a book on condom history through interlibrary loan, and just finished a major expansion of the history section of the condom article.  I'm sure some of the new text is somewhat raw and would benefit from copyediting and reviews offering improvement suggestions.

Unfortunately the book is due back at the library tomorrow (I already used up the single renewal allowed for interlibrary loan books).  But I'm hoping that if there are any content/source issues, they will be caught soon, when hopefully having the material fresh in my mind will help resolve them.

Also, the expansion increased the size of the condom article by 73%.  I think this is a bit much, and the history section probably needs to be spun out into its own article.  Help with naming the new article, and doing the summary style in the main condom article, would both be appreciated. LyrlTalk     01:01, 16 June 2008 (UTC)
Infobox Eye

The many pages on eye anatomy lack a common infobox.  Would someone here make one, please?  I'd like one that uses an image like , which has numbers instead of names;  the names can be wikilinked in a list below the image.  This accomodates easy language localization:  one image, many name lists. --Una Smith (talk) 15:09, 5 June 2008 (UTC)

Golly, you're right! Perhaps we could entice the creator of that beautiful template (Selket) to perform the same feat for ocular anatomy. It is, after all, in the eye of the beholder. JFW | T@lk 22:20, 5 June 2008 (UTC)

Yeah, that's the ticket.  Imagemap probably would be even better ... although the eye image I have in mind has 15 labels.  Anyway, images with text in them are not the way to go;  too non-portable.  --Una Smith (talk) 02:26, 6 June 2008 (UTC)

Project navigation template and project organization

Since this project has merged with Clinical medicine and Preclinical medicine, it has become increasingly unorganized.  To help alleviate this, I just revised , which was previously only used on one page.  I am in the process now of adding this to all of the project's pages.  I also think the main  page could undergo some reorganization as well, but will save that for another time.  Feel free to make changes to the template as you see fit.  --Scott Alter 00:18, 12 June 2008 (UTC)

Thanks Scott, I think that is immensely helpful. Please unleash your editorial powers on the WPMED page. It needs some TLC, methinks. JFW | T@lk 09:45, 12 June 2008 (UTC)

Thank you Scott for the easy way of finding the &quot;unaccessed&quot; tagged articles.  I often am tagging articles that don't have the wp:med template on the talk page but then never can figure out how to go back and rate them later.  That second link is very helpful.  Ari-ga-to (or however you say / spell thank you in Japanese).  —Preceding  comment added by  (talk) 21:24, 12 June 2008 (UTC) 

I would like to propose a large reorganization of all the medicine-related WikiProjects.  My idea is that rather than have separate projects for each specialty like we have now, we would convert them all to task forces of this project.  All of the descendant projects are relatively small and most members are also members of this project - many of these projects even redirect to the WPMED member list.  This would only apply to projects wholly within the scope of medicine.  For example, this would include  and , but not necessarily  and ...so there would still be some descendant projects.

By making these projects into task forces, we would consolidate all of the administrative functionings.  This would centralize the article assessment department and FA review department.  Template listings and todo lists would still be separated by task force, but there would also be a central page that lists them all together.

In terms of article assessments and talk page categorization, we could add task force designations to .  So, rather than having a separate banner for each project, there would only be the WPMED banner with an indication that the page is in the scope of the specified task force(s).  With some simple scripting, this would enable all articles to be listed in the quality stats for the combined WPMED project, in addition to still being listed in separate stats for the individual task forces.

The process of completing this proposal is relatively simple, as the descendant projects are not that complicated.  The most difficult part would be appropriately tagging article talk pages - but this could probably be accomplished with a bot.  The first step would be for this project to agree to the reorganization.  Then, we would ask the descendant projects if they would like to go along.  Even if only some of the descendant projects want to partake, I still think this reorganization will be valuable.  I envision that this project could become large and organized similar to  and .  What do others think?  --Scott Alter 10:33, 13 June 2008 (UTC)

I'm not sure if we have quite enough active participants to have such a detailed level of organisation. This is exactly the reason why we formed WPMED recently from WPCLINMED, WP:PREMED and so on. Task forces are good, but also run the risk of being irregularly staffed. JFW | T@lk 14:44, 13 June 2008 (UTC)

I don't think that any more participants would be needed to maintain the proposed organization.  If anything, less people would be required.  Having WPMED, WPCLINMED, and WPPREMED didn't work out because it required too many people for organization, and some people would only participate in one project and ignore the others.  By converting current projects to task forces, there would be no new additional administrative overhead.  I think there might even be less combined administrative overhead, since there wouldn't be duplication of efforts between the current projects.  Once task forces are set up, everything would run the same as they run now, but there would be a central location for things.  The additional pages required in WPMED would basically be the sum of the pages in the descendant projects.  The problem of low staffing currently plagues the descendant projects, as most are or have recently been marked with an inactivity tag.  By moving these projects to task forces, WPMED may gain some new members, and it would be easier for WPMED members to be aware of and contribute to the task forces.  --Scott Alter 19:59, 13 June 2008 (UTC)

Does anyone outright object to this proposal?  If not, I will start asking the descendant projects if they would like to become task forces.  --Scott Alter 05:37, 15 June 2008 (UTC)

I don't see the added value, seems like just a name change to me. It will not cause more people to become involved in any articles. --Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 15:13, 15 June 2008 (UTC)

I think the primary added value is to the WikiProject Council:  If the tiniest ones are converted to task forces, then they can't end up in the (long) &quot;dead projects&quot; list.  
Overall, I think this move is inevitable.  It's just a question of whether we do it now or later.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:55, 15 June 2008 (UTC)

This is one of the impetuses for the proposal.  I would rather see inactive projects be converted to task forces than sit around as inactive projects - even if it is just a simple name change.  As for added value, I think that article assessments broken down by specialty (aka task force) would be useful for editors.  Someone who specializes or has an interest in only one task force could easily focus on improving those articles, rather than wading through all of the WPMED articles.  Currently, most of the descendant projects do not use assessments.  By adding assessments, it would become apparent where assistance is needed within each specialty's task force.  --Scott Alter 21:18, 15 June 2008 (UTC)

On a related topic, I would like to propose a task force on birth control.  It would be nice to have a place to, say, decide what the correct order of sections should be, work out consistent naming of sections, coordinate article improvements,  etc.  It would also be nice to use the rating system WP:MED has already set up, so I'm thinking a task force would be nicer than a separate WikiProject.  Any thoughts on a &quot;birth control&quot; task force under WP:MED? LyrlTalk     00:50, 16 June 2008 (UTC)

Ditto for Sleep, Sleep medicine, Sleep disorders and Circadian rhythms &amp; disorders thereof, etc.  I have no idea how such projects / task forces are formed.  I've tried to organize my thoughts for myself (on my [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Hordaland/Sandbox sandbox/soapbox] page), but it would be good to have a group to turn to.  --Hordaland (talk) 15:41, 16 June 2008 (UTC)

Before creating a new task force, it is best to have a few other people interested in the topic.  There should probably be a separate page to list task force proposals, since proposals on this page can get lost among other topics - maybe they could be at .  Similar to , there could be a section for each proposal, with intended scope and a list of interested people.  I think a task force for &quot;birth control&quot; might be better suited for , but a work force for &quot;reproductive medicine&quot; would fit here better.  &quot;Sleep medicine&quot; would make a good task force.  But again, task forces are for collaboration, so they should only be created if there are other people interested in collaborating.  --Scott Alter 01:37, 17 June 2008 (UTC)

I've created the subpage you suggested, and ask that Lyrl and Hordaland please go to that page and write descriptions of their proposed projects.  (I left the template in place under the suggested names.)  I'm sure that many WPMED members will want to put that page on their watchlists.  Also, if someone could add that page to a suitable place on the main page, or into the navigation template, or something like that, that would be great.

Bias in Breast cancer article?

The breast cancer article, like several other articles just got its monthly bias claim. That article always gets accused of bias against men. It has several issues, but I don't think under-representation of men is one of them. This article may also have some issues with fringe science slipping in ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Breast_cancer&amp;curid=70547&amp;diff=219635901&amp;oldid=219574065 Thermology], and others).

Suggstion for the Tables that go under the picture of the muscle - showing innervation, blood supply, etc

I would suggest also adding Nerve Root.

This would be useful for say the foot drop in the Physical exam of walking on heels.

And it would tie it in to anatomy.  You could look at a muscle, say: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibialis_anterior  and look at the nerve roots involved in the nerve supplying that muscle...

That way you could learn about nerve root injuries.

Yes - you need to add the new parameters to each individual article.  If you set &quot;NerveRoot=x&quot; and &quot;PhysicalExam = y&quot;, they should show up in the articles.  --Scott Alter 06:10, 18 June 2008 (UTC)

Articles needing improvement

I have recognized certain articles to be in very bad condition, more so considering their relative importance in the medical field:
* Lymphatic system and related articles. There are some factual inaccuracies, the articles are incoherent, need more images to become understandable by an average reader.
* Childbirth and related articles. The part that particularly needs attention is the mechanism of labor, which only has a very small section when may be an entire article could have been dedicated to it. Also, the various labor-related complications that can occur have not got proper treatment (like dystocia and shoulder dystocia— the ones that I'd managed to go through).
* Pancreas. The article does not discuss the anatomy, blood, nerve, lymphatic supply, etc. Also, it does not list the various disorders associated with it. Needless to say, this important organ deserves a better article.

I'm trying and planning to work on them, but the effort required is going to be immense. Would be nice if others also contribute.

Regards. —KetanPanchaltaLK 08:26, 18 June 2008 (UTC)

More about Scalpels on Wikisurgery

I have been in discussion with the Editors of WikiProject Medicine about a possible linkage between Wikipedia and Wikisurgery.

Wikisurgery contains an unrivalled amount of operative information in the shape of unique operative scripts and images. 

The information is aimed primarily at the surgical trainee and other hospital staff, but is of great interest to the general Wipedian, judging by the hit rate when some of this information found its way, unofficially, onto Wikipedia for a short while.
 
The practical information greatly exceeds that in most surgical articles in Wikipedia. The scripts are detailed enough to include, not only the basic surgical information, but also the tips, hints, pearls and what ifs that make surgery an art as much as a science. 

In the special field of surgery, the loose, flexible structure of Wikisurgery should form  a valuable complementary information source to the disciplined, neutral approach of Wikipedia. 

At the suggestion of a WikiProject Medicine Editor, I have an article called More about Scalpels in a Wikipedia format on the Talk page of the Wikipedia article titled Scalpel. The article is part of a basic surgical training program to be found on-line on Wikisurgery.com.

I should welcome your comments.

I think surgical scripts, like cooking recipes, belong on Wikiversity, not Wikipedia.  I have started in a very small way to write content on Wikiversity and I find the two cultures often go hand in hand.  Wikiversity can focus on the training aspect and omit all encyclopedic content, if the relevant Wikipedia articles are well developed.  Wikipedia can omit all &quot;how to&quot; in favor of a link to Wikiversity.  Wikipedia can give the history of a technique, what conditions it addresses, and the whys of it (the science, as in why does the technique work);  Wikiversity can teach the technique as currently practiced. --Una Smith (talk) 05:50, 19 June 2008 (UTC)

 Cooking recipes belong on Wikiversity? ;-) Otherwise I agree. Axl (talk) 10:11, 20 June 2008 (UTC)
Absolutely.  Cooking schools are big and getting bigger.  I have tried for years to learn how to make injera, which is amazingly hard.  It involves some important points of food science and technique, which ordinary cookbook recipes do not cover.  Some are fundamentally defective:  eg, a recipe that omits any leavening agent.  We could dispense with universities if only we could teach all there is to learn via a book;  a university differs in that there is (or is supposed to be) a live instructor in the loop. --Una Smith (talk) 16:40, 20 June 2008 (UTC)

The trophy box was not been transcluded on the project page since December.  There is currently a link to it from the navigation template.

Regarding the trophy box, I plan on reformatting it into columns, and putting it back on the project page as a &quot;showcase&quot; section.  I don't think keeping it as one really long list in an isolated box would be good for the organization of the main project page.  --Scott Alter 21:56, 20 June 2008 (UTC)

Progressive bulbar palsy, a contradiction in information about the prognosis?

In the section on epidemiology it says that &quot;PBP is both progressive and slow, with symptoms lasting around 10 to 20 years until it reaches a fatal ending&quot; quoting Collins, 1900. In the section on symptoms it says that &quot;Death, which is often from pneumonia, usually occurs 1 to 3 years after the start of the disorder.&quot; Which is true? As far as I can tell from some rapid research, the latter is true of this disease, not the former. But this is not an area in which I have any expertise. Help anyone? Thanks. Invertzoo (talk) 14:43, 12 June 2008 (UTC)

I find it unhelpful that we have different articles on different forms of motor neurone disease. There tends to be an overlap with one system predominating. To my knowledge, prognosis is not determined by clinical subtype but rather by system affected. JFW | T@lk 16:28, 12 June 2008 (UTC)

 Possibly both statements may be true, depending on whether &quot;usually&quot; refers to incidence or prevalence. If most cases are rapidly progressive, and only a few arrest or progress slowly, there could still be more of the latter group around at any one time. Prognosis in conditions like these used to be self-fulfilling: before modern palliative care and active management of swallowing disorders, e.g. by thickening fluids or gastrostomy feeding, it might have seemed kinder to sedate a declining patient with morphine or the old &quot;Brompton Cocktail,&quot; and avoid parenteral antibiotics and vigorous physiotherapy, thus accelerating the process by means of the double effect.

Looking for Translation from German Wikipedia page on REFLEXES

this is an amazing page = it even has tibialis posterior reflex!

I might be able to help you with this (slowly).  What's your goal?  Does it need to appear on en.wikipedia (under what name?), or is this just for personal use?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 19:28, 17 June 2008 (UTC)

It is for wikipedia.  It has all the clinically useful reflexes - even ones that are hard to test and are rarely used.  It is a brilliant german article.  I wish I could read it.  Tkjazzer (talk) 23:41, 17 June 2008 (UTC)

What is the name of it translated from German? That would help decide where to put it.  I originally used google translator to sorta read it but that never works very well. Tkjazzer (talk) 23:43, 17 June 2008 (UTC)

Well, I don't know what the English word is for this.  The German is &quot;self-reflex,&quot; and it's all about whacking a tendon and seeing the response in the self-same tendon (or whatever you've just hit).  WhatamIdoing (talk) 05:38, 18 June 2008 (UTC)

It appears, to me, to be an article explaining the Physical exam procedures that can be used by doctors in the Neurological part of the Physical Exam.  We often call them deep tendon reflexes, but i'm not sure if all the reflexes listed are considered &quot;deep.&quot;  There are superficial reflexes too, like the umbilical reflex.  I don't know if that helps any. Tkjazzer (talk) 18:26, 18 June 2008 (UTC)

The article on Hyperhidrosis has been the target of spammers for three years. The spammers have been interested in directly promoting external links to their anti-sweat products, but have also been changing the wording to help their SEO efforts. Please review this article to check that the appropriate language is being used, and the range of treatments are appropriate and given appropriate weight.

 I have just improved language / grammar / readability, removed some redundancies and weasel words, fixed some wikilinks.

It hasn't.  --Hordaland (talk) 10:45, 22 June 2008 (UTC)

And another anon came along and listed a brand-name drug at the top of the treatment list and asserted that it has no side effects.  Zzuuzz, are most of your problem editors anonymous IPs?  If so, it might qualify for semi-protection.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 01:15, 23 June 2008 (UTC)
There has been a mix of many unregistered and registered users. I have already semi-protected it for some months, but this is a longer term problem which I hope we can consign to the past before any more protection. Let me elaborate. There is one spammer in particular who has effectively owned the article for much of its history. I suspect they shaped some of the article around their product, and now we have blacklisted all their sites and clamped down on the spam they are still changing the article (the link above shows one example), in ways which can only be search engine optimisation. They appear to be removing keywords of value to them, which leads me to suspect there may be other things skewed in the article to affect search engine results. To be honest I don't really care what keywords they want to deprive us of or how our article affects their search results, as long as we have an article which is normal and neutral. Which I why I brought it here for an independent checkover by people familiar with the appropriate language. I'm hoping more eyes can iron out any existing biases, if there are any, now that we are otherwise on top of the spammers. Thanks for your time. --   23:46, 24 June 2008 (UTC)

Bronchodilators in pneumonia

are &quot;...intended to help improve the breathing capacity of patients with emphysema, pneumonia and bronchitis.&quot; Anyone else feels that bronchodilators can only cause tachyarrhythmias in patients with pneumonia? Anyone have a good review or study on this? --Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 15:36, 13 June 2008 (UTC)

Could pneumonia be a strange mistype of asthma, which is curiously absent from the list?  --Una Smith (talk) 20:45, 13 June 2008 (UTC)

Emphysema is not a restrictive lung disease. I'm deleting the second half of that sentence. Axl (talk) 07:28, 26 June 2008 (UTC)

If there is significant bronchoconstriction interfering with comfort and oxygenation I cannot see why bronchodilators cannot be used in pneumonia. Some suggest that beta-2 agonists are rubbish in COPD: . JFW | T@lk 15:49, 26 June 2008 (UTC)

Hypoxia seems to be a common reason for the initiation of bronchodilators (only relevant study I found on bronchodilators in pneumonia: ) but why would you expect bronchoconstriction? Do you give pneumonia patients a reversibility test? If there is bronchoconstriction, then they probably have COPD exacerbation or previously unrecognised asthma. In bronchiolitic babies they try it often but at least they check (clinically and by oxymetry) if it makes a difference. Also, you suggest they be used in pneumonia but on the other hand they're rubbish? --Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 18:09, 26 June 2008 (UTC)

Bronchoconstriction is found on examination (wheeze) and may happen even in someone with pneumonia if they have associated infective bronchitis (it is not called &quot;bronchopneumonia&quot; for nothing). The main use is for symptomatic relief, although I would be reassured by improving oxygenation.
The study I cited talks very specifically at improving prognosis in COPD. Turns out that anticholinergics improve prognosis while beta-2 agonists only give symptomatic relief and worsen prognosis; the case is therefore for salbumatol-sparing use of ipra/tiotropium. One of the suspected problems with beta-2 agonists are its cardiovascular effects. JFW | T@lk 19:01, 26 June 2008 (UTC)

 Neither the British Thoracic Society guidelines nor the American Thoracic Society guidelines mention the use of bronchodilators in the treatment of pneumonia. There are no randomized controlled trials investigating the outcome of treating pneumonia with bronchodilators. JFW comments &quot;If there is significant bronchoconstriction interfering with comfort and oxygenation I cannot see why bronchodilators cannot be used in pneumonia.&quot; Indeed this is exactly what we do in clinical practice. However there is no hard evidence to support this. Axl (talk) 15:31, 27 June 2008 (UTC)

 JFW, the &quot;study&quot; that you cited is one half of a debate between two opposing physicians, both outlined in the same journal. Axl (talk) 15:34, 27 June 2008 (UTC)

Copyright of radiographies revisited

 is discussing if patients can upload their imaging or if the copyright belongs to the radiographer. Clearly this would create an important precedent. If anyone has arguments or knows about this from a legal POV, please join in. --Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 15:38, 24 June 2008 (UTC)

X-rays form part of the medical record, which is owned by the patient, at least in the UK. This is something best discussed on the  page. JFW | T@lk 15:59, 24 June 2008 (UTC)
Beg to differ JFW.  My understanding was that NHS records are the property of the Secretary of State for Health and the  British Department of Health, and are held and managed of their behalf by the NHS (see Medical records#Ownership). However the Data Protection Act grants the patient the right to see their notes (with a few provisos) (consider, if patients owned their own notes, there would be no need for patients to request to see their notes under the Data Protection Act). Likewise a patient may not have information removed from their notes, it not being &quot;their&quot; notes to do with as they please (having had right to see the notes and point out what they think are errors, if the doctor does not agree to make a correction then the doctor is obliged to insert a note of the patient's disagreement with the medical entry).
Hence the copyright in the UK would be the Department of Health vested in the Secretary of Health on behalf of teh crown, as I crudely understand things. Certainly in the UK the radiographer has no owbership issue here for NHS material. As patients generally have rights to see and have a copy of their notes, the issue for uploading images is of confidentiality &amp; consent:
*Is the person uploading the image the subject of the Xray test ? If so then they are de facto agree to diclosure and confidentiality is not an issue. That said, they still need provide suitable image tagging that they release the image under a free licence as is required in wikipedia.
*If they are not the subject of the image, then their are big issues. A health professional has a duty of confidentiality to a patient and requires explicit informed consent to use an xray for any purpose other than for what it was initially intended. So if the radiographer is trying to upload an image, do they have legally valid consent to so use the image (required even if patient identification not disclosed by the image) and have they taken steps to hide the identity of the patient - e.g. is the patients name, date of birth and address present on the Xray film ? 
We can't at wikipedia do as journals might of holding copies of signed consent forms for patient images, therefore we are the poorer for this and must rely on professional websites providing images under a free licence, or patient's kindly uploading their own images. But medical staff uploading images is very problematic unless the identity of the editor can be verified (which it can't) to allow a clear chain of consent David Ruben  Talk  17:03, 24 June 2008 (UTC)

In the US, there is an important distinction between the records (formerly physical folders of papers) and the copyright in those records.  I know of no good source for this, but the common understanding within the health care community is that the records belong to the record administrator (individual physician, group practice, government health care system, or similar) but the copyright belongs to the patient.  Outside of the health care community, there is a widespread belief that both copyright and the records themselves belong to the health care community, and along with that belief there is resentment. --Una Smith (talk) 18:56, 24 June 2008 (UTC)

There's an AfD on Bed Blockers (UK term for person stuck in the hospital due to lack of appropriate care/housing for legally and/or morally appropriate discharge)  that might interest some of you.  What interests me is that I can't find any Wikipedia articles on discharge planning.  Have I overlooked something?  Is there an obvious name for this?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:46, 2 July 2008 (UTC)
No, because in the US a lack of appropriate care, housing, or ethical appropriateness are not contraindications to discharge. :) Boy, I've gotten cynical. Most of the terms in vernacular use among American house staff are a bit more... charged... than &quot;bed blocker&quot;. In all seriousness, an article on discharge planning might be useful - there is a reasonably-sized literature on the topic. It might also be folded into an article title like length of stay or hospital bed management. MastCell Talk 19:04, 2 July 2008 (UTC)

Chronic fatigue syndrome

Some expert eyes are needed at Chronic fatigue syndrome and on a big group of forks added since March. There has been great consensus there for months since the people editing and talking have a distinct shared POV and they want replace the name CFS with myalgic encephalopathy or myalgic encephalomyelitis.

Since March a bunch of forks using ME/CFS were made, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ME/CFS_nomenclatures ME/CFS nomenclatures], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ME/CFS_pathophysiology ME/CFS pathophysiology], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ME/CFS_hypotheses ME/CFS hypotheses], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ME/CFS_descriptions ME/CFS descriptions], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ME/CFS_therapies ME/CFS therapies], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ME/CFS_treatments ME/CFS treatments], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ME/CFS_history ME/CFS history], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ME/CFS_controversies ME/CFS controversies], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ME/CFS_outbreaks ME/CFS outbreaks], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_references_of_Chronic_fatigue_syndrome Cultural references], and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notable_people_with_chronic_fatigue_syndrome Notable people with CFS].

Anyway, I don't think there's any consensus for removing the name &quot;ME&quot; from these article titles, however nonsensical that term is (many have no myalgia and there is no histological evidence of encephalomyelitis apart from nonspecific changes on SPECT scans - and then only by certain investigators).

Liaison psychiatry

The Liaison psychiatry could really use some attention from the Medicine project. A new editor came through and did quite a bit of expansion, but he didn't really source any of it (he added a bunch of refs but they were all for &quot;this book exists&quot; rather than actually supporting any claims made about the field), and I suspect quite a bit of it may be  (which he has admitted to in the Editor help board). From a web search, if his user name is his real name, he's a professor in the UK who has an interest in Liaison psychiatry. I've tagged it for issues and cleaned up what I could, but an expert who knows more about the field should really give it a going over. From the earlier version, before he started editing[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Liaison_psychiatry&amp;oldid=188674673], I also wonder if it shouldn't be redirected to psychosomatic medicine, as it was listed as an alternate name?

Looking for input

In the course of work I've run into an interesting phenomenon that is probably worthy of a wikipedia article: medical studies conducted under exemptions from informed consent.  They're sometimes called [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=50.24 50.24] studies in the US after the regulation that allows them.

Obviously studies without consent have been conducted unethically, but attempts to do research of this fashion and comply with the spirit of the Declaration of Helsinki are a separate affair.  It shouldn't be surprising that these are rare (I'm only aware of four), but one was a trial of Hemopure which is somewhat notorious.

Is anyone aware if these kinds of trials take place in other countries?  If it's solely a US phenomenon, I'll just call the article 50.24 study and it can be moved if necessary.  Otherwise I'm at a bit of a loss for a name.  SDY (talk) 17:27, 8 July 2008 (UTC)

Lyme disease

OK, I suspect this will not be a popular request, but I was asked by SandyGeorgia to look at Lyme disease, which had been delisted as a Good Article under the relentless pressure of advocacy for minoritarian viewpoints (&quot;chronic&quot; Lyme, Lyme disease as a biowarfare experiment gone awry, etc) overwhelming .

Yes, I originally thought it might be that simple - cite reputable sources and accurately represent their content. However, that was naive of me. These folks had the Infectious Diseases Society of America investigated for antitrust violations for producing guidelines which (in line with the weight of clinical evidence) discourage the use of long-term antibiotic treatment for &quot;chronic&quot; Lyme disease ([http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2008/06/09/hlsa0609.htm], [http://www.idsociety.org/Content.aspx?id=11182]). This is a new one for me - docs being accused of greedy profiteering for arguing against the use of risky and unecessary medication - but apparently they were in cahoots with the insurance industry, every physician's best friend.

Responses from Wikipedia editors to Wikisurgery-type article on Talk page of Wikipedia article How to use a scalpel

Here is the article and the first 2 responses:  

Article

 This subsection has text and images from an interactive multimedia training program on 
  for basic 
 surgical skills, called PrimeSkills in Surgery.
 You can use this subsection on its own or follow the whole program (further details at the end of 
 this subsection).


How to use a scalpel



Introduction

A scalpel may appear alarming at first. 

This is a useful safety reaction and should mean that you will learn carefully and steadily.

A small minority of trainees develop an aggressive gung-ho tendency when holding a scalpel. 

This should be suppressed completely. 

If it persists, the trainee should not continue with the program.


Holding a scalpel


For fine work with a No 15 blade, hold the scalpel like a pen.	

This is the correct way of holding a pen, using a tripod grip.



The three parts of the tripod are the side of the middle finger and the tips of the index and thumb.

(Other ways of holding a pen, such as placing it between the sides of the thumb, index and ring finger, are unacceptable.)

This grip enables the surgeon to:
Flex and extend the digits, so that the scalpel moves in and out during delicate dissections. 
Rotate the handle of the scalpel with the thumb, so the scalpel can cut small diameter curves.

The most usual grip with a No 10 or 22 blade is as if you are holding a table knife. 

(This is the polite way of holding a table knife)

The handle rests in the palm of the hand.  	



The digits and hand are largely on top of the scalpel unlike with the pen grip. 

This means that the scalpel can be held close to the surface of the tissues when cutting, without the digits and hand getting in the 

way as in the pencil grip.			

The grip is quite gentle.  
				
For tougher tissues, such as the skin on the back, grip more firmly and place your index finger on the top of the handle rather than 

on the side.	



This will let you increase the downward pressure of the blade on the tissue.  

For more delicate tissue, hold the handle between the thumb on one side and the four fingertips on the other. 

The handle does not touch the hand. 	



Holding the scalpel in the fist or like a dagger is far too clumsy. 	


				
DO NOT dissect with the handle of the scalpel. 



You will be concentrating on the site of dissection and may accidentally cut your assistant.
				
DO NOT hold the scalpel in your hand while using another instrument.	



You may accidentally cut the patient as you concentrate on the dissection area.

ALWAYS  pass the scalpel to someone else handle first.
				


Preferrably, place the scalpel in a dish for the scrub nurse to pick out.
				


DO NOT  throw the scalpel down onto the bench (or onto the patient.)

How to cut with a scalpel

The part of the blade that does the cutting is the curve and not the tip.
				
This means  that you need to drag the curve of the blade across the tissue. 

Scratching with the tip of the blade is a beginner's error. 

(A scalpel with a straight blade should be reserved for stab incisions such as for a drain tube.)

You will  feel the curved blade cutting into the tissue. 

Go slowly and gently at first with repeated strokes in  the same place, until you see how much the blade is cutting the tissue.

Brace your hands and fingers so that you make controlled movements without the blade suddenly slipping.
				


Press harder at the beginnings and ends of incisions to allow for the less efficient cutting action at the tip and the back of 					
the blade. 



Rock the handle to enhance  this effect.





		

For a right handed surgeon, incisions are most easily made from left to right, cutting towards the surgeon. 

Cutting from right to left is more difficult.
				
Curved incisions are made by rotating the scalpel.
				
Curves up to 4cm. radius or so are best made by rotating the scalpel between finger and thumb. 



Curves larger than 4cm. need rotation of the scalpel using the wrist, elbow, and finally the shoulder. 







For a right handed surgeon, clockwise curves are easier to do than anticlockwise ones. 

Be prepared for a greater tendency to miss the planned track and more slips when cutting an anticlockwise curve.

Incisions need to be made with the blade perpendicular to the tissues to avoid slicing.  

Slicing will devascularise the thinner side of the incision.

(NB. Slicing with the blade held at an angle to the tissues is done deliberately when dissecting with a scalpel.)

 For gosh sakes, what is this?  This is a Project talk page; please put this in a subpage if an illustrated guide is needed.  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 05:06, 23 June 2008 (UTC)

Planning

As well learning HOW to cut with a scalpel, learning WHERE to cut is vitally important. 
					
Each incision has a start point, a path, a depth and a finish point. 
						
e.g. The positions of the start and finish points of an ellipse incision will determine the final line of the scar. 



The path and the depth of  the incision determine whether there is enough clearance around a tumour.  		
					
With real tissues, once an incision is made, there is no going back. 

Mistakes are not acceptable.

On simulated tissue, learn to plan your incisions with this degree of precision.

Editor comments on above sections
As per , an example where a useful external link. However directly hosting this is a problem as  - an external link to your site describing this is clearly fine (by me). Otherwise change in approach is needed to move away from a guide to a more encyclopaedic coverage, eg last sentance of &quot;On simulated tissue, learn to plan your incisions with this degree of precision.&quot; would perhaps come under &quot;Surgeons now practice their technique on artificial simulated tissue&quot; 

There is really good material here, just question of how best to use/incorporate it :-) David Ruben  Talk  22:09, 18 June 2008 (UTC)

I also think that an external link to this page on Wikisurgery is a much preferable approach.  Wikipedia is  a how-to guide; it is also not written for the convenience of medical students or the edification of surgeons (or other professionals).  Please consider  as well, when you're trying to decide whether material is appropriate for this general encyclopedia.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 22:37, 18 June 2008 (UTC)

I would welcome further discussion about a possible linkage with Wikisurgery based on these very positive responses.


Michael Harpur Edwards (talk) 08.30: 19 June 2008 (UTC)

Michael, It's usually considered poor form to move discussions around until you get the answer you want.   (We call it &quot;&quot;.)  You should pick one location or the other to have this conversation.  Whichever you choose, you need to post a link to it at the other location.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 19:21, 19 June 2008 (UTC)


I seem to be in trouble all the time. Sorry. I am only trying to follow the advice of the editors.  I am not familiar with the procedure when more than one location is involved. I do not know how to post a link between 2 locations.
How would you suggest I progress this exciting possibility of a link between Wikisurgery and Wikipedia? I am in your hands.
Michael Harpur Edwards (talk) 21.08 19 June 2008 (UTC)

Michael Harpur Edwards, by &quot;link&quot; do you mean something other than an ordinary external link on any article? --Una Smith (talk) 20:09, 19 June 2008 (UTC)

Michael, Your first discussion is at .   This discussion on this page is at .  Pick one or the other, and paste its link into the other location (inside double square brackets) with an invitation for any interested editors to join the conversation there.

Several contributors here have suggested using external links from Wikipedia pages to Wikisurgery.  To do that, you can simply do what is usually done, and add a plain link in the external links section.  Or you can get a little fancier, a la links to Wikimedia Commons and Wikitravel.  See for example Harpers Ferry, West Virginia: edit that page so you can see how its links to Wikimedia Commons and Wikitravel are achieved. A clue:   uses .  Anyone can make a template.  That said, MHE, the more I read the more I want to encourage you to relocate your project from Wikisurgery to Wikiversity;  you seem to be rather alone on Wikisurgery.  You are asking very basic questions about how to develop content in a wiki environment. --Una Smith (talk) 22:47, 19 June 2008 (UTC)

Actually, MHE has a conflict of interest, and so technically shouldn't add the links himself.  But he could certainly propose them on the talk page, with a simple &quot;I've been working on this page (link goes here), and does anyone else think that it would be a good addition to the external links for this article?&quot; request.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 23:24, 19 June 2008 (UTC)
Is there COI?  The site is a wiki, and could perhaps be edited by a community much like Wikipedia.  What if the content were on Wikiversity;  would it be improper for contributors on either site to add links between Wikipedia and Wikiversity?  Is there COI?  What if the content were on Wikipedia;  we encourage contributors to add links to and from articles here.  Is there COI?  Sometimes.  Looking at this Wikisurgery site, it seems to be a one-man operation.  (Pun intended. ;-)  --Una Smith (talk) 05:35, 20 June 2008 (UTC)

Revived
Hi everyone,
In the last two weeks, the external link between 
 and  has been deleted.

I guess that this is on the grounds per WP:NOT, that wikipedia is not a how to do it manual giving technical details.
However I note that many surgical articles in Wikipedia do contain explicit how to do it information, to the great enrichment of the texts.
Eg 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalpel#Gripping_a_medical_scalpel
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episiotomy
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine_needle_biopsy#Procedure
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_tube
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seldinger_technique

 gives headings for the  main steps of an operation to remove the thyroid gland, but  these steps have been waiting for the how to do it information to be supplied by Wikipedians since December 2006. A link to Wikisurgery could provide the solution.

I note that the  includes detailed how to do it information  in the 
 However I think it is possible to improve on a surgical manual published in 1921, which  recommends that surgical instruments  be sterilised by boiling in a fish kettle or by soaking in carbolic solution. Up to date information could be easily  provided by an external link to Wikisurgery

To give some increased credibility to the information on Wikisurgery, please note that the basic surgical skills program was published on CD-ROM  as PrimeSkills in Surgery, . 
©1999 Scalpel Information Systems, and the basic laparoscopy program was published as 
CurrentTechniques in Surgery -  Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy , 
©1997 SilverPlatter Education and Scalpel Information Systems.The program qualified the users Grade A Continuing Medical Education credits with the Americal Medical Association.

I have had a look at Wikiversity, but could not find a section covering surgery.

I hope I have not transgressed any protocols with this text.

I should be pleased to see whether  the editors would like to request external links with Wikisurgery for any of the Surgical articles in Wikipedia (to overcome any conflict of interest issues).

Medical resource exchange

At  you can request sources if you can't access them: could we set up something similar for medical resource, e.g. full text articles you can't access? --Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 10:43, 8 July 2008 (UTC)

I think that is an excellent idea, but we must be careful not to run foul of copyright matters. Publishers will not be best pleased if we start happily trading PDFs that they would normally have sold for $$$$.
However, it should be possible to ask members with access to verify a citation without sending around PDFs or passwords. I would happily verify any citation for BMJ Group and AMA journals. JFW | T@lk 16:18, 8 July 2008 (UTC)
Yes, I'm sure a &quot;verification service&quot; (e.g. &quot;Could someone check PMID xxxxx and see if it actually supports statement Y in article Z&quot;) would be an excellent idea and certainly poses no copyright issues. Fvasconcellos (t·) 16:30, 8 July 2008 (UTC)

Toxin theory of cancer

Because of Dressed to Kill (book), which claims that wearing brassieres causes breast cancer, I've started wondering what article(s) might cover the Toxin theory of cancer.  This is the idea that the human body can't handle its own metabolic byproducts, which are &quot;toxins&quot;, and if they build up, or concentrate in an area, then you get cancer.  It's wildly popular in the alternative medicine press and is the idea that underlies all the recommendations for fasting, juicing, eating only organic vegetables, drinking distilled water, and more as ways of preventing or treating all forms of cancer.  It's utterly unsubstantiated by any mainstream research of any kind.  Do we have a page on this somewhere?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 06:15, 10 July 2008 (UTC)

This is stuff very closely related to the whole concept of carcinogenesis. The fact that toxins cause cancer is obviously not controversial (see benzopyrenes and lung cancer, asbestos and lung cancer and mesothelioma) but the theory you are referring to is obviously untested. Is that what they call it, &quot;toxin theory&quot;? JFW | T@lk 19:33, 10 July 2008 (UTC)

I don't know what it's called.  I'm not sure it's really called anything.  See [http://wellness-tribune.com/wt/?p=cancer this] for an example.  The focus was originally on metabolic byproducts, not benzene and asbestos.  The &quot;solution&quot; is that you need to change your diet, &quot;cleanse&quot; your body with enemas and natural supplements, and so forth.  [http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/321/7276/1586 This BMJ paper] refers to &quot;intestinal autointoxication&quot; as one possible name from the 19th century.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 20:19, 10 July 2008 (UTC)
Thank you very much for depressing me by pointing out our article on Dressed to Kill (book). Everyone knows that bras can detect and prevent cancer, not cause it (cf. ). Anyhoo... the problem is one of scope: like many alt-med concepts, this one is vague and means different things to different people. How would we delimit an article and choose sources? I foresee a battleground without much hope of building a solid, manageable article. But then, I'm a cynic (or, as I prefer, an informed realist) when it comes to Wikipedia.

(Also, there are additional sources on his Tourette syndrome; I added the two that provide free, full text.)  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 20:33, 12 July 2008 (UTC)
I would have put the &quot;madness&quot; in quotes, but wiki always seems to have a fit when I do that. :) Ottava Rima (talk) 20:34, 12 July 2008 (UTC)
 I'm thinking of an even more general section heading, since the descriptions then of his behaviors can be viewed in the context of current understanding.  If he had TS/OCD, then &quot;madness&quot; is antiquated.  The folks here will likely be able to come up with a contemporary, neutral, general heading.  Also, I'm not sure on the separation of the issues by headings, since depression is often part and parcel with OCD.  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 20:38, 12 July 2008 (UTC)
That would make sense on the separate page about his Tourettes. However, it might lead to the unwanted conclusion that the contemporaries were leading up to that point, i.e. we should contextualize (somewhere) his actions in an 18th century setting. They didn't have the medical knowledge or the treatments that we have now, and there was a fear that Johnson would be locked away like Christopher Smart (which was why he defended Smart quite a few times). Ottava Rima (talk) 20:46, 12 July 2008 (UTC)
 I don't think his contemporaries could have been leading to that point; they simply didn't know what TS was, the connection to OCD, or the link between OCD and depression (see History of Tourette syndrome).  Johnson died in 1784. Jean Marc Gaspard Itard, reported the first case of Tourette syndrome, Marquise de Dampierre, in 1825.  Georges Gilles de la Tourette published an account of nine patients (including Itard's Marquise de Dampierre) with Tourette's in 1885.  Johnson's contemporaries had none of that knowledge.

WPMED scope

Is Human embryogenesis within the scope of WPMED?  Or is it more of a biology topic?  It's not really a medical condition or treatment, although of course every med student is required to learn about it.  What do you think?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:53, 25 June 2008 (UTC)
 Medicine can cover anything related to health.  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 16:56, 25 June 2008 (UTC)
True, but perhaps too sweeping.  Under that rule we could legitimately declare not just Water and Food, but also household furnaces, air conditioning, electricity, and roads to be within the scope of WPMED, since the absence of these things is frequently associated with health problems in susceptible persons.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 17:19, 25 June 2008 (UTC)

Embryology is a biolgy topic but relevant to medicine as any dysmorphia (inborn cardiac defects, cleft palate etc) has a basis in dysregulation of embryology. I thing this article is suitable for  tagging. JFW | T@lk 18:13, 25 June 2008 (UTC)
I think you provided the answer to your own question. IMHO, something that is a core part of medical school curricula certainly falls under WPMED scope; otherwise, what was the point of absorbing ? :) Fvasconcellos (t·) 18:32, 25 June 2008 (UTC)
I think there should be a department in wikiproject medicine that soley focuses on tagging articles with WPMED template - mainly articles that lie in other wikiprojects but are TAUGHT in medical schools.  All of those subjects are fair game.  If it is a word in a medical dictionary it is, with some exceptions, fair game.  If it is a topic on the USMLE or other basic science medical school exam, it's fair game.  This is a huge project, and I would propose that it should be its own department within WP;med. Tkjazzer (talk) 04:29, 26 June 2008 (UTC)
Can you explain the goal behind tagging the maximal number of articles?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 04:55, 26 June 2008 (UTC)

I don't include developmental biology, anatomy, physiology, or pharmacology within the scope of WPMED, and I have no interest in recapitulating the curriculum of any medical school. --Una Smith (talk) 15:30, 26 June 2008 (UTC)

I don't see any reason why they should be tagged, but I also don't see any reason why they couldn't be.  My personal demon, the blood donation article, is marked as , but it could also be seen as pharmaceutical manufacturing.   If the wikimedia foundation wanted to create a paper copy of the encyclopedia targeted towards medical topics or somesuch it might be relevant, but I don't really see how it matters either way what the project flags.  Somedumbyankee (talk) 15:46, 26 June 2008 (UTC)
I would have not found wp;med if it were not for the template on a talk page.  the more we spread out and open up in other disciplines we might recruit some health conscious people who edit in biochemistry and physiology.  They may want to learn more about the relationship of a biochemical process in relation to medicine and it is nice for medical students to have a section that is catered for the health science community and not written by and for molecular biologists.  the more eyes the better.  since there is nothing wrong with tagging and since the templates can be expandable/hidden if it starts to get excessive, I see nothing wrong with tagging articles that aren't necessary topics on WebMD as different diseases, but involve proteins which are mutated in specific genetic diseases (both acquired and congenital).  Tkjazzer (talk) 18:27, 26 June 2008 (UTC)
I'm sure that is why citizendium.org uses &quot;health sciences&quot; instead of &quot;medicine&quot; in their equivalent of projects. Tkjazzer (talk) 18:31, 26 June 2008 (UTC)

I don't think that its advertising value is an adequate justification for spamming all the articles that we can.  Too many tags = way too much administrative overhead.  I'm willing to include major articles on developmental biology (for example), but I don't think we want everything in those areas.  The mere fact that it might possibly be relevant background material for a medical condition isn't a good enough justification for me.  
I've been struggling recently with the number of anatomy articles.  There are billions of little bits in the human body, and nearly everyone of them has a stub on Wikipedia.  I haven't been removing WPMED tags from them, partly because of my suspicion that WP Anatomy is some day going to become a task force under WPMED.  There are hundreds of WPMED-tagged articles that really belong to the Anatomy project, and the fact is that the WPMED members who aren't also WPANATOMY members are highly unlikely to improve these articles.  We're not contributing anything to the encyclopedia by slapping our project banner on these pages.
Genetics is another area.  It might be nice if your doc knows what a neutral mutation is, but are we really going to help that article, or the dozens like it?  Don't you think that MCB and the newly formed Genetics projects are much more likely supporters for that article? 
More than 60% of assessed &quot;WPMED&quot; articles are rated as low priority, and I expect this to hold true for the remaining 1300 or so that are currently tagged and need assessing.  This disproportionate number of low priority articles is largely because we've (automatically, in many cases) tagged so many articles that are in the allied sciences. 
I don't know what the solution is, but I'm not convinced that we're on the right track here.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 01:34, 28 June 2008 (UTC)
If you let molecular biologists and geneticists write these articles without imput from the clincial standpoint, then the articles are lacking something. period.  One major thing they are lacking is read-a-bility.  so many articles start about specific gene mutations, which chromosome, etc before saying anything readable.  Yes that information is great to the geneticist who wrote it, but if it is clinically relevant, than eventually we need to write clinical related stuff in the introduction - stuff that medical students, especially future medical students may need to have access too.  I don't know how long you have been practicing and away from the academic center, but many many many many medical students utilize wikipedia to look stuff up.  And in doing so, many add bits and pieces to the articles.  But those articles are seriously lacking a solid workgroup to oversee them.  Wikipedia is going to continue to grow, I see nothing wrong with the citizendium approach of tagging multiple workgroups to an article.  Sorry, I meant wikiprojects - speaking in citizendium terms - get them mixed up.  I don't know if that means anything.  I hope there isn't some kind of vote that bans me from adding WPMED tags, because there are a lot of articles out there with no tag at all that fall in the medicine category.  I don't seem much harm in tagging and I hope others do not either.  (talk) 04:23, 3 July 2008 (UTC) [same person as above]

I see no reason why a person writing for WikiProject Genetics can't produce an article that is readable, or reasonably complete.  If you're running into that problem, then they need a note about the quality of their articles.  Note, please, that many WPMED members are also Genetics members.  We doubtless do not check our medical knowledge at the door of an article on genetics just because there's no WPMED tag on it.  Furthermore, have you ever seen a study  of patients' comprehension that indicates that physicians are good at communicating information?  I haven't -- and I've seen many to the contrary.  
Banner bloat is bad for Wikipedia.  It increases our administrative overhead at the expense of writing articles.  Having more than one banner provides no additional value to the 1.0 team.  I have assessed about ten thousand articles for this project.  I can assess simple articles at a sustainable rate of more than 100 articles per hour, which is much faster than the usual rate.  However, every minute spent assessing articles is a minute not spent writing the encyclopedia.  Slapping six project tags on an article because they're all kind of related to the article means that six editors have to assess the article.  Every single article so tagged costs Wikipedia at least five minutes of editor attention -- and there are more than two million articles on the English Wikipedia.  
By contrast, not adding our banner costs the WPMED project nothing:  we are still allowed to improve articles that are not tagged for this project.  So I'm increasingly inclined to be intelligent about what we tag.  If WPMED is not clearly a major player for the article, then we should make room for those that are.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 01:11, 5 July 2008 (UTC)
Yes, of course, it is possible and I'm sure many of the basic genetic articles like DNA, etc are written for a broad audience.  But if you were to search for a gene or a protein, instead of putting clinical relevance anywhere in the introduction, they have specific genetic details.  I think those details belong further down in the article, but it might only be my opinion.  My point is, I don't think that it is excessive to tag articles that have clinical relevance with wpmed.  we have a responsibility to oversee any article with clincial relevance.  Just because there are not enough users yet to oversee it, doesn't mean that we can't tag it.  You argue our time should be spent helping with editing, not tagging and I agree.  However, for the people who enjoy tagging articles with WPMED, I see no reason in stopping them or countering their work by deleting the tag.  If everyone focuses on doing what they enjoy, things will be great.   (talk) 22:29, 15 July 2008 (UTC)

Question about PubMed as a source

In working on , I came across Thyrotoxic crisis, which is a copypaste from [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1707465 this PubMed article]. I know US Federal Government stuff isn't copyrighted. Are articles on PubMed considered a non-copyrighted government publication, or is it simply a reprint of a copyrighted (by the authors) work? Thanks!--Fabrictramp | talk to me 16:40, 2 July 2008 (UTC)
I've redirected it to hyperthyroidism, as we've done with thyroid storm, thyrotoxicosis, and other generally synonymous terms. In general, the abstract you see on PubMed is often copyrighted to the publishing journal. The copyright to journal articles (including the abstracts indexed on PubMed) is generally held by the journal, not by the federal government. There's an increasing move toward open-source publishing, but even so we shouldn't be in the business of cut-and-pasting PubMed abstracts. Thanks for picking up on this instance.

There is plenty of scope for thyroid storm to be made into its own article, as it is indeed an endocrine emergency quite different from the non-acute setting.

OK, but it is drastically limited to only the common ones.  For example, the superficial umbilical reflex is not listed, yet that is in Bates Guide to Physical Exam.  What about checking for sphincter tone - &quot;anal wink&quot; (i know it sounds funny or crude), but it is a reflex.  There is another super rare reflex that also sounds vulgar, but i think it might be notable (brace yourself): you pinch the glans of the penis and there is a reflex contraction of the anal sphincter (also possible with the clitoris). The list goes on and on.  I just used the two most SHOCKING reflex exams that I could think of to get your attention.  What about the reflexes used in endocrinology?  -eg. the one where you tap the facial nerve with hypocalcemia (I believe, not sure).  What about all the reflexes listed in the german wikipedia article that has no english counterpart (yet). http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine/Archive 8#Looking_for_Translation_from_German_Wikipedia_page_on_REFLEXES
or a direct link to the german article: http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenreflex
I really would like to see rare reflexes listed like tibialis posterior reflex which is in the german article.  I hope that I did not cross any professional lines, but reflexes could be greatly improved.  Also the articles could have more anatomy and neurology / neuroscience incorporation (nerve roots, muscles used in the reflex, etc etc).  The reflex articles could list/link to other physical exam procedures that are used to test muscles when focusing on a problem in one region.  I don't know if this makes sense to anyone else.

Questions to the editors of Retractor (medical)

On opening the  Retractor (medical)  talk page, I have been directed to the Doctor’s Mess to ask questions.

Would the editors of  Retractor (medical) care to evaluate the article [http://www.wikisurgery.com/index.php?title=Retractors_05_Parts_of_retractors Parts of Retractors]  in [http://www.wikisurgery.com/index.php?title=Main_Page Wikisurgery]? 

The Wikisurgery article describes surgical retractors from the simplest (the hand of an assistant) to the most complex (self retaining abdominal and thoracic retractors). 

Internal links from Parts of a Retractor  connect  to other articles in Wikisurgery. These linked articles explain, for instance,  how  retractors  work and also give details of  20 current retractors with action photographs from the operating theatre.

At present, Retractor (medical)  appears to be a stub. 

Might the editors consider the Parts of  a Retractor  article worthy of  being an  External Link to Retractor (medical)?

Proposal: a missing article creation contest

Dear all,

as we roam around medical articles, all of us occasionally bump into unexpected redlinks. I'm talking about articles you would expect to be already existing for ages because they are prominent medical subjects (and after all, we have articles on the rarest of conditions and virtually all human genes).

To promote work on these essential but missing articles, I propose a new contest which could accompany the MCOTW. I haven't figured out a name that gives a proper acronym yet, but the idea is to try and find the most high-profile article that was missing, until you created it. Everyone could show off their most important recent creations, and every one or two weeks, myself or another [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Cabal-leaders cabal leader]  could declare a winner (or tied winners if there is no clear-cut winner). Once we get a proper name, I could also create a matching award.

If others have on occasion also been amazed by the stuff we're still completely missing, and think this might be a useful effort, I'll set up a page for this.

--Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 19:15, 21 July 2008 (UTC)

Excellent idea. Perhaps a good scour of  would yield some appropriate candidates. More worryingly, though, are the very important articles that are still stubs or class C. Are those to be included as well? JFW | T@lk 08:39, 22 July 2008 (UTC)
In my experience, most of those requested article redlinks can (and should) be fixed by creating redirects, or direct editing of the linking page. --Una Smith (talk) 15:26, 22 July 2008 (UTC)
That's my experience too, most should be redirected. On the other hand, some redirects deserve articles of their own. And indeed, Top priority stubs are more worrying. I just can't help to say how boring I find some of these general articles like medicine, disease, health, ... I'd prefer making a long effort on one article like cough.
Instead of a biweekly contest, I was thinking more along the lines of an exchange trophy, kinda 'world record' type, where one persons holds the trophy until someone else creates an even more amazingly missing article.

Top priority

I didn't see anything in our &quot;Top importance&quot; category about addiction/drug abuse/alcoholism/etc. and I think that we ought to consider one or two such articles as reasonable candidates.  Top importance articles are basically always included in the 1.0 Team's work, so it's important for us to have both a wide variety of articles and also to keep them in good shape.  Can anyone recommend a particular article for this area?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 23:48, 22 July 2008 (UTC)
I'd recommend something like delirium tremens over something like alcoholism, because the latter term cannot be well defined from a medical context. --Arcadian (talk) 06:03, 23 July 2008 (UTC)

A disambiguation page may be needed here.  There are many uses of &quot;coarse facial features&quot; on the web and in PubMed, and even in Wikipedia, on pages that list signs and symptoms of numerous diseases.  However, what constitutes &quot;coarse&quot; is rarely defined and evidently varies considerably from disease to disease.  --Una Smith (talk) 02:44, 28 June 2008 (UTC)

To me, &quot;medical research&quot; is &quot;clinical research&quot;.  In the United States, NSF funds biomedical research and NIH funds clinical research.  --Una Smith (talk) 19:28, 20 July 2008 (UTC)
Note that clinical research is a separate stub. --Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 20:09, 20 July 2008 (UTC)
That's funny:  I think of biomedical research as being a subtype of medical research.  Steven, how do you classify an epidemiological survey for, say, the prevalence of a clinical symptom like fatigue or transient situational depression?  I say that it's true medical research, but certainly not biomedical research, as &quot;How tired do you feel today, on a scale of 1 to 10&quot; is not even remotely biological.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 22:16, 22 July 2008 (UTC)
 
I would think, from a naming conventions standpoint, that medical research is a better title.  Not more accurate, but more commonly recognized.  SDY (talk) 19:39, 20 July 2008 (UTC)

Is there any consensus to rename to Medical research?? --  (talk) 13:30, 24 July 2008 (UTC)

Come to think of it, could someone peer review the hypopituitarism article?

Right, hands up everyone who equates tumor with....

OK, Emmanuelm wants to change tumor back to a version where tumor equates swelling.

Or am I missing something. I don't diagnose many of these in psychiatry...Cheers, Casliber (talk · ) 21:12, 24 July 2008 (UTC)
It's one of the cardinal signs, so I think it's reasonable for there to be a section on that page regarding this usage. I frequently spout off &quot;calor, dolor, tumor, rubor&quot; (and substantially less frequently, &quot;functio laesa&quot;). Antelan 21:20, 24 July 2008 (UTC)
The older definition (&quot;swelling&quot;) should be mentioned in the article body, but the focus of the article should be on the current usage, as in a neoplasm. That's what people will come to the page to read about, for the most part. MastCell Talk 21:25, 24 July 2008 (UTC)
Agree majority of focus should be neoplastic, except &quot;neoplasm&quot; is not &quot;what people will come to the page to read about&quot;, but rather to read about &quot;cancer&quot; and that needs be mentioned very prominantly - yes I know neoplasms are one particular solid-lump type of cancer vs. say leukaemia, and so that too needs explaining along lines of: &quot;Tumours are any form of abnormal solid body swellings and whilst in modern usuage generally applied to solid cancers, known as neoplasms, the term may also apply to innocent (benign) growths, inflammatory swellings from infections and cysts.&quot; David Ruben  Talk  22:55, 24 July 2008 (UTC)
Neoplasm and cancer are not synonyms, if cancer is defined as malignant neoplasm.  IMO, that is a problem with Cancer.  Just a thought: perhaps Tumor should be a disambiguation page? --Una Smith (talk) 02:45, 25 July 2008 (UTC) 

Needs to address its meaning as &quot;neoplasm&quot; before briefly touching on the the stricter meaning of &quot;swelling&quot; which might hold true in Latin but not in English. JFW | T@lk 23:11, 24 July 2008 (UTC)

[http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=tumor Works in English, too], but I agree that it's less prominent a usage than as a synonym for &quot;neoplasm&quot;. Antelan 02:53, 25 July 2008 (UTC)

Public health works on that wonderful boundary between the two, unfortunately.  Also, unfortunately, some of the editors have very strong opinions.

Medical analysis of circumcision doesn't need subarticles.

Pool chlorine hypothesis

Given the huge numbers of people in the rich countries who have asthma, and whose children are at relatively high risk of having asthma, i'm curious why nobody before me happened to start the article on the pool chlorine hypothesis.

Boud (talk) 21:22, 7 August 2008 (UTC)

I think the hypothesis itself, even if true, contributes minimally to the burden of asthma in the United States. For example, it certainly doesn't explain why indigent, inner-city children in Baltimore are getting asthma at higher rates than in the past. That said, thanks for the link. Antelan 21:26, 7 August 2008 (UTC)

Sound like you [http://www.blackhealthcare.com/BHC/Asthma/Description.asp are probably right] for this sector of the US population with asthma, though if the hypothesis is correct and if well-intentioned people recommend to indigent, inner-city children's caretakers (parents, schools) to encourage the children to take one of the most highly recommended forms of exercise - swimming - [http://www.google.com/search?q=baltimore+swimming+pools&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:unofficial which does seem to be available in central Baltimore], then they might actually make it even worse. Anyway, detailed discussion should probably go to . Boud (talk) 21:52, 7 August 2008 (UTC)
It's certainly biologically plausible, and the papers describing it are . I did have the same reaction as Antelan: the burden of asthma in American inner cities is much more intense than in their suburbs, despite greater exposure to pool chlorine in the latter group. That said, it could certainly be one risk factor for asthma. The problem is that pool attendance is a surrogate marker for a billion other demographic, medical, environmental, and socioeconomic variables, any of which could be a confounder. I guess my gut feeling is that it's worth a mention in asthma, but I'd like to see it picked up and researched by more than a single group before creating a standalone article. But then, I'm a hardliner about that sort of thing. MastCell Talk 21:59, 7 August 2008 (UTC)

Boud - if you can find a way to give inner-city Baltimore kids the chance to get to a swimming pool, I will hail you as a hero. Regarding this article, I am with MastCell on that hard line. Antelan 22:05, 7 August 2008 (UTC)

* &quot;More than a single group&quot;: see Fjellbirkeland et al, Thickett et al, Jacobs et al.  in pool chlorine hypothesis. Research so far seems to have been only done in Europe. Given the comments about inner-city kids in Baltimore, in the USA it might only be a priority for research if medical researchers or their funding agencies are interested in the wealthier children in the suburbs. In the parts of the world (especially South, East and South-East Asia) with rapidly growing middle classes, we probably could expect some interest from researchers there.
* &quot;a billion other demographic etc. variables&quot;: Please read how the Bernard et al. articles treat demographic and other markers. There's a section Relations to demographic and environmental variables where i attempted to summarise what they've done. You're welcome to improve the accuracy, NPOV, etc. of the summary. Bernard et al seem to have done a quite solid job on this, and condensing the key points of what they've done in either this section or other sections is not easy. \
* BTW, the English language wikipedia is about knowledge of the World, so an article about asthma is not an article especially focussing on asthma in the USA. [http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/tm_objectid=17400353&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=50082&amp;headline=swimming-pool-chlorine-may-give-children-asthma--name_page.html This article] says that a third of Welsh 13 and 14 yr olds have asthma which is consistent with the referenced update i added to Asthma#Epidemiology. USA is towards the top of the asthma ranking, but it's not the topmost. Boud (talk) 18:54, 8 August 2008 (UTC)
It's not my goal to debate the validity of the research; I think it's interesting stuff. But please recognize that controlling for potential confounding factors is not a black-and-white or infallible process - quite the opposite. In fact, both of Bernard et al.'s papers drew published commentary which was critical of their statistical methodology and suggested that the association, if any, between pool chlorine and asthma was not as strong as they had reported. See  and  - these are published letters responding to the Bernard articles, and I believe they are freely accessible through the PubMed links I've given. I would open the question of whether this published skepticism about some aspects of the statistical methodology should be incorporated into our article. I take your point about US-centrism - I didn't mean to imply that European research was irrelevant, only to point out that the finding is unlikely to be a universal key to asthma. MastCell Talk 19:55, 8 August 2008 (UTC)
Of course, i agree that the statistical analysis is certainly not a trivial or perfect process. i myself have not tried to seriously judge the quality of the statistical analyses, and even if i did, that would not be publishable in the wikipedia article. Thanks for the links - somehow i don't always manage to get to the open access versions of certain potentially useful medical articles. Both of the ones you gave are open access. In the second case, i found a version including the Bernard group's response. Unfortunately, i also found that Eggleston seems to be a lobbyist for a rather wide range of chemical and pharmaceutical companies, which doesn't add a lot to the credibility of his criticisms. That doesn't make them wrong, but it does alert people to a possible bias. The good point is that it's presumably thanks to many years of citizens' groups' lobbying that medical researchers are now obliged to declare this sort of information. In any case, the info is there - readers will judge what they want from it. Boud (talk) 17:28, 9 August 2008 (UTC)

Major headache at major depressive disorder

Folks, I bring this up now as I want to get this sorted here and now rather than at FAC. In psychiatry here in Oz we all use DSM IV, like the US, and as far as I can tell, there is a lot more written and researched using DSM IV criteria than ICD 10. Thus, we have major depressive disorder aka major depression, which has loads of epidemiological/treatment effectiveness etc. research, and MDD sorta fits somewhere between 'moderate' and 'severe' depression on ICD 10. Unfortunately, we have a  using ICD 10...

*Thus, options are:

leave as is and (a)  or (b) look at addressing naming conventions by at least noting DSM IV-TR is internationally recognised.

change to depressive disorder, with a confusingly close title to depression which serves as a sort of disambiguation page which needs embellishing, and have an article with a huge chunk of details on epidemiology/treatment response etc. referring to MDD all through it and try to explain it.

Also, the situation is even more of an issue when we get to borderline personality disorder (DSM IVTR) vs the stubby ICD 10 article Emotionally unstable personality disorder - the former has a much higher profile and common usage. Cheers, Casliber (talk · ) 13:55, 8 August 2008 (UTC)

I would be very comfortable invoking  here.  The principle from MEDMOS is that we use an appropriate name, not &quot;the Black Dog&quot; or &quot;the blues.&quot;  To quasi-comply, since they have different definitions, they could very well be considered different (albeit intrinsically related) diseases, and each would have their own article, well interlinked.  SDY (talk) 14:10, 8 August 2008 (UTC)

DSM-IV basically outranks ICD-10 in the field of psychiatry. Just leave it. --Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 14:52, 8 August 2008 (UTC)

 Agree with ignore all rules (I believe I had similar with Tourette syndrome, where the ICD-10 name is some gosh-awful convoluted mess, F95.2 Combined vocal and multiple motor tic disorder (de la Tourette) ).  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 15:02, 8 August 2008 (UTC)

ICD-9 shows 296.2 and 296.3 as major depressive disorder single and recurrent episode respectively. All of 296 is Episodic mood disorders with 296.0, .4,.5,.6,.7 as Bipolar I disorder varying on episode numbers; 296.1 as Manic disorder, recurrent episode; 296.8 as Other and unspecified bipolar disorders; and 296.9 as Other and unspecified episodic mood disorder. Not sure if any of this helps at all at this point, especially since I don't know mental health or icd9s that well. Also Tourette's(307.23) comes back as Tourette's disorder(Motor-verbal tic disorder). -Optigan13 (talk) 19:45, 8 August 2008 (UTC)

Constipation Controversy



According to Bockus Gastroenterology (p. 754 2nd ed. Saunders, Philadelphia and London, 1964)

&quot;The ideal posture for defecation is the squatting position, with the thighs flexed upon the abdomen. In this way the capacity of the abdominal cavity is greatly diminished and intra-abdominal pressure increased, thus encouraging expulsion ...&quot;  

I tried adding this to the constipation article, but my edit was vetoed (for reasons I consider erroneous.)  I protested on the talk page a few days ago, but no one has commented, so I thought I'd solicit comments here.  --Jonathan108 (talk) 11:38, 12 August 2008 (UTC)
I definitely learned from a text somewhere that squatting instead sitting reduces hemorrhoids.  But man, I'll be darned if I can remember where I read that. Maybe do some research in African medical articles - I know they don't have hemorrhoids in communities where they squat and not sit.  Maybe a reference like this will help you in your ideal defecating position article.  And if you don't already see the connection, higher intra-abd. pressure = higher incidence of hemorrhoids. Tkjazzer (talk) 15:41, 12 August 2008 (UTC)
I reviewed this a year or two ago because it was added to the hemorrhoids article. I found only 1 reference, and it was in the Journal of Medical Hypotheses. There is no good evidence for either of these theories, although there is considerable circumstantial evidence. --Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 16:27, 12 August 2008 (UTC)

Yes, squatting does prevent (and,in most cases, cure) hemorrhoids.  See the hemorrhoids article for the research.  Higher intra-abd. pressure is not the only effect of squatting.  It also relaxes the puborectalis muscle and increases the anorectal angle. This opens the outlet valve and reduces the straining which is responsible for hemorrhoids.  The squeezing action of the thighs on the cecum and the sigmoid colon fosters more complete evacuation in the 2 most common locations for colon cancer.  --Jonathan108 (talk) 16:34, 12 August 2008 (UTC)
I know. I'm just saying that it's all theory and epidemiology: there are no randomized or case-control or any other trials investigating the usefulness of squatting to prevent hemorrhoids/constipation/bowel cancer/whatever. --Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 18:24, 12 August 2008 (UTC)
Since there's no good research directly on that subject, it is probably better to leave it out of Constipation.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 19:47, 12 August 2008 (UTC)
Just glancing at the article, I'm a little concerned that some of it borders on  issues, including what might be seen as medical advice.  This possible inclusion is a symptom of what that article could easily become.  SDY (talk) 20:12, 12 August 2008 (UTC)

 I don't have a conflict of interest (Axl). This is Soomeh's contribution to the article:-





I found no reliable references for &quot;arterial venous switch&quot; with respect to stroke. In my opinion, this technology is in its infancy. It has not yet demonstrated efficacy. It should not be included in Wikipedia. [And don't dare tell me about &quot;Board certification&quot;, or how I need to &quot;read more&quot;.] Axl (talk) 18:12, 13 August 2008 (UTC)

Help: Low-Carb Diet

I am hoping to find a writing partner for the Low-carbohydrate diet article, specifically somebody with a more formal medical or nutritional background. Currently the references of the article are of non-uniform quality. There are two main reasons for this.
# My access to medical texts and journals is limited.
# The subject itself is very controversial and finding references that are viewed as authoritative and neutral, and which succinctly summarize the relevant points is difficult in some cases. Most sources that clearly elaborate on a relevant point are doctors who are low-carb advocates and, therefore, are perceived as biased. Most general texts only discuss the relevant physiological details in the context of a much broader discussion. As such it is difficult to cite them (i.e. combining bits and pieces from a whole chapter of a book smacks of &quot;original research&quot;).

Any help is appreciated. Mind you, the help does not have to come from a low-carb advocate, only somebody who can be objective about something they might disagree with.

Thanks.

 project

Looking at Featured Topics, there are none to do with science, and none to do with medicine. I'd like to propose a project where we work together to get three or more medical articles (which must be related) up to featured article status so that we can have our first featured topic. Any ideas? —CyclonenimT@lk? 22:32, 18 August 2008 (UTC)

Well, there's a few science Featured Topics, such as the Noble gases, the Solar System and all those hurricanes, but I agree that it would be great if there were more! :)  It'd be great if we could work more closely together.

For this WikiProject, there's a lot of choices.  How about infectious diseases (maybe subdivided into bacterial, viral and eukaryotic parasitic)?  There's also cancer, diseases of metabolism, diseases of different organs and physiological systems (e.g., kidney diseases, congenital heart diseases, neurological disorders, etc.).  I kind of like the infectious diseases: more colorful, more history, more funky angles, but I'm only one editor.

You might also consider making alliances with other WikiProjects, such as  and .  Willow (talk) 22:45, 18 August 2008 (UTC)

Argh. We're having enough trouble keeping up MCOTW! There are some articles of HUGE importance that are just not getting the attention they need (diabetes, stroke, some psychiatry and paediatrics topics). The last think we need now is another diversion... But infectious diseases are interesting, with indeed lots of funky angles, and of major worldwide relevance (and therefore very suitable for major attention on our free encyclopedia with a potentially global readership). Thankfully tuberculosis is FA and malaria a GA. JFW | T@lk 22:53, 18 August 2008 (UTC)

Yeah I appreciate it's hard to get everyone motivated to get articles up to FA quality, but you're right, infectious diseases is an area of significant research and diversity, and there's a topic for everyone to enjoy (seeing as infectious diseases span many, many specialties). Remember that a featured topic is 3 or more articles, so one more article on infectious diseases that is FA or GA then we're already at the minimum requirements. I'm all up for doing a project on infectious diseases if others are. I'll post a notice on some of the other WikiProjects tomorrow. Further comments are appreciated. —CyclonenimT@lk? 22:57, 18 August 2008 (UTC)

This could be fun! :) But maybe we should our sights a little higher than the 3-article minimum?  We'll have a mycobacterium and a parasite — how about adding one Gram-negative disease (Black Death or cholera?), one Gram-positive (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus), and one viral (smallpox or Ebola)?   Plus we might consider bringing up drug resistance and public health, to round out the Topic?  Immune system is already FA, too.  But I guess we shouldn't get too ambitious. ;) Willow (talk) 23:28, 18 August 2008 (UTC)
Are we talking about doing several subtopics of infectious diseases? That's a little ambitious, it'll take a long time to get one clearly defined set done. Also, the topic is supposed to be quite niché, so perhaps start off doing something like 'bacterial infections' and have a few, such as pneumonia (already FA), tuberculosis (already FA) etc. I agree though it should be more than 3 articles, perhaps 5 or 6? It's a little less ambitious than doing loads of different related topics under infectioius diseases, and it's more likely to be accepted. If we finish this task sucessfully, then maybe we could consider moving on to other subtopics. —CyclonenimT@lk? 23:53, 18 August 2008 (UTC)

Just a suggestion, Poliomyelitis has a well defined set of associated articles (Poliovirus, Polio vaccine, Post-polio syndrome, Poliomyelitis eradication, History of poliomyelitis and List of polio survivors). Two of these are already featured (Polio is an FA and List of polio survivors is a featured list). As the primary author of most of these articles, I'd like to think that perhaps most aren't that far off... It has always been my intention to get these article up to FA, and although I haven't had a lot of time to contribute lately I'd love to see polio as a featured topic.--DO11.10 (talk) 01:49, 19 August 2008 (UTC)

New policy proposal and draft help



I have drafted a new proposal and would like help in clarifying, adjusting, adapting, and improving it. It is based on five years of work here at Wikipedia (not always the prettiest, I might add). I think it summarizes the opinions of a great majority of editors as to how to handle scientific situations. This proposal serves as a nexus between  and  for cases where we are dealing with observable reality. It is needed because there are a lot of editors who don't seem to understand what entails best-practices when writing a reliable reference work about observable reality. I don't pretend that this version is perfect, and would appreciate any and all additions, suggestions people may have for getting to some well-regarded scientific standards.

Note that these standards would apply only when discussing matters directly related to observable reality. These standards are inspired in part by  but avoid some of the major pitfalls of that particular proposal. In particular, the idea that SPOV even exists is a real problem. However, I think it is undeniable that we should have some standards for writing about scientific topics.

See also  for another failed proposal that dovetails with this one. I hope this particular proposal is more in-line with the hole I see in policy/guidelines for dealing with these situations.

ScienceApologist (talk) 19:59, 19 August 2008 (UTC)
 Is this partly in response to &quot;Opposition to water fluoridation&quot;? ;-) In principle, it looks good. Unfortunately the nature of &quot;pseudo-controversial&quot; is likely to be controversial, as proponents of the &quot;fringe&quot; may claim scientific evidence. Would you consider long-term antibiotic use in &quot;chronic Lyme disease&quot; controversial or pseudo-controversial? Axl (talk) 20:41, 19 August 2008 (UTC)

In part it's a response to that, but it's more in response to all my work over the last few years which involves a lot more than just that article. Yes, the nature of pseudo-controversial is likely to be controversial, but I think a standard of &quot;Does the opposing side acknowledge the controversy exists when publishing within their communities?&quot; is a very stringent one that will make it more clear for people trying to sift through babies and bathwater. So to answer your last question, I do the dishonorable thing of asking a question of my own, do people who object to long-term antibiotic use in &quot;chronic Lyme disease&quot; acknowledge a controversy within the medical community when writing about treatment of Lyme disease? If not, then it is pseudo-controversial. If yes, then it's controversial. Of course, something need not stay pseudo-controversial. For example, what causes stomach ulcers was for years a pseudo-controversy, but burst onto the scene and rapidly went from legitimate controversy to uncontroversial. ScienceApologist (talk) 23:26, 19 August 2008 (UTC)

Ultimately we'll be citing individual opinions on what is controversial or not. One scientist will say &quot;it is not controversial&quot;, another will say it is. Another will do a paper devoted to  Many may not acknowledge it in their papers. Others may run whole papers devoted to the topic and conclude that there is a connection, or there is not. Almost all of these controversies have some peer-reviewed papers supporting them. The ones that don't, sure, those are complete pseudocontroversies. Your examples, evolution and global warming, are (based on what I've heard) pseudocontroversies, but as I'm no expert on the subject, I'm hesitant to make that statement. Anyway, I agree that certain things are pseudocontroversial, but we don't need an entire page on that point alone. It's a fine essay, but it's utterly superflous and possibly dangerous as policy.
