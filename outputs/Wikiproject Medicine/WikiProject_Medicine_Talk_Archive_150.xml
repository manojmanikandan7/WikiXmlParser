 Sources for fossil fuel air pollution deaths 

Hi everyone. For the article ustainable energy, I'm trying to figure out what sources we can use for the number of worldwide annual air pollution deaths that are caused by fossil fuel emissions. This is tricky because while calculating the total number of air pollution deaths is biomedical science, the work of tracing the sources of pollutants is mostly environmental science. What do you think about using the calculated numbers of deaths from [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30910976/ this paper by Lelevield et al in PNAS], and [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0013935121000487 this paper by Vohra et al in Environmental Research]? ser:Clayoquot|Clayoquot (ser_talk:Clayoquot|talk | pecial:Contributions/Clayoquot|contribs) 04:09, 26 April 2021 (UTC)

@ser:Clayoquot|Clayoquot, have you looked for statistics from the WHO?  That might let you sidestep any &quot;your scientists are the wrong kind&quot; debate that might arise. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 20:27, 26 April 2021 (UTC)
Hi WhatamIdoing. Thanks for this idea. The WHO doesn't give precise numbers on this. They say 7 million people die each year from air pollution and say in various documents that fossil fuels are a major contributor. FWIW it's just a debate between myself and myself for now to make the article as useful as possible within policy. ser:Clayoquot|Clayoquot (ser_talk:Clayoquot|talk | pecial:Contributions/Clayoquot|contribs) 23:05, 26 April 2021 (UTC)

Is this any help? [https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2684596] I used it at the nvironmental policy of the Donald Trump administration article. ser:Gandydancer|Gandydancer (ser talk:Gandydancer|talk) 11:26, 27 April 2021 (UTC)
Thanks, but we need sources that are global in scope. ser:Clayoquot|Clayoquot (ser_talk:Clayoquot|talk | pecial:Contributions/Clayoquot|contribs) 16:40, 27 April 2021 (UTC)
The WHO document that your Lelevield paper cites [https://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/250141 here] looks pretty detailed, but I only skimmed it. The topic is [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/21/reduce-air-pollution-levels-uk-to-who-limits-says-coroner-ella-kissi-debrah in the UK news] again. I get the feeling more and more illnesses than just the obvious asthma/lung disease ones are being identified, so this may be something where the estimates become quickly out of date. -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 17:23, 27 April 2021 (UTC)
Thanks. I checked and this WHO document doesn't seem to quantify the contribution of fossil fuel emissions. ser:Clayoquot|Clayoquot (ser_talk:Clayoquot|talk | pecial:Contributions/Clayoquot|contribs) 17:36, 27 April 2021 (UTC)

After thinking more, I'm leaning towards using these two papers. The p:Why MEDRS|reasons for MEDRS are the particular complexity of medical science, and the level of potential harm if we report information prematurely. I don't think either of these concerns apply in this case, and I prefer not to normalize too-high sourcing standards that would make it harder to write about pollution. ser:Clayoquot|Clayoquot (ser_talk:Clayoquot|talk | pecial:Contributions/Clayoquot|contribs) 17:30, 27 April 2021 (UTC)
The rather long essay you link to is largely the thoughts of one editor (Jytdog). Sometimes when we are worried about whether MEDRS applies, then it is useful to step back and look at other guidelines and policy. For example P:RS/AC recommends using review articles to determine if there is scientific consensus on a matter. I would think also a big organisation like WHO would also have processes in place to ensure its public-facing publications are within the bounds of scientific agreement, but others may know more about that. Medical or not, there is a danger when one cites a research paper with novel findings that the findings were not accepted. Per P:UNDUE, if nobody else is pulling that &quot;X million deaths due to Y&quot; figure out of the paper, then perhaps we shouldn't. There's also the complication with ustainable energy that some &quot;sustainable&quot; solutions involve burning. When we start adding bio fats and ethanol into fuel, what proportion is &quot;fossil&quot;? Wood and ry dung fuel also cause significant pollution. Someone shifting from dry dung to natural gas in the kitchen is likely reducing pollution, though adding other environmental debts. Ideally, for this article, we'd want a source that considers pollution from this angle of sustainable energy transition. -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 08:41, 28 April 2021 (UTC)
It's wonderful to see the interest here in sustainable energy. I agree that the WHO is an ideal source for the health effects of energy use, which as Colin points out are caused by the burning of both fossil fuels and biomass. What I think I'm hearing so far is that policy does not categorically exclude the two papers I mentioned, but sources that state scientific consensus (like the WHO) should be given a lot more weight. ser:Clayoquot|Clayoquot (ser_talk:Clayoquot|talk | pecial:Contributions/Clayoquot|contribs) 05:41, 29 April 2021 (UTC)
I can't read your second paper, but I googled some findings and the 8.7 million fossil fuel deaths figure was widely picked up in the media. Ok, so that's mostly hurnalism and those aren't high quality sources for scientific facts. But the commentary, and the US political angle, suggests this finding is going to be cited in reviews and other high quality secondary sources soon. Wrt consensus, if you are reading the literature, then you'll likely have a gut feel and take a punt on this source in good faith. The main problem will be if someone challenges your figures, and all you have is the primary research paper -- it can't demonstrate its own acceptance by the scientific community. But perhaps nobody will challenge it, and in a couple of months time, you'll have a review to cite instead or as well. -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 07:59, 29 April 2021 (UTC)

 Template:Rp on the way out ? 

From [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Rp this], and from the linked discussion, it seems to have been decided that this template will become obsolete and deprecated. My impression is it's quite heavily used in medical articles. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 15:56, 15 April 2021 (UTC)
That note has been on the template's doc page for a long while.  My impression is that getting the WMDE wish here is blocked on editor acceptance (in addition to them finishing up the work).  If you're used to seeing ummy refp|234 then seeing ummy ref|1a is, you know, different.  (It would probably be &quot;1a&quot; here, rather than the &quot;1.1&quot; they show in their documentation, because that's the style we use here.) ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:12, 15 April 2021 (UTC)
This is news to me - multiple WP space pages specifically refer to this template as both a method and at times the preferred method of adding page numbers to references - as you may see, I have used it in all of my GAs which all have used textbooks for reference. I don't know why a Wikimedia Group is going to be able, if ever, to deprecate a template on enwp without obtaining a local (project) consensus for such - and I see no such linked discussion. FWIW, I don't support requiring editors to use a specific method of referencing pages any more than I support requiring editors to use a specific reference style - if anything, I could support a certain method being preferred (like I prefer CS1 [and included vancouver style parameters if desired] for ease of use and readability) but not mandated. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez (ser:Berchanhimez|User/ser talk:Berchanhimez|say hi!) 03:59, 16 April 2021 (UTC)
The template's creator is the one who [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Rp/doc&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=929219735&amp;oldid=927748666&amp;diffmode=source added this note], and I have the impression from prior discussions that he'll be glad to see it go.  If we ever actually deprecated the template (which is not necessary), it should be easy to convert from the template to the new WMDE option via bot or AWB script. 
I didn't remember seeing any pages recommend it as the preferred method, but I have found ikipedia:Writing your first GA, which doesn't list any alternatives. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:16, 16 April 2021 (UTC)
Maybe I am mis-remembering or conflating two things - my understanding was that this template was &quot;preferred&quot; when multiple distinct page sections are referenced from the same book, over the alternative which is having the same book appear in multiple citations with differing page numbers (i.e. instead of having [1] [2] [3] [6] [8] [10] all being the book but with different page numbers, have [1]l|rp and change the rp template so that the book itself only appears in the reference list once). In fact, elp:References_and_page_numbers|this help page states (perhaps incorrectly) that using pages in the references themselves is deprecated and either SFN or RP should be used instead. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez (ser:Berchanhimez|User/ser talk:Berchanhimez|say hi!) 16:28, 16 April 2021 (UTC)
There's no such rule.  I mean, I personally happen to prefer l|rp to the sfn templates, but that's not the same as there being an actual rule.  Our main rule is basically that editors shouldn't fight about how to format citations.  We'll take almost anything as long as it is internally consistent within the same page, makes some basic level of sense, and nobody's fighting. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:09, 17 April 2021 (UTC)
I wouldn't mourn its loss. The vast majority of our readers are not looking at the references, never mind needing to know the page number of a book or long paper. For them, this is just visual noise that gets in the way of reading. So we are inconveniencing the huge majority to help with the 1 in a big-number reader who wants to look up the book and page number to check a fact. The l|sfn template isn't ideal, but at least readers of the article aren't bothered by the extra detail of source precision. -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 10:52, 16 April 2021 (UTC)
 The noisy thing cannot be gone soon enough for me :). ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  12:33, 16 April 2021 (UTC)
|SandyGeorgia, Not sure this is the best place to discuss it, but I recently started using this. It works well in VE, produces results that look satisfactory, and makes ref organizing helpful - before that I used to create dozens of refs for the same book. It also makes citing pages from journals more doable. So I'd be sad to see it go, unless we get something that replaces it and retains all functionality &amp; friendliness of this. ser:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus|ser talk:Piotrus| reply here 05:44, 17 April 2021 (UTC)
Hi, Piotrus!  I don’t care for the clutter within text.  I hated SFNs for years, but have to come to understand they are easy to use, give a clean result for our readers, and are easy to edit around.  So, that’s the system that gives the same result but with better functionality and friendliness, once one does the convert. 
* ementia with Lewy bodies#References
* uruli ulcer#References
* enstrual cycle#References
 No irritiating clutter for the reader, and very little clutter to edit around in edit mode. ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  12:52, 17 April 2021 (UTC)
Eventually, it appears that our options will look something like this:
* p|123 → ummyrefp|123
* fn|Lee|2020|123 → ummyref
* p. 123  → ummyref|1a
I don't think that any of these amount to clutter in wikitext mode, and I'm not sure that readers will be irritated by any of them.  If you were looking for a reason to prefer one or another, then if you use the same source for a large part of the content, then the sfn template tends to obscure that (by giving you a different blue number for each page number), and any form of template is worse for translation (because neither sfn nor rp are present at most Wikipedias, whereas wikitext options will eventually be the same everywhere).  However, I think that for most subjects, these are minor considerations.
@ser:Piotrus|Piotrus, I don't think there is any significant risk of the l|rp template being deleted locally during the next couple of years, even if etawiki:WMDE_Technical_Wishes/Book_referencing#%E2%80%A6_the_Visual_Editor|the WMDE wish list item gets finished soon (which is not guaranteed). ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:32, 17 April 2021 (UTC)
|SandyGeorgia, I don't think the page numbers in text produce irritating clutter. In fact, I think they are educational, stressing the fact that we care about page numbers and also telling the reader the source is probably of a higher quality (since paginated sources are usually books or journal articles). So the more I think about it the more I believe the 'rp' style is the best style, both from the reader (educational) and editor (simple code) perspective... ser:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus|ser talk:Piotrus| reply here 04:29, 18 April 2021 (UTC)
I don't buy it. There are plenty awful books and primary research articles are a pest that also have page numbers. And I wouldn't want readers to think the source was more reliable just because someone stuck :[123] after the citation. I mean, how many readers will even have the slightest clue what :[123] means? Particularly when the DOI or other link takes you to an HTML format journal article that doesn't even have page numbers found only in the PDF version (assuming our reader can even access the journal article beyond the abstract). Honestly, I think you are just trying to convince yourself that the style you picked is best, which is a pretty natural human thing to do. Perhaps our readers think text with [1][5][7][14][16] think is super reliable because it has five sources, when it is often a sign of editors trying to convince others of some contentious &quot;fact&quot;. I suspect most of our readers don't look for the citations at all. Is text with a citation at the end of the paragraph more reliable than text with five citations throughout the paragraph? Not necessarily, and the former is probably more readable prose that has been added by one person sourced to one comprehensive source, vs five editors with five factoids sourced to five varied sources. -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 08:09, 19 April 2021 (UTC)
Of course references are sometimes  used wrongly. Finding references sourced to incorrect page numbers is an excellent way of detecting them I've used many times. We should be encouraging as precise citation as possible.(tho of course over precision can be excessive, as in twenty citations to the same or adjacent pages) But  I always get a little suspicious when I see something specific and important linked to a book without giving page numbers unless it seems clearly to be a book that supports the overall content of hte article.- I take it as a sign that the editor might never have seen the book--  The basis by which we librarians have  supported the use of WP is that, unlike all other generally available sources, it does give citations, and often correct  and exact citations at that. The idea that it's irrelevant to users implies that we've given up on showing WP:V. ser:DGG| DGG (ser talk:DGG| talk ) 10:21, 29 April 2021 (UTC)

 Smell training 

A newly created article on mell training, a proported treatment for the loss of the sense of smell caused by Covid-19, is in the queue to be in DYK on the Front Page.

@ser:Abductive|Abductive, at a quick glance, and based on my overall impression (i.e., not based on a thorough review of sources), I think the article's description as a &quot;promising experimental treatment&quot; probably reflects the mainstream view.

Here's an analysis: [https://slate.com/technology/2021/04/does-smell-therapy-for-people-who-had-covid-19-really-work.html &quot;Questionable Therapy&quot;.]  “Smell training is somewhat questionable, frankly,” says Richard Doty, director of the University of Pennsylvania’s Smell and Taste Center. While the therapy has “caught the imagination of laypeople as well as scientists,” he says, the evidence is “pretty weak that it has any effect.” Doty, a physician who has published widely on olfactory dysfunction ... “the studies have been so poor”. And: According to Moein, the Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences neuroscientist, an additional limitation is that in many smell studies, patients and researchers know at the outset which patients are and are not receiving the treatment — a study design that can bias the results. “This has been problematic for many of the papers about smell loss,” she says. And: ...Moein, too, notes that when you have vision problems, doctors tell you to wear glasses. “They never tell you to look at different lines, vertical or horizontal, several times a day to recover your eyesight.”.

I'm also not sure that the Slate.com article would actually disagree with any single sentence in the article.  COVID-19 is only mentioned in a single sentence, and that sentence merely says that some COVID patients are trying it.
IMO the comparison to optometry is inappropriate.  Most vision problems are physical, not neurological.  You can't change the shape of the eyeball or remove a cataract by trying to see something.  Neural plasticity, on the the other hand, is something that behavior does affect.  A more apt comparison would be to patching a dominant eye to treat mblyopia, because &quot;trying to see something&quot; while your brain is ignoring the nerve signals seems pretty close to &quot;trying to smell something&quot; when the nerves aren't working. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 05:08, 4 May 2021 (UTC)

ser:Abductive|Abductive can you please revert your changes since 12:45 and we can discuss, perhaps on the article talk page, what should and should not be said on the article. This is a treatment, rightly or wrongly, that is viewed by our most reliable sources as having some benefit to some patients, and is clinically recommended by multiple authorities. In medical articles, we try, as much as possible, not to argue in front of the reader. If this treatment is as dubious as Richard Doty believes, we should have no trouble finding multiple high quality sources that agree with him on that. So far, we have multiple high quality sources that do not. Doty is not among the 42 experts who signed that position statement I cited above. How do we justify including his views above 42 others? Or above British Rhinological Society? Wikipedia has to apportion weight fairly, whereas magazines (and historically, the BBC, to its shame) often like to place two opposing &quot;experts&quot; as equals, thinking that provides some kind of balance. If it is &quot;a joke&quot;, as you say, then there are an awful lot of expert bodies that are in on it. Do you think that is likely? -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 15:16, 4 May 2021 (UTC)
The field of olfaction has no idea how the sense of smell works, and this treatment, as the article now correctly states, is low-cost and unlikely to do harm, so these experts can go about their days without having to admit that they can't help people regain their sense of smell, but give them something to do instead of ringing their offices. It is a joke, and we all know it. ser:Abductive|Abductive (ser talk:Abductive|reasoning) 16:06, 4 May 2021 (UTC)
Who is the &quot;we&quot; that knows it's a joke?  If &quot;we&quot; is &quot;experts in the field&quot;, then why are the experts in the field saying that it's not a joke in their official writings?

We only have User:Colin's word that Doty is alone in his view. In fact, there are others, even ones in the source I provided in the beginning of this section. A simple solution is to include the skeptical viewpoint, which has some weight, in the article instead of arguing here. I have attempted to do so. As editors, it is incumbent upon all of us to make the article better, not take an adversarial position here because we don't like another editor's tone.  ser:Abductive|Abductive (ser talk:Abductive|reasoning) 16:30, 4 May 2021 (UTC)
What's the point in saying it is &quot;Colin's word&quot;. It is easy to disprove. There are various search engines and repositories of research you can use to find if anyone else shares Doty's views. I googled Doty and Moein, the two people that Slate interviewed who were negative, and it turns out they are colleagues: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7436559/ Prevalence and Reversibility of Smell Dysfunction Measured Psychophysically in a Cohort of COVID‐19 patients] and [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/alr.22587?fbclid=IwAR2zjBnhAiBzU-P5F3CCEQppqzlly6WOUZTeD44oSwot9Y9uGroHUKYSFy0 Smell dysfunction: a biomarker for COVID‐19] are written by Moein under Doty's supervision.

So, their learned perspectives should be given extra weight in the article.— Preceding ikipedia:Signatures|unsigned comment added by ser:Abductive|Abductive (ser talk:Abductive#top|talk • pecial:Contributions/Abductive|contribs) 17:38, 4 May 2021 (UTC)
I'm not seeing any evidence their perspective is more &quot;learned&quot; than any of the other experts cited above, who consider smell training to have some value. Let's be clear, nobody is suggesting this is a miracle cure. The current evidence suggests a small improvement for some people. I've tried finding reviews on smell training that have a negative conclusion but have not found any yet. The more I read of Doty's book chapter (which reviews several treatment options or research paths) the less I'm impressed. The disadvantage of a narrative review like his is that he can cherry pick which studies support his opinions, and exclude others (he neglects to mention two randomised controlled trials that are picked up in other meta analyses). A systematic review (like those mentioned above) avoids a deliberate neglect of inconvenient findings. The strong opinions that litter his text are accompanied by citations to other articles which do not reach his conclusions. It is a bit like a movie poster that says &quot;Astounding&quot; and cites a review that says the film was &quot;astoundingly bad&quot;. Or if your friend Joe said a restaurant had slow service but the food was fine and you repeated this to another friend as &quot;Joe says it wasn't worth the wait&quot;. The chapter is really quite a mess and more of a rant, actually. IMO, it goes beyond professional disagreement into academic insults that must make him an awkward invite to any conference. -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 20:12, 4 May 2021 (UTC)


I would appreciate if WP:MED could review the recent edits to this article, which is on the main page today. User:Abductive continues to attack the article with negative comments. Some unsourced (such as adding &quot;small&quot; to describe the studies and other sourced to one lone critic (Doty). These have been written in a way that looks like Wikipedia is editorialising (&quot;unfortunately still marred by small sample sizes and lack of double blinding&quot;) and inserted in a way that looks like they are the view of a meta-analysis. I cannot see any reason at this point to include Doty's views, as they appear to be P:FRINGE. -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 14:34, 5 May 2021 (UTC)
I have refactored the weight to be as mild as possible. Please take a look. ser:Abductive|Abductive (ser talk:Abductive|reasoning) 15:24, 5 May 2021 (UTC)
Firstly, the weight should be zero. I have not found a single reliable source or authority that agrees with Doty. Whereas we have position papers and consensus guidelines that list many dozens of expert authors who unanimously agree this treatment has merit. Secondly, the Slate article is not P:MEDRS for medical claims. Thirdly, the book chapter does not, AFAICS, mention &quot;the potential for the observed improvements to have been the result of nerve regeneration that would have occurred without intervention as reason to be skeptical&quot;. The problem with that statement is there are randomised controlled studies of this, but Doty doesn't mention them in his narrative review. In contrast, the two meta-analysis reviews do include them, because those are the best trials. The controls in those studies show that this is not simply regression to the norm or expected regeneration -- those doing the training are more likely to gain smell or gain it quicker than controls. Thirdly, you say &quot;Critics&quot; when there is just one guy. -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 15:36, 5 May 2021 (UTC)

ser:Abductive|Abductive, Moein and Doty are colleagues. He's her supervisor, or similar relationship. And we only have a non-reliable source for her opinions. You said on my user talk page that I was &quot;determined to win&quot;. I'm really not. Neither WAID nor I had any knowledge of this therapy and folks at WP:MED are pretty sceptical about unusual therapies. I've researched the evidence and indicated what I found. If I was &quot;determined to win&quot; I wouldn't have even mentioned Doty's book chapter. I'm still looking to find negative opinions but not finding anyone else who concludes this therapy is &quot;a joke&quot; or who &quot;question[s] the validity of this entire field&quot; as Doty puts it. 
Justin Turner, one of the co-authors of yet-another meta-analysis, from 2017: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4783272/ Efficacy of olfactory training in patients with olfactory loss: a systematic review and meta-analysis] has recently written an editorial [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/alr.22681 Olfactory training: what is the evidence?]. He is interviewed about it in a podcast [https://www.scopeitoutpodcast.com/podcast/episode-49-olfactory-training-what-is-the-evidence-with-dr-justin-turner/ Olfactory training: what is the evidence? with Dr. Justin Turner]. I encourage you to read and listen to those. The editorial is quite critical, and yet this is a guy who offers the treatment to his patients. Sure there are weaknesses in the studies performed, but the overwhelming view of the experts is that some patients will see some improvement, and it is not just down to &quot;they'd have got better anyway&quot;. For sure, the fact that it is harmless and cheap means there's little harm in recommending it, but there are supplements for example, that that are also relatively harmless and cheap, and which guidelines say are not recommended. The problem we have is that the Slate article fails MEDRS. The editorial fails MEDRS. The podcast fails MEDRS. And Doty is hugely outnumbered by other experts to the degree where his views are fringe. We aren't in some situation, for example, where the American's all think it is bunk and the Europeans think it is great. -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 16:39, 5 May 2021 (UTC)
You are a master at cherry-picking. But you are wrong on every count. You misinterpret WP:MEDRS.

But you don't have any source that multiple people have made those actual claims. Please can you quote from the sources you give that small sample size and the potential for regeneration is a &quot;reason to be skeptical&quot;. I can't find that in the Slate review. The book chapter conveniently avoids citing the several randomised controlled studies.

Because of a phenomenon we call P:BOOMERANG, and our unfortunate tendency to privilege editors' experience and prior participation (you'd lose) and our general preference for &quot;fancy&quot; academic citations over an individual clinic's own website (you'd lose again), I think you might be better off not taking your complaint to the ikipedia:Dramaboard.

I also assumed that the number was not meaningfully different from zero, but it seems that about three out of 1,000 page views result in the reader clicking a link inside a ref.  This is most likely to happen when the article is incomplete.  The assumption is that people click the links when they need more information than the article can provide.  epression (mood) is a pretty popular article, with ~1750 page views per day, so if we assume that it's average for clickthrough rates (it's probably less) and that all refs are equally likely to be clicked on (probably not true), then using this link as a ref means that about 12 (twelve) readers per year would click through.  &quot;Where readers will not see it&quot; sounds like an accurate description. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 20:23, 2 May 2021 (UTC)

 Is there any research on people's reasons for not accepting the COVID 19 vaccine? 

Hi all

Is anyone aware of any research looking a who is unwilling or worried about getting a COVID-19 vaccination either in a specific country/region or globally? Most popular news sources focus on conspiracy theories related to COVID but there are also issues around perceived risk of blood clots etc. The section OVID-19_vaccine#Vaccine_hesitancy talks about percentage of vaccine hesitancy generally and one study from the US of what people say they would do when a vaccine became available.

For context, my sister is a vaccination nurse and only around 1/4 of people with appointments for getting vaccinated today showed up.... My hope is that this is not all because of a belief in conspiracy theories.

Thanks 

ser:John Cummings|John Cummings (ser talk:John Cummings|talk) 21:36, 5 May 2021 (UTC)
Well, I don't have sources, but in my experience actual hesitancy is only about maybe a quarter of the population anywhere - and of those, maybe only half are adamantly refusing the vaccine. Of the other 75%, there's about a third (or 25% overall) who aren't going to ever go out of their way to get the vaccine. Basically, if they show up and are shopping at their grocery store and can get an appointment (or an expiring dose), they'll get it, and they'll then go back for the second (maybe), but if not, they won't. Furthermore, of the remaining 50% overall, another quarter isn't going to &quot;traverse mountains&quot; to get it - i.e. they'll make an appointment and a special trip, but they won't do so if it means going out in the rain, or if it's super hot, or if another activity comes along which conflicts, etc. Luckily, in the US, there's a massive surplus of vaccines now, meaning that people can reschedule as much as they want. As a comparison, a place I work at had around 40 appointments one day recently, but only about 8 of them showed up because of completely shit weather that day. From what I saw, the vast majority of those people ended up rescheduling and coming to appointments later that week. It's not just weather but also other events such as traffic issues that cause people to miss. On the subject of side effects, I think there's actually more people getting appointments from what I've seen now than when the J/J vaccine was paused - many people seem to have been waiting for the J/J vaccine (against our recommendations) and then once they perceived it to be potentially risky said &quot;fuck it I'll get whatever I can&quot;. Any links to studies that people provide here would be appreciated, but I figured I'd give my experiences. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez (ser:Berchanhimez|User/ser talk:Berchanhimez|say hi!) 21:42, 5 May 2021 (UTC)

 Looking for an editor to help with edit requests 

Hi, I am a COI editor that recently made a few edit requests on alk: FIGS (apparel). The editor that had been helping me has taken a break from editing, so I am hoping someone in the WP: Medicine will be interested in taking a look at my most recent requests and then implementing them. Thanks in advance. ser:Todd at Figs|Todd at Figs (ser talk:Todd at Figs|talk) 23:26, 12 May 2021 (UTC)
Made some of the edits requested - I'm not well versed in how CEOs/etc are put into articles so leaving that for someone else, as well as the recognition. Made significant changes to the &quot;controversy&quot; section - another set of eyes on that would be appreciated as well. The controversy is well documented and far-reaching, but I'm not sure what if any changes were made after in the company that can be well-sourced and added for due weight and balance. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez (ser:Berchanhimez|User/ser talk:Berchanhimez|say hi!) 00:08, 13 May 2021 (UTC)

 Edit request on alk:Primary hyperoxaluria 
ile:Structure of oxalate.svg|thumb|100px|Oxalate

Hello,

I wanted to point out that there is an outstanding edit request on alk:Primary hyperoxaluria from an editor with a COI.  It's a lengthy, somewhat complicated edit request that involves evaluating sources for compliance with P:MEDRS, and thus is unlikely to interest the vast majority of people working the edit request queue.  Just thought I'd point it out in case anyone in this Wikiproject is inclined to tackle it. ~ ser:ONUnicorn|ONUnicorn(ser talk:ONUnicorn|Talk|pecial:Contributions/ONUnicorn|Contribs)P:P&amp;S|problem solving 16:41, 10 May 2021 (UTC)

 Time-limited trial 

I've been seeing news reports about ime-limited trial, a technique used in nd-of-life care (among other things).  The general idea is that you try something, and if you don't see an improvement in a stated (reasonable) amount of time, then you stop.  Is this something that could be part of an existing article?  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:22, 11 May 2021 (UTC)
Probably best as a section in linical trial for now, likely under the &quot;trial design&quot; heading or the &quot;types&quot; heading, and if it becomes clear there's too much information for adding on that page, a P:SS|summary paragraph with a link to a specific page. Just my 2 cents, I'm not sure there's enough encyclopedic information on those trials specifically to merit inclusion on the page or on its own page - it's basically just another &quot;form&quot; of trial where instead of continuing treatment regardless of improvement, the clinician can stop the treatment. IMO it's not much different than other treatment-paramaters in trials such as crossovers, but there may be enough information out there for a small extra article on them. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez (ser:Berchanhimez|User/ser talk:Berchanhimez|say hi!) 19:05, 11 May 2021 (UTC)
I'm not sure it's really a clinical trial, since it's not research-oriented.  What I've seen suggests that it's more about helping family members see that the hospital staff is doing everything reasonable, and agreeing in advance that if  doesn't produce  in a reasonable length of time, then it's time to stop life-prolonging treatment.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 20:18, 11 May 2021 (UTC)

 Should disease pages have a link to diagnostic tool if one exists 

In my opinion, when a destination link to a diagnostic tool satisfies these 8 criteria:

1. Not commercial - no advertising

2. No registration required

3. Scientifically validated.

4. Considered the gold standard of diagnosing that disease.

5. In multiple languages

6. Available worldwide

7. Not collecting user data.

8. Immediate automated results.

Then that tool should be linked to from the diagnosis page.

Imagine a world where non-profit medical organizations and non-profit universities started competing to create these diagnostic tools. And these diagnostic tools were available on the disease page. 

I would like to live in that world where my mother could have filled out the diagnostic form and detected her disease years before she was actually able to save money to see the doctor.

In my work with the medical industry over 20 years I am confident that such a policy will have non-profit organizations and universities creating these diagnostic tools. And these diagnostic tools will save 1000's of lives each day.

Please let me know your thoughts.

ser:Knownnotknown|Knownnotknown (ser talk:Knownnotknown|talk) 23:27, 4 May 2021 (UTC)

Your #1 isn't technically a requirement here at the English Wikipedia, but it's a nice-to-have, when available.  (We object to ikipedia:ELNO#EL5|'objectionable' amounts of advertisements, not normal amounts).
#2 is a ikipedia:ELNO#EL6|requirement in the usual rules, and I think closely related to your #8 (none of this 'thank you for spending all this time answering the questions – now give me your e-mail address if you want to see the results' garbage).
#3 is my preference, but I could be persuaded to skip it if there were some special circumstance.  I wouldn't want to have disputes over whether the website or the tool has to be scientifically validated.
#4 is IMO not important.  For example, height–weight calculators of ody mass index aren't the gold standard for diagnosing obesity, but they are very widely used.
#5 is another nice-to-have, but I wouldn't exclude a link for being available only in English.  The related #6 is ikipedia:ELNO#EL7|a requirement in the usual rules.
#7 is IMO a nice-to-have rather than a requirement.  
I think that you might overestimate the concern that average people have about computer security and privacy.  The average person, if promised a video of dancing bears, will click on anything necessary to watch that video.

* I don't think we should be including diagnostic tools with the (hyperbolic) intention of &quot;saving 1000's of lives each day&quot;, as that is not the purpose of an encyclopedia. It is also possible that linking such tools may cause real-world harm. On the other hand there is surely no problem linking such a site if it is, as suggested above, &quot;scientifically validated&quot; - and that I suggest would mean it was at least uncritically referred-to in some P:MEDRS.

*Do we have any examples of existing diagnostic tool web pages that would meet even a few of these criteria? I'm sceptical that doctoring could be reduced to filling in a static form. A link on a &quot;disease page&quot; suggests the person already has a suspected diagnosis. There are existing websites that take users through a set of questions and may use a mix of static logic or AI to triage patients towards either an information page or where to go next (doctor, pharmacy, hospital A&amp;E). But these are general purpose portals (not aimed at one condition) and likely aimed at the typical health needs of their target audience (so not much emphasis on tropical diseases or snake bites in the UK, say). A website that could deal with global health concerns in this fashion would be unlikely IMO. I have to say, I'd rather imagine a world where your mum didn't have to save up money before she could see a doctor. -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 08:57, 5 May 2021 (UTC)

* eply to|Knownnotknown Just to make it clear to everyone here, you are just off a block for edit warring in which you promoted that questionnaire, and now it's painfully obvious what your question is all about.
 We do mention diagnostic tools as described in P:MEDRS, which mainly includes academic literature. We do not usually link to the websites of private medical practices, because well, they are usually not MEDRS, and two, there is always a risk of uncontrolled content - the website will disappear, the tool will be edited, the site owner will add promotional content, etc. Moreover, the mere linking to a private medical practice may be construed as sort of endorsement of that practice, which we are normally keen to avoid.
 So - no, I'm against linking to your medical practice. — ser:Kashmiri|kashmīrī ser talk:Kashmiri|TALK 09:44, 5 May 2021 (UTC)

 The problem of uncontrolled content is with all external links. MEDRS is for the tool and not for the domain name. The reason for starting this discussion is to build consensus. Not to hide.

I find this surprising because I'm under the impression that the PHQ-9 is commonly used in clinical medicine. ser:Biosthmors|Biosthmors (ser talk:Biosthmors|talk) 23:09, 9 May 2021 (UTC)
It does seem to have been quite difficult to get Knownnotknown to digest how Wikipedia articles are written; I have given two examples of how to discuss and include a link to HQ-9 in a featured article at the discussion [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Major_depressive_disorder&amp;oldid=1023621391#External_links here], but I don't sense I have made any progress. The intent seems to be to get a specific link in to the article, rather than correctly sourced content about the instrument with a wikilink to the instrument's article.  If not for being so busy, I would search for a high quality source, adequate for a Featured article, and do it myself as this discussion continues to go in circles; perhaps someone else will add the text, correctly sourced. ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  12:13, 17 May 2021 (UTC)
I see no reason that for articles solely about diagnostic tools, or articles about diseases where one diagnostic tool is considered due weight to include a section about, they can't include an external link to a copy of that tool. Our article bodies are not to put external links to additional content in - if it's not encyclopedic (i.e. we can't include it directly in the article), then it can at most be linked as an external link at the bottom of the article. In cases where the tool itself has an article about it, there is no reason to include the external link on the disease article itself. The ajor depressive disorder article rightly goes over many screening and evaluation tools for depression. PHQ9 should be included under the ajor depressive disorder#Screening and prevention|Screening and prevention section of the article. A link to the tool itself that meets EL criteria can then be added on HQ-9. The relevant policy here is P:SS|summary style - for articles that cover in brief content that is given its own or a sub-article, content should generally be added to that sub-article. While it's noble to want people to be able to &quot;easily be able to self-screen for depression when reading the MDD article&quot; (my summary, not a direct quote of any one person), that is not within the purpose of Wikipedia and does not make it okay to add that link on the MDD article. It should go on the article about the tool and the tool should be discussed in the appropriate section of the MDD article. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez (ser:Berchanhimez|User/ser talk:Berchanhimez|say hi!) 23:18, 9 May 2021 (UTC)
Update: I just noticed that the PHQ9 article already links to the Pfizer website, which requires inputting no personal information whatsoever, and offers the PHQ9 (among other tools) with only about 3 clicks in a variety of languages as a PDF - that someone could easily check off. Our article already provides a &quot;conversion&quot; from the PHQ9 score to whether someone would potentially want to seek help. I see no reason to add another link to a different website than the official one. Alternatively, the website makes clear that the questionnaires can be reproduced without permission required. This seems to me like a good thing to port to WikiSource, and then a WikiSource content box can be added to relevant articles if desired. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez (ser:Berchanhimez|User/ser talk:Berchanhimez|say hi!) 23:22, 9 May 2021 (UTC)

 I strongly prefer a tool that will give me the depression score instead of a PDF where I have to do math to calculate the depression score.

I think a link to the Pfizer tool that provides people with multiple tools used for depression screening is likely the most appropriate. While I think it's admirable that you want people to have an &quot;easy&quot; tool, that's not a criteria for external links, and the Pfizer link is more beneficial overall as it gives people printable tools (they can use for people without internet access) as well as multiple tools itself. I understand and agree that depression is a &quot;raging disease&quot; - but Wikipedia isn't a tool for advocacy or public health, it's an encyclopedia. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez (ser:Berchanhimez|User/ser talk:Berchanhimez|say hi!) 02:02, 13 May 2021 (UTC)
 The external link policy of wikipedia states: Is the site content accessible to the reader? I think the link I am advocating meets this criteria much better then Pfizer. Pfizer tools requires math and then subsequently another PDF and a table lookup on the 2nd PDF to know the severity. I still have not been able to find the 2nd PDF on the Pfizer website. I think we can all agree that most of us cannot use the pfizer PDF specially since the 2nd PDF is not there. Also the link I am advocating can be printed using the browser print button. Hence pfizer tool advantage of paper distribution that you mentioned is nullified. Since Pfizer does not meet the content accessibility to the reader requirement, I think we finally can have an agreement that the link I am advocating is better then Pfizer for the EL section. If I do not hear back a counter argument for 3 days I will change the EL link from mdcalc to the link I am advocating ser:Knownnotknown|Knownnotknown (ser talk:Knownnotknown|talk) 20:59, 13 May 2021 (UTC)
|Knownnotknown, That's not what the accessibility requirement means. That's for sites that are geolocked or require an add-on program or something.

Accessible to the reader means that external links shouldn't be behind a paywall, or geographic restrictions. It doesn't mean &quot;ease of use&quot;. There is no requirement that &quot;math&quot; is prohibited. The second lookup was easily accessible to me. And no, the link you're advocating can't be easily printed - because it then requires someone to have a computer to get the results of it by plugging it back in. You've heard many counter arguments - if you continue to add your desired link I will request your account be blocked.

However, it is clear that there is upset on all sides, which tends to close minds, and for which a break is often a good solution.

@ser:Knownnotknown|Knownnotknown, if you want opinions from people who are familiar with the ikipedia:External links guideline, then ikipedia:External links/Noticeboard is the central place to ask.  However, you might be better off talking about this at the individual articles first. 
I think you have several questions here:
* Should [this article] (there are several possibilities, right?) have a link to any screening questionnaire at all?
* If so, then should [this article] have a link to the PHQ9 specifically (rather than other options)?
* If [this article] should have a link to the PHQ9, then which of the many webpages should be the one linked?  (That is, the one for that particular article; people could reasonably prefer different links for different articles.)
As an example, I have started one such discussion at alk:Major depressive disorder#External links, asking only whether, in principle, there should be any external links to any screening tools.  If people decide, e.g., that they just don't want any external links section at all in that article, then we have a useful answer for that page, and don't have to consider the relative merits/demerits of any particular link. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 02:03, 17 May 2021 (UTC)

 Concerns about sychedelic therapy 


Could someone please look at that article and determine if it's compliant with P:NPOV and P:MEDRS? Or is it promoting an unproven therapy in wikivoice?

I'm not at all an expert in this area. I was led to the Wikipedia article after reading a New York Times article titled &quot;The Psychedelic Revolution Is Coming&quot;
[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/09/health/psychedelics-mdma-psilocybin-molly-mental-health.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage]. I reacted skeptically to the article, which relies heavily on ick Doblin as a source. He's been a psychedelic advocate for 40 years, he has no actual medical training, and he was a student of the fringe personality tanislav Grof, who certified him in olotropic Breathwork. I then went to sychedelic therapy to see whether Wikipedia's coverage might be less promotional than that in the NY Times. It isn't.

I raised this issue at FTN, but that was probably a mistake, since it might not really be a fringe issue, and only one other editor has responded there. The two questions I raised about the studies that make claims for safety and effectiveness are (1) COI, and (2) unclarity about double-blinding. I also raised a social concern about psychedelic therapy spreading to millions of people who do not have PTSD or other severe mental conditions, similarly to what occurred with opioids.  

For example, the article [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00213-019-05249-5] on MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD gives a meta-analysis of what it describes as q|six randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials, and argues that the therapy is both safe and effective. But despite the use of the word &quot;double-blind&quot;, toward the end of the article the authors write: q|However, participants and therapists often, but not always, accurately guessed dose assignment (Mithoefer et al. 2011, 2018; Oehen et al. 2013; Ot'alora et al. 2018)--a recognized limitation in clinical trials of all drugs with perceivable effects and in all psychotherapy studies where there is no possibility of effective blinding. I read that as saying that the studies were not double-blind: the researchers were blinded but not either the patients or therapists. In addition to the placebo effect when patients know which group they're in, therapists might consciously or subconsciously handle therapy differently, especially if they're believers. The misleading use of the term &quot;double-blind&quot; might call into question the objectivity of the researchers.

Another question about the studies is whether they lasted long enough to detect long-term effects. Isn't it true that therapies and psychotropics typically don't &quot;cure&quot; patients once and for all, but rather often have to be repeated for years or even decades? And that they can be psychologically addictive even if not physically addictive? Do researchers have any idea what the long-term effects will be if psychedelic usage increases dramatically for reasons other than severe mental conditions? 

From an outsider's perspective this seems to me to be a topic that needs some balance. Thanks. ser:NightHeron|NightHeron (ser talk:NightHeron|talk) 21:09, 14 May 2021 (UTC)
Blinding is not removed by simply someone accurately guessing. There's many people that guessed, based on side effects, that they got the Pfizer shot in the double blind trials of that. The fact that people can correctly guess isn't necessarily an issue in studies. The use of psychotropic substances, including psychedelics such as LSD, MDMA, and others, in therapy has long been a mainstream view of science. The only reason it isn't used daily and hasn't had large-scale trials yet is because of the onerous restrictions governments around the world have placed on the substances. Most of your questions on long term affects and addiction simply haven't been studied well enough for us to make claims like that. It's certainly nowhere near a fringe theory - and while I appreciate your concerns about the issue, I can't identify glaringly obvious MEDRS violations in the article you link. It's possible that the material could be pared back, but to my quick reading of the text and sources, it doesn't appear to me that anything is being misrepresented, and the text based on individual studies is clearly labelled as such. The quotes could likely be pared back or removed completely, and it's possible that some sections contain just an P:INDISCRIMINATE list of studies and their results, but the topic is well known, it's a mainstream view that it works, and I don't see that article as promotional as you try and say it is. You brought up a &quot;social concern&quot; that I agree is potentially an issue - but the bigger social concern is unfortunately the fact that these studies, which for decades have shown since the drugs' discovery that they have medical use, have been buried by people who are &quot;anti-drug&quot; just because some people use them illegally and have side effects or die because of that. I'll note that you may be unaware, but esketamine, an enantiomer of ketamine, has already been approved by the FDA for use in psychedelic therapy sessions - someone goes into an office, is administered the drug, remains for 6 hours or so until their &quot;trip&quot; is over, and repeats that every so often. The tide is slowly turning that governments are realizing that classifying these compounds as &quot;no medical use&quot; is inappropriate - and studies will continue to show that they are immensely useful when used appropriately. Unfortunately, until the governments allow larger scale studies, we won't be able to answer the questions you pose in your second to last paragraph. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez (ser:Berchanhimez|User/ser talk:Berchanhimez|say hi!) 22:59, 14 May 2021 (UTC)

Thank you for your informative response to my questions. As I said, it was a mistake on my part to bring this to FTN, since it's not a fringe issue (although at first I had thought it might be because of the NY Times' heavy use of Rick Doblin as a source). I'm certainly not &quot;anti-drug&quot;. The question remains: Should the Wikipedia article cover sychedelic therapy as a standard treatment that's proven to be safe and effective, or as a promising treatment with many unanswered questions about matters that are crucial for public health, particularly in the U.S., where there are dangers of misuse and over-prescription? The double-blind question doesn't matter much for the Pfizer trials, since there are clinical tests for COVID. In the case of mental conditions, isn't the issue of placebo effects (from patients' knowledge that they're getting the drug and not the placebo) a serious one? Also, if the therapist is an advocate for the drug-assisted treatment, and also knows which patients are in which group, doesn't that have an effect on the nature of the therapy that's provided along with the drug or placebo? I've read some of what arcia Angell wrote that's sharply critical of the overuse of psychotropics on children, starting in the 1970s. In particular, she criticized the research that led to the approval of psychotropics for widespread use on children for COI and failure to consider long-term effects. In connection with psychedelic therapy, are there any MEDRS sources that should be in the article that call for caution and highlight the difficult issues that will take quite a while to resolve, such as evaluating long-term effects and determining precisely what patient conditions are favorable or unfavorable for safe and effective use? ser:NightHeron|NightHeron (ser talk:NightHeron|talk) 02:04, 15 May 2021 (UTC)
On your first question (Is it safe and effective, or promising and experimental?), I believe that the answer is a firm &quot;yes, both&quot;.
I'm not sure that the placebo effect is a problem here.  (Everyone who gets it in the future would know that they were getting it, right?  So if that knowledge causes efficacy [or side effects] in the trial, then that knowledge should cause efficacy [or side effects] in future treatments, too.)  If you are concerned about people saying that they feel better because they believe that they got the real treatment, then I think that could be addressed by measuring objective outcomes rather than self-reports.  The number of hospitalizations is just as objective as a COVID test. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 03:08, 15 May 2021 (UTC)
|NightHeron, unfortunately, the answer is &quot;both&quot; - we should cover it as a treatment that's been proven in many small scale trials over 4+ decades, but unfortunately due to government regulations there haven't been the large scale trials necessary for government approval. There are questions to be answered, yes, but unfortunately until the government loosens the regulations (ex: by classifying LSD and MDMA as Schedule 2 in the US instead of Schedule 1 with no accepted medical use), they can't be answered at all. And I disagree with the &quot;placebo effect&quot; being a big deal here. The whole point of a placebo is to see if the drug has an effect. If the participants and therapists are able to determine based on the effects that someone got the placebo vs. active drug, that's even more evidence that the drug works. Sure, there's COI/bias concerns - but that happens with all drug studies. I can see your concern about the fact the therapist may be able to glean which the patient was provided based on the actions, but I think that assuming that has an impact on the therapy provided is saying that they're unprofessional. Keep in mind that even though they're small scale, most studies have multiple if not many therapists involved in them - so you're saying that there's a mass problem with professionalism in the therapy industry if you claim that it would have such a big impact to tamper with the results. I think children is a different topic completely and conflating that with use of psychotherapy on adults is improper. I don't think many MEDRS call for caution - because the medical consensus is clearly that the therapies are useful and aren't being used more widely due to government regulations - it's clear from the studies that have been conducted that they're safe and useful when used appropriately. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez (ser:Berchanhimez|User/ser talk:Berchanhimez|say hi!) 04:22, 15 May 2021 (UTC)
I hope I don't regret posting because I am bringing my personal experience into the discussion rather than the extremely professional and competent feedback that I see here.  I am not a therapist but I have worked for some years in a mental health setting with patients and their therapists.  In all that time I never met a therapist that would not do their best to help their patients to the best of their ability in a study in which they would immediately know who had been given the drug that was being studied.  They would know and they all would know.  I can not speak so firmly about the patients, but I would guess that most of them knew as well, perhaps almost all of them.  But of course, many patients did benefit from therapy even without the medication--as one would expect.  Talk therapy works.  And one more thing, having worked in the field I know that some people do not know the agony and suffering that some people are going through.  For example, 20 vets a day, multiply that times 365 and you get over 7000 a year, are taking their own lives, many from depression and PTSD related to the time they served in combat.  We owe it to these suffering people to offer anything we've got, including drugs without endless testing, to help them live a life that is not so bad that they want to end it.  (Which bring untold grief to family's of the dead ones as well.)  I apologize if this post is not appropriate here but I am quite moved by both NightHeron's postings and the wisdom presented by those that have responded.  More evidence of the wisdom and caring that goes into making WP such a remarkable body of information.  ser:Gandydancer|Gandydancer (ser talk:Gandydancer|talk) 05:03, 15 May 2021 (UTC)

e|Colin (1) I have no medical expertise, and came to this issue as a layperson.

(3) At FTN and this page no other editor entered the discussion to share my skepticism, and 4 editors argued against skepticism.

And as it turned out, he didn't let me down here either when he proved that he came here for advise and not to prove that he was right.  And then, there is Waid...she may very well be one of the most, if not the most intelligent editors here that also is very emotionally intelligent as well.  When she speaks, I listen. I don't know the third editor but I felt he did a really exceptional job of covering the information.  I might add and really appreciated the fact that I felt safe enough to disclose personal information, not that it probably helped, &quot;tho it didn't hurt, right?&quot; (per my above link).

 I think the intersex article needs a review 

There is a certain sentence on the ntersex article that makes me suspect someone was doing original research.

The sentence that says. 
“ Research in the late 20th century led to a growing medical consensus that diverse intersex bodies are normal, but relatively rare, forms of human biology.[9][184][185][186]”

I looked at sources 185 and 186 and those two never once said there was a growing consensus. I can’t tell what sources 9 and 184 say because I don’t have access to them.

Also here’s another problem with saying intersex is normal. There is no agreement on what counts as intersex. (As a matter of fact it’s not a medical term anymore.) The article even mentions that statistics on what counts as intersex varies.

Like is the article on intersex saying urner syndrome is normal. Like if you scroll through the Turner syndrome you can tell why it’s clearly not normal. 

Since the article on ntersex is both a sociology and medical article I feel like I need some editors who know more about this topic to look through those sources and see if there any issues. ser:CycoMa|CycoMa (ser talk:CycoMa|talk) 03:20, 17 May 2021 (UTC)
It does indeed need a review, as I have stated extensively. It's a bizarre slapdash of the most radical advocacy sources one could find naming conditions that have absolutely never been conceptualized in the most expansive definition of &quot;intersex&quot; as such. It is unfortunately owned by people with absolutely no understanding of the things they claim expertise on, so it continues to be an embarrassment run by people who don't know what consensus is edit-warring for versions that fail P:BURDEN. ser:Vaticidalprophet|Vaticidalser talk:Vaticidalprophet|prophet 04:35, 17 May 2021 (UTC)

|Vaticidalprophet that’s another thing I have noticed too, a lot of the sources cited in intersex articles especially ntersex is that they use partisan sources. In earlier versions of that article I remember that article cited ntersex Society of North America on the definition of hermaphrodite, even tho that definition of hermaphrodite went against the definition biologists use to classify organisms as hermaphrodites.
Also there was literally a consensus back in 2006. Where they came to the agreement that intersex would no longer be a medical term. I mean I even checked the ICD on this.ser:CycoMa|CycoMa (ser talk:CycoMa|talk) 04:55, 17 May 2021 (UTC)
This is a difficult subject area to work on.  If some of you want to take it on, then I think it's useful to keep in mind that editors' identities and deep feelings are involved.  If you conceptualize yourself as ____, then you will really (even subconsciously) believe that the article about ____ should reflect your view as the reasonable/rational/best-informed position (because why would you personally hold any view that you think is less than best?).  I also think that it would be best to have two or three editors make a long-term commitment to the article.

This is a bit puzzling.

The journal was published from 1995 to 2010 by SUNY. Then it was transferred to a Brazilian publisher... and there's now an association with llied Academies of some sort...

There's some action going down on xcited delirium. This is a complicated topic that straddles sociology, race relations, current affairs and medicine. We have a couple of editors making editors that in my opinion are more from the current affairs (and maybe sociology) angle - which is good! Energetic editors make wikipedia, but I fear some P:NPOV might be slipping into the article and the medical and scientific perspective being lost a little. I wonder if any editors here could help ensure the medical perspective is represented, but at the same time not used to dismiss the possibility that the diagnosis is being misused should this exist in literature.

Some angles on this. This diagnosis seems to exist mostly in emergency medicine. It is recognised by the NHS though also under another name, acuate behavioural disturbance, [https://www.rcem.ac.uk/docs/College%20Guidelines/5p.%20RCEM%20guidelines%20for%20management%20of%20Acute%20Behavioural%20Disturbance%20(May%202016).pdf], it is used as a cause of death, but is also used to justify treatment. My personal opinion, with some review of the literature, but not complete in depth reading, is that it is more of a *symptom* that justifies hemical restraint.

 Is this PRIMARY, or a survey article? 

Is there some kind of attribute or characteristic on a published paper that can be used as a clear indicator that the article is a survey, versus an individual study that should be regarded as PRIMARY? Usually it's obvious to me, I look for words like &quot;survey of the literature&quot; and so on.  But [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27799078/ here's a paper] that I can't determine if it's one longitudinal study with activity in 1971, 1992, 1999, 2007, and 2015 so maybe in that case can be regarded as primary, or whether it's a survey of five individual studies. I don't see reference to other authors for each activity-year. (This ref came up due to some edit warring at efractory period (sex), which I read as a possible disagreement about whether this ref is primary or not. (pinging ing|Generalrelative|MordvinEvgen)) So, two questions, really:
# is [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27799078/ this Finland paper] a longitudinal study, and should it be regarded as one study, thus PRIMARY?
# in the general case, what's the best way to separate a survey or literature review (thus, SECONDARY) from a primary study, and where do longitudinal studies fit in this scheme?
Currently, MEDRS doesn't say anything about longitudinal studies, which I imagine have individual papers published over time.  Is the most recent paper of a longitudinal study, which refers to latest results and maybe compares them to previous results from years past PRIMARY or SECONDARY?  Or aren't such papers organized that way? me ser:Mathglot|Mathglot (ser talk:Mathglot|talk) 21:13, 18 May 2021 (UTC)
Responding to the ping. FYI I don't have an informed view on the matter. I restored the ref [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27799078] after seeing it removed in what appeared to me to be a campaign against MordvinEvgen by the IP pecial:Contributions/37.47.128.238|37.47.128.238. I didn't see anything superficially wrong with this source and in any case it was one of three refs used to support a single point. But I have no opinion on the larger question raised by Mathglot above. For context, see ser_talk:Generalrelative#Sex_differences_and_User:MordvinEvgen|this thread on my talk page. ser:Generalrelative|Generalrelative (ser talk:Generalrelative|talk) 21:38, 18 May 2021 (UTC)
No campaign. MordvinEvgen wants men and women to be the same. Finland study doesn't support what it's used for on the page. — Preceding ikipedia:Signatures|unsigned comment added by pecial:Contributions/31.61.162.219|31.61.162.219 (ser talk:31.61.162.219#top|talk) 05:39, 19 May 2021 (UTC)

The initial report of any set of findings from any study, including longitudinal studies, is a primary source.  It would not be surprising if this were cited in a review article or a book.
Also, that journal only published between 2011 and 2018.  It's not listed in Scopus or MEDLINE, and I don't recognize the publisher's name.  You might want to see if its reputation is acceptable (it doesn't have to be &quot;the best&quot;, but it should be &quot;not the worst&quot;). ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:20, 19 May 2021 (UTC)
I thought PubMed used to classify articles and you could discover this at the article page. I know there is some classification going on so that the search page can find reviews or clinical trials or meta-analysis or whatever. When I search for one of the authors, and try ticking any of those search filter boxes, it doesn't come up, suggesting this paper wasn't classified at all, or doesn't fit into one of those boxes. If I search more generally, and tick some of the boxes, sometimes the article result list has entries with &quot;clinical trial&quot; or &quot;review&quot; tagged along with the citation, but not always.  Anyway, I agree with WAID that novel findings are primary research. As MEDRS notes (and discussed on its talk page several times), the introduction section of that paper is a kind of poor man's review: not ideal but might be useful for non-controversial stuff where you can't get access to anything better. -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 07:49, 20 May 2021 (UTC)
Per Colin. The term ongitudinal study is commonly used as a synonym for ohort study (retrospective or prospective) - a type of study design that is namechecked a few times in the P:MEDASSESS section of MEDRS (though the term longitudinal isn't itself is now[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources_(medicine)&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1024297981] mentioned). These are *always* primary study designs (the Methods section in the paper you link to gives relatively few details of the design itself, other than its use of preexisting surveys). Worth noting perhaps that surveys of people, procedures, or whatever, are ross-sectional study|cross-sectional (primary) studies; whereas &quot;surveys&quot; of the scientific literature are normally referrred to  as eview articles, and as such are secondary sources (and, in the case of ystematic reviews, secondary studies). Hope this helps a bit (fwiw, personally, I feel the incomplete list/s of primary study designs in WP:MEDASSESS is already wordy enough, perhaps almost verging on OT[?]; but I can also see how such info can be explanatory). pecial:Contributions/86.174.206.60|86.174.206.60 (ser talk:86.174.206.60|talk) 16:46, 20 May 2021 (UTC)
Perhaps it's also worth mentioning here [re Colin's point, I think] that the &quot;review&quot; filter  used to retrieve review articles in PubMed is sensitive but not specific. In other words, it finds a lot of review articles of the type we're looking for, but it also picks up primary studies which happen to use the word &quot;review&quot; in the text (eg &quot;review of cases&quot; [in a hospital, etc]). So we editors always need to inspect the text carefully to see whether a listed source really does qualify as a secondary review article (or whether it's actually a primary study). (Additionally: searching/filtering by 'publication type' [pt], such as 'review' or 'systematic review', etc, may sometimes mean missing out on certain of the more recent articles that are listed in PubMed but haven't yet been indexed in MEDLINE [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/help/#filters-article-type]) pecial:Contributions/86.174.206.60|86.174.206.60 (ser talk:86.174.206.60|talk) 17:44, 20 May 2021 (UTC)

I'm not sure about that.

 Hepatic hydrothorax is a subset of pleural effusion. So, you could link it to the leural effusion page where it lists liver cirrhosis as one of the causes. Pleural effusion, when unspecified, is called hydrothorax. So, I doubt we need a separate article for hydrothorax. I agree with your point that the hepatic hydrothorax article could be spruced up with references.

@ser:Aeschylus|aeschylus I meant that 'hydrothorax' does not need an article because 'leural effusion' covers it already. 'Hepatic hydrothorax' is a type of pleural effusion, so you could have a page for 'hepatic hydrothorax' (provided it is well-sourced). You could add a link to hepatic hydrothorax as a related topic on the pleural effusion page, if you wanted to. However, you redirection from hydrothorax to hepatic hydrothorax does not make sense because they are not one and the same. ser:Iciplascarfern|Iciplascarfern (ser talk:Iciplascarfern|talk) 12:40, 25 May 2021 (UTC)
I'm by no means a clinician, I've not read the leural effusion article, and I've no alternative targets to suggest; but I just want to mention that ICD-10 and ICD-11 both classify hydrothorax (CD10|J94.8 and CD11|CB2Y) away from pleural effusion (CD10|J90 and CD11|CB27). ser:Little pob|Little pob (ser talk:Little pob|talk) 13:40, 25 May 2021 (UTC)

 Article request for criticism of psychiatry and psychology practices. 

nti-psychiatry is a movement rather than just criticism of  psychiatry which has a connotation that entire stream of psychiatry is bad. 
But there are various kinds of practices in psychiatry and psychology which are criticised, obsoleted and changes with time, just like any other branches of science. 
Sometimes there is a delay in this change or updatation though. 
I want to request an article on criticism of psychiatric and psychology practice, and how it changes with time.  

ontroversies about psychiatry article discusses the subject of psychiaty as a matter of controversy, it does not have a discussion on individual practices and methods and their criticism. 

Therefore I request an article on criticism of psychiatric and psychological &quot;practices&quot; rather than entire psychiatry and/or psychology.

My view is that ontroversies about psychiatry is sufficient, and open for expansion if more is needed on practices. However, my view is that criticism of such practices are already present in those articles, with a link to main articles (so, appropriately in P:SUMMARY format). For example, ontroversies about psychiatry#ADHD or ontroversies about psychiatry#Psychosurgery both discuss practices.

I would. I think article assessment is a vital part of the project, and the fact most people ignore it is a problem with them, not with assessment.

IMO it ought to be called a &quot;priority&quot; rating rather than an &quot;importance&quot; rating, but changing the template requires updating tens of thousands of pages, and it's never seemed worth it.  
The point of these ratings is to show the level for this group, not for the world in general.  We generally rate &quot;subtopics&quot; as low importance to this group.  That is, we think our time is better spent on IV/AIDS|HIV and ale circumcision as separate topics than on IV and circumcision as a combined topic.  We have accordingly rated in the category described as &quot;Article may only be included to cover a specific part of a more important article&quot; (i.e., Low).  That puts it in the same category as Nobel Prize winners, panish flu, uicide methods, sbestos, erd immunity, OVID-19 lockdowns, and every article about COVID in any country.

&quot;Importance&quot; ratings aren't useless, but they have very limited uses that are not apparent to most people.  These ratings were created by and exist primarily for the ikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team.  The idea is that if a subject interests Wikipedians enough to form and sustain ikipedia:WikiProject|a group of editors on wiki about it, then the articles that are most interesting to this group should be given extra &quot;points&quot; when articles are selected for offline releases.  Since the main criteria are popularity and quality, this additional criteria helps combat some types of bias by increasing the odds that the collections will include articles of importance to small groups of people (e.g., an article about a city that most English speakers have never heard of, but which is important to people from that country, or an article that is important to people of a small religion/ethnic group/sexual orientation/etc.).
Since we're tagging articles for this purpose anyway, some WPMED folks additionally use the ratings to focus their own editing or patrolling efforts.
