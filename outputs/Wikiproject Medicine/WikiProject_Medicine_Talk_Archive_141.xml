 Medical injections 

ser:Berchanhimez/injections|collapsed=yes
While I hate to add to the multitude of recent posts of &quot;this article/topic needs work on Wikipedia&quot;, I'd like to bring up the topic of injections. I found 17 articles related to purely medical injections (not including things like ypodermic needle that are more physical things) and only three of them are above start class. I think this is partially due to ratings not being updated (there's a few stub class that are longer than start class), but it's also because there's massive problems with many of the articles. As some examples, I [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intravitreal_administration&amp;curid=5416572&amp;diff=974807600&amp;oldid=974776642 removed a massive copyvio from one], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intramuscular_injection&amp;curid=334821&amp;diff=974774595&amp;oldid=974085396 removed just a long list of drugs with no sourcing whatsoever from another], and removed [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Injection_(medicine)&amp;curid=665909&amp;diff=974774065&amp;oldid=974195142 those lovely non-article content templates that SandyGeorgia loves so much from another]. These articles are going to take a lot of work, but I think they're probably quite important to work on. Ideally, I'd like to try and get all of these to good article (and the topic of medical injections to P:GT|good topic), but that's a dream for way in the future, so for now I'll just take any help I can get with P:TNTing bad content out of these articles. That's really the biggest thing - the TNT is probably something anyone can help with, and I'll be able to build them back up once all the fluff/useless things are taken out. Thanks in advance for all your help. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez (ser:Berchanhimez|User/ser talk:Berchanhimez|say hi!) 17:54, 25 August 2020 (UTC)
p.s., on a side note, my brain can't figure out for the life of me why the collapse parameter I added to the box isn't working here, so if anyone smarter wants to try and fix please help. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez (ser:Berchanhimez|User/ser talk:Berchanhimez|say hi!) 18:04, 25 August 2020 (UTC)
 Berchan I suggest adding pageviews to your chart, and using that to guide your work.  I like the idea of a stable number, like last year’s average  pageviews ... get the most important done first ... [https://pageviews.toolforge.org/?project=en.wikipedia.org&amp;platform=all-access&amp;agent=user&amp;redirects=0&amp;range=last-year&amp;pages=Intravenous_therapy sample] ... I will help TNT as I can. Best, ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  18:23, 25 August 2020 (UTC)
 I've fixed the template/table for you and made it sortable. HTH --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 18:31, 25 August 2020 (UTC)

As a start, I've been going through slowly and P:TNT|applying a liberal dose of high explosives as appropriate, as well as attempting to reorganize remaining sourced material to MEDMOS sections or at least sections that make more sense. I think I should be able to handle most of it, but I'll post below specific things I'd like assistance from more experienced editors on:
*pidural administration - honestly, I don't even know where to start with this one...
*ransdermal implant - worth starting an AFD on this or at least removing it from P:MED jurisdiction? Seems this can be covered in mplant (medicine) just fine.
I'll keep the list here updated with specific things I'd like more input on, but please feel free to work on any of these articles. These articles on medical injections total somewhere over 2 million views, and the only one above C-class is the one I recently created. Far from the only potential for improvement on Wikipedia, but one I think is likely more urgent than some others given the massive pageviews and the state of some of these pages.

 Filtering-facepiece mask ontology 

ile:Cone-88240 1920.jpg|thumb|A filtering-facepiece mask, not certified to any national standard
There is a discussion at alk:N95 mask#Page move, concerning the division into articles of the information summarized in echanical filter (respirator). 

Specifically, should there be an article called iltering facepiece respirator (or iltering-facepiece mask, if it includes lookalike ust mask|uncertified filtering-facepiece masks)? Should there be separate articles for filtering-facepiece masks that are certified to each of the national standards  (&quot;respirators&quot; in US terminology)? That is, separate articles for 95 mask (US) and FP mask (FFP1, FFP2 and FFP3, EU) etc.? One or the other? Both? Neither? Thanks! ser:HLHJ|HLHJ (ser talk:HLHJ|talk) 19:04, 20 August 2020 (UTC)

 US residency programs 

pecial:Contributions/208.185.20.14 edited mostly content on US residency programs, specifically around the market structure. Their edits seem to be unsourced and removed some sources. Needs expert to determine if it's update or slant. ser:HLHJ|HLHJ (ser talk:HLHJ|talk) 01:23, 29 August 2020 (UTC)

 The last edit I find from pecial:Contributions/208.185.20.14 is 16 June 2017 [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_Resident_Matching_Program&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=786011834 Diff]. Do you read the make-up of the Board of Directors as a market structure discussion? There was nothing remarkable on that edit; I would have to do research to see if it is accurate.

 Survey of external links bot 

Hi all, I've made a request for a bot to be created to run a survey of the external links in our article space (See Wikipedia:Bot_requests#Medical_external_links_survey). This is with a view to updating our set of external link templates (Category:Medicine external link templates) based on links we currently use. It would also be interesting to see the prevalance of links to sites that we wouldn't consider reliable, such as search results.

Regarding external link templates - having these templates is very useful. In the anatomy space, it's made bulk fixing of dead links much easier. As I've seen in my recent template survey, it's also been useful to help centralise discussion about links that are no longer seen as useful - they can be deleted in one fell swoop if the source destination changes, is no longer seen as reliable or, for example, becomes paywalled. Lastly, if we want to move some of these links to authority control or other templates, it will be a useful precursor. --ser:Tom (LT)|Tom (LT) (ser talk:Tom (LT)|talk) 07:26, 29 August 2020 (UTC)

If you want to add these articles to your P:WATCH|Watchlist, you can do so in a single operation, using a bulk edit. This is described at elp:Watchlist#Controlling which pages are watched, at #3. Edit entire watchlist. Or just go to pecial:Watchlist/raw and append the entire list below to the bottom of your watchlist. (Be careful; your watchlist is not versioned, afaik, so if you *replace* it instead of appending to it by mistake, I'm not sure how your could get it back again.  If this is your first time using the bulk edit/(&quot;raw&quot; edit) feature, I would recommend saving the current contents of your Watchlist somewhere offline, before you muck with it. That said, this is a very easy operation.) Note that the bulk edit feature removes duplicates, so if any of these are already on your Watchlist, it won't matter; dupes will be eliminated. (Ditto, if I've inadvertently left some dupes in the list itself.)

 Status 
hank you to everyone who has volunteered so far.  I love that people are volunteering to watch a few specific articles that interest them.  That helps spread the workload.  More than 40% of the articles for this class have already been picked up by experienced mentors.  According to the schedule, the class will end on Friday, 21 August, just about five weeks from now, so this is a short-term commitment.

I've just reorganized the list a bit to make it a bit easier to see what's left.  The biggest areas are pediatrics and women's health, but we also need editors who are interested in rare diseases, geriatrics, cardiology, immunology, and more.  If you look at ikipedia:Wiki Ed/UCSF/Foundations II (Summer 2020), you can see that each student has named several articles.  You can choose articles based on the subject, or you can look at the list and pick a single student to mentor on multiple unclaimed articles.

If you're on the fence about signing up:  Please do!  Just move the article(s) you want to the Watched subsection, add your name to the list above.  It's okay to volunteer for just one article and to be realistic about your availability.  But I do encourage you to try it out.  These are all new editors, so they have a lot to learn, and we want them to make them successful in improving these articles.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:55, 16 July 2020 (UTC)

 Hi. The students are in groups of four people, and each group of four people was assigned to multiple articles and asked to pick two of them to edit. We assigned them to multiple articles in advance this year after a Wiki Ed Dashboard error last year when students attempted to select articles and despite only clicking once were assigned and unassigned to those articles by the Dashboard several hundred times per hour, which led to several people who were watching those articles have their inboxes explode with notifications. To ensure that would not happen again we assigned each of them to a longer list of articles in advance rather than having them self-select the final articles they will edit. ser:Health policy|Health policy (ser talk:Health policy|talk) 22:46, 28 July 2020 (UTC)

 Hypoestrogenism 

I originally approached Sandy (ser talk:SandyGeorgia#Monitoring students at Med articles|here) regarding pecial:Diff/884320399/971245306|90 student edits at ypoestrogenism, and even since I composed it, there are more, and I'm not sure I can keep up.

My other question was about &quot;Causes&quot; vs. &quot;Etiology&quot; as a section title, and if there's any guidance about that. Any advice about that topic, or any other, is much appreciated; either here, if more &quot;Med mentor-y&quot;, or at the article talk page, if more &quot;content-y&quot;.

Jen, I took a quick look, and I left some comments on the talk page.  Having first checked what used to be on the page (which was basically terrible), I'm really impressed with how much progress they made.  Someone who already knows basic-primary-care stuff about pregnant women should probably just read through it just to check for any obvious mistakes, but it's a really dramatic improvement.  They have more than tripled the number of sources, replaced most of the old ones with recent sources, and expanded the content significantly to make it much more comprehensive.  It's not going to pass FA, or even GA, today, but it is a substantial upgrade from what we had before.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 03:02, 14 August 2020 (UTC)

 I have found it to be no better, and no worse than the typical student editing experience, with one of everything of the usual sorts of things that have to be dealt with; poor quality sources, copyvio (both text and images), failure to engage on talk, text that belongs in other articles, high-school level writing, misrepresenting sources, text in the wrong place, text that is plain wrong, text that lacks context, gobs of MOS-y cleanup-- in other words, the usual, that makes me appreciate the cleanup that Wiki Ed did (and I wish could still be doing if WMF had not cut staff-- this was a huge task to take on). I love mentoring new editors, but since students rarely stick around or return, the mentoring feels futile.  The end result is that we have three as-of-now poor articles that are much better than they would be if not for our intervention and cleanup after the students, but the reason we have this extra marginal content is because established Wikipedians had to babysit to make it happen.  In my case, that meant putting off FAC reviews, peer reviews, and writing articles that interested me so that I could clean up three articles that don't interest me. But whatyagonnado.b Now for the GOOD NEWS!  I hope everyone will please welcome again and thank |Memdmarti, who is a topic expert who can clean up the remaining problems at alse pregnancy, ertility medication and ypoestrogenism.

So, we win by engaging a new-ish editor, willing to do the clean up, and I believe/hope he will also take on the other two ob/gyn articles. I don't see much point in trying to get students to engage further-- they never do, but ... Thanks, Memdmarti!!

* I was very pleasantly surprised with the good work &quot;my&quot; students did.  Over the years I have been extremely critical of students, and for good reason.  However, I am even more critical of the student's instructors -- and the whole set-up as far as that goes.  I can only guess that instructors do not have a clue as to how difficult it is to edit medical articles.  I believe that it's often easier to write an entirely new article than to attempt to improve an existing one, even for an experienced editor.  Add to that, a student most likely does not yet recognize whether the article they're supposed to improve is actually already quite good or pretty bad.  I wish they'd change the program and instead, as a class, perhaps just look at a few articles and judge how good or bad they are.  I think that the instructors need to be more involved.  Some of our best editors, Sandy for example, might be willing to advise the instructor.  Anyway, I pinged and praised my students but not surprisingly heard nothing back from them.  So in the end, as comparatively they were pretty good, I can't see where they actually learned much of anything when no critical feedback was given.  ser:Gandydancer|Gandydancer (ser talk:Gandydancer|talk) 12:55, 20 August 2020 (UTC)
* Curious that you mention advising the instructors, as I in fact recently undertook a large mentorship venture to help a busy instructor better learn the ropes.  I came up with a missing article-- one I have often needed but is now a redlink-- and started walking Eyoungstrom through how to develop a stub step-by-step.  I do agree that training the instructors is likely to be more productive than spending a lot of time with students who almost never stick around so that articles can benefit from what we have taught them.  Eyoungstrom and I seem to be stalled, but it's summer and I suppose he has gotten busy-- at any rate, it has been good learning for both of us, as it gave me the chance to understand how they were working, what tools they were using, what things they were completely unaware of, etc.  I hope we'll resume the lesson plan soon, as it is giving Eyoungstrom a roadmap.b Some history for everyone on the Education Program might be helpful.  Many Many Moons Ago, I was party to the birth of this program, when ser:Jbmurray brought multiple Spanish-language literature articles from his classes through P:FAC, producing quite a few Featured articles, and many more Good articles.  I was doubly involved, as FAC delegate, and because I speak Spanish.  Jb was not only an instructor: he was a very involved editor (in fact, I ikipedia:Requests for adminship/Jbmurray|co-nommed him RFA).  Jon knows how to edit, and was actively engaged.  Nonetheless, I was quite frustrated at the time (YEARS ago) at seeing how much of FAC's resources were drained to produce just one FA, where those same resources could have produced in the same time ten non-student FAs, as the students required so much handholding.  EVEN with FAs produced, to my knowledge, none of those students stuck around.  And publicity around Jbmurray's course launched the Wiki Ed program, even though we have never had another instructor who was hands on as Jb was.  It was a program that took hold around the efforts of one very knowledgeable professor, who was very engaged with Wikipedia, but that nonetheless tapped a lot of resources.  So, I do think that training the instructors is more useful than hoping the students will ever respond to talk pages, but at the same time, I hold out little hope that the program will ever be more than a drain on regular editor time, where like at FAC, we could do ten in the time it takes to mentor one.  And I seriously think the WMF goofed in letting go of staff, leaving us with the work for a program they were happy to see promoted in the media a decade ago.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  17:15, 20 August 2020 (UTC)

*:::Ha, thanks for remembering me. Former FA writer, I gave up on FAs a few years ago after coming to the conclusion that nitpicking on prose makes it impossible to get stuff featured (an article of mine got copyedited by three copyeditors, each of whom objected to one another's copyedits at the FA process... or something else crazy like that). Still, since the FA process still exists I guess maybe I just had a singularly bad experience at that time, but I remember it being so utterly frustrating I am stopping at GAs now.
*::: As for the entire Wiki Edu and friends (which I still overall support, it &quot;kinda&quot; works, like the rest of our project, lol)... it is the usual problem of not enough volunteers, here or there. (Well, WE technically gets paid for what they do, but I doubt they are making much). In the end, students=newbies, and even experienced Wikipedians like myself can do only so much, since even if we prepare a very good syllabus/tools and use the pretty decent tools WikiEdu and the community provides, newbies will be newbies, and students will be students, with all that this entails: a minority will be good, most will be so-so and the other end of the normal curve will cause trouble. All that is happening, in the end, is that we are forcing a few dozen people to edit Wikipedia, creating a few dozen new semi-active accounts that get assistance from one person (instructor), who most often then not is a newbie themselves. Since the ikipedia:Ambassador program was retired (I still don't understand why, exactly), only instructors in US-Canada can get some additional support (in the form of salaried Wiki Edu personnel), those of us in the rest of the world only get to use their dashboard tool (thanks), but we get zero personnel support. So on that note, if you are unhappy with the results you are getting from a Wiki Edu supported course... just be happy you don't have to deal with the rest of the world, where there is no infrastructure to support instructors outside self-help (i.e. &quot;hope you are lucky to find the tools we make public and learn how to use them&quot;). --ser:Piotrus|Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus|ser talk:Piotrus| reply here 03:52, 21 August 2020 (UTC)

I didn't have the pleasure of promoting any of your FAs, as you were generally well before my time, and the one promotion during my tenure was handled by Karanacs and Laser brain, but of course I was well aware of your body of work.  One thing you were facing is that very few editors in those early days of Wikipedia knew your content areas as you did, while in Medicine, we have the benefit of having many knowledgeable eyes on topics.  But I always recommend (for the reasons you raise) that FAC nominators have experienced FA people watching the nomination to revert and contest the unhelpful additions, changes or FAC commentary.  Anyone can comment at FAC, and not all commentary or edits are valid!b As an example of not being able to force students to care about Wikipedia, the Spanish literature FAs produced by students-- which consumed FAC resources for months at a time-- have now fallen into disrepair and are appearing at P:FAR.  Even with the best possible scenario and a very good Wikipedia experience, none of the students cared to stick around to maintain those articles, which are now full of Black WikiGoo Cruft.  b I do wish the WMF would send some money in the direction of having paid staff clean up the messes student editing leaves, or alternately, do everything they can to shut down student editing, as we reap little benefit. Articles end up improved because established editors engage.

It's still early days, but I think that the model of dedicated local support for individual institutions will eventually scale better than centralised models. My take on all this is that WPMED will get most long-term value from investing time in relationships whenever we come across a willing academic, such as the ones we've recently discovered. If we have to create out own unofficial &quot;MED ambassadors&quot; to supply the extra expertise, it will be worth it if we can engage the course leaders inside the institution. If we look for ways of supporting/educating those academics, instead of merely trying to clean up student errors, I believe we'll make our task far more manageable in the long run. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 21:53, 21 August 2020 (UTC)

 Post-mortem discussion at ENB 

We've had Ian's help and benevolent monitoring here, but he's just one person. There's a whole Wiki Ed team out there, that isn't necessarily watching here.  The feedback of the MED team is important for Wiki Ed to hear, in my opinion; likewise, we can probably learn some tips from their years of experience with student editors. We should chat directly together about our experiences.  Accordingly, I've opened this discussion at the Wiki Education Noticeboard:
 ikipedia:Education noticeboard/Archive 20#MED editing experience and post-mortem
The course is not quite over, but when you have a moment, please add your thoughts and feedback about your experience with the &quot;Foundations II&quot; course (or other Wiki Ed courses) at the listed discussion. It will help them help us. Thanks, ser:Mathglot|Mathglot (ser talk:Mathglot|talk) 01:19, 14 August 2020 (UTC)

 iolence article

rticle|Violence

This article could very much use eyes from this WikiProject and others, which I will also alert. Regarding P:TALKCENT, I'm not fully sure where the central discussion should take place. To me, it makes the most sense for it to be had here, but someone else might feel it's best had at P:Crime or P:Law. Still, not all violence falls under criminal/legal matters. I've started a section at alk:Violence#Defining violence in the lead sentence for central discussion.

As for the matter at hand? I've been to the Violence article before, but I followed [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/97.122.95.30 this] IP to the article minutes ago. And I see that it begins with a dictionary definition of violence and places the orld Health Organization (WHO) definition of violence in the context of &quot;less conventional definitions.&quot; There has been edit warring over this and over defining violence in other parts of the article. Considering that violence is a broad term (as is clear by the Wikipedia article), but it is especially relevant to the medical/health area, how to define the term in the lead sentence needs discussion.  

I have noted on the article's talk page that I alerted this WikiProject (and will alert other WikiProjects that the talk page is tagged with) to the definitional matter. ser:Flyer22 Frozen|Flyer22 Frozen (ser talk:Flyer22 Frozen|talk) 05:36, 26 August 2020 (UTC)  Tweaked post. ser:Flyer22 Frozen|Flyer22 Frozen (ser talk:Flyer22 Frozen|talk) 06:49, 26 August 2020 (UTC)

 Merging of commitment with involuntary commitment 
ile:Rod of asclepius.jpg|20px|right

nvoluntary commitment is the better and more comprehensive article. And &quot;Involuntary commitment&quot; is the P:Common name for that topic. Commitment (mental health) is mainly a history article. I can't even state &quot;half a history article and half a criticism article&quot; since even the criticism section focuses on history. In the article's edit history, ser:Fgnievinski|Fgnievinski mentions‎ splitting that content from nstitutionalisation. Also, I see ser:Sundayclose|Sundayclose in the Involuntary commitment article; so I just now pinged Sundayclose for their thoughts on this. ser:Flyer22 Frozen|Flyer22 Frozen (ser talk:Flyer22 Frozen|talk) 06:00, 5 September 2020 (UTC)

 I'd vote for merging both voluntary and involuntary variants into ommitment (mental health). ser:Fgnievinski|fgnievinski (ser talk:Fgnievinski|talk) 06:30, 5 September 2020 (UTC)
ser:Fgnievinski|Fgnievinski and others, it should be discussed on one of the article talk pages. And merge templates should be placed on the articles. If that happens, I will start an RfC on the merge and advertise it since articles are often stuck with merge tags for a long time.

 omplete blood count at FAC 

The FAC at ikipedia:Featured article candidates/Complete blood count/archive1 needs a source review. Watchers of this page may be the best to do this. --- ser talk:Coffeeandcrumbs|C&amp;pecial:Contributions/Coffeeandcrumbs|C (ser talk:Coffeeandcrumbs|Coffeeandcrumbs) 04:28, 3 September 2020 (UTC)
C&amp;C, the editors here who know what a source check involves for a first-time nomination are already involved in the FAC.  Perhaps you could spell out what is needed, else I will do it when I have time. ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  15:02, 3 September 2020 (UTC)
All right, guzzled coffee, hauled myself out of bed to a real computer to explain this. Here is some general info, that is not specific to medicine: ikipedia:Guidance on source reviewing at FAC.  There are three parts to a source check:
# Source checks for first-time nominators are supposed to be more strict than for others, as we need to make sure there is no close paraphrasing, plagiarism, or copyvio.  That part is accomplished by reviewing a random but representative check of several passages, and stating that no paraphrasing or copyvio problems were found.  Once the regulars at FAC get to know a nominator, and know they don't have problems paraphrasing, this part is relaxed.
# Top-quality reliable sources, in this case compliant with P:MEDRS are used.
# Citation formatting, must be consistent and correct.
The CBC FAC has cleared all hurdles except a source check; if anyone is able to do this, we/Spicy have a new and quite useful FA! Someone needs to indicate they have looked at formatting for correct/consistency, a random selection of sources that verify the text cited without paraphrasing or copyvio issues, and high-quality MEDRS-compliant sources are used. ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  15:43, 3 September 2020 (UTC)

 With a couple of exceptions, most of the cites are already formatted consistently.  I will take a closer look. One thing that I noticed is that the shortened footnotes are not linked to the full citations.  There is no requirement that they are linked, but it does make it easier for readers. ser:Boghog|Boghog (ser talk:Boghog|talk) 20:44, 5 September 2020 (UTC)

 Not required, and making it happen is a miserable experience for the editor! BTW, FAC is so backlogged that I fear this FAC could sit there for eons waiting for a source review, because other FAC reviewers are intimidated by medrs.

 Reminder: Harvnb citations are not required, and many editors hate them. P:CITEVAR. Perhaps I should have added, when explaining the basics of a source review, that the citations already had a consistent and acceptable format; what is needed now is a check that high-quality sources are used and a random selection of text is checked to be sure that it verifies the text without copyvio or close paraphrasing.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  05:49, 6 September 2020 (UTC)

The citations didn't have a consistent format, because some of them were unintentionally linking to archives and others were not. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:39, 6 September 2020 (UTC)

 What we're valuing actually is &quot;anyone can edit&quot;, because new editors have a much harder time with Harvrefs, and unless you have the script/gadget or whatever it is that I have installed (and I can't even remember which or where), many editors don't realize when they have introduced Harvref errors into articles.  There are fans and detractors for each citation system, but it's important to note that Harvnbs are not required to be used when short-form citations are used to provide page numbers of lengthy journal articles or book sources.  We need to get used to doing this since, for some odd reason, we medical editors have a (bad) custom of NOT providing page numbers as required for WP:V in citations for lengthy journal articles. Yet, that doesn't mean we have to move to difficult-to-use or difficult-to-see-when-they-have-errors Harvnbs for the short-form citation.  bThere is a consistent citation format at CBC; we still need a close paraphrasing and source-to-text integrity check of a random selection.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  06:31, 8 September 2020 (UTC)
If we medical editors have a bad custom of not providing page numbers for lengthy journal articles, then I think we could fairly charge non-scientific editors with having a bad custom of citing sources for isolated facts that can be found only in a single sentence, instead of citing sources for their main conclusions.  If you are citing something like https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32895355/, the correct approach is to cite all ten pages for the main conclusion, not one page for some isolated factoid. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 15:41, 8 September 2020 (UTC)
 That is also correct; both situations exist (specific page citations for some text, and entire journal articles for one overarching conclusion). The underlying principle is WP:V-- can the reader easily verify the cited text.   ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  16:12, 8 September 2020 (UTC)

xcited delirium

This article is written as promotional of a controversial term being used to describe something not listed in DSM-V. It is presumptious, using passive language to normalise a non-existant condition. It needs medically qualified oversight to render it objective/factual.

I have rewritten the intro to better describe the subject but the infobox and main body need a scalpel. ser:markdask|Markser talk:markdask|Dask 13:36, 1 September 2020 (UTC)

 Interesting. I like your intro, and think it's quite balanced.  I'm not sure something not being in the DSM-V is strong evidence that this doesn't exist, for example things like CPTSD, Moral Injury, and post traumatic embitterment disorder (which may all describe some similar underlying concepts) are not in the DSM but are recognised. But the fact that something is not in the DMS should certainly be noted, as you do here.
 I'm actually quite interested in this topic, though am by no means an expert. I might have a dip into the literature this weekend. Shooting from the hip for now. I suspect this is a complicated and controversial topic. I imagine those in the psychiatric community would be inclined to label this psychosis / schizophrenia, if you read some of the literature of drug induced psychosis, you'll often come across the word &quot;trigger&quot; (as opposed to cause) the assumption being that there is an underlying cause - this links into the &quot;chemical imbalance model of psychosis&quot;. If you dig into the literature you actually find that relapse rates following drug induced psychosis are far lower (assuming cessation of use) than psychosis without the presence of drugs, which adds some weight to the idea that there might be a diagnosis separate from psychosis/schizophrenia. Related to this is the concept of brief episodic psychosis (may have misremembered the name here).
 It might be interesting looking at some literature to see how people distinguish this from psychosis - which is an obvious question that isn't really covered by the article 
 Some conterversies that cut across this &quot;just happened once. I'm not taking your drugs&quot; / &quot;we are going to make you take drug&quot;; &quot;medical model&quot; / &quot;broken way of thinking from medicine&quot;, &quot;psychology / psychiatry&quot;; &quot;individual autonomy / public safety&quot;, &quot;safety of psychiatric drugs&quot;  --ser:Talpedia|Talpedia (ser talk:Talpedia|talk) 17:27, 2 September 2020 (UTC)

utdent|5I saw you've rolled back your initial, very extensive editing |Talpedia. Perhaps best keep in mind the nature of the encyclopedia, which is to provide facts. While it is a fact that there exist many essays on the subject, it is not necessarily useful to &quot;introduce content&quot; from any given essay, or review. Wikipedia aint a magazine.
I'd very much appreciate it if you could link me to the review you refer to above before you introduce any further content, and we could discuss it. You can also email me from my homepage. Thanks - ser:markdask|Markser talk:markdask|Dask 12:33, 6 September 2020 (UTC)
 &quot;very extensive editing&quot; - I'm not sure this was very extensive. I found some content about the validity of the diagnosis added it, then realized there was a little duplicated, tried to deduplicate, and then decided it was time to regroup, because I needed to get more of a context of the whole article before making further changes - to avoid this https://www.thevintagenews.com/2019/01/04/artworks-destroyed/
 &quot;Perhaps best keep in mind the nature of the encyclopedia, which is to provide facts.&quot; Hmm, might want to be careful with that language there :p. The source I was using was this https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acem.13330, a 2018 systematic review on excited delirium - which is closest we're going to get to facts on this topic (P:MEDRS). While &quot;introducing material&quot; might not improve an article, having it be consistent with the most recent, and highest quality sources on the topic will -  rather than older non-systematic reviews quoting consensus reports (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excited_delirium#cite_note-Vi2012-1), educational material (tertiary https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK546674/)  or UD implications about not being in diagnostic guidelines that can risk bordering on weasel words (&quot;it isn't here, so it doesn't exist&quot;). *Anyway*, the the tl;dr of the review was &quot;exists, diagnosis vague and inconsistent, evidence sucks, probably distinct mechanism, more research necessary&quot;. But yeah, have a read and see what you think. I think the article should i) include that the fact that the review thinks EXD exists and &quot;probably&quot; is distinct a ii) the fact that the definitions used in the research are inconsistent i. I'd quite like to get a link to &quot;validity of psychiatric diagnoses&quot; in here as well, because this is part of the debate  - unfortunately there aren't really pages on wikipedia on the topic :/ ser:Talpedia|Talpedia (ser talk:Talpedia|talk) 13:21, 6 September 2020 (UTC)

 I first became aware of this term while working on the eath of Elijah McClain article.  This man, really hardly more than a boy, was killed by the Colorado police every bit as much as George Floyd was but like most pre-Floyd deaths it went largely unnoticed. I have worked on enough of these articles that I have learned to hear police set up their alibi while the arrest is going on.  If you read this article you can see how the police conversations set up a rationale to use both ketamine and a choke hold even though McClain was already cuffed.  See this article &quot;Medics in Colorado dosed 902 people with ketamine for “excited delirium” in 2.5 years, including Elijah McClain&quot; [https://coloradosun.com/2020/07/23/ketamine-use-paramedics-elijah-mclain/]  ser:Gandydancer|Gandydancer (ser talk:Gandydancer|talk) 16:38, 9 September 2020 (UTC)
 Hmm, I can see a little of the controversy there. Having one of the side effects of your syndrome being &quot;death&quot; is convenient if you kill someone. I would note that the use of hemical restraint is accepted for basically all forms of agitation that put people at risk, so the existence or non-existence of EXD is not necessarily relevant for the choice to administer drugs (medical advice also says that chemical restraint is to be preferred to physical restraint in the documents I have read). I seem to remember the NICE guidelines mentioned, but did not advise the use of, ketamine. I think ketamine is faster acting than benzodiazapines / antipsychotics - I can't remember why they didn't recommend it - perhaps it had risks associated with it (ketamine is used in anaesthesia). I was struck by how, in this review, they suggested standard &quot;chemical restraint&quot; procedures without mentioning chemical restraint itself or referrinng to the literature onnthe topic. The use of chemical restraint is only advised after verbal deescalation has been attempted.  ser:Talpedia|Talpedia (ser talk:Talpedia|talk) 17:35, 9 September 2020 (UTC)

 Translation task force forks 

We have more than a thousand articles associated with the translation task force (link here: Wikipedia:WikiProject_Medicine/Translation_task_force). Full list here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:PrefixIndex?prefix=Wikipedia%3AWikiProject_Medicine%2FTranslation_task_force%2FRTT%2F&amp;namespace=0]. These articles seem to be copied lead statements and most haven't been edited since creation eg Wikipedia:WikiProject Medicine/Translation task force/RTT/Simple Bacteriuria|here. This has come to my attention whilst doing my template survey (as many templates that have been discussed are used on those articles).

;I have a number of concerns about these pages:
* They are not maintained, meaning content can be inaccurate and out of date
* They appear to be part of our encyclopedia, when in fact they are unmaintained content forks
* They are indexed by search engines
* The forks are needless and redundant content forks (P:REDUNDANTFORK) that are not temporary
* They are all titled &quot;Simple&quot;, which is also a fork of the simple English Wikipedia
* They do not reflect our current consensus. For example Wikipedia:WikiProject Medicine/Translation task force/RTT/Simple Desmopressin and the recent drug pricing discussions.
* Content is copied and pasted without attribution to original authors
* Maintaining these wastes a lot of valuable editor time (particularly the gnoming editors updating templates, citation styles etc).
* They are out of date, often by some years, which poses a risk to the communities and readers of the non English wikipedias where they are translated into.

;With regard to Wiki med translation task force:
It's clearly a very worthy goal and a great effort has gone in. However, the translation task force really seems to relate to WP MED foundation which is a meta organisation and should more appropriately be based there, in my opinion. Additionally, the large amount of extra wiki collaboration which, whilst wonderful, means that is very difficult for our local English Wikipedia project per se to be that involved short of relying on the people who are making those collaborative efforts. To become involved at the leadership level will clearly require speaking with specific editors and forming off-wiki relationships with those organisations. This gated community / ownership model is, I do not think, compatible with a local language based WikiProject, which in my understanding are generally flat in organisation, composed of volunteers, and have work that goes on relating to their local language.

I have some questions for everyone:
* Are we as a local EN WP still maintaining this task force?
* Should this content be moved to WP Med foundation on meta?
* What should we do with these articles? (Should we deindex them from search engines, mark them as historical, or just delete them?)

I'd like to hear what other editors think about this. --ser:Tom (LT)|Tom (LT) (ser talk:Tom (LT)|talk) 04:46, 30 August 2020 (UTC)

He's also [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Doc_James been active on Commons] and [https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Doc_James Meta]. I'm sure he is aware of this post by ser:Tom (LT)|Tom (LT) and really should comment on it, since he created every single one of those 1200 pages and is still on the WMF board representing the English Wikipedia community.
As for &quot;[https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_Project_Med WP Med foundation on meta]&quot;, the pages there have been snipped out and redirect now to [http://mdwiki.org/wiki/WikiProjectMed:Wiki_Project_Med_Foundation Wiki Project Med Foundation on MD Wiki]. The [https://mdwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page MD Wiki] home page claims that wiki is &quot;home to Wiki Project Med Foundation&quot;. The Meta pages are now just a shell. It very much appears that &quot;Wiki Project Med Foundation&quot; have moved off of Wikipedia to their own Wiki, and that the &quot;[http://mdwiki.org/wiki/WikiProjectMed:WikiProject_Medicine/Translation_task_force Translation task force]&quot;, which is a sub-project of that group, has moved too. As Tom notes, these &quot;simple leads&quot; do not reflect current community consensus on issues such as drug pricing, and it appears that one of the purposes of MD Wiki is to deviate from the Wikipedia community on areas such as drug pricing, drug dosage information, restrictions against -ND and -NC Creative Commons licences for media, and being open for anyone to edit. The MD Wiki site has now &quot;limited visability of the article space&quot; due to copyright problems with attribution, but if these &quot;simple leads&quot; have not yet been copied over, I'm sure they soon can be.
There seems to be no point to keep the content on en:wp. As Tom says, none of them were ever maintained wrt medical content but waste the time of wiki gnomes who go about fixing things and don't spot that these aren't actually articles on Wiki namespace. Readers may accidentally find them on Google.

 Thanks for taking this on, Tom (LT).  Considering the response from James, would it not be more expedient just to go ahead and have your MFD list all of them? b More importantly, at some point, WP:MED might hold a conversation about examining and re-aligning our goals and priorities back towards a focus on content ON the English Wikipedia (it had become too focused on spreading content OFF the English Wikipedia, while content ON the English Wikipedia deteriorated).  This might entail some restructuring of the main page of the Project at WP:MED, and the ongoing new look at P:MEDMOS and P:MEDRS; all three became a bit out of whack as WPMED became more externally focused, and there is much work to be done towards regaining a focus on improving English Wikipedia content, and reaching out to new editors, making our Project pages more friendly.  Many of our FAs aren't, and I imagine most of our GAs aren't either, as too many topics went outdated as only leads were maintained for purposes of translation. I em encouraged by seeing good progress in all three of these directions.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  19:58, 3 September 2020 (UTC)
Thanks. I am in a bit of a cautious Wikipedia mood at the moment and my overall feeling is that instead of expending lots of effort making large sudden changes, I prefer to expend an appropriate amount of effort to test the waters first.
With regard to your comments about EN WP, I do agree. A lot of really great collaboration has gone on, but I think the boundaries between off-ENWP collaboration (which really relates to WP MEDF) and our local EN WP has become blurred. WPMEDF does great work, and I think that there is absolutely room for both, but that having some clearer boundaries will also refocus discussion and attention locally on article space rather than the broader WPMEDF work. 
Third comment regarding MEDRS and MEDMOS - as we've mentioned previously, I also think it would be worth making them leaner, and moving some content to explanatory supplements instead of the actual guideline text. Smaller guidelines are easier for editors to follow, and explanatory supplements are helpful to help newer editors understand the why and how a bit more. --ser:Tom (LT)|Tom (LT) (ser talk:Tom (LT)|talk) 00:01, 4 September 2020 (UTC)
When large numbers of pages are involved, then a smaller discussion at MFD is often helpful as a starting point.  It helps people get oriented to the subject without being overwhelmed by the number of links or worrying that they'll miss something.
I'm not sure what kind of goals this group might set.  It's possible that creating and maintaining FAs is not where the group's main interest lies this year, especially with this pandemic going on.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 00:07, 4 September 2020 (UTC)
 That's just the sort of thing we need to discuss :)  Long story short, should I just run all the out-of-compliance FAs through P:FAR and have them defeatured?  I think not-- I'd rather see us build up resources and save a few of them-- particularly the high pageview ones, like olio and utism. But much more urgent is to get the P:MED page to a point that it can actually be helpful to newbie editors.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  00:24, 4 September 2020 (UTC)
I recently read a book (Shockwave: Countdown to Hiroshima) which was good but didn't really say much about how the Bomb was designed. So I turned to the Wikipedia App on my mobile and spent a couple of hours reading articles on atomic bomb design. I learned about the two types that were developed and dropped on Japan, why one had plutonium and one had uranium, that a hydrogen bomb actually contains lithium and that most of the blast energy from it is from fission and not fusion, and so on. It was all fairly readable. Not perfect by a long way, and I don't think any were featured articles, though some may have been decades ago. 
Wikipedia serves all sorts of purpose, from just answering a &quot;What is X?&quot; question to explaining to a parent about a disease that is going to dominate their family's life from now on. My wife looked up ary Somerville after seeing her on a Scottish banknote, and ended up reading the whole article. I think we should aim to satisfy the reader's initial question that got them to English Wikipedia, and then to grab them and hold onto them to make them want to continue to read the article and related topics. I don't think our goal needs be more specific than that (e.g. 8 FAs per year). We can't force people to write about subjects they aren't passionate about, but we can create an environment where those that do are supported (e.g. peer review, copy editing, advice).
I don't think our aim should be to just continue dumping more low-quality factoids into articles just because we found a source that is free, online and contains 300 medical facts that we could add. That approach just leads to Wikipedia being a very low-quality resource for information, where people just read a few lines of the lead, or skim the article to try to find the information you were looking for among all the other random stuff, or read the other Google Search results that were written professionally. See roken windows theory: an article that is just a random collection of facts about a topic just encourages more accumulation of random stuff and discourages quality writing. Like the student work, which is of variable quality, but worst when the students are adding more facts to an article that has already have several years of students dumping facts into it. We saw above a discussion from someone adding facts to an article full of unsourced or badly sourced facts and wondering why their fact got reverted and all the others kept. And I think the project got way way too focused on ensuring every article fit some straightjacket MEDMOS structure that our readers could not care less about. -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 10:52, 4 September 2020 (UTC)
 Does anyone think we might prevail if we suggested to the Wiki Ed people that they might re-orient student editors towards working on articles and lists supplied by us? That would be so much more helpful than cleaning up after students who drop less than useful content into articles on obscure niche topics.  Imagine if we could ask a course to upgrade all the primary sources in article X to secondary, or write an epidemiology section for article Y, etc. ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  12:43, 4 September 2020 (UTC)
Well, it might be worth a try. Of the recent student edits I reviewed, nfant mortality is the one that has had six student classes in the last three years, and each class dump more into it. The coronavirus section is particularly desperate. That important subject needs the article quality improved and shortened. In contrast, the students took pignathus from [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Epignathus&amp;oldid=933311014 this stub] to [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Epignathus&amp;oldid=971510497 this modest article]. The result isn't going to pass any award but is a very good first attempt. And while the topic might be very rare, it is going to be really important to some unfortunate family.
I have mentioned before in an email to someone, my thoughts on the [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Photo_challenge Commons Photo Challenge]. Sometimes people request topics that they feel Commons lacks images or concern some issue of great importance to them. Other times the topic is wide open, merely suggesting &quot;rural decay&quot; or &quot;shadows&quot; for example. The ideas are [https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commons_talk:Photo_challenge/themes discussed and voted on] and the person running it picks some each month. This month's challenge shows the difference in approach with themes on &quot;Mobility aids for the handicapped&quot; and &quot;Nature's blues&quot; and you can probably guess which topic will get the most and best entries and that people will really enjoy reviewing and awarding points for. I'm not saying PC shouldn't have a &quot;mobility aids&quot; challenge, but if it was all that sort of &quot;worthy&quot; approach, then the challenge wouldn't have been popular for seven years and attract a lot of newbies to Commons. I wonder if &quot;infant mortality&quot; is falling into the &quot;worthy&quot; trap, with mediocre results, and &quot;Epignathus&quot; was more of a serendipitous find.
I think the students (and their teachers) do need directed better to what to pick but should we be the ones choosing or would it be better to provide some guide on &quot;How to pick an article subject for students&quot; with general advice? -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 16:06, 4 September 2020 (UTC)
 I think we have tried over and over and over to improve our guidance to students and profs, and neither seem to read it.  More is not better.  Time to try something new.b Back to the subject of why I keep harping on FAs, is the autism example.  Autism and Asperger syndrome are among our most highly viewed medical topics, and for over a decade after cleaning up a significant walled garden with Eubulides, we maintained the suite in good condition. Now the entire suite has fallen prey to advocacy editing again, and no one seems to care.  When we lose Featured articles, the entire suite goes to heck.  I don't keep bringing up FAs because they matter more than other content, but when the best quality and lead article at the utism suite goes, they all go.  The entire suite is going back to the advocacy walled garden it was before Eubulides brought them to top status.  WPMED has ignored the suite, and advocates are creating an UNDUE mess.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  16:13, 4 September 2020 (UTC)
If you care about page views, then we should be working on pandemic-related articles (and uicide methods).  utism is #105 on the list of ikipedia:WikiProject Medicine/Popular pages.

&quot;Highly viewed&quot; is only one aspect of an article that might guide someone to focusing their attention and care. The list is a little bizarre with tella Immanuel at #12 who only got an article on 29th July and notable for one weird event and will likely drop off the chart completely in September. Many of the top entries are more about people in the news or current affairs (coronavirus in the UK/US/India/etc) which is more politics than medicine. OVID-19 pandemic in the United States is really not imo a Wikimedicine article. All the sources are journalism. That article is more akin to 020 United States presidential election and 020 United States Postal Service crisis. sperger syndrome is pretty high up at #27 for a disease that doesn't officially exist any longer. ung cancer is at 994 yet is the biggest cancer killer in men and #2 in women. So, really, lots of these topics are &quot;highly viewed&quot;. Btw I followed the link to ser:West.andrew.g/Popular medical pages and this doesn't seem to be updated past Jan 2020. But the order of entries is very different, suggesting quite a &quot;hot topic&quot; effect on the list, which  isn't necessarily the way an encyclopaedia should focus its effort.   -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 17:29, 4 September 2020 (UTC)

ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing, wrt the science writing class, the OVID-19 pandemic in the United States is probably more of a social science topic or a politics topic with a medical flavour. It depends what the class is hoping to learn about. If they are hoping to write about something medicine or disease or biological science, using appropriate MEDRS or professional textbooks, then those are not the articles they want to touch. On the other hand, the top coronavirus medical articles (disease, virus, etc) can be a battleground that I wouldn't steer any newbie towards unless they want to have their Wikipedia experience abbreviated by a hot headed admin applying their idea of arbitration enforcement. I don't have a strong opinion about the coronavirus articles on Wikipedia. I think they need/attract the kind of editor with more time on their hands than I have. For what it is worth, I have never once felt the need to consult Wikipedia about anything coronavirus related. Like everyone else here, I have lived with it dominating our lives for nine months. I get reliable news (half an hour of BBC news at 10pm and subscription to The Guardian) which keeps me up-to-date with more than enough information. I have colleagues and friends to chat with about it and family members who are involved up to their eyeballs in a professional medical capacity. I suspect are probably kidding ourselves that those who get their news from Facebook and follow Trump on twitter are going to get properly educated about it on Wikipedia.

But learning to or assessing if a student can &quot;accurately and precisely explain the various statistics and epidemiological concepts&quot; doesn't require Wikipedia. At least with stroke and lung cancer, your incidence and mortality figures are likely to be accurate for longer than 24 hours.

 Do we actually know what the goals of any of the profs are when they choose medical topics ?  I wonder if Wiki Ed even does.  At times, it's a prof pushing a personal agenda.  At times, it's a prof using Wikipedians as TAs to teach students better writing skills.  At times, it's unclear.  Maybe we could get a better sense of how student medical editing could be less intrusive and more beneficial if Wiki Ed could give us some insight into the goals of the profs, other than getting a whole ton of free teacher assistants to do their correcting and instructing. It would be wonderful to see good student editing, and to see student editors stick around to learn from all the effort we have to put into correcting their articles. Keep your eyes on ikipedia:Wiki Ed/University of Minnesota/Geomorphology (Fall 2020) by |Awickert, who has three FAs and is an awesome Wikipedian.  He could give us some ideas, but he is not by any means a typical prof ... he will be one of two highly prepared and knowledgeable profs to take on student editing. ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  22:04, 5 September 2020 (UTC)

Hi |SandyGeorgia et al. Helaine spoke to the instructor about this when her students started assigning themselves obviously unsuitable articles, and they instructor said that they were doing this as part of their evaluation exercise. This is obviously not what the article assignment tool is for since (a) it makes it really difficult for me to catch the actual inappropriate assignments, and (b) since it tags pages, it's going to mislead people and waste volunteer resources. I should have posted here about the class (and I apologise for not thinking of that). I was off for a few days, and I'm playing catch-up.
It was already on my agenda to follow up with the instructor today or tomorrow. Thanks for the ping. ser:Ian (Wiki Ed)|Ian (Wiki Ed) (ser talk:Ian (Wiki Ed)|talk) 14:48, 14 September 2020 (UTC)

 Thanks, |Ian (Wiki Ed); please note that I have also fixed a typo in this section heading, in case you have referenced it anywhere.  I have reviewed some of this course's past work, and am concerned.  It involves, once again, a professor who has [https://xtools.wmflabs.org/ec/en.wikipedia.org/Asinger333#namespace-totals not once, ever, edited a Wikipedia article], teaching large numbers of students affecting large numbers of articles. There are now eight courses from this professor listed for Fall 2020 at ser:Asinger333; how many students overall will be involved, and once they get the article links corrected on their course pages, how many articles will there be?

e|SandyGeorgia Given our obvious limitations, we're supporting fewer classes, and asking quite a few instructors to have their students keep their work in their sandboxes, at least until it can be reviewed by me. Given the number of students in this class, and the fact that some of them were interested in working on medical topics, this is one of the classes we've asked to stay in sandboxes.

 Reproductive Medicine BSc Wikipedia assignment at University of Edinburgh 

Hi, the University of Edinburgh are to run a Wikipedia research session for Honours students on the Reproductive Medicine BSc course on the mornings of 23rd and 30th September 2020. The course leaders have identified the following reproductive medicine topics they would like the students to work in group to research and help improve/add to Wikipedia:
*orse ovary
*rtificial ovary
*estis organoid (although potentially there maybe currently too little secondary literature)
*uteolysis (in human, sheep and cow)
*isphenol S (page exists (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphenol_S) but could be expanded: comparison to BPA could be made more clearly and the extent of its role as an endocrine disruptor can be expanded, a quick search has brought up at least 6 review articles.
*ndogenous ovine jaagsiekte retrovirus (new page to link to aagsiekte retrovirus)
If anyone has time to comment on these selections just to review they would make sense or have suggestions about the approach we are taking and the best way of curating this content also then do let me know. Many thanks, ser:Stinglehammer|Stinglehammer (ser talk:Stinglehammer|talk) 10:17, 4 September 2020 (UTC)
Thanks for working to build new content. Some comments regarding the new page proposals; regarding:
*orse ovary, why not build a section in vary#Other animals then split if the page becomes unbalanced? 
*estis organoid, why not build a section in rganoid#Types, as is the case for Gut organoid and Lingual organoid
*ndogenous ovine jaagsiekte retrovirus, why not build on aagsiekte sheep retrovirus?

 yes, assuredly. In addition to above pages we also are looking at working on the following:
*ndothelin 2 - Currently very short page - to be expanded - secondary literature available.
*esticular Tissue Cryopreservation - suggest generating a new page for this, as has been done for &quot;oocyte cryopreservation&quot;, &quot;ovarian tissue cryopreservation, and &quot;embryo cryopreservation&quot;.
*anos Gene Family - Currently no page.
*eproductive toxicity – there is a wiki page but it could do with considerable updating/expanding.
*erm Cell Migration - there is some information on this under the ‘germ cell’ wiki page but there are a lot of citations missing and this could be expanded upon quite considerably, possibly in its own wiki page?  Any thoughts on these suggested pages to work on are very welcome. Thanks, ser:Stinglehammer|Stinglehammer (ser talk:Stinglehammer|talk) 14:46, 14 September 2020 (UTC)

 yperandrogenism 

Hyperandrogenism is a term medically applying to people with female gonads, not male ones.

However it seems the IOC/IAAF appropriated the term in order to hide the fact that they had athletes with male gonads &amp; DSDs competing in their sport:

https://www.tas-cas.org/fileadmin/user_upload/CAS_Award_-_redacted_-_Semenya_ASA_IAAF.pdf

* The DSD Regulations do not stigmatise athletes with DSD. The DSD Regulations stress the importance of strict confidentiality. These confidentiality provisions are effective. The IAAF dealt with ... cases under the Hyperandrogenism Regulations and at least ... further cases prior to that. The IAAF has never leaked any information about any of those cases; the identity of the athletes, their nationality and the number of cases all remain unknown outside the IAAF.
* The DSD Regulations expressly and emphatically stress that they do not connote any judgment or questioning of an individual’s sex or gender identity. They are also careful not to spell out that they apply only to 46 XY individuals with fully functioning testes.
* The DSD Regulations do not exclude affected individuals from competing in the female category.


This coinage was first used by the IOC/IAAF in 2011: [https://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-addresses-eligibility-of-female-athletes-with-hyperandrogenism] 

Since 2011 coverage of hyperandrogenism has overwhelmingly focused on XY individuals with testes in sport, i.e. 'political hyperandrogenism'. 

However the term does not seem to be in medical use, because there is nothing 'hyper' about individuals with testes having high testosterone levels, it's perfectly normal. I.e. the usage was to try to protect the secrecy of the fact that athletes were XY,SRY+ in women's sport.

Any comments on how to deal with this ?  ser:Sumbuddi|Sumbuddi (ser talk:Sumbuddi|talk) 13:31, 18 September 2020 (UTC)

Do you think that hyperandrogenism in sport is a separate subject? ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 15:44, 18 September 2020 (UTC)

They aren't really related. As noted 'Hyperandrogenism is a medical condition characterized by high levels of androgens in females. Symptoms may include acne, seborrhea (inflamed skin), hair loss on the scalp, increased body or facial hair, and infrequent or absent menstruation.'

OTOH, 'hyperandrogenism in sport' is merely a euphemism  for 46,XY DSD. The IAAF did originally include CAH 46,XX in its definition of 'hyperandrogenism' to try and obfuscate, but that was deleted in the final version, so there are no hyperandrogenic women (in the usual sense, e.g., PCOS or similar) included in the scope of this. 

 At any rate the article is confusing in that the article has been written to describe normal 46,XX biology, but then adds the euphemistic sense without explaining that hyperandrogenism may also refer to a 46,XY DSD, and this seems misleading. ser:Sumbuddi|Sumbuddi (ser talk:Sumbuddi|talk) 16:41, 18 September 2020 (UTC)

 First Aid 
ile:Rod of asclepius.jpg|20px|right
A long, long time ago, there was a WikiProject called P:WikiProject First aid. In 2008, this project became redundant and users were redirected to the most likely success, WikiProject Medicine. There are hundreds of First Aid related articles on Wikipedia, and most of them are simply categorised under the default category for WikiProject Medicine, and sometimes the EMS task force. I was wondering if anyone has ever considered creating a first aid task force?

 MEDMOS abuse 

It is with regret that MEDMOS is again being mis-cited as a rational to arbitrarily re-order sections in articles. MEDMOS states &quot;The following lists of suggested sections are intended to help structure a new article or when an existing article requires a substantial rewrite. Changing an established article simply to fit these guidelines might not be welcomed by other editors.&quot; Today the cosmetic/fashion article oisturizer [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Moisturizer&amp;diff=977873398&amp;oldid=977386176&amp;diffmode=source was re-ordered] with &quot;MEDMOS&quot; given as the edit summary. MEDMOS has always discouraged reordering article sections in existing articles. Further, the vast majority use of moisturiser is as an everyday skincare rather than medical treatment. The reorder didn't make any sense, with the article's present form since a rewrite in 2018 having a &quot;Description&quot; section up-front. The article isn't great, but it requires more effort to improve it than just reordering and renaming section headings. The MEDMOS sections are intended to guide (not require) authors when writing new material, and not to authorise editors to chuck the article content in a tumble-dryer and randomly reorder things. Please, lets not have any more of this disruptive and non-consensus approach to editing. Editors making major changes to articles, such as a reorder, should first seek consensus on the article talk page. -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 20:37, 12 September 2020 (UTC)

 Thank you, |Colin! Is the added section separation at [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Primary_ovarian_insufficiency&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=979331996&amp;oldid=979328710 Diff] OK? -- ser:Memdmarti|Memdmarti (ser talk:Memdmarti|talk) 16:46, 20 September 2020 (UTC)
The historical abuse of MEDMOS was and continues to involve one or two editors re-ordering sections in order to &quot;conform&quot; to MEDOS, when in fact MEDMOS says not to do that. If you think, while working on article content, that a new section is required or content could be split into two sections, that seems like normal healthy article development, and you are welcome to use the MEDMOS sections as &quot;suggestions&quot;.  Whether the content at rimary ovarian insufficiency that is was inside &quot;Causes&quot; is better inside &quot;Mechanism&quot; is a difficult question. It seems there is a bit of overlap and maybe it is not all &quot;mechanism&quot;. I don't know if someone has some example articles with Causes/Mechanism sections on similar kinds of disorders, that would guide you better on where to stick the content. -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 10:41, 21 September 2020 (UTC)

 Article alerts 

I thought I'd take a look at ikipedia:WikiProject Medicine/Article alerts.  The P:AFD section is usually just a bunch of P:BLPs.  However, today there's also enous needle dislodgement, which claims to be a dialysis problem, and multiple hospitals.  I've been surprised by the persistence of one editor in nominating hospitals for deletion; he doesn't seem to be able to find lengthy sources with a web search.  Last time, it was a thousand-bed teaching hospital in a non-English-speaking country.  This time, it's 425-bed evel 2 trauma center in Florida.  I'm sure that on occasion the hospital administration would prefer that nobody paid attention to them, but I've never yet seen a modern hospital, even a quite small hospital, that didn't meet the P:GNG if only one knows where to look (e.g., the local newspaper).

WP:MED/AA has a long list of MFD's in it at the moment, but if you scroll past that, you'll find a few things that may interest you, including alk:Coronavirus disease 2019#Requested move 16 September 2020 and alk:Mitigation of COVID-19#Merger discussion.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 03:20, 21 September 2020 (UTC)
Commented on the VND AFD since I had time to do a quick search. I don't feel comfortable taking part in hospital AFDs since honestly I see no reason personally for individual hospitals to have articles unless they're major (ex: Houston Methodist, Cedar Sinai NYC, St Jude, etc)... instead having articles on hospital organizations/regions... but I get that Wikipedia tries to include more than paper encyclopedias so I won't push my view on that. Regards, -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez (ser:Berchanhimez|User/ser talk:Berchanhimez|say hi!) 03:41, 21 September 2020 (UTC)
The better hospital articles tend to focus on institutional history, rather than services currently provided.  One that's up for deletion was founded in the 19th century because a pedestrian ended up with a broken leg after being run over by a horse-drawn wagon, and the leading citizens decided that they needed a local hospital.  Quite a few were started by religious organizations.  A few hundred hospitals' original locations are on the ational Register of Historic Places.  There's always the odd hospital associated with a criminal story.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 21:20, 22 September 2020 (UTC)

 Peanut allergy contradiction 

eanut allergy currently suggests in the eanut allergy#Timing of exposure section q|In infants with a family history of peanut allergy, consuming peanut proteins at 4 to 11 months old has been shown to reduce the risk of developing an allergic response by 11-25% but then in the very next section q|A 2010 systematic review of clinical research indicated that there is insufficient evidence for whether maternal peanut exposure, or early consumption of peanuts by children, affects sensitivity for peanut allergy. Technically infants aren't children under some definitions but I don't think this is what's being said. I imagine the 2016 consensus communication outweighs a 2010 systematic review so the children part should just be deleted, but I don't have enough experience with MEDRS to say for sure. BTW, how is stuff like amba (snack)#Peanut allergy normally handled? I guess it's less of an issue now with the 2016 consensus, but it seems to me like it could be a problem before that given that although it's only describing a single result (as it mentions), it could lead the the mistaken assumption that this single result was conclusive although the 2010 systematic review didn't find that. Even now, the ten fold difference which while to be fair could apply so some particular subgroup, is I assume poorly supported (since it's only this single study) given the consensus was only a 11-25% reduced risk. ser:Nil Einne|Nil Einne (ser talk:Nil Einne|talk) 22:52, 21 September 2020 (UTC)
Reading more carefully, the systematic review is said to be about sensitivity but the 2016 statement about risk so maybe these aren't so clearly contradictory although the abstract suggest to me we're probably misleading what the 2010 review found. Still even if we keep both in entirety, I think they probably need to be combined in a single section at least the sections renamed to make it clearer what the focus is. Likewise if they are contradictory but neither is strong enough to over-ride the other so we present them as differing views. ser:Nil Einne|Nil Einne (ser talk:Nil Einne|talk) 00:35, 22 September 2020 (UTC)
The 2016 statement is also about families with a history of peanut allergy, whereas the other claims to be about any family.  I'd generally recommend looking for a third &quot;tie-breaker&quot; source.  If there aren't any, then I'd prefer the more recent consensus statement instead of the decade-old systematic review, but I'd write the statements narrowly. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 21:39, 22 September 2020 (UTC)
