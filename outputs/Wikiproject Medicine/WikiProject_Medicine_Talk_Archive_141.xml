While I hate to add to the multitude of recent posts of &quot;this article/topic needs work on Wikipedia&quot;, I'd like to bring up the topic of injections. I found 17 articles related to purely medical injections (not including things like hypodermic needle that are more physical things) and only three of them are above start class. I think this is partially due to ratings not being updated (there's a few stub class that are longer than start class), but it's also because there's massive problems with many of the articles. As some examples, I [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intravitreal_administration&amp;curid=5416572&amp;diff=974807600&amp;oldid=974776642 removed a massive copyvio from one], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Intramuscular_injection&amp;curid=334821&amp;diff=974774595&amp;oldid=974085396 removed just a long list of drugs with no sourcing whatsoever from another], and removed [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Injection_(medicine)&amp;curid=665909&amp;diff=974774065&amp;oldid=974195142 those lovely non-article content templates that SandyGeorgia loves so much from another]. These articles are going to take a lot of work, but I think they're probably quite important to work on. Ideally, I'd like to try and get all of these to good article (and the topic of medical injections to ), but that's a dream for way in the future, so for now I'll just take any help I can get with ing bad content out of these articles. That's really the biggest thing - the TNT is probably something anyone can help with, and I'll be able to build them back up once all the fluff/useless things are taken out. Thanks in advance for all your help. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez (/) 17:54, 25 August 2020 (UTC)
p.s., on a side note, my brain can't figure out for the life of me why the collapse parameter I added to the box isn't working here, so if anyone smarter wants to try and fix please help. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez (/) 18:04, 25 August 2020 (UTC)
 Berchan I suggest adding pageviews to your chart, and using that to guide your work.  I like the idea of a stable number, like last year’s average  pageviews ... get the most important done first ... [https://pageviews.toolforge.org/?project=en.wikipedia.org&amp;platform=all-access&amp;agent=user&amp;redirects=0&amp;range=last-year&amp;pages=Intravenous_therapy sample] ... I will help TNT as I can. Best, [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] ()  18:23, 25 August 2020 (UTC)
 I've fixed the template/table for you and made it sortable. HTH -- () 18:31, 25 August 2020 (UTC)

As a start, I've been going through slowly and  as appropriate, as well as attempting to reorganize remaining sourced material to MEDMOS sections or at least sections that make more sense. I think I should be able to handle most of it, but I'll post below specific things I'd like assistance from more experienced editors on:
*Epidural administration - honestly, I don't even know where to start with this one...
*Transdermal implant - worth starting an AFD on this or at least removing it from  jurisdiction? Seems this can be covered in Implant (medicine) just fine.
I'll keep the list here updated with specific things I'd like more input on, but please feel free to work on any of these articles. These articles on medical injections total somewhere over 2 million views, and the only one above C-class is the one I recently created. Far from the only potential for improvement on Wikipedia, but one I think is likely more urgent than some others given the massive pageviews and the state of some of these pages. Thanks -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez (/) 07:25, 26 August 2020 (UTC)

Filtering-facepiece mask ontology


There is a discussion at , concerning the division into articles of the information summarized in Mechanical filter (respirator). 

Specifically, should there be an article called filtering facepiece respirator (or filtering-facepiece mask, if it includes lookalike uncertified filtering-facepiece masks)? Should there be separate articles for filtering-facepiece masks that are certified to each of the national standards  (&quot;respirators&quot; in US terminology)? That is, separate articles for N95 mask (US) and FFP mask (FFP1, FFP2 and FFP3, EU) etc.? One or the other? Both? Neither? Thanks!  () 19:04, 20 August 2020 (UTC)

US residency programs

 edited mostly content on US residency programs, specifically around the market structure. Their edits seem to be unsourced and removed some sources. Needs expert to determine if it's update or slant.  () 01:23, 29 August 2020 (UTC)

 The last edit I find from  is 16 June 2017 [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=National_Resident_Matching_Program&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=786011834 Diff]. Do you read the make-up of the Board of Directors as a market structure discussion? There was nothing remarkable on that edit; I would have to do research to see if it is accurate. I was on a residency selection committee for 10 years at UTHSC in Memphis and taught residents for 43+ years. () 01:57, 29 August 2020 (UTC)

Survey of external links bot

Hi all, I've made a request for a bot to be created to run a survey of the external links in our article space (See [[:Wikipedia:Bot_requests#Medical_external_links_survey]]). This is with a view to updating our set of external link templates ([[:Category:Medicine external link templates]]) based on links we currently use. It would also be interesting to see the prevalance of links to sites that we wouldn't consider reliable, such as search results.

Regarding external link templates - having these templates is very useful. In the anatomy space, it's made bulk fixing of dead links much easier. As I've seen in my recent template survey, it's also been useful to help centralise discussion about links that are no longer seen as useful - they can be deleted in one fell swoop if the source destination changes, is no longer seen as reliable or, for example, becomes paywalled. Lastly, if we want to move some of these links to authority control or other templates, it will be a useful precursor. -- () 07:26, 29 August 2020 (UTC)

If you want to add these articles to your , you can do so in a single operation, using a bulk edit. This is described at , at #3. Edit entire watchlist. Or just go to  and append the entire list below to the bottom of your watchlist. (Be careful; your watchlist is not versioned, afaik, so if you *replace* it instead of appending to it by mistake, I'm not sure how your could get it back again.  If this is your first time using the bulk edit/(&quot;raw&quot; edit) feature, I would recommend saving the current contents of your Watchlist somewhere offline, before you muck with it. That said, this is a very easy operation.) Note that the bulk edit feature removes duplicates, so if any of these are already on your Watchlist, it won't matter; dupes will be eliminated. (Ditto, if I've inadvertently left some dupes in the list itself.)

Yes, a number of articles under &quot;Append this list in raw edit mode to add them to your Watchlist&quot; are on my watchlist. Too many to go through at the moment and list. I think that pervasive developmental disorder used to be on my watchlist. For those aware of the areas I usually work in, sexology is obviously on my watchlist. Other examples: Tampon and Klismaphilia are my watchlist.  () 02:43, 29 July 2020 (UTC)

Status
 to everyone who has volunteered so far.  I love that people are volunteering to watch a few specific articles that interest them.  That helps spread the workload.  More than 40% of the articles for this class have already been picked up by experienced mentors.  According to the schedule, the class will end on Friday, 21 August, just about five weeks from now, so this is a short-term commitment.

I've just reorganized the list a bit to make it a bit easier to see what's left.  The biggest areas are pediatrics and women's health, but we also need editors who are interested in rare diseases, geriatrics, cardiology, immunology, and more.  If you look at , you can see that each student has named several articles.  You can choose articles based on the subject, or you can look at the list and pick a single student to mentor on multiple unclaimed articles.

If you're on the fence about signing up:  Please do!  Just move the article(s) you want to the
Watched
subsection, add your name to the list above.  It's okay to volunteer for just one article and to be realistic about your availability.  But I do encourage you to try it out.  These are all new editors, so they have a lot to learn, and we want them to make them successful in improving these articles.   () 16:55, 16 July 2020 (UTC)

 I've got a matching offer ('ya know, like in fundraising :)  I've got seven so far.  I'll add two more if five other editors take two more.  And I will EVEN make those two be feminine hygiene and tampon.  How's that for sacrificial duty?  [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] ()  16:32, 18 July 2020 (UTC)

Updated lists
, are you watching the Course page?  It's gotten a good bit longer.  Looking at only the most recent row all the way at the bottom, none of those four are in our list yet:  Senile osteoporosis, Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, Sperm bank, Spermatocele.  I didn't try to figure out exactly what's new, there, but if you find out when I first posted here, then go to the course page at that timestamp and diff it with current, that should be a good approximation. I don't have the bandwidth to do anything about this right now.  () 05:55, 27 July 2020 (UTC)
  here is the diff;[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AWiki_Ed%2FUCSF%2FFoundations_II_%28Summer_2020%29&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=970035685&amp;oldid=967564789] it is not very helpful since some of them were already on your list. And it is apparent that WPMED cannot keep up with this.   even with our best efforts, this is out of control and too much novice editing for all of us together to watch.  Why can  not restrict their students to one or two articles each? [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] ()  22:17, 28 July 2020 (UTC)
 Hi. The students are in groups of four people, and each group of four people was assigned to multiple articles and asked to pick two of them to edit. We assigned them to multiple articles in advance this year after a Wiki Ed Dashboard error last year when students attempted to select articles and despite only clicking once were assigned and unassigned to those articles by the Dashboard several hundred times per hour, which led to several people who were watching those articles have their inboxes explode with notifications. To ensure that would not happen again we assigned each of them to a longer list of articles in advance rather than having them self-select the final articles they will edit.  () 22:46, 28 July 2020 (UTC) 
 I am not sure how that response addresses the problem or query.  There are 123 students, and the dashboard does not say how many articles, but too many for us to monitor.  I have begun updating the list above. [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] ()  23:07, 28 July 2020 (UTC)
 I have updated the list above; there appear to be 123 students and 128 articles.  Too many articles for novice editors to be hitting all at once.  [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] ()  23:26, 28 July 2020 (UTC)

 Thanks for volunteering! The course list has changed considerably, and most of those we had watched are no longer being student edited, so we will need to re-assign.

 I'm confused about the differences between the &quot;reduced list&quot;, and the course page, which continues to grow. Where does the reduced list actually come from? When I look at the  now, it seems as long and wide as it was before, and has grown  in the last four days. The added courses highlighted in that Diff may be duplicates of others already on the list for some other student perhaps, but if each student is only working on one, why would they be adding articles to their own list which is already four articles long on the average? What does the course list on that page now represent, if the reduced list above is accurate?  Thanks,  () 00:51, 6 August 2020 (UTC)
 The list comes from a discussion with the instructor, who agreed that they would only work on one article per group, instead of the planned 4 per group. It looks like these changes are all articles on this list. The old assigned articles still need to be removed.  () 13:29, 6 August 2020 (UTC)
 will the instructor be reviewing all Wikipedia articles and the student improvements to ensure quality control? I am trying to help, but even with only a few articles on my watch list the volume of content is just too much to keep up with as a volunteer. () 14:31, 6 August 2020 (UTC)

I've added this subsection, in case editors want to discuss individual articles on the reduced list.

Hypoestrogenism

I originally approached Sandy () regarding  at Hypoestrogenism, and even since I composed it, there are more, and I'm not sure I can keep up. (I'm also probably the least experienced of all of you at Med articles, which is a factor.)  It's maybe more appropriate to raise this here, though, rather than her page. The main issue I raised, was the appropriateness of the #Hypogonadism subsection, or whether the whole thing should be reduced to a sentence with hyperlinks. My other question was about &quot;Causes&quot; vs. &quot;Etiology&quot; as a section title, and if there's any guidance about that. Any advice about that topic, or any other, is much appreciated; either here, if more &quot;Med mentor-y&quot;, or at the article talk page, if more &quot;content-y&quot;.  Thanks!

Thanks for touching base and for offering support. I reviewed my articles. I really could not keep up with the volume of edits. If someone has time Drugs in pregnancy could use a set of eyes. So many new medication categories were added that I did not review all the new content. I just did some work on the lead of this article that I would greatly appreciate another set of eyes on to get feedback on the changes I made. I think that the group did pretty well on Breast prosthesis, although this is not in my field/area of expertise. I mostly revised the formatting on this one. Thanks again for getting us organized to tackle this!  () 22:16, 13 August 2020 (UTC)
Jen, I took a quick look, and I left some comments on the talk page.  Having first checked what used to be on the page (which was basically terrible), I'm really impressed with how much progress they made.  Someone who already knows basic-primary-care stuff about pregnant women should probably just read through it just to check for any obvious mistakes, but it's a really dramatic improvement.  They have more than tripled the number of sources, replaced most of the old ones with recent sources, and expanded the content significantly to make it much more comprehensive.  It's not going to pass FA, or even GA, today, but it is a substantial upgrade from what we had before.   () 03:02, 14 August 2020 (UTC)
I put Kwashiorkor, Anti-ageing supplements and Biliblanket on my watch list. The first two had one and two edits, respectively, on 27 July. Biliblanket had lots of work, but nothing after 5 August, which was when I started watching it and left statements of work needed on the Talk page. None of the students contacted me even though I had pinged them. I am disappointed unless edits start appearing.  () 22:38, 13 August 2020 (UTC)
  Of those, only Biliblanket is on the #New, reduced list; Kwash and A-aging are not; that probably explains the reduced editing at those two.  () 03:09, 14 August 2020 (UTC)

 I have found it to be no better, and no worse than the typical student editing experience, with one of everything of the usual sorts of things that have to be dealt with; poor quality sources, copyvio (both text and images), failure to engage on talk, text that belongs in other articles, high-school level writing, misrepresenting sources, text in the wrong place, text that is plain wrong, text that lacks context, gobs of MOS-y cleanup-- in other words, the usual, that makes me appreciate the cleanup that Wiki Ed did (and I wish could still be doing if WMF had not cut staff-- this was a huge task to take on). I love mentoring new editors, but since students rarely stick around or return, the mentoring feels futile.  The end result is that we have three as-of-now poor articles that are much better than they would be if not for our intervention and cleanup after the students, but the reason we have this extra marginal content is because established Wikipedians had to babysit to make it happen.  In my case, that meant putting off FAC reviews, peer reviews, and writing articles that interested me so that I could clean up three articles that don't interest me. But whatyagonnado. Now for the GOOD NEWS!  I hope everyone will please welcome again and thank , who is a topic expert who can clean up the remaining problems at false pregnancy, fertility medication and hypoestrogenism.  Memdmarti has worked hard to digest Wikipedia policies and guidelines, making considerable notes on his talk page as he works through our weirdness, and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:False_pregnancy&amp;oldid=972790096#Proposed_Revisions LOOK at what he's done here in terms of fixing what is at false pregnancy.]  If the students don't deal with it (unlikely they will), Memdmarti has said he will get to it.  So, we win by engaging a new-ish editor, willing to do the clean up, and I believe/hope he will also take on the other two ob/gyn articles. I don't see much point in trying to get students to engage further-- they never do, but ... Thanks, Memdmarti!!

* I was very pleasantly surprised with the good work &quot;my&quot; students did.  Over the years I have been extremely critical of students, and for good reason.  However, I am even more critical of the student's instructors -- and the whole set-up as far as that goes.  I can only guess that instructors do not have a clue as to how difficult it is to edit medical articles.  I believe that it's often easier to write an entirely new article than to attempt to improve an existing one, even for an experienced editor.  Add to that, a student most likely does not yet recognize whether the article they're supposed to improve is actually already quite good or pretty bad.  I wish they'd change the program and instead, as a class, perhaps just look at a few articles and judge how good or bad they are.  I think that the instructors need to be more involved.  Some of our best editors, Sandy for example, might be willing to advise the instructor.  Anyway, I pinged and praised my students but not surprisingly heard nothing back from them.  So in the end, as comparatively they were pretty good, I can't see where they actually learned much of anything when no critical feedback was given.   () 12:55, 20 August 2020 (UTC)
* Curious that you mention advising the instructors, as I in fact recently undertook a large mentorship venture to help a busy instructor better learn the ropes.  I came up with a missing article-- one I have often needed but is now a redlink-- and started walking Eyoungstrom through how to develop a stub step-by-step.  I do agree that training the instructors is likely to be more productive than spending a lot of time with students who almost never stick around so that articles can benefit from what we have taught them.  Eyoungstrom and I seem to be stalled, but it's summer and I suppose he has gotten busy-- at any rate, it has been good learning for both of us, as it gave me the chance to understand how they were working, what tools they were using, what things they were completely unaware of, etc.  I hope we'll resume the lesson plan soon, as it is giving Eyoungstrom a roadmap. Some history for everyone on the Education Program might be helpful.  Many Many Moons Ago, I was party to the birth of this program, when  brought multiple Spanish-language literature articles from his classes through , producing quite a few Featured articles, and many more Good articles.  I was doubly involved, as FAC delegate, and because I speak Spanish.  Jb was not only an instructor: he was a very involved editor (in fact, I ).  Jon knows how to edit, and was actively engaged.  Nonetheless, I was quite frustrated at the time (YEARS ago) at seeing how much of FAC's resources were drained to produce just one FA, where those same resources could have produced in the same time ten non-student FAs, as the students required so much handholding.  EVEN with FAs produced, to my knowledge, none of those students stuck around.  And publicity around Jbmurray's course launched the Wiki Ed program, even though we have never had another instructor who was hands on as Jb was.  It was a program that took hold around the efforts of one very knowledgeable professor, who was very engaged with Wikipedia, but that nonetheless tapped a lot of resources.  So, I do think that training the instructors is more useful than hoping the students will ever respond to talk pages, but at the same time, I hold out little hope that the program will ever be more than a drain on regular editor time, where like at FAC, we could do ten in the time it takes to mentor one.  And I seriously think the WMF goofed in letting go of staff, leaving us with the work for a program they were happy to see promoted in the media a decade ago.

I expect that other countries will have similar arrangements. -- () 21:36, 20 August 2020 (UTC)
*:::Ha, thanks for remembering me. Former FA writer, I gave up on FAs a few years ago after coming to the conclusion that nitpicking on prose makes it impossible to get stuff featured (an article of mine got copyedited by three copyeditors, each of whom objected to one another's copyedits at the FA process... or something else crazy like that). Still, since the FA process still exists I guess maybe I just had a singularly bad experience at that time, but I remember it being so utterly frustrating I am stopping at GAs now.
*::: As for the entire Wiki Edu and friends (which I still overall support, it &quot;kinda&quot; works, like the rest of our project, lol)... it is the usual problem of not enough volunteers, here or there. (Well, WE technically gets paid for what they do, but I doubt they are making much). In the end, students=newbies, and even experienced Wikipedians like myself can do only so much, since even if we prepare a very good syllabus/tools and use the pretty decent tools WikiEdu and the community provides, newbies will be newbies, and students will be students, with all that this entails: a minority will be good, most will be so-so and the other end of the normal curve will cause trouble. All that is happening, in the end, is that we are forcing a few dozen people to edit Wikipedia, creating a few dozen new semi-active accounts that get assistance from one person (instructor), who most often then not is a newbie themselves. Since the  program was retired (I still don't understand why, exactly), only instructors in US-Canada can get some additional support (in the form of salaried Wiki Edu personnel), those of us in the rest of the world only get to use their dashboard tool (thanks), but we get zero personnel support. So on that note, if you are unhappy with the results you are getting from a Wiki Edu supported course... just be happy you don't have to deal with the rest of the world, where there is no infrastructure to support instructors outside self-help (i.e. &quot;hope you are lucky to find the tools we make public and learn how to use them&quot;). --|[[User talk:Piotrus| reply here]] 03:52, 21 August 2020 (UTC)
*:::: Of course I remember you, Piotr!  I didn't have the pleasure of promoting any of your FAs, as you were generally well before my time, and the one promotion during my tenure was handled by Karanacs and Laser brain, but of course I was well aware of your body of work.  One thing you were facing is that very few editors in those early days of Wikipedia knew your content areas as you did, while in Medicine, we have the benefit of having many knowledgeable eyes on topics.  But I always recommend (for the reasons you raise) that FAC nominators have experienced FA people watching the nomination to revert and contest the unhelpful additions, changes or FAC commentary.  Anyone can comment at FAC, and not all commentary or edits are valid! As an example of not being able to force students to care about Wikipedia, the Spanish literature FAs produced by students-- which consumed FAC resources for months at a time-- have now fallen into disrepair and are appearing at .  Even with the best possible scenario and a very good Wikipedia experience, none of the students cared to stick around to maintain those articles, which are now full of Black WikiGoo Cruft.   I do wish the WMF would send some money in the direction of having paid staff clean up the messes student editing leaves, or alternately, do everything they can to shut down student editing, as we reap little benefit. Articles end up improved because established editors engage. All the articles we would be writing correctly while we are mentoring students who never return ... interesting that our two Wikipedia-knowledgeable profs have come out more or less at the same place on this.

It's still early days, but I think that the model of dedicated local support for individual institutions will eventually scale better than centralised models. My take on all this is that WPMED will get most long-term value from investing time in relationships whenever we come across a willing academic, such as the ones we've recently discovered. If we have to create out own unofficial &quot;MED ambassadors&quot; to supply the extra expertise, it will be worth it if we can engage the course leaders inside the institution. If we look for ways of supporting/educating those academics, instead of merely trying to clean up student errors, I believe we'll make our task far more manageable in the long run. -- () 21:53, 21 August 2020 (UTC)

Involuntary commitment is the better and more comprehensive article. And &quot;Involuntary commitment&quot; is the  for that topic. Commitment (mental health) is mainly a history article. I can't even state &quot;half a history article and half a criticism article&quot; since even the criticism section focuses on history.

Also, I see  in the Involuntary commitment article; so I just now pinged Sundayclose for their thoughts on this.  () 06:00, 5 September 2020 (UTC)

The FAC at  needs a source review. Watchers of this page may be the best to do this. --- [[User talk:Coffeeandcrumbs|C]]&amp;[[Special:Contributions/Coffeeandcrumbs|C (]][[User talk:Coffeeandcrumbs|Coffeeandcrumbs]]) 04:28, 3 September 2020 (UTC)
C&amp;C, the editors here who know what a source check involves for a first-time nomination are already involved in the FAC.  Perhaps you could spell out what is needed, else I will do it when I have time. [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] ()  15:02, 3 September 2020 (UTC)
All right, guzzled coffee, hauled myself out of bed to a real computer to explain this. Here is some general info, that is not specific to medicine: .  There are three parts to a source check:
# Source checks for first-time nominators are supposed to be more strict than for others, as we need to make sure there is no close paraphrasing, plagiarism, or copyvio.  That part is accomplished by reviewing a random but representative check of several passages, and stating that no paraphrasing or copyvio problems were found.  Once the regulars at FAC get to know a nominator, and know they don't have problems paraphrasing, this part is relaxed.
# Top-quality reliable sources, in this case compliant with  are used.
# Citation formatting, must be consistent and correct.
The CBC FAC has cleared all hurdles except a source check; if anyone is able to do this, we/Spicy have a new and quite useful FA! Someone needs to indicate they have looked at formatting for correct/consistency, a random selection of sources that verify the text cited without paraphrasing or copyvio issues, and high-quality MEDRS-compliant sources are used. [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] ()  15:43, 3 September 2020 (UTC)

, I know you've done some work with making citation formatting be consistent throughout an article.  Would you like to look over this article?  () 18:33, 5 September 2020 (UTC)

 With a couple of exceptions, most of the cites are already formatted consistently.  I will take a closer look. One thing that I noticed is that the shortened footnotes are not linked to the full citations.  There is no requirement that they are linked, but it does make it easier for readers.  () 20:44, 5 September 2020 (UTC)

 Not required, and making it happen is a miserable experience for the editor! BTW, FAC is so backlogged that I fear this FAC could sit there for eons waiting for a source review, because other FAC reviewers are intimidated by medrs.  Wish someone would do this, but I am already “too involved”. [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] ()  20:59, 5 September 2020 (UTC)

 Reminder: Harvnb citations are not required, and many editors hate them. . Perhaps I should have added, when explaining the basics of a source review, that the citations already had a consistent and acceptable format; what is needed now is a check that high-quality sources are used and a random selection of text is checked to be sure that it verifies the text without copyvio or close paraphrasing.  [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] ()  05:49, 6 September 2020 (UTC)

 Since we are prioritizing editors over readers, I will not participate further.  () 08:58, 6 September 2020 (UTC)
The citations didn't have a consistent format, because some of them were unintentionally linking to archives and others were not.  () 17:39, 6 September 2020 (UTC)

 What we're valuing actually is &quot;anyone can edit&quot;, because new editors have a much harder time with Harvrefs, and unless you have the script/gadget or whatever it is that I have installed (and I can't even remember which or where), many editors don't realize when they have introduced Harvref errors into articles.  There are fans and detractors for each citation system, but it's important to note that Harvnbs are not required to be used when short-form citations are used to provide page numbers of lengthy journal articles or book sources.  We need to get used to doing this since, for some odd reason, we medical editors have a (bad) custom of NOT providing page numbers as required for WP:V in citations for lengthy journal articles. Yet, that doesn't mean we have to move to difficult-to-use or difficult-to-see-when-they-have-errors Harvnbs for the short-form citation.  There is a consistent citation format at CBC; we still need a close paraphrasing and source-to-text integrity check of a random selection.  [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] ()  06:31, 8 September 2020 (UTC)
If we medical editors have a bad custom of not providing page numbers for lengthy journal articles, then I think we could fairly charge non-scientific editors with having a bad custom of citing sources for isolated facts that can be found only in a single sentence, instead of citing sources for their main conclusions.  If you are citing something like https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32895355/, the correct approach is to cite all ten pages for the main conclusion, not one page for some isolated factoid.  () 15:41, 8 September 2020 (UTC)
 That is also correct; both situations exist (specific page citations for some text, and entire journal articles for one overarching conclusion). The underlying principle is WP:V-- can the reader easily verify the cited text.   [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] ()  16:12, 8 September 2020 (UTC)

Excited delirium

This article is written as promotional of a controversial term being used to describe something not listed in DSM-V. It is presumptious, using passive language to normalise a non-existant condition. It needs medically qualified oversight to render it objective/factual.

I have rewritten the intro to better describe the subject but the infobox and main body need a scalpel. [[User:markdask|Mark]][[User talk:markdask|Dask]] 13:36, 1 September 2020 (UTC)

 Interesting. I like your intro, and think it's quite balanced.  I'm not sure something not being in the DSM-V is strong evidence that this doesn't exist, for example things like CPTSD, Moral Injury, and post traumatic embitterment disorder (which may all describe some similar underlying concepts) are not in the DSM but are recognised. But the fact that something is not in the DMS should certainly be noted, as you do here.
 I'm actually quite interested in this topic, though am by no means an expert. I might have a dip into the literature this weekend. Shooting from the hip for now. I suspect this is a complicated and controversial topic. I imagine those in the psychiatric community would be inclined to label this psychosis / schizophrenia, if you read some of the literature of drug induced psychosis, you'll often come across the word &quot;trigger&quot; (as opposed to cause) the assumption being that there is an underlying cause - this links into the &quot;chemical imbalance model of psychosis&quot;. If you dig into the literature you actually find that relapse rates following drug induced psychosis are far lower (assuming cessation of use) than psychosis without the presence of drugs, which adds some weight to the idea that there might be a diagnosis separate from psychosis/schizophrenia. Related to this is the concept of brief episodic psychosis (may have misremembered the name here).
 It might be interesting looking at some literature to see how people distinguish this from psychosis - which is an obvious question that isn't really covered by the article 
 Some conterversies that cut across this &quot;just happened once. I'm not taking your drugs&quot; / &quot;we are going to make you take drug&quot;; &quot;medical model&quot; / &quot;broken way of thinking from medicine&quot;, &quot;psychology / psychiatry&quot;; &quot;individual autonomy / public safety&quot;, &quot;safety of psychiatric drugs&quot;  -- () 17:27, 2 September 2020 (UTC)
Good luck.  I tried to track that article about a decade ago.  The struggle then was to avoid it turning into a laundry list of every person who died during a police encounter, with this subject mentioned in a newspaper article.  () 23:14, 2 September 2020 (UTC)

 Not sure I'm making it better! There was quite a nice systematic review in 2018 I'm trying to introduce some content from this into the article. -- () 18:33, 5 September 2020 (UTC)

I saw you've rolled back your initial, very extensive editing . Perhaps best keep in mind the nature of the encyclopedia, which is to provide facts. While it is a fact that there exist many essays on the subject, it is not necessarily useful to &quot;introduce content&quot; from any given essay, or review. Wikipedia aint a magazine.
I'd very much appreciate it if you could link me to the review you refer to above before you introduce any further content, and we could discuss it. You can also email me from my homepage. Thanks - [[User:markdask|Mark]][[User talk:markdask|Dask]] 12:33, 6 September 2020 (UTC)
 &quot;very extensive editing&quot; - I'm not sure this was very extensive. I found some content about the validity of the diagnosis added it, then realized there was a little duplicated, tried to deduplicate, and then decided it was time to regroup, because I needed to get more of a context of the whole article before making further changes - to avoid this https://www.thevintagenews.com/2019/01/04/artworks-destroyed/
 &quot;Perhaps best keep in mind the nature of the encyclopedia, which is to provide facts.&quot; Hmm, might want to be careful with that language there :p. The source I was using was this https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acem.13330, a 2018 systematic review on excited delirium - which is closest we're going to get to facts on this topic (). While &quot;introducing material&quot; might not improve an article, having it be consistent with the most recent, and highest quality sources on the topic will -  rather than older non-systematic reviews quoting consensus reports (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excited_delirium#cite_note-Vi2012-1), educational material (tertiary https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK546674/)  or FUD implications about not being in diagnostic guidelines that can risk bordering on weasel words (&quot;it isn't here, so it doesn't exist&quot;). *Anyway*, the the tl;dr of the review was &quot;exists, diagnosis vague and inconsistent, evidence sucks, probably distinct mechanism, more research necessary&quot;. But yeah, have a read and see what you think. I think the article should i) include that the fact that the review thinks EXD exists and &quot;probably&quot; is distinct a ii) the fact that the definitions used in the research are inconsistent i. I'd quite like to get a link to &quot;validity of psychiatric diagnoses&quot; in here as well, because this is part of the debate  - unfortunately there aren't really pages on wikipedia on the topic :/  () 13:21, 6 September 2020 (UTC)
 I am a little concerned that the source might be a little &quot;pro EXD&quot; though. I spent a while looking from critique of the diagnosis but couldn't really find one with a little searching.  () 13:28, 6 September 2020 (UTC)
 I first became aware of this term while working on the Death of Elijah McClain article.  This man, really hardly more than a boy, was killed by the Colorado police every bit as much as George Floyd was but like most pre-Floyd deaths it went largely unnoticed. I have worked on enough of these articles that I have learned to hear police set up their alibi while the arrest is going on.  If you read this article you can see how the police conversations set up a rationale to use both ketamine and a choke hold even though McClain was already cuffed.  See this article &quot;Medics in Colorado dosed 902 people with ketamine for “excited delirium” in 2.5 years, including Elijah McClain&quot; [https://coloradosun.com/2020/07/23/ketamine-use-paramedics-elijah-mclain/]   () 16:38, 9 September 2020 (UTC)
 Hmm, I can see a little of the controversy there. Having one of the side effects of your syndrome being &quot;death&quot; is convenient if you kill someone. I would note that the use of Chemical restraint is accepted for basically all forms of agitation that put people at risk, so the existence or non-existence of EXD is not necessarily relevant for the choice to administer drugs (medical advice also says that chemical restraint is to be preferred to physical restraint in the documents I have read). I seem to remember the NICE guidelines mentioned, but did not advise the use of, ketamine. I think ketamine is faster acting than benzodiazapines / antipsychotics - I can't remember why they didn't recommend it - perhaps it had risks associated with it (ketamine is used in anaesthesia). I was struck by how, in this review, they suggested standard &quot;chemical restraint&quot; procedures without mentioning chemical restraint itself or referrinng to the literature onnthe topic. The use of chemical restraint is only advised after verbal deescalation has been attempted.   () 17:35, 9 September 2020 (UTC)

Translation task force forks

We have more than a thousand articles associated with the translation task force (link here: [[:Wikipedia:WikiProject_Medicine/Translation_task_force]]). Full list here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:PrefixIndex?prefix=Wikipedia%3AWikiProject_Medicine%2FTranslation_task_force%2FRTT%2F&amp;namespace=0]. These articles seem to be copied lead statements and most haven't been edited since creation eg [[:Wikipedia:WikiProject Medicine/Translation task force/RTT/Simple Bacteriuria|here]]. This has come to my attention whilst doing my template survey (as many templates that have been discussed are used on those articles).

;I have a number of concerns about these pages:
* They are not maintained, meaning content can be inaccurate and out of date
* They appear to be part of our encyclopedia, when in fact they are unmaintained content forks
* They are indexed by search engines
* The forks are needless and redundant content forks () that are not temporary
* They are all titled &quot;Simple&quot;, which is also a fork of the simple English Wikipedia
* They do not reflect our current consensus. For example [[:Wikipedia:WikiProject Medicine/Translation task force/RTT/Simple Desmopressin]] and the recent drug pricing discussions.
* Content is copied and pasted without attribution to original authors
* Maintaining these wastes a lot of valuable editor time (particularly the gnoming editors updating templates, citation styles etc).
* They are out of date, often by some years, which poses a risk to the communities and readers of the non English wikipedias where they are translated into.

;With regard to Wiki med translation task force:
It's clearly a very worthy goal and a great effort has gone in. However, the translation task force really seems to relate to WP MED foundation which is a meta organisation and should more appropriately be based there, in my opinion. Additionally, the large amount of extra wiki collaboration which, whilst wonderful, means that is very difficult for our local English Wikipedia project per se to be that involved short of relying on the people who are making those collaborative efforts. To become involved at the leadership level will clearly require speaking with specific editors and forming off-wiki relationships with those organisations. This gated community / ownership model is, I do not think, compatible with a local language based WikiProject, which in my understanding are generally flat in organisation, composed of volunteers, and have work that goes on relating to their local language.

I have some questions for everyone:
* Are we as a local EN WP still maintaining this task force?
* Should this content be moved to WP Med foundation on meta?
* What should we do with these articles? (Should we deindex them from search engines, mark them as historical, or just delete them?)

I'd like to hear what other editors think about this. -- () 04:46, 30 August 2020 (UTC)

, that isn't entirely true: James edited Ringer's lactate solution a week ago, and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Doc_James has made two dozen edits in August]. He's also [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Doc_James been active on Commons] and [https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Doc_James Meta]. I'm sure he is aware of this post by  and really should comment on it, since he created every single one of those 1200 pages and is still on the WMF board representing the English Wikipedia community.
As for &quot;[https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wiki_Project_Med WP Med foundation on meta]&quot;, the pages there have been snipped out and redirect now to [http://mdwiki.org/wiki/WikiProjectMed:Wiki_Project_Med_Foundation Wiki Project Med Foundation on MD Wiki]. The [https://mdwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page MD Wiki] home page claims that wiki is &quot;home to Wiki Project Med Foundation&quot;. The Meta pages are now just a shell. It very much appears that &quot;Wiki Project Med Foundation&quot; have moved off of Wikipedia to their own Wiki, and that the &quot;[http://mdwiki.org/wiki/WikiProjectMed:WikiProject_Medicine/Translation_task_force Translation task force]&quot;, which is a sub-project of that group, has moved too. As Tom notes, these &quot;simple leads&quot; do not reflect current community consensus on issues such as drug pricing, and it appears that one of the purposes of MD Wiki is to deviate from the Wikipedia community on areas such as drug pricing, drug dosage information, restrictions against -ND and -NC Creative Commons licences for media, and being open for anyone to edit. The MD Wiki site has now &quot;limited visability of the article space&quot; due to copyright problems with attribution, but if these &quot;simple leads&quot; have not yet been copied over, I'm sure they soon can be.
There seems to be no point to keep the content on en:wp. As Tom says, none of them were ever maintained wrt medical content but waste the time of wiki gnomes who go about fixing things and don't spot that these aren't actually articles on Wiki namespace. Readers may accidentally find them on Google. But most importantly, every single one of them is a copyright violation, including those [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:WikiProject_Medicine/Translation_task_force/RTT/Simple_Cannabinoid_hyperemesis_syndrome&amp;action=history created just last September].

 Thanks for taking this on, Tom (LT).  Considering the response from James, would it not be more expedient just to go ahead and have your MFD list all of them?  More importantly, at some point, WP:MED might hold a conversation about examining and re-aligning our goals and priorities back towards a focus on content ON the English Wikipedia (it had become too focused on spreading content OFF the English Wikipedia, while content ON the English Wikipedia deteriorated).  This might entail some restructuring of the main page of the Project at WP:MED, and the ongoing new look at  and ; all three became a bit out of whack as WPMED became more externally focused, and there is much work to be done towards regaining a focus on improving English Wikipedia content, and reaching out to new editors, making our Project pages more friendly.  Many of our FAs aren't, and I imagine most of our GAs aren't either, as too many topics went outdated as only leads were maintained for purposes of translation. I em encouraged by seeing good progress in all three of these directions.  [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] ()  19:58, 3 September 2020 (UTC)
Thanks. I am in a bit of a cautious Wikipedia mood at the moment and my overall feeling is that instead of expending lots of effort making large sudden changes, I prefer to expend an appropriate amount of effort to test the waters first.
With regard to your comments about EN WP, I do agree. A lot of really great collaboration has gone on, but I think the boundaries between off-ENWP collaboration (which really relates to WP MEDF) and our local EN WP has become blurred. WPMEDF does great work, and I think that there is absolutely room for both, but that having some clearer boundaries will also refocus discussion and attention locally on article space rather than the broader WPMEDF work. 
Third comment regarding MEDRS and MEDMOS - as we've mentioned previously, I also think it would be worth making them leaner, and moving some content to explanatory supplements instead of the actual guideline text. Smaller guidelines are easier for editors to follow, and explanatory supplements are helpful to help newer editors understand the why and how a bit more. -- () 00:01, 4 September 2020 (UTC)
When large numbers of pages are involved, then a smaller discussion at MFD is often helpful as a starting point.  It helps people get oriented to the subject without being overwhelmed by the number of links or worrying that they'll miss something.
I'm not sure what kind of goals this group might set.  It's possible that creating and maintaining FAs is not where the group's main interest lies this year, especially with this pandemic going on.   () 00:07, 4 September 2020 (UTC)
 That's just the sort of thing we need to discuss :)  Long story short, should I just run all the out-of-compliance FAs through  and have them defeatured?  I think not-- I'd rather see us build up resources and save a few of them-- particularly the high pageview ones, like polio and autism. But much more urgent is to get the  page to a point that it can actually be helpful to newbie editors.  [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] ()  00:24, 4 September 2020 (UTC)
I recently read a book (Shockwave: Countdown to Hiroshima) which was good but didn't really say much about how the Bomb was designed. So I turned to the Wikipedia App on my mobile and spent a couple of hours reading articles on atomic bomb design. I learned about the two types that were developed and dropped on Japan, why one had plutonium and one had uranium, that a hydrogen bomb actually contains lithium and that most of the blast energy from it is from fission and not fusion, and so on. It was all fairly readable. Not perfect by a long way, and I don't think any were featured articles, though some may have been decades ago. 
Wikipedia serves all sorts of purpose, from just answering a &quot;What is X?&quot; question to explaining to a parent about a disease that is going to dominate their family's life from now on. My wife looked up Mary Somerville after seeing her on a Scottish banknote, and ended up reading the whole article. I think we should aim to satisfy the reader's initial question that got them to English Wikipedia, and then to grab them and hold onto them to make them want to continue to read the article and related topics. I don't think our goal needs be more specific than that (e.g. 8 FAs per year). We can't force people to write about subjects they aren't passionate about, but we can create an environment where those that do are supported (e.g. peer review, copy editing, advice).
I don't think our aim should be to just continue dumping more low-quality factoids into articles just because we found a source that is free, online and contains 300 medical facts that we could add. That approach just leads to Wikipedia being a very low-quality resource for information, where people just read a few lines of the lead, or skim the article to try to find the information you were looking for among all the other random stuff, or read the other Google Search results that were written professionally. See Broken windows theory: an article that is just a random collection of facts about a topic just encourages more accumulation of random stuff and discourages quality writing. Like the student work, which is of variable quality, but worst when the students are adding more facts to an article that has already have several years of students dumping facts into it. We saw above a discussion from someone adding facts to an article full of unsourced or badly sourced facts and wondering why their fact got reverted and all the others kept. And I think the project got way way too focused on ensuring every article fit some straightjacket MEDMOS structure that our readers could not care less about. -- ° 10:52, 4 September 2020 (UTC)
 Does anyone think we might prevail if we suggested to the Wiki Ed people that they might re-orient student editors towards working on articles and lists supplied by us? That would be so much more helpful than cleaning up after students who drop less than useful content into articles on obscure niche topics.  Imagine if we could ask a course to upgrade all the primary sources in article X to secondary, or write an epidemiology section for article Y, etc. [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] ()  12:43, 4 September 2020 (UTC)
Well, it might be worth a try. Of the recent student edits I reviewed, Infant mortality is the one that has had six student classes in the last three years, and each class dump more into it. The coronavirus section is particularly desperate. That important subject needs the article quality improved and shortened. In contrast, the students took Epignathus from [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Epignathus&amp;oldid=933311014 this stub] to [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Epignathus&amp;oldid=971510497 this modest article]. The result isn't going to pass any award but is a very good first attempt. And while the topic might be very rare, it is going to be really important to some unfortunate family.
I have mentioned before in an email to someone, my thoughts on the [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Photo_challenge Commons Photo Challenge]. Sometimes people request topics that they feel Commons lacks images or concern some issue of great importance to them. Other times the topic is wide open, merely suggesting &quot;rural decay&quot; or &quot;shadows&quot; for example. The ideas are [https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commons_talk:Photo_challenge/themes discussed and voted on] and the person running it picks some each month. This month's challenge shows the difference in approach with themes on &quot;Mobility aids for the handicapped&quot; and &quot;Nature's blues&quot; and you can probably guess which topic will get the most and best entries and that people will really enjoy reviewing and awarding points for. I'm not saying PC shouldn't have a &quot;mobility aids&quot; challenge, but if it was all that sort of &quot;worthy&quot; approach, then the challenge wouldn't have been popular for seven years and attract a lot of newbies to Commons. I wonder if &quot;infant mortality&quot; is falling into the &quot;worthy&quot; trap, with mediocre results, and &quot;Epignathus&quot; was more of a serendipitous find.
I think the students (and their teachers) do need directed better to what to pick but should we be the ones choosing or would it be better to provide some guide on &quot;How to pick an article subject for students&quot; with general advice? -- ° 16:06, 4 September 2020 (UTC)
 I think we have tried over and over and over to improve our guidance to students and profs, and neither seem to read it.  More is not better.  Time to try something new. Back to the subject of why I keep harping on FAs, is the autism example.  Autism and Asperger syndrome are among our most highly viewed medical topics, and for over a decade after cleaning up a significant walled garden with Eubulides, we maintained the suite in good condition. Now the entire suite has fallen prey to advocacy editing again, and no one seems to care.  When we lose Featured articles, the entire suite goes to heck.  I don't keep bringing up FAs because they matter more than other content, but when the best quality and lead article at the autism suite goes, they all go.  The entire suite is going back to the advocacy walled garden it was before Eubulides brought them to top status.  WPMED has ignored the suite, and advocates are creating an UNDUE mess.

If you care about page views, then we should be working on pandemic-related articles (and Suicide methods).  Autism is #105 on the list of .  The article about COVID-19 in the US, which is #3, gets 10 times as many page views each day.  () 16:27, 4 September 2020 (UTC)
I'd rather encourage students to work on an obscure article than try to edit articles like Eating disorder or Abortion.
There's another science writing class starting, and I am almost tempted to ask them to work on cleaning up the country-specific COVID-19 articles, which need both updated sources and copyediting.    () 16:19, 4 September 2020 (UTC)
&quot;Highly viewed&quot; is only one aspect of an article that might guide someone to focusing their attention and care. The list is a little bizarre with Stella Immanuel at #12 who only got an article on 29th July and notable for one weird event and will likely drop off the chart completely in September. Many of the top entries are more about people in the news or current affairs (coronavirus in the UK/US/India/etc) which is more politics than medicine. COVID-19 pandemic in the United States is really not imo a Wikimedicine article. All the sources are journalism. That article is more akin to 2020 United States presidential election and 2020 United States Postal Service crisis. Asperger syndrome is pretty high up at #27 for a disease that doesn't officially exist any longer. Lung cancer is at 994 yet is the biggest cancer killer in men and #2 in women. So, really, lots of these topics are &quot;highly viewed&quot;. Btw I followed the link to  and this doesn't seem to be updated past Jan 2020. But the order of entries is very different, suggesting quite a &quot;hot topic&quot; effect on the list, which  isn't necessarily the way an encyclopaedia should focus its effort.   -- ° 17:29, 4 September 2020 (UTC)

, wrt the science writing class, the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States is probably more of a social science topic or a politics topic with a medical flavour. It depends what the class is hoping to learn about. If they are hoping to write about something medicine or disease or biological science, using appropriate MEDRS or professional textbooks, then those are not the articles they want to touch. On the other hand, the top coronavirus medical articles (disease, virus, etc) can be a battleground that I wouldn't steer any newbie towards unless they want to have their Wikipedia experience abbreviated by a hot headed admin applying their idea of arbitration enforcement. I don't have a strong opinion about the coronavirus articles on Wikipedia. I think they need/attract the kind of editor with more time on their hands than I have. For what it is worth, I have never once felt the need to consult Wikipedia about anything coronavirus related. Like everyone else here, I have lived with it dominating our lives for nine months. I get reliable news (half an hour of BBC news at 10pm and subscription to The Guardian) which keeps me up-to-date with more than enough information. I have colleagues and friends to chat with about it and family members who are involved up to their eyeballs in a professional medical capacity. I suspect are probably kidding ourselves that those who get their news from Facebook and follow Trump on twitter are going to get properly educated about it on Wikipedia. It is important, but in terms of deaths in the UK, so is stroke and so is lung cancer, and both of those will continue to be important causes of death in 2021 and 2022 and 2023... -- ° 09:50, 5 September 2020 (UTC)
I was thinking that if you want to write about biological subjects, then learning how to accurately and precisely explain the various statistics and epidemiological concepts would be a valuable educational experience.   () 18:28, 5 September 2020 (UTC)
But learning to or assessing if a student can &quot;accurately and precisely explain the various statistics and epidemiological concepts&quot; doesn't require Wikipedia. At least with stroke and lung cancer, your incidence and mortality figures are likely to be accurate for longer than 24 hours. If you want student editors to feel like their contribution mattered, then steer away from &quot;in the news&quot; articles. In the UK, we have a saying that today's news is wrapping tomorrows fish and chips.  -- ° 21:35, 5 September 2020 (UTC)
 Do we actually know what the goals of any of the profs are when they choose medical topics ?  I wonder if Wiki Ed even does.  At times, it's a prof pushing a personal agenda.  At times, it's a prof using Wikipedians as TAs to teach students better writing skills.  At times, it's unclear.  Maybe we could get a better sense of how student medical editing could be less intrusive and more beneficial if Wiki Ed could give us some insight into the goals of the profs, other than getting a whole ton of free teacher assistants to do their correcting and instructing. It would be wonderful to see good student editing, and to see student editors stick around to learn from all the effort we have to put into correcting their articles. Keep your eyes on  by , who has three FAs and is an awesome Wikipedian.  He could give us some ideas, but he is not by any means a typical prof ... he will be one of two highly prepared and knowledgeable profs to take on student editing.

Reproductive Medicine BSc Wikipedia assignment at University of Edinburgh

Hi, the University of Edinburgh are to run a Wikipedia research session for Honours students on the Reproductive Medicine BSc course on the mornings of 23rd and 30th September 2020. The course leaders have identified the following reproductive medicine topics they would like the students to work in group to research and help improve/add to Wikipedia:
*Horse ovary
*Artificial ovary
*Testis organoid (although potentially there maybe currently too little secondary literature)
*Luteolysis (in human, sheep and cow)
*Bisphenol S (page exists (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphenol_S) but could be expanded: comparison to BPA could be made more clearly and the extent of its role as an endocrine disruptor can be expanded, a quick search has brought up at least 6 review articles.
*Endogenous ovine jaagsiekte retrovirus (new page to link to Jaagsiekte retrovirus)

*Nanos Gene Family - Currently no page.
*Reproductive toxicity – there is a wiki page but it could do with considerable updating/expanding.
*Germ Cell Migration - there is some information on this under the ‘germ cell’ wiki page but there are a lot of citations missing and this could be expanded upon quite considerably, possibly in its own wiki page?

Hyperandrogenism

Hyperandrogenism is a term medically applying to people with female gonads, not male ones.

However it seems the IOC/IAAF appropriated the term in order to hide the fact that they had athletes with male gonads &amp; DSDs competing in their sport:

https://www.tas-cas.org/fileadmin/user_upload/CAS_Award_-_redacted_-_Semenya_ASA_IAAF.pdf

* The DSD Regulations do not stigmatise athletes with DSD. The DSD Regulations stress the importance of strict confidentiality. These confidentiality provisions are effective. The IAAF dealt with ... cases under the Hyperandrogenism Regulations and at least ... further cases prior to that. The IAAF has never leaked any information about any of those cases; the identity of the athletes, their nationality and the number of cases all remain unknown outside the IAAF.
* The DSD Regulations expressly and emphatically stress that they do not connote any judgment or questioning of an individual’s sex or gender identity. They are also careful not to spell out that they apply only to 46 XY individuals with fully functioning testes.
* The DSD Regulations do not exclude affected individuals from competing in the female category.


This coinage was first used by the IOC/IAAF in 2011: [https://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-addresses-eligibility-of-female-athletes-with-hyperandrogenism] 

Since 2011 coverage of hyperandrogenism has overwhelmingly focused on XY individuals with testes in sport, i.e. 'political hyperandrogenism'. 

However the term does not seem to be in medical use, because there is nothing 'hyper' about individuals with testes having high testosterone levels, it's perfectly normal. I.e. the usage was to try to protect the secrecy of the fact that athletes were XY,SRY+ in women's sport.

Any comments on how to deal with this ?   () 13:31, 18 September 2020 (UTC)

Do you think that hyperandrogenism in sport is a separate subject?  () 15:44, 18 September 2020 (UTC)

They aren't really related. As noted 'Hyperandrogenism is a medical condition characterized by high levels of androgens in females. Symptoms may include acne, seborrhea (inflamed skin), hair loss on the scalp, increased body or facial hair, and infrequent or absent menstruation.'

OTOH, 'hyperandrogenism in sport' is merely a euphemism  for 46,XY DSD. The IAAF did originally include CAH 46,XX in its definition of 'hyperandrogenism' to try and obfuscate, but that was deleted in the final version, so there are no hyperandrogenic women (in the usual sense, e.g., PCOS or similar) included in the scope of this. 

 At any rate the article is confusing in that the article has been written to describe normal 46,XX biology, but then adds the euphemistic sense without explaining that hyperandrogenism may also refer to a 46,XY DSD, and this seems misleading.  () 16:41, 18 September 2020 (UTC)

MEDMOS abuse

It is with regret that MEDMOS is again being mis-cited as a rational to arbitrarily re-order sections in articles. MEDMOS states &quot;The following lists of suggested sections are intended to help structure a new article or when an existing article requires a substantial rewrite. Changing an established article simply to fit these guidelines might not be welcomed by other editors.&quot; Today the cosmetic/fashion article Moisturizer [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Moisturizer&amp;diff=977873398&amp;oldid=977386176&amp;diffmode=source was re-ordered] with &quot;MEDMOS&quot; given as the edit summary. MEDMOS has always discouraged reordering article sections in existing articles. Further, the vast majority use of moisturiser is as an everyday skincare rather than medical treatment. The reorder didn't make any sense, with the article's present form since a rewrite in 2018 having a &quot;Description&quot; section up-front. The article isn't great, but it requires more effort to improve it than just reordering and renaming section headings. The MEDMOS sections are intended to guide (not require) authors when writing new material, and not to authorise editors to chuck the article content in a tumble-dryer and randomly reorder things. Please, lets not have any more of this disruptive and non-consensus approach to editing. Editors making major changes to articles, such as a reorder, should first seek consensus on the article talk page. -- ° 20:37, 12 September 2020 (UTC)

The historical abuse of MEDMOS was and continues to involve one or two editors re-ordering sections in order to &quot;conform&quot; to MEDOS, when in fact MEDMOS says not to do that. If you think, while working on article content, that a new section is required or content could be split into two sections, that seems like normal healthy article development, and you are welcome to use the MEDMOS sections as &quot;suggestions&quot;.  Whether the content at Primary ovarian insufficiency that is was inside &quot;Causes&quot; is better inside &quot;Mechanism&quot; is a difficult question. It seems there is a bit of overlap and maybe it is not all &quot;mechanism&quot;. I don't know if someone has some example articles with Causes/Mechanism sections on similar kinds of disorders, that would guide you better on where to stick the content. -- ° 10:41, 21 September 2020 (UTC)

Last time, it was a thousand-bed teaching hospital in a non-English-speaking country.  This time, it's 425-bed level 2 trauma center in Florida.

Regards, -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez (/) 03:41, 21 September 2020 (UTC)
The better hospital articles tend to focus on institutional history, rather than services currently provided.  One that's up for deletion was founded in the 19th century because a pedestrian ended up with a broken leg after being run over by a horse-drawn wagon, and the leading citizens decided that they needed a local hospital.  Quite a few were started by religious organizations.  A few hundred hospitals' original locations are on the National Register of Historic Places.  There's always the odd hospital associated with a criminal story.   () 21:20, 22 September 2020 (UTC)

Peanut allergy contradiction

Peanut allergy currently suggests in the Peanut allergy#Timing of exposure section  but then in the very next section  Technically infants aren't children under some definitions but I don't think this is what's being said. I imagine the 2016 consensus communication outweighs a 2010 systematic review so the children part should just be deleted, but I don't have enough experience with MEDRS to say for sure. BTW, how is stuff like Bamba (snack)#Peanut allergy normally handled? I guess it's less of an issue now with the 2016 consensus, but it seems to me like it could be a problem before that given that although it's only describing a single result (as it mentions), it could lead the the mistaken assumption that this single result was conclusive although the 2010 systematic review didn't find that. Even now, the ten fold difference which while to be fair could apply so some particular subgroup, is I assume poorly supported (since it's only this single study) given the consensus was only a 11-25% reduced risk.  () 22:52, 21 September 2020 (UTC)
Reading more carefully, the systematic review is said to be about sensitivity but the 2016 statement about risk so maybe these aren't so clearly contradictory although the abstract suggest to me we're probably misleading what the 2010 review found. Still even if we keep both in entirety, I think they probably need to be combined in a single section at least the sections renamed to make it clearer what the focus is. Likewise if they are contradictory but neither is strong enough to over-ride the other so we present them as differing views.  () 00:35, 22 September 2020 (UTC)
The 2016 statement is also about families with a history of peanut allergy, whereas the other claims to be about any family.  I'd generally recommend looking for a third &quot;tie-breaker&quot; source.  If there aren't any, then I'd prefer the more recent consensus statement instead of the decade-old systematic review, but I'd write the statements narrowly.  () 21:39, 22 September 2020 (UTC)

I just reviewed the Step aerobics article at DYK.  It's worthy topic and the article creator has done a lot of good work covering its historical aspects, but the section on its health effects needs to be completely rewritten from -compliant sources.  The article creator isn't experienced with medical topics, so we're looking for someone to replace the health effects section.  It doesn't need to be long or comprehensive, just MEDRS-compliant.  The contributor would get DYK credit as well.  Thanks!   () 19:23, 22 September 2020 (UTC)

If anyone wants to have a go at this, the three most recent reviews are PMID 28715061 (pregnancy), PMID 23914499 (includes multiple styles of aerobics), and PMID 21944303 (apparently, it's good for bone mineral density).   () 06:40, 23 September 2020 (UTC)

Congratulations Ajpolino. I don't know you well enough to have voted at the RFA, but it seems like you sailed through it. -- ° 14:18, 23 September 2020 (UTC)

Global Certification Commission

I just expanded/created Global Certification Commission. Can I get a sanity check before I nominate it for DYK? Thanks in advance! --- [[User talk:Coffeeandcrumbs|C]]&amp;[[Special:Contributions/Coffeeandcrumbs|C (]]) 07:40, 24 September 2020 (UTC)
Looks good to me. Nice find. It seems there are lots of gaps in our coverage of global public health infrastructure here. Glad to see this headed to DYK.  () 14:04, 24 September 2020 (UTC)

Merging Pages

Upon reviewing 2019 Philippines measles outbreak, 2019–2020 New Zealand measles outbreak, 2019 Tonga measles outbreak, and 2019 Samoa measles outbreak, I am wondering if we could merge these 4 pages together into: Pacific Island Measles Outbreak 2019 or merge into the already existing 2019 measles outbreaks. These pages have a significant amount of overlap/interconnected events and merging the pages would cut down on repetitive info. I can take point on either option, I just want feedback before committing.  () 19:47, 24 September 2020 (UTC)
, I support a merge, either way you want to do it.  () 20:14, 24 September 2020 (UTC)
That sounds good to me too. Ping me if you'd like a hand enacting it. Thanks!  () 20:25, 24 September 2020 (UTC)</segment>
