Poppers

I think the article should be tagged for this project. The lede seems POV in that these are largely untested and unregulated chemicals used recreationally and known to cause medical problems yet the article seems to glow about how harmless they are. Thoughts?  -- Banjeboi 19:12, 18 January 2010 (UTC)
The article has been a cesspit for awhile. I abandoned it a year or two ago after a proliferation of warring  depressed me. It would probably be worthwhile to revisit it. MastCell Talk 21:18, 18 January 2010 (UTC)
ONe of those SPA's was, IMHO, Hank Wilson who seems to have been a lone activist trying to collect and distribute the scientific studies he found. He died last year at some point. The others have every appearance of selling the stuff.  -- Banjeboi 03:50, 19 January 2010 (UTC)
The recreational drug pages along with sex topics are some of Wikipedias most visited.  They are also the most heavily vandalized.  Both fall under WP:MED!  Are we not lucky? Doc James (talk ·  · ) 04:38, 19 January 2010 (UTC)
Hank Wilson passed away at the end of 2008, and I do remember hearing that he had held on to the causation of poppers with AIDS/KS long after that was abandoned. Here's a [http://www.sfcityclinic.org/moreresources/POPPERSANDIMMUNOSUPPRESSION.pdf bibliography] attributed to him. I don't see anything in the article covering poppers use and increased STD risk due to vasodilation, although there is material on tie to increased high-risk behavior and on use with Viagra. With respect to the pages popularity, I've been working under the assumption that flagged revisions would eventually wind their to way to a lot of med articles at some point for that reason. -Optigan13 (talk) 04:47, 19 January 2010 (UTC)

I have just done a bit of a rewrite of the article to resolve poor sourcing and POV issues. Mastcell has also helped improve the article as well. Hopefully the major concerns with the article have been resolved now and fingers crossed the SPA's don't return. Optigan13 with regard to KS the most [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18040808 recent review] seems to give weight to poppers being associated with kaposi's sarcoma but a more recent [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19108691 study] found no association. It seems the literature is devided on the issue although the volume and quality of the research into poppers is seriously lacking.--Literaturegeek | T@1k? 20:33, 19 January 2010 (UTC)

Any reason the article uses that title rather than merging to the more formal alkyl nitrites? Smack is a dab page linked to Heroin, e.g. LeadSongDog come howl 21:43, 19 January 2010 (UTC)
A merge may help ease the promotional SPA issues and get the focus on the chemical aspects.  -- Banjeboi 21:49, 19 January 2010 (UTC)

Per  I think that poppers is the right name for the article as it is most commonly known under this name by lay people. Poppers also gets more pubmed hits in the academic literature. A similar controversy has previously been discussed with regard to the heroin article and whether it should be renamed to diamorphine.--Literaturegeek | T@1k? 02:01, 20 January 2010 (UTC)
Ecstasy disambiguates to MDMA and on pubmed, &quot;amyl nitrite&quot; gets four times the hits of &quot;poppers&quot;. LeadSongDog come howl 06:24, 20 January 2010 (UTC)
As long as the information is easily accessible - like ensuring poppers is prominently in the lede - I think it would be fine.  -- Banjeboi 06:46, 20 January 2010 (UTC)
Oh sorry guys I must have gotten confused, amyl nitrite does indeed get more hits in pubmed. I would be happy if poppers is merged into amyl nitrite.--Literaturegeek | T@1k? 19:32, 20 January 2010 (UTC)

Curious..

..are there any lipid metabolism disorders that may present as a mild case of diabetes that is aggravated by lipid intake? Or any case of diabetes? --CopperKettle 16:41, 17 January 2010 (UTC)

Do we mean the same thing when we say &quot;lipid metabolism disorder&quot;?  I think of a purely genetic problem (i.e., enzyme mutation).  There are all kinds of much more common things that are &quot;aggravated&quot; by &quot;lipid intake&quot; in some people, e.g., pancreatitis, gall bladder problems, hepatitis...  WhatamIdoing (talk) 17:39, 17 January 2010 (UTC)
Yes, I mean the rare species, so to speak. Enzyme mutations and such that sprang up as a strange form of diabetes, possibly with strange neurological side-effects, that vanish when lipid intake drops. --CopperKettle 04:08, 21 January 2010 (UTC)
The matter is, I have this kind of strange diabetes for 10 years that stubbornly refuses to develop into a full-blown form and is marked as &quot;MODY diabetes (?)&quot; (sic, with a question mark) on my medical card. Personally endocrinologists say to me that they havent met the disease with such course as mine; some say &quot;this is not diabetes&quot;. Sugar load test keeps telling it is diabetes, but with diet the glycated haemo stays normal. For 10 years. And it is aggravated by lipid intake, it seems to me. Excessive lipid\caloric intake leads to strange feelings (left hand numbness, dizzyness, dizziness while performing cognitive tasks) and.. dry mouth without the increase in blood sugar. Also I have keratoconus, and normal\high lipid\caloric intake seems to lead both to increased days of &quot;sore throat&quot; and &quot;cloudy cornea&quot; (that requires topical steroids), so I keep at unnaturally low levels of calories and lipids for years. --CopperKettle 04:20, 21 January 2010 (UTC)

Concerns regarding this section of the TMJ syndrome article

Hey all, I decided to raise this concern here because the contributors to this WikiProject would probably have the most experience dealing with articles that inch too close to crossing the line between articles on medical topics and .  I invite you to take a look at this section of the TMJ syndrome article and comment about what you think.  To me, it seems like a &quot;how-to&quot; guide to treating a medical condition, which is basically giving medical advice, right?  However, I'm a little too inexperienced in this area to  and just remove or rewrite the whole section, so I was hoping for ideas.  The talk page of the article itself is pretty much dead, so I brought this issue here instead of there.  I will, however, link to this discussion there, so interested contributors can make their way here.  --Nick—Contact/ 04:05, 25 January 2010 (UTC)

Symphysis pubis dysfunction

Policy regarding citation of disease synonyms

Are there policies out there regarding how disease synonyms are cited?  I think when a disease synonym is included in an article, it should have it's own citation so someone can verify where it has come from.  When there are multiple synonyms, I think they should each be associated with their own citation, even if they all come from the same source.  The reason being that if someone comes along and adds an additional synonym, the sources of the previous ones are not confused.  Any thoughts? ---kilbad (talk) 23:46, 22 January 2010 (UTC)

I understand the impulse, but it makes the text less readable, which is highly undesirable.  Additionally, alternate names are usually presented in the first sentence, and citations are  for the entire lead section, particularly for non-controversial statements.
Inline citations are actually required for only a remarkably small set of facts:
* Direct quotations
* Contentious statements about living people
* Facts whose accuracy is disputable (&quot;challenged or likely to be challenged&quot;)
* Statistics (defined broadly)
* Opinions that need to be attributed to a source
That's the whole list, and making it very slightly harder to vandalize the alternate names for a disease isn't on the list.  
In my experience, it's usually quite easy to verify alternate names, and adding a source tag won't prevent anyone from incorrectly copying an existing source tag over to newly added names.  I really don't think that you'd be gaining much with that practice.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 00:49, 23 January 2010 (UTC)
I support Kilbad's proposal. On many articles, the primary arguments about article content derive from differing underlying assumptions about whether or not two different terms actually refer to the same condition. The best way to resolve these disputes is to provide unambiguous provenance for the assertion of equivalence. --Arcadian (talk) 03:15, 23 January 2010 (UTC)

 I agree with WAID.  If something is problematic or disputed, ask for a citation; otherwise, it makes no sense to have to cite that synonyms for Tourette syndrome are Tourette's, TS and GTS, for example.  Current policy already covers this.  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 03:20, 23 January 2010 (UTC)

I have a slightly different suggestion. If there are alternate names that may be contentious, then that fact, in itself is interesting. Only in the cases where there disputable alternates, I'd recommend a short section immediately after the lead entitled Naming, or similar, which would be the best place to describe alternate names – and any contention – and cite the sources. The lead would then contain those alternates as part of its function of summarising the rest of the (cited) article. That would have the dual advantage of keeping the lead concise and free of cites, and drawing attention to the issue of alternate names. Although this is not prescribed in , it's a common enough tactic elsewhere in wikipedia to make it worth consideration. --RexxS (talk) 05:13, 23 January 2010 (UTC)
Names might also be reasonably discussed in a history section, and could be appropriately cited in that case.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 23:09, 25 January 2010 (UTC)

Zidovudine

Additional eyes are needed at Zidovudine, where a strongly opinionated editor with a block history on the article is stating that cancer is a side effect of AZT. The source is a California website. I don't feel that this satisfies our sourcing requirements for medicine, nor do I think it's appropriate to include a paragraph about the purported carcinogenicity of a substance partially responsible for the reduction in AIDS-related cancers. Keepcalmandcarryon (talk) 16:04, 24 January 2010 (UTC)

Agree read through lexidrugs and they do not mention cancer as a side effect.  Would need good primary research or a review to support something like this.Doc James (talk ·  · ) 00:42, 25 January 2010 (UTC)

The influence of antiretroviral therapy in general (and NNRTIs in particular) on the incidence of cancer is a fascinating topic. While HAART leads to clear declines in most AIDS-defining malignancies, the data are much more conflicting and unclear with regard to non-AIDS-defining malignancies. The page on zidovudine is probably not the place to cover this, since no one uses zidovudine in isolation - probably more appropriate for the page on HAART. The editor in question, , is a relentless promoter of AIDS denialism on various and sundry pages, from zidovudine through Paul Gann, and they're not above anything from misrepresenting refs to actual socking. The focus on zidovudine (as if it were still 1993) is typical AIDS-denialist stuff, but despite the unpromising provenance of these edits, it's something we should probably look into covering a bit more deeply. Several recent high-quality papers and reviews are available, which I will collect as time permits. MastCell Talk 00:58, 25 January 2010 (UTC)

Although AZT and other NRTIs are much more specific for the viral polymerase, they do have some affinity for cellular polymerases. One could certainly envision a possible mechanism for carcinogenesis. However, NRTI-mediated increase in cancer incidence has not yet been established in humans. Until more research is done, I don't see a reason to include carcinogenicity speculation in the Zidovudine article. Keepcalmandcarryon (talk) 14:32, 25 January 2010 (UTC)

Spinal disc herniation

A self-identified chiropractor ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spinal_disc_herniation&amp;curid=6737633&amp;diff=340293029&amp;oldid=340092341 see the edit summary]) keeps adding chiropractic and spinal decompression to the article. Spinal manipulation is usually considered a relative contraindication for this condition and spinal decompression machines are the subject of FDA confiscation and prosecution because of the claims made for them in connection with the treatment of this condition. I'm not sure what to do and would rather not get in an edit war with this person. More eyes on the situation please. -- Brangifer (talk) 14:41, 27 January 2010 (UTC)

The anon is in Canada, where the US FDA's actions are pretty much irrelevant.
However, it sounds like this topic should be covered in the article, e.g., with a really stellar scientific source that directly says that spinal manipulation is relatively contraindicated (particularly in serious cases).  WhatamIdoing (talk) 19:44, 27 January 2010 (UTC)

Hi gang! You're absolutely spot on, What'!  I'm pretty sure Brangifer will be able to find such a reference, or more.  I suggest that the anonymous Canadian Chiropractor should be invited to present the volumes of references that he or she promised in the edit summary s/he made. A particular treatment modality should not be added without references.  I think it'd be better to tag Chiro Rx as  or at least unsourced and flag the information for removal from the article if suitable references are not provided.  At the same time, valid reasons not to opt for a particular course of treatment, properly cited, should also be provided in the interests of  having a balanced POV in the article.  And by valid reasons, I echo What' in saying that just because the FDA does it is not valid in the global sense - that's just the decision of one committee in one country, after all.  However, stating their reasons and the evidence behind them would be valid! Cheers, Matto Have a yarn 00:52, 30 January 2010 (UTC)

If he's removing useful content, it's probably worth reverting and explaining to the IP that strict sourcing is only really required in BLPs.

The diffs I reviewed showed that the editor was removing uncited content that has been tagged for a long period of time, and not fixed. If you want to revert the edit and provide a source for the information, that is fine. Reverting the removal of unsourced content goes against :
This policy requires that a reliable source in the form of an inline citation be supplied for any material that is challenged or likely to be challenged, and for all quotations, or the material may be removed. This is strictly applied to all material in the mainspace
The burden of evidence lies with the editor who adds or restores material. All quotations and any material challenged or likely to be challenged must be attributed to a reliable, published source using an inline citation
Both the fact tags and the removal of the content are example of challenges to the material. Remember that Wikipedia is not about truth, but about verifiability. It would be better if the IP editor would search for a source for the information, rather than just remove the challenged information, but then again, no editor has come forward with a source for quite awhile.

Vertebral artery dissection

In spite of the fact that chiropractic high cervical neck manipulation has been strongly associated with VAD, strokes, and deaths, a recent addition on that subject was [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vertebral_artery_dissection&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=340625171 reverted]. I have to agree that the German study isn't the best one because its language/translation is confusing and it includes numerous examples not performed by chiropractors. It does, quite correctly, show that the technique itself, not the practitioner, is problematic. It is only noted so often in connection with chiropractic because they perform most cervical neck manipulations.

The article is merely a stub and needs development. This was the only mention of chiropractic, which is the most common cause of VAD in persons under 45 years of age, with a [http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/short/32/5/1054 500% increased risk of VAD among those who have visited a chiropractor within 1 week of the VBA]. A California study found a 600% increased risk.

I have collected a number of sources in this somewhat sensationalistic [http://quackfiles.blogspot.com/2006/12/must-see-dangers-of-chiropractic.html blog entry]. Rather than gettting bogged down in my rhetoric (except the short introduction, which should be read), look carefully at the sources and see if some of them can be used to develop the subject.

More eyes needed. The stub needs to be developed, and cervical manipulation needs be mentioned as an important risk factor. -- Brangifer (talk) 17:59, 30 January 2010 (UTC)

I reverted the addition of that source as it was blatantly misleading the statistics reported in the article, and I have a problem with the reliability of a source that misrepresents its own facts in the abstract. Rather than reading Ernst from 2002, or such biased sources as Barrett, I would suggest reading the interdiscipinary studies performed by the World Health Organization Bone and Joint Decade Task Force (2000-2010):

The increased risks of VBA stroke associated with chiropractic and PCP visits is likely due to patients with headache and neck pain from VBA dissection seeking care before their stroke. We found no evidence of excess risk of VBA stroke associated chiropractic care compared to primary care.&quot;

 I see we share the concern about that one source. As to your other comment, obviously no blogs would be used. It's just a collection of sources that could be used, and Barrett's article also lists many reliable sources. Here are even more sources.

* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:BullRangifer/Spinal_manipulation_research Spinal manipulation research]

 Obviously the use of chiropractic sources will usually tend to emphasize only one side of the debate, or even whitewash the situation. For example, the two chiropractic sources mentioned above (Cassidy and Boyle), are often used to trump myriad other sources, which is a very biased method of protecting the profession and stopping investigation of this subject. Patient safety is ignored by this approach. The degree of denial is incredible. Every time this subject has been broached and attempted here at Wikipedia it is immediately attacked by chiropractors and their advocates. Deletionism is a favorite ploy. In this case you had a legitimate excuse, but when better sources are used, I'm wondering what your reaction will be.

 There is a debate. Of that there is no doubt, and that debate can be documented using RS, and that should be included in the article. -- Brangifer (talk) 19:49, 30 January 2010 (UTC)

I believe that describing the World Health Organization Bone and Joint Decade Task Force studies as &quot;chiropractic sources&quot; to be disenguously misleading. These were not &quot;chiropractic sources&quot;, but rather interdisciplinary sources.
The multidisciplinary, international Task Force led by Prof Scott Haldeman from the University of California in Irvine and in L.A., involved more than 50 researchers based in 9 countries and represented 14 different clinical and scientific disciplines in 8 universities. The group assembled the best international research data on neck pain and related disorders – specifically more than 31,000 research citations with subsequent analysis of over 1,000 studies – making this monumental document one of the most extensive reports on the subject of neck pain ever developed, and offering the most current expert perspective on the evidence related to the treatment of neck pain..
It is true that Cassidy was originally trained as a chiropractor, but it is equally true that he also holds a Ph.D and a Dr. Med Sc. It is also true that he is a Professor of Epidemiology with the Department of Public Health Sciences in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Toronto. To simply cast off these sources because a chiropractor was involved is bad logic and bad science.
Boyle on the otherhand, is not a chiropractor. She has a M.Sc and a Ph.D. Other researchers involved include Pierre Cote, who has a chiropractic degree, but also a Ph.D. and is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Public Health Sciences in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Toronto. How about Yaohua He, who is an MD, Ph.D, or Frank Silver MD, FRCPC? You discount their involvement in this massive project when you descripe these articles as &quot;chiropractic sources&quot;. DigitalC (talk) 21:03, 30 January 2010 (UTC)

 I only mentioned two names, not the World Health Organization Bone and Joint Decade Task Force, but you're right, Haldeman is also a chiropractor (second third generation IIRC) and uses his MD to give chiropractic good press. My point is that one can't blindly accept a source. The researchers also have their biases, and whenever chiropractors are involved, or, like Haldeman, lead the study, it will usually favor chiropractic.

 BTW, some of the data in the Cassidy study doesn't back up his editorializing conclusions. His conclusions are unrelated to much of the other data which could easily explain away his conclusions. He has lots of statistics in there which he doesn't use to soften his conclusions. 

 The Cassidy data shows that in this population patients are 7-8 times more likely to have consulted a primary care MD than a chiropractor over the time intervals for any reason, as demonstrated by the fact that in the 3164 control cases (no VAD) 29.9% of cases had seen a doctor within the previous month while only 4% consulted chiropractors.

 This doesn't seem to have been allowed for anywhere in his conclusions. These two factors (the other being that patients with actual VADs would normally preferentially consult an MD) could well explain why there appears to be an association of MD consultations with VAD. The strong associations shown in this and other studies of VAD and neck manipulation remains unaccounted for. -- Brangifer (talk) 07:39, 31 January 2010 (UTC)

It wasn't comparing MDs and DCs, but rather primary care MDs (ie, not the emergency room). Patients with VADs complain of headaches and neck pain, and aren't necessarily likely to consult an emergency room with those symptoms, but would likely consult a chiropractor or their family doctor. However, if they have full-blown symptoms of a VAD, then they would consult an emergency room. Given that both Cassidy and Cote have Ph.D's in epidemiology, and Haldeman is a professor of epidemiology at UCLA, I'm sure that they understand the statistics better than you or I. As an interesting/trivial aside, Haldeman is a third generation chiropractor - his grandmother was the first chiropractor in Canada - might be worth a bio if there are good sources that discuss her. Again, Haldeman is also a medical doctor, so to state that he is biased towards one side or the other seems to be an adhominem attack - &quot;he is a chiropractor and therefore the study will favor chiropractic&quot; (paraphrased). DigitalC (talk) 15:31, 31 January 2010 (UTC)

 I have tweaked my comment to make sure that such a misunderstanding doesn't happen again. Writing &quot;MD&quot; was too vague. I didn't imply ER MDs at all, so nothing else needs changing.

 Thanks for the info about Haldeman. 3rd generation! I wasn't too far off. That establishes his bias as more genetic than cognitive and professional. He simply can't do otherwise since he's actually in a familial relationship with the profession. ;-) My comment was based on the fact that nearly all his work involving chiropractic subjects tends to glorify it or subtly run interference for it with his MD colleagues. (He wouldn't get paid if he criticized the profession. He makes lots of money speaking for them and they'd stop hiring him. He'd essentially become &quot;divorced&quot; from his &quot;family&quot;.) He's a favorite poster boy used by the profession when they want the added prestige of an &quot;MD&quot; title promoting their agenda. That's just what I've gleaned from my years of reading his publications, seminars and speeches. In this he's no different than chiropractors in France, who for many years had to become MDs to legally practice chiropractic. Once they graduated, they promptly ignored their scientific learnings and reverted back to chiropractic metaphysics and unethical practices, while being legally protected by their MD title.

 It is very telling that he very rarely (if ever) speaks out clearly and loudly against the unscientific practices, fraud, abuse, and quackery which have been documented by chiropractic researchers to be more prevalent in their own profession than in other professions. (See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiropractic_controversy_and_criticism#Ethics_and_claims here for refs].) Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm very willing to change my mind if you can show me refs where he does criticize his own profession/family. His status as an MD enables him to get acceptance for chiropractic POV where a DC would not get acceptance for saying exactly the same thing. That's what I've observed over the years.

 I'm pretty certain that some of the MDs reading this can identify with the still common attitude in the medical profession, that an MD automatically has more credibility than a DC, IF one only looks at their credentials. There is still a lot of (justified) skepticism toward the chiropractic profession. Chiropractors are in much the same situation, as the old joke goes, that, just like women and blacks, they have to work twice as hard to get half the pay credibility. In some cases it's quite unfair to certain chiropractors, but there are historical reasons for those attitudes. -- Brangifer (talk) 19:40, 31 January 2010 (UTC)
Toxicology Task Force / Need help adding health effects of household/industrial chemicals

Two questions:
# What is the status of the  proposal? It seems that the conversation kind of died last November, but it looks like at least a few people were interested. What would we need to do to get that project started?
#* Nevermind, answered my own question -- I'm creating the project now. Jrtayloriv (talk) 06:43, 1 February 2010 (UTC)
#I am about to start going through the list of chemicals/health problems listed in [http://database.healthandenvironment.org/ CHE Toxicant and Disease Database], [http://www.scorecard.org/chemical-profiles/ Scorecard.org: Chemical Profiles], and other such sources, and adding known health effects for each chemical to the WP article for that chemical. Anyone interested in helping me with this? Know of any other sources I might use? Thanks Jrtayloriv (talk) 06:26, 1 February 2010 (UTC)

Looking at [http://www.healthandenvironment.org/tddb/disease/637 an example from CHE], I appreciate the categorization by strength of evidence.  However, they don't seem to include any information about absolute or relative risk, and that could be misleading to our readers.  For example, something can have very strong evidence to support a link -- but perhaps only one in a thousand people are ever exposed to that level of some uncommon toxin, and only one in a hundred of small group of exposed people ever develop the disease as a result of the exposure... and perhaps it's a common disease, like hypertension.  The result is that you could have a ~99.993% chance that any given case of high blood pressure is not caused by the &quot;strong evidence&quot; toxin.  Simply saying &quot;There is strong evidence that [name of rare thing] causes this disease&quot; -- which  is all this source says -- doesn't begin to communicate  to the reader.  
Also, I don't think that a laundry list of every probably associated substance is going to help our readers; it might be worth limiting such lists to those with strong evidence.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 04:05, 2 February 2010 (UTC)
Agreed -- as far as Wikipedia articles for certain pathologies, I was only going to include chemicals with strong evidence, and was only using the CHE database as a place to get ideas for chemicals to search for in the literature. On the other hand, as far as chemicals, I don't think it would hurt to have a &quot;laundry list&quot; of health effects, since that list will be much shorter than the list of chemicals suspected to cause a certain illness. Thanks for your comments. -- Jrtayloriv (talk) 04:18, 3 February 2010 (UTC)

Stupid questions perhaps

A couple of questions arose while reading on MELAS syndrome. 
*Will eating dairy products increase lactate levels? (I'm sure it won't, just to be safe) 
*How lactate levels could be manipulated by diet? 
Cheers, --CopperKettle 16:13, 1 February 2010 (UTC)

 I couldn't find any references to suggest that dairy products can increase lactate level, even in MELAS. Neither could I find any evidence to show that diet has a significant effect on lactate level. The closest article I found was [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16145217?itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum&amp;ordinalpos=2 this one], where spoilt milk led to septic shock. The body has a fairly robust homeostatic mechanism to deal with excess lactic acid: lactate dehydrogenase. Lactic acidosis is traditionally caused by impaired oxygen utilization in tissues, either due to impaired oxygen delivery, or impaired uptake into the tissues/mitochondria.

Redirects and the WPMED banner

Should unique redirects for disease synonyms (like Mallorca acne --&gt; Acne aestivalis) have a WPMED banner on the talk page, perhaps with a new &quot;redirect&quot; parameter, as there is already a &quot;category&quot; parameter (see  for example).  I think there may be utility in seeing unique redirects within the scope of a project or task force.  If WPMED banners on unique redirect pages is not recommended, perhaps you could share your rational. ---kilbad (talk) 03:03, 2 February 2010 (UTC)

Like most projects, we don't usually bother with such tags.  Such tags don't seem to be tracked or useful to the  team -- or to us, since, unlike a stub-class article, there's not much 'improvement' that you can do for a redirect.  In fact, I routinely remove them, because they are almost always leftovers from a merge, and thus contain invalid/outdated information from the pre-merge state.  
If you decide that it's warranted in any given case, then the tag should be set to |class=Redirect |importance=NA (&quot;NA&quot; means &quot;not an article&quot;; if you don't set this, then the banner may assume it).  WhatamIdoing (talk) 03:47, 2 February 2010 (UTC)
It may be useful to create redirects banners for sourced synonyms that are used within a condition's article and are assigned to a designated category. For example this would differentiate redirects categorized per  with a dermatology task force redirect template banner, excluding those created as common misnomers or redirects without the use of difficult to type characters such as ascents or en dashes. Calmer Waters 07:36, 2 February 2010 (UTC)
Can someone make the banner read &quot;redirect&quot; when the class is set to redirect?  See  for an example. ---kilbad (talk) 18:22, 2 February 2010 (UTC)
Red Hawk (disambiguation) isn't a redirect:  it's a disambiguation page.  Pages like that should normally be set to |class=Disambig |importance=NA.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 22:07, 2 February 2010 (UTC)
Well, can we still get class=Redirect to read &quot;redirect&quot; when the banner is viewed? ---kilbad (talk) 23:32, 2 February 2010 (UTC)
If it's not showing up, then you could make the request at  or at the Meta banner that it relies on -- but what's the point?  Basically nobody looks at the talk pages for redirects, and the few who do are highly unlikely to care whether it says &quot;redirect&quot; on it.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 06:04, 3 February 2010 (UTC)

The risk is in making any such list meaninglessly vague. Hence malaise is such a common symptom as not to be discriminatory. One mighjt expect WP article therefore to list just the top few causes of perhaps &quot;anaemia, thyroid disorder, untreated diabetes, and many other acute and chronic illness, as well as a psychological symptom of depression and anxiety&quot;. However the current article malaise includes conjunctivitis and mouth ulcers which clearly are trivial inclusions in the list, indeed I dispute that malaise is a core feature of eithr of these. The second problem is that WP is not aimed at patients or as a self-diagnosis guide, so setting up comprehensive list of symptom categories such as shoulder pain, shoulder swelling, elbow pain, elbow swelling, wrist pain, wrist swelling, muscle stiffness, muscle ache, muscle swelling etc etc needs to be restrained by what is appropriate for an encyclopedia. David Ruben  Talk  10:39, 3 February 2010 (UTC)
Well, the symptom checkers which have impressed me are computer programs with audio and a virtual physician (ie, video of a ER clinician) who asks the user questions: age, gender, what is the complaint, ... . The user answers them from the keyboard or mouse click. The virtual physician asks the next consequential question, the user answers back &amp; forth until the top few candidate diseases are displayed; the virtual physician usually ends up with See your doctor right away, or in the next 2 weeks etc. Perhaps an article which possibly lists the current symptom checkers on the web could be a real service for readers. For example, comparing the URLs after a search yields some surprising differences in ease of use. Some of them can only be used by a computer literate person, some can only be used by a healthy person who is trying to help a sick person, some require medical knowledge to use, some are xxx etc. --Ancheta Wis (talk) 13:55, 3 February 2010 (UTC)
Oh no - not our role to suggest where to get help. Furthermore, however good a website may be, only applicable to its own country (minor illness management, access routes to medical care, even urgent but not life-threatening health access, let alone choice of self medication or prescribed medication vary globally).

It appears to be your typical long term malingering article- while real medical viewpoints are included noting that there is no evidence it exists, they naturally aren't the focus of the article. Several puff pieces also exist on organizations promoting (compensation for) the supposed syndrome. Nevard (talk) 23:43, 6 February 2010 (UTC)

Dental caries GA Sweeps: On Hold

I have reviewed Dental caries for GA Sweeps to determine if it still qualifies as a Good Article. In reviewing the article I have found several issues, which I have detailed . Since the article falls under the scope of this project, I figured you would be interested in contributing to further improve the article and help it maintain its GA status. Please comment there to help resolve the raised issues. If you have any questions, let me know on my talk page and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. --Happy editing!

Perception

Dear all,

I’ve been trying to help folks who were trying to articulate the latest knowledge on Perception article, but my suggestions did not help much. On top of that, some little egos managed to erode even that little clarity we had.

I have decided, therefore, to simply rewrite the article on the basis of currently available knowledge in the following disciplines: cognitive and developmental psychology, medicine (especially genetics), philosophy and complex (adaptive) systems theory with emphasised references to non-monotonic logics. I am contemplating few other disciplines, but these will suffice for the beginning.

I have drafted the lead into the article and the draft can be found on the related discussion page. I am calling now for comments and contributions backed by the latest science and the latest contemporary philosophical thought. My only condition is clarity and brevity wherever possible. If you find other possible references, they will be welcomed too.

WPMED template

Why are some task forces in bold, and others not?  Can we un-bold all of them? ---kilbad (talk) 01:49, 9 February 2010 (UTC)

Since all but two are in bold type, it might make more sense to bold all of them.  This kind of request should probably go on the template's own talk page; a couple of editors who know how to deal with it seem to watch the template page.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 02:12, 9 February 2010 (UTC)

Then, a change was made ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:WPBannerMeta/taskforce&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=329125866 here]), which defaulted the task force names to be bolded.  However, the 2 WPMED task forces that are not bolded use their own custom text, rather than the default in  (although the custom text is identical to the default - &quot;This article is supported by...&quot;).  The reason these task forces require custom settings is that they do not use the default settings for importance - they take the importance from WPMED if no task force importance is specified.  When  was changed, no one noticed and  was never changed.  I will go ahead and bold these 2 task forces.

Brainstorming again

I want to make an article to complement the list of cutaneous conditions, perhaps something that will combine the content of skin disease and skin lesion, with an overall goal to provide a fuller discussion on cutaneous conditions as a whole.

Outdated term

We've got some confusion about Reticuloendotheliosis.  [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reticuloendotheliosis&amp;oldid=288780571 Here] we say that it's a (any) lymphoma of the reticuloendothelial system; then it's [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reticuloendotheliosis&amp;oldid=312190716 redirected] to a specific neoplastic disease, Leukemic reticuloendotheliosis (ignoring other uses, such as non-lipid reticuloendotheliosis, which is [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000068.htm an older name] for Histiocytosis); finally, it has been [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reticuloendotheliosis&amp;oldid=343066118 redirected] to a fungal infection of the lungs (possibly a corruption of &quot;reticuloendothelial cytomycosis&quot;).  

The original citation is to MeSH, where it has recently been [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/2009/introduction/deleted.html replaced by &quot;Lymphatic Diseases&quot;].  There also seems to be a [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/cgi/mesh/2009/MB_cgi?mode=&amp;term
RETICULOENDOTHELIOSIS,+AVIAN Reticuloendotheliosis virus], which causes neoplastic disease in birds.

I've always seen this term used in the context of neoplastic disease; does anyone else know of other uses?  Should we make this a disambiguation page, or revert to the neoplastic disease (which appears to be the most widespread use of this uncommon term).  WhatamIdoing (talk) 23:20, 10 February 2010 (UTC)

Thanks for noticing this issue.

Aspartame

This [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_substitute#Aspartame section] in the Sugar substitute article is troubling in its use of speculative and dubious research by Olney, who is a well-known enemy of aspartame and friend of Betty Martini, the major promoter of the aspartame hoax (see the Aspartame controversy article). Some expert eyes are needed to analyze that paragraph with an eye to using MEDRS sources and for balance. -- Brangifer (talk) 03:29, 11 February 2010 (UTC)


What is going on here?  Does someone think that our standard is, &quot;When in doubt, cite press releases?&quot;  
I'm off wiki now, but I hope that someone will be able to help with this particular paragraph:Since the FDA approved aspartame for consumption, some researchers have suggested that a rise in brain tumor rates in the United States may be at least partially related to the increasing availability and consumption of aspartame.[9] Some research, often supported by companies producing artificial sweeteners, has failed to find any link between aspartame and cancer or other health problems.[10] Recent research showed a clear link between this substance and cancer; leading some experts to call for the FDA to pull aspartame from the market.[11][12] This research has led the Center for Science in the Public Interest to classify aspartame as a substance to be avoided in its Chemical Cuisine Directory.[13] However, the EFSA's press release about the study,[14] published on 5 May 2006, concluded that the increased incidence of lymphomas/leukaemias reported in treated rats was unrelated to aspartame, the kidney tumors found at high doses of aspartame were not relevant to humans, and that based on all available scientific evidence to date, there was no reason to revise the previously established Acceptable Daily Intake levels for aspartame.[15]

Someone with converter or good computer speed to label hematopoiesis image?


This is the case: A. Rad made  a couple of years ago in a vector software, but it could only be exported to raster format, so we couldn't have a vector version. Still, Spacebirdy successfully uploaded an  of it, but hasn't got time to upload the original English vector version. It is fully editable in Inkscape, but it is so large that it slows down my computer (with AMD Athlon 2.6 GHz dual-core processor &amp; Vista) too much to conveniently label it. So, is there anybody with either a &quot;vector png&quot; to svg converter or a faster computer (or a faster svg-editor) that can label this one? Mikael Häggström (talk) 06:47, 7 February 2010 (UTC)
I also have a slow computer, but I thought I could simply edit this 4.3 MB file with an ordinary text editor. But I couldn't locate the text anywhere in the file. It looks as if all letters are being drawn. That also explains why it is so big. I guess it's best to start with the original English file. Hans Adler 09:41, 7 February 2010 (UTC)

I seem to be able to load the unlabelled svg into Inkscape and add labels to it without problem. I'll use the same labels as the &quot;English raster with labels&quot;. Have I missed something, or should this give the result you want? --RexxS (talk) 11:53, 7 February 2010 (UTC)

Uploaded, but with problems.  does not display the notes, and several of the cells render badly. Just checked - cells are also badly rendered on , which I worked from. It all displays perfectly in Inkscape, so there's obviously some incompatibility with the Wikimedia svg handling. I can export perfect png's at any size from Inkscape - a full sized png is only one-tenth the size of the svg, so maybe that's the best option until I can figure out how to make the svg compatible. As an aside, the Icelandic version actually has the label text converted to shapes, so you can't edit those easily. Any thoughts? --RexxS (talk) 16:11, 7 February 2010 (UTC)

To answer my own question:  says that Inkscape needs the following to be modified before upload:
* Lines with arrow heads (the arrows need to be converted)
* Text
* Compound objects created with the binary path tools (union, intersect etc)
 which pretty much covers everything in the diagram we've been working on. It's really dispiriting to find that the mediawiki software is incompatible with the most common free vector graphic tools (Inkscape and Open Office). Until the software can handle SVGs that anyone can edit without huge effort, I'll recommend the retention of PNGs (although the auto-rendering serves a small-filesize, palletted PNG in to a large-filesize, 32-bit colour version - but that's another story). Anyone with Inkscape can download the SVG I uploaded and export an appropriately sized PNG. --RexxS (talk) 15:35, 8 February 2010 (UTC)

Well done! Too bad it isn't rendered perfectly in MediaWiki, but as long as png-versions can be made, then it seems acceptable for now. Mikael Häggström (talk) 16:41, 11 February 2010 (UTC)



This section on the talk page of the Vaccination article was started by an apparent doubter of the efficacy of vaccinations. The editor had been placing tags without any discussion, so I removed the tag with the request that they discuss, and now they have created the section and the matter needs discussion. The request is polite and reasonable. It is odd that the article doesn't provide this proof. To medical personnel this is as fundamental a matter of common knowledge as the fact that the Earth is round, but we can't therefore leave proofs out of that article!

Safety of the blood supply: XMRV

Chronic fatigue syndrome websites have been abuzz following the October 2009 report in Science suggesting xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) as the potential cause of CFS. Recently, this buzz has included statements that the US Department of Health and Human Services is planning to screen the blood supply for XMRV (with the implication that the US government agrees that some form of disease causation has been established). However, causation has not yet been established, the association of the virus (with prostate cancer and with CFS) remains uncertain and the US government has made no statements on the matter. An editor at the XMRV page has [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Xenotropic_murine_leukemia_virus-related_virus#Proposed_addition_to_Xenotropic_murine_leukemia_virus-related_virus.23.2FTransmission proposed] a paragraph on blood safety based upon statements made by a CFS advocacy group and by a doctor in a court transcript. I have opposed this addition as premature (until a government agency makes a statement, preferably reported in the media) and as not satisfying . What's the best way to proceed? Keepcalmandcarryon (talk) 21:30, 13 February 2010 (UTC)

The study has not been replicated, and there is very little evidence that this virus is indeed blood-transmissible. I this the less we go along with this the better, until the time that there is some scientific consensus on the matter. JFW | T@lk 21:37, 13 February 2010 (UTC)

Agree that WP is not a soapbox for extrapolation from a correlative study to regulatory impact.  -- Scray (talk) 22:19, 13 February 2010 (UTC)

Clarification, the proposed material is about prostate cancer and CFS. It does not presuppose a disease causation, studies have now &quot;associated&quot; XMRV with prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome, the committee will investigate the blood safety threat from XMRV.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Xenotropic_murine_leukemia_virus-related_virus#Proposed_addition_to_Xenotropic_murine_leukemia_virus-related_virus.23.2FTransmission] The doctor stateing this is Jerry A. Holmberg, PhD, Senior Advisor for Blood Policy, Executive Secretary of the Advisory Committee on Blood Safety and Availability, U.S. HHS, at a meeting by the HHS Advisory Comittee on Blood Safety And Availability, published by the U.S. HHS, and transcribed by a court reporter.[http://www.hhs.gov/ophs/bloodsafety/advisorycommittee/pastmeetings/transcripts/acbsa20091119.pdf](pgs 22-23)

The CFIDS Association of America's statement adds more detail and presents no conflicting or controversial material.

Again, this is a transcribed statement (read: personal opinion) by an advisor to an advisory committee. No amount of related speculation by advocacy groups or special-interest soapboxing on Wikipedia will make this into a reliable source for our XMRV article. Keepcalmandcarryon (talk) 22:50, 13 February 2010 (UTC)

Sorry, I am confused by this last statement.  Did you actually check the RS before making this statement?  Dr Holmberg is an officer of the HHS and the senior technical advisor for blood policy within the OPHS making this statement on behalf of &quot;his boss, the Assistant Secretary for Health and he is designated as the Blood Safety Officer&quot; and after some more preamble he continued &quot;I have a statement for you. This statement has been coordinated throughout the entire HHS public health services.  Many hours last night -- I have emails on this flying throughout the night, and the majority of us have just got back from the American Association of blood banks meeting in New Orleans where this was a discussion point throughout the meeting. &quot; He then reads the reference [http://www.cfids.org/xmrv/blood-supply-ophs.pdf].

For the avoidance of doubt:
*Keepalmandcarryon: &quot;a doctor&quot;

It is well understood that a source's reliablity is not generic but relative to the statement made. If I read the above correctly, Holmberg's statement on behalf of the group is at best a primary source on the advice the HHC gave to HHS. It would help if you could tell us what is the statement in the source that you seek to use, and how you would use it in the article.  come howl 03:21, 14 February 2010 (UTC)

(outdent) In the verbal preamble which is recorded on the video at the HHS site he does state that &quot;This statement has been coordinated throughout the entire HHS public health services.&quot; [My transcription] and the nature of the audience committee, indicates that this was a veted announcement.

As to HHC vs HHS -- sorry, it was a typo it should have read HHS: he is speaking on behalf of the HHS; that's my point -- I am a Brit and I get confused by your acronyms the way that you do with ours: DWP, NHS, NICE, etc. :) TerryE (talk) 03:37, 14 February 2010 (UTC)

No source is &quot;reliable&quot; for any possible use; no matter how reliable this statement, for example, is about the name of the speaker, it would be worthless for supporting a claim about, say, Chinese astrology.  You've really got to tell us what you want to say here.  That Holmberg issued a press release?  Fine.  That XMRV causes CFS?  Not fine.  Something in between?

Sorry but I gave you my suggested text 2 paras above: &quot;The DHHS OPHS Advisory Committee on Blood Safety and Availability has begun an investigation into potential impacts of the findings reported in this paper.&quot; as I was asked to do.  This is the shorter form.  The longer alternative included a preamble Dr Holmberg of the Advisory Committee on Blood Safety and Availability issued a statement ... though the cited reference would explain all this.  I am not sure why you want me to repeat it a second time. -- TerryE (talk) 05:08, 14 February 2010 (UTC)

Reading Holmberg's words on pages 22-23 of that transcript I don't see very direct support for that statement. He did mention the (then) recent paper in Science on October 9 which identified that XMRV had been found in individuals with CFS. He made that mention in the context of a broader discussion of blood surveillance technology. In that context, he then went on to explain that &quot;the department&quot; (HHS) was &quot;looking at&quot; standardizing the researchers' tests and at applying them to blood repositories as a way to investigate prevalence of XMRV in repository blood. None of that explanation rises beyond a primary statement, even from a very credible individual. You might justify saying something like &quot;The U.S. DHHS OPHS Advisory Committee on Blood Safety and Availability was reported in November 2009 to be planning to investigate just how prevalent XMRV might be in repository blood.&quot;  come howl 07:26, 14 February 2010 (UTC)

Thanks for your feedback.  Yes, we need to reach an agreed consensus on how to reflect an accurate and appropriate length summary of the multiple RS along this sort of discussion.   But this a somewhat different discussion from the original editors position of exclusion on the grounds that the statement given by &quot;some doctor in a court transcript&quot;, when in reality Dr Holmberg is an officer of the HHS who was reading out a prepared statement on the OPHS behalf. -- 12:14, 14 February 2010 (UTC)

What to do with condition subtypes/variants in the list of cutaneous conditions

For any cutaneous condition, there may be (though certainly not always) different subtypes or variants.  Take lichen planus for example, which has many subtypes and variants, or squamous cell carcinoma, which also has multiple subtypes, like mucosal squamous cell carcinoma.

Therefore, for the most complicated cases, you might have something like:

Condition name (Conditions synonym(s))
Condition subtype (Condition subtype synonym(s))
Condition variant (Condition variant synonym(s))

Currently, I have been trying to list the main condition name as well as the specific subtypes/variants, hence squamous cell carcinoma and mucosal squamous cell carcinoma both being in the list of cutaneous conditions.

However, here are some questions I wanted to get the community's opinion on.  Right now, subtypes/variants are simply listed in alphabetical order, independent of the main condition.  For example, mucosal squamous cell carcinoma is not listed under squamous cell carcinoma.  However, should it be?  Should we be indenting subtypes/variants under the main condition?  What are the pros and cons of that?  

Also, going with that, should the various subtypes/variants have their own stub, or be redirected to the main condition article?  In general, I have been making stubs, though there are times when simply a redirect exists, as with mucosal squamous cell carcinoma.  What do you think is best?

Thanks in advance for your comments! ---kilbad (talk) 04:55, 15 February 2010 (UTC)

* My inclination is to merge subtypes and variants, especially if the separated articles would contain relatively little unique information, or would be stubs.  It's often quite useful for the reader to be able to compare and contrast closely related conditions.  If the articles grow significantly, they can always be split later.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 21:15, 16 February 2010 (UTC)

*Ok, and what are your thoughts about how the different condition variants/subtypes should be listed in the list? ---kilbad (talk) 00:41, 17 February 2010 (UTC)
* I may have misunderstood, but it seems to make sense to me that subtypes should be listed alphabetically under the main condition, i.e.
Condition  name
Condition subtype A
Condition subtype B
*Whereas, variants should be listed separately and alphabetically in the list. Just my opinion. Regards, --—Cyclonenim | Chat  14:47, 17 February 2010 (UTC)

I don't think that it really matters.  There are advantages and disadvantages to both structures.  I'd pick whichever appeals most to you, and not worry about it.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 01:51, 18 February 2010 (UTC)

One more thought:  When you create redirects for non-synonyms that could, plausibly, have a good article someday, then adding the  template might be helpful and appropriate.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 02:31, 18 February 2010 (UTC)

I wouldn't necessarily say it's &quot;wrong&quot;; but most of it is unverifiable because of the poor sources used. To search edit summaries, your best bet is to ask the question of someone who has toolserver access who could probably run that sort of query for you.

Differential diagnosis in the disease box?

Should we link to a site that gives an exhaustive differential in the disease box / symptom box?  DiagnosisPro looks like a good candidate?Doc James (talk ·  · ) 08:40, 8 February 2010 (UTC)

I'm not sure what encyclopedic value we'd be providing here.  An unranked list of the 175 (only?) known causes of neutropenia (where, BTW, a series of merge discussions would benefit from more eyes) doesn't tell the generalist/reader much more than &quot;well, it could be caused by lots of things,&quot; which is pretty much what the article says. 
I don't feel strongly about this, but my initial inclination is 'against'.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 22:38, 8 February 2010 (UTC)

If you look at the artile Testicle pain we list 6 causes well this site lists another 30 [http://en.diagnosispro.com/differential_diagnosis-for/testicular-pain/24350-154.html].  They by the way do link to us at the bottom of their page and we are listed first.
I do not think we should list all possible causes on Wikipedia of either the differential of a symptom of a disease.

Not really. Google Health is mostly about helping you collect, store, manage, and share your medical records and health information. There is a search box at the top of every page in Google Health, and if you enter a search query there, you go to the Google.com search results page that you are used to. There is also useful health information built into Google Health, but Google Health is not a new health-specific search engine.

Notability of a medical professional

It was dePRODed, rewritten somewhat, and two of Dr. Rasgon's papers were added (he is 1st author on a paper cited 50 or so times, and 5th author on a paper cited 150 or so times).

Becoming very difficult. We've had the &quot;professor test&quot;, but I can name numerous professors (especially in the USA, where large numbers of clinicians hold assistant professorships) who have no claim to fame while people relatively low in the hierarchy may have made significant contributions in some way or another. In the case of Dr Rasgon, the article does not indicate why he would stand out from any other clinician in this position, and I have taken the liberty of putting the article up for AFD.

Injectable anticonvulsant agents should be readily available.  Sickle cell anemia: In in vitro studies, deoxygenated sickle erythrocytes align perpendicular to a magnetic field; the enhancement of magnetic moment by contrast agents may potentiate this alignment possibly resulting in vaso-occlusive complications in vivo.

At the risk of answering what sounds like a request for medical advice, I will say that those of us who sometimes investigate these disorders in children do not consider a possible diagnosis of a mitochondrial disorder a contraindication to an MRI. Because so many of them initially present with vague and nonspecific developmental and/or neuromuscular complaints, I suspect the majority of people with these disorders have had MRIs. alteripse (talk) 01:23, 3 March 2010 (UTC)

Craniosacral therapy

The article regarding the pseudoscientific practice of craniosacral therapy needs attention. Take this one example:

* Cranial textbooks propose that motion of the skull is possible during flexion and extension because the sutures are mobile. The sphenobasilar synchondrosis (SBS) - the junction between the base of the sphenoid and the occiput- is thought to fuse by the mid- to late twenties, but still retain limited mobility . An alternative theory to SBS Motion taught in craniosacral training suggests that sutures are &quot;lines of folding&quot;, like pre-folded marks on cardboard, rather than necessarily being fully open. 

 

This uses a dubious source admittedly &quot;Self-published online, September 2005. http://www.hummingbird-one.co.uk/pdf/sbs_simplified.pdf&quot;

I think the whole article needs to be checked for violations of MEDRS. -- Brangifer (talk) 18:51, 7 March 2010 (UTC)

Paleolithic Diet deserves more attention

I find the Healthy diet article to be extremely biased in that it only lists recommendations from the World Health Organization and nothing else.  I tried to add a section about the Paleolithic diet but my edits were reverted by a vandal.  Evolutionary medicine is credible and should be given more attention than it currently is.

Outside eyes: 

I would appreciate any outside input at . I have some concerns about edits which one user is repeatedly reinserting. In particular, I believe that the article makes fundamentally erroneous statements about the causes of sudden infant death syndrome. I'd prefer not to get into a two-person back-and-forth, and I may be off-base, so any outside input would be helpful. MastCell Talk 00:36, 9 March 2010 (UTC)
I have not &quot;repeatedly reinserted&quot; anything. I made one large edit which added some balance to what was at best a flawed article and, while MastCell stated that he objected to one sentence I had put in, he had reverted my entire edit including an entire section saying that it was an &quot;apologia&quot; as the edit description. I reverted his revert and simultaneously revised the statement he objected to, which is not essential to the edit and if he objected to it, all he had to do was take it out. I'm not sure why he didn't do so rather than go to multiple pages on Wikipedia making misleading claims about my edit.--Gloriamarie (talk) 01:56, 9 March 2010 (UTC)

Gloria, your changes to that article today (e.g., [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Medical_Hypotheses&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=348591053&amp;oldid=339780977][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Medical_Hypotheses&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=348621665&amp;oldid=348591860][http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Medical_Hypotheses&amp;diff=348631475&amp;oldid=348624662]) certainly exceed my own definition of &quot;one edit&quot;, large or otherwise, but please don't be insulted by editors' requests for help, especially since MastCell explicitly said that his initial view might not be correct.  
You seem to be making progress on the talk page, and are identifying some of the errors in your original work.  Please try taking  over the next few days to put the best information back in the article, with plenty of time for other people to double-check things.  If you're persistent, you'll get it done in the end. WhatamIdoing (talk) 02:41, 9 March 2010 (UTC)
 Hi, WhatamIdoing, thanks for the encouragement. The first edit you link to was just pretty basic and was not what MastCell was talking about when he said I was &quot;repeatedly reinserting&quot; information and the second two were the &quot;one large edit&quot; I was referring to in my original comment, between which MastCell reverted it. It could be accurately stated that I reinserted information, but not that I &quot;repeatedly reinserted.&quot; I'm also puzzled why no one who objected to the sentence just didn't take it out rather than reverting the entire edit (I took the sentence out myself) since my edit on the whole improved the entry a great deal. This is the oddest situation I've ever encountered in all my Wikipedia editing. There was only the one honestly made error, and I corrected a few errors by omission (i.e., what occurred with Medical Hypotheses between its founding and 2009?) in my edit. Cheers, Gloria --Gloriamarie (talk) 04:35, 9 March 2010 (UTC)

Liver cancer

I noticed that the Liver cancer article appears to have information on both Benign and Malignant Hepatic tumors, which I feel is incorrect, as the inclusion of the word &quot;cancer&quot; into the articles title suggests that only malignant hepatic tumors should be discussed in the article. I feel the text on benign hepatic tumors should be removed from that article. However, we need to discuss the benign liver tumors (such as the Hemangiomas, nodular regeneritive hyperplasia, and hepatic adenomas) somewhere on Wikipedia, I suggest the creation of a new article on benign liver tumors. Best wishes. Immunize (talk) 14:30, 13 March 2010 (UTC)

 Yea definitely that should be removed, and there is this redirect Liver tumor, which redirect to liver cancer, which is a misconception too, I believe that the style of liver cancer article should be moved to liver tumor, or liver tumors, and by that I mean we should consider creating an article that talks about benign and malignant liver cancer, which should link to the liver cancer article as the malignant variant of liver tumors, what do you think??  15:03, 13 March 2010 (UTC)

I have removed the section on benign liver tumors on the article in question, but the problem remains that we need some article to cover these benign hepatic tumors. Looking at the histroy of the redirect Liver tumor, it appears that  redirected the page to liver cancer on February 17, 2010. What should the next step for this article be? Immunize (talk) 15:13, 13 March 2010 (UTC)

Actually, I see that another user has already resotored the lost content on the page Liver cancer and added it into the page Liver tumor, and has added the information on benign lesions back into the Liver tumor article. Immunize (talk) 15:46, 13 March 2010 (UTC)

I've done my best to untangle the two pages, so that Liver cancer now discusses just the cancer, and Liver tumor gives an overview of both benign and malignant tumors. The cancer article has a See also link to the tumor article, and the the Malignant section of the tumor article has a  template pointing to the cancer article.

Disagree.  states &quot;Use the singular form: Article titles are generally singular in form, e.g. Horse  not Horses. Exceptions include nouns that are always in a plural form in English (e.g. scissors  or trousers) and the names of classes of objects (e.g. Arabic numerals or Bantu languages).&quot; You can make the case that liver tumours constitute a class of tumours, but its primary use is the object, &quot;a liver tumour&quot;, which exists in the singular and should be the article title. --RexxS (talk) 20:45, 13 March 2010 (UTC)

Pedantically, clinical research should be a (large) subset of medical research, but I'm not sure how strongly the distinction is made now. I suppose that, considering the interest drug companies are showing in traditional medicine, you might consider as an example that research done on alternative plant remedies is &quot;medical&quot;, but not &quot;clinical&quot; research.

I don't think that such images are appropriate for an encyclopaedia for general readers (both because black squares for eyes produces a shocking photo and because the black squares were clearly added for a reason, and that reason is privacy even if it is ineffective).

Colin°Talk 11:55, 19 March 2010 (UTC)

Agree with the concerns regarding consent.  Blacking out the eye in my opinion makes for a poor image.  When a medical practitioner comes out with a camera however consent is usually either obtained in writing or verbally.  So I assume consent was given.  Just check with the person who is donating the images.Doc James (talk ·  · ) 12:18, 19 March 2010 (UTC)

See [http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/insrv/graphicsandmedia/advice/clinicalphotography.html these guidelines on Clinical Photography Consent]. Note that they regard all images as identifiable, not just those of the face, etc. The maximum consent level is &quot;for the images to be used in a medical publication&quot;. This is not a medical publication, and images appearing here or on Commons could be reproduced anywhere, including for example, a site making fun of people or those that find extreme illness to be a form of entertainment. Colin°Talk 12:24, 19 March 2010 (UTC)

 Is this concern regarding all patient images on Wikipedia or these in particular??, I agree with Doc James, since any physician will take permission before taking any picture, and we can confirm that with Dr.Thomas Habif, who so a well know author of many books as you can see [http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=sr_adv_b/?search-alias=stripbooks&amp;unfiltered=1&amp;field-keywords=&amp;field-author=Thomas+Habif&amp;field-title=&amp;field-isbn=&amp;field-publisher=&amp;node=&amp;field-p_n_condition-type=&amp;field-feature_browse-bin=&amp;field-binding_browse-bin=&amp;field-subject=&amp;field-language=&amp;field-dateop=&amp;field-datemod=&amp;field-dateyear=&amp;sort=relevancerank&amp;Adv-Srch-Books-Submit.x=57&amp;Adv-Srch-Books-Submit.y=9 here]. And we can add the personality rights tag to those pictures which can restrict the use of the images, for example check this [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Jaundice.jpg image]  12:40, 19 March 2010 (UTC)

 Hi, responding to Colin's request for input.  Congratulations on negotiating this generous donation!  Please work out any details regarding permissions/screening.  When you're ready for upload let me know; I'll put you in touch with the people who do bot uploading.  Best regards, Durova412 20:33, 19 March 2010 (UTC)

 Thank you, and we ll let you know  20:42, 19 March 2010 (UTC)

I am very excited at the prospect of adding many of these images to Wikipedia, and I think they will be a valuable addition for our general readers.  However, I do have a few follow-up questions/comments.  First, with regard to permissions, I would still like to see a correspondence from someone from [http://www.dermnet.com/ dermnet.com], Dr. Habif or whoever, expressly stating that we can use any/all the photos under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license.  I have e-mailed support@dermnet.com twice, and have yet to hear back myself on the issue.  Maybe someone else can try contacting them as well?  Also, perhaps someone at OTRS should be activity involved with this donation to make sure we are doing everything appropriately/legally. Second, with regard to patient consent, what it our actual Wikipedia policy/consensus on this matter?  This issue has never been clear to me.  Does a patient's &quot;consent to be photographed&quot; have to be indicated somewhere on the Wikipedia/Commons file page?  If so, is there a specific form we should be using with he patient?  What does/will this mean for photos in which that information is not provided?  Finally, dovetailing off that, what is our Wikipedia policy/consensus regarding identifiable aspects of medical images?  Many of us have uploaded images from different sources (ourselves, the CDC, etc), all with different degrees of identifiableness (examples , , , , , ).  Sometimes we use a censoring black box, sometimes we do not.  Sometimes we include the face, other times we do not.  I suggest, if there is no clear consensus on this latter issue, perhaps (once we get proper permission) we could still copy all the photos over to Wikipedia, and then edit/delete photos over time as consensus develops?  Alright, just a few thoughts. ---kilbad (talk) 04:02, 20 March 2010 (UTC)
I've posted to the Commons OTRS noticeboard regarding this discussion. Durova412 15:32, 20 March 2010 (UTC)

Radiopaedia

Hi, I have contacted [http://radiopaedia.org/users/frank Dr.Frank Gaillard] who is the CEO of the [http://radiopaedia.org/ Radiopaedia] site, and asked him to give me permission to upload images from radiopedia, he accepted that, and volunteered to upload them him self, but the I found  his  on commons and found , then I asked him if we could upload images under this license, he accepted this offer but had some requests that should be done whenever we upload a picture from his site:
*First of all this permission is only valid for cases and images uploaded by Dr.Frank Gaillard, which are currently 1552 case and can be found [http://radiopaedia.org/users/frank/cases here]
*Second request was that whenever we upload an image we should inform Dr.Frank Gaillard by e-mail about that picture
*Third request was that we should add the categories  and  to the uploaded images
*Fourth, images uploaded should be tagged with this 
*And finally each image should state in its description tag the URL of the original case and image from [http://radiopaedia.org/ Radiopaedia], and as an example Dr.frank told me that images should look like this [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:MesotheliomaCT.jpg file]

So we need a list for images uploaded by Dr.Frank to radiopedia that we need here at wikipedia, so that we inform him, and then upload those images, any one wants to help with that?? [http://radiopaedia.org/users/frank/cases here is the full listing of cases uploaded by Dr.Frank]  17:25, 19 March 2010 (UTC)
 Here is the first , I first informed Dr.Frank about the upload, then did the upload and sent him a link to the uploaded image at commons by e-mail  17:43, 19 March 2010 (UTC)

I think you should discuss these issues with the image and legal experts at Commons. You are talking about enough images that it is worth their legal bods to have a look. Colin°Talk 20:24, 19 March 2010 (UTC)

 What issues?? we Already got the permission and that permission was already reviewed and confirmed as you can see in the OTRS information in the license tag   20:39, 19 March 2010 (UTC)

Well there's the requests that he makes: are they reasonable? Probably but I don't really know Commons rules. I'm more concerned about the photos than the radiographic images. Although the copyright issue might be straightforward, the ethical/legal issues surrounding the subjects and their identification and publication on Wikipedia is less so. You're talking thousands of images. That's class-action territory if it goes pear-shaped. IMO, if I'd signed one of those consent forms I linked above, that consented to &quot;Medical publication&quot; usage, I'd be fuming if my pic appeared on the home page of Wikipedia in front of 8 million people and then copied to every leaching website in the world. I'd be taking legal advice. Colin°Talk 21:30, 19 March 2010 (UTC)

 First his requests are reasonable, and we do them by routine, except for notifying him about the uploaded images, and I ll volunteer to do that whenever any images are uploaded, and about the other concerns, the [http://radiopaedia.org/ Radiopaedia] site does not contain any patient images, they are all CTs, MRIs, X-rays, and Ultrasounds. So I believe there is no reason to have any concerns about patient's privacy since no images have name labels.  11:42, 20 March 2010 (UTC)

I ask this for my own education, but it seems that &quot;syphilide&quot; originated in French literature.  Therefore, for sake of the argument, let's say that originally it was a French term.  However, eventually it was &quot;imported&quot; into English derm literature.  So my question is this: after a word is &quot;imported&quot; from another language, at what point is a word considered &quot;English&quot; terminology? ---kilbad (talk) 16:09, 20 March 2010 (UTC)

I would say as soon as it is used without a qualifier/translation/explanation in an English text. It's would be the same for any word that gets acquired by the English language, which is great vacuum cleaner of other people's words, sucking them in without fear.  --Slp1 (talk) 16:21, 20 March 2010 (UTC)

That seems like a great way of looking at the issue.  I added this footnote after sources repeated mentioned that those were not English terms, but rather specified them to be from another language, despite their use in English medical literature. ---kilbad (talk) 16:27, 20 March 2010 (UTC)
The ultimate source for such stuff would be OED. However, wikitionary can be informative, can be linked to, even if care must be taken when citing. Rich Farmbrough, 15:40, 24 March 2010 (UTC).
I'm not an authority, but my guess, from having seen numerous forms of French words wrt to their English counterparts, is that it has much to do with helping pronunciation - the French language has stricter rules and fewer exceptions on how words are spelt dictate their pronunciation.

Patient images: consent issues

The above very-welcome opportunities raise the issue of consent by the subject of the photo to appear on Wikipedia. It is one thing for the copyright owner to willingly donate images to Wikipedia or to Commons, but permission is still required from any identifiable subject. Have a look at our Model release article and the [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Patient_images Patient images] essay on Commons (see also the talk page: I feel this essay is inadequate and will probably comment over there). Look also at [http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/insrv/graphicsandmedia/advice/clinicalphotography.html], [http://www.rlbuht.nhs.uk/Library/document_downloads/for_patients/Consent___PFF_944_Consent_to_Clinical_Photography_or_Video_Recording.pdf], [http://www.acmg.net/resources/policies/pol-020.pdf], [http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/330/7497/916] which are just a few of the Google results for &quot;clinical photography consent]. Here's some findings:
*&quot;In accordance with guidelines for the Welsh Assembly Government and the General Medical Council, the notion of whether a patient can be identified has been dispensed with. All patients should be considered as identifiable from any of their photographs.&quot; This appears to be the position of all medical journals. This includes pictures of someone's infected toe
*Typical hospital consent forms in the UK have levels of consent that range from ones own medical records to &quot;medical publication&quot;. They do not extend to publishing on Commons, which is effectively a &quot;do what you like with it&quot; permission.
*Blanking out a patient's eyes is ineffective as a privacy measure and went out with the dark ages.
*The legal liability lies with the publisher, not the photographer (though the photographer is usually the one that gets the form signed, because that's convenient). I'm not clear whether the publisher is the uploader or Wikipedia itself or both.

I think, especially given the volume of images involved, we should take legal advice from Wikipedia's legal team. Colin°Talk 12:37, 20 March 2010 (UTC)

I have emailed Mike Godwin. Colin°Talk 13:44, 20 March 2010 (UTC)
We have a model release, just like what we do for pornographic images. Just send the permission to OTRS and that takes care of everything. (Plus, in all seriousness, how can you identify someone if it is just a picture of their toe?)  (Return Fire) 14:44, 20 March 2010 (UTC)

Yes, the &quot;toe&quot; is an extreme example but I've literally repeated what the BMJ says. I guess they find that deciding what is &quot;identifiable&quot; or not is very hard and if they don't have the resources to do it then we certainly don't -- so we're left with a &quot;assume any patient photo is identifiable&quot; safety position.

IANAL but it seems to me if the subject can not be reasonably identified from the photo and the owner releases it to a free license, there should be no problem. Besides look at all the pics of identifiable living people on Commons, just but the &quot;Personality rights&quot; tag on the photo if they are identifiable. — Rlevse • Talk •  15:49, 20 March 2010 (UTC)

I would imaging that we all agree that the medicine project should have a page somewhere discussing the use of medical photography.  Perhaps we could create a page analogous to the , but for images?

 I would say that patient images where the patient is reasonably identifiable and would require a model release. I wouldn't worry about it, though:
* If the patient is not reasonably identifiable.
* If the image is before some date (I'd suggest 1900).
* Possibly if the image is already published (e.g. in a medical book, magazine, etc.)
 Jmabel | Talk 16:32, 20 March 2010 (UTC)

I would encourage folk to read the above linked sources and add any more they find, rather than just guess. Even if we don't take the &quot;assume everything is identifiable&quot; approach, I would say all images that include even part of someone's face should be regarded as identifiable and we accept the widespread view that black boxes over the eyes do not help. But further, I don't think the permission to appear in a medical publication is sufficient for Commons. Medical pictures are different from everyday pictures. They say something negative about the person, which is akin to  issues. Colin°Talk 16:43, 20 March 2010 (UTC)

An alternative to black boxing is to selectively blur identifiable features.  It takes less than two minutes on any reasonably powerful image editing program. GIMP can do it and GIMP is free.  The only challenging part is that images would need to be reviewed and edited one by one.  

So how does this solution sound?  Form two teams of editors: one to review and one to edit.  Divide up the review tasks so that reviewers don't duplicate each other.  Designate a separate group of editors to do the privacy edits.  I'll train the second group (if you know how to crop a family portrait you can learn this easily).  

Designate a space for reviewers to indicate which images need editing, for image editors to indicate when the editing is done, and for editors to note when a group of images is fully reviewed and ready for batch upload.  (This setup would be organized like the copyright infringement reviews).  Edited images would be uploaded manually.  Sounds workable? Durova412 17:03, 20 March 2010 (UTC)

I think This is a great idea, and a doable one too, we should start working on that  17:31, 20 March 2010 (UTC)
The sheer variety of images mean that on some categories, we could simply not upload any images remotely identifiable and make do with other body parts.

How would you handle [http://www.dermnet.com/Acne-Scar/picture/4833 Acne Scar], [http://www.dermnet.com/Eczema-Face/picture/307 Eczema Face], [http://www.dermnet.com/Tuberous-Sclerosis/picture/23739 Tuberous sclerosis face], [http://www.dermnet.com/Tuberous-Sclerosis/picture/23770 Tuberous sclerosis face2], [http://www.dermnet.com/Neurofibromatosis/picture/23547 Neurofibromatosis face]? This image [http://www.dermnet.com/Neurofibromatosis/picture/23516 Neurofibromatosis (Not safe for work)] doesn't include much of the face but might be recognisable to someone familiar with the brown patch under her arm.

Colin, here's a quick set of edits on four of the five images you linked.[http://www.flickr.com/photos/durova/]  It may be fair to set up the review system so that we bypass potentially sensitive images in situations where nonsensitive substitutes exist.  Otherwise we could increase the size of black boxing, plus implement selective blurs and crops to minimize identifiability.  Sounds fair? Durova412 18:23, 20 March 2010 (UTC)
In all the stuff I've read today, simply making the black boxes bigger wasn't suggested. In all those pictures you've edited, if I knew the person, I'd recognise them. Let's say that's your English teacher who has a distinctive brown mark on her face. Now you've learned that she has an incurable genetic disease that causes other, perhaps personal, problems. Her employer might worry that her illness could get worse, leading to time off or insurance issues. On another angle, I find the last of the tuberous sclerosis images I linked (which you haven't edited yet) to be simply shocking. The pimples on the face are the least of the problems with that picture. I experimented with white boxes rather than black and it was much improved. But basicaly, such blanked pictures are poor aesthetically and IMO not appropriate for an encyclopeadia for general readers. I appreciate that's getting into personal opinion territory, but I don't see anyone putting one of them on the MainPage any time soon? Wrt the picture editing project, I think we should wait for advice on where the &quot;identifiable&quot; threshold is set. Colin°Talk 19:32, 20 March 2010 (UTC)
Colin, your points are well taken.  Further advice is not likely to be forthcoming (the featured picture program had a rather difficult discussion on a candidacy of a childbirth a while back).  The best way forward is to identify which images are potentially problematic and deal with them one by one until we reach consensus.  If we at least segregate those from the others, we can move forward with the majority/uncontroversial images. Durova412 19:43, 20 March 2010 (UTC)

Added links to that and the Commons guideline at the review page. Durova412 19:46, 20 March 2010 (UTC)

I think we need be really clear, that uploading of medical images involves 2 issues:
# The trivial one (for now) is of copyright and our right to upload/transfer images. Of course normal rules over copyright and permissions to release under free licence apply just as for any WP Commons image, and if we have permission of Radiopedia or DermNet copyright holders to upload, then fine. 
# The tough issue here is of patient confidentially. Confidentiality is not gained by attempts at anonymity with black bars across eyes, or a decision that an image is not identifiable for being say just an X-ray film (if BMJ and leading medical journals take this opinion then we should be wary of making our own decisions that radiographs or photos not showing faces must be OK). Past discussions include , and  kindly did a literature search to be found at . Per , what counts is the model's consent... so if likes of DermNet/Radiopedia can confirm that images obtained were with patient consent for 'any' redistribution (vs. not just use in the one source or for medical education alone -and Wikipedia is not the closed doors of medical education), then this requirement seems met... I would though for such a large upload, suggest seeking clarification of Wiki Foundation legal advice - so Colin, please let us know when you hear back from Mike Godwin :-)  David Ruben  Talk  20:22, 20 March 2010 (UTC)
Thanks David. So if we do get the level of consent we require (any purpose) then we don't need to bother with fiddling with the pictures other than for our own needs (e.g. better composition). Colin°Talk 20:33, 20 March 2010 (UTC)
Actually  is an essay, not a policy or guideline, and medical images have been promoted to featured picture without explicit patient consent.  Perhaps the best solution is to wait for Mike Godwin's response before proceeding. Durova412 20:53, 20 March 2010 (UTC)
 Any news from Mr. Mike Godwin ??  20:06, 21 March 2010 (UTC)
I'll let you know. I'm sure he's a busy man and it has been the weekend. It may help if you him an email too, giving some idea of the scale of the donation and therefore the importance to Wikipedia of getting hold of such valuable pictures but also of getting it right legally and ethically. Point him at this Wiki page. Colin°Talk 22:27, 21 March 2010 (UTC)
 Any thing yet?? how long should we wait?? Should we consult someone else?? :-)  10:04, 25 March 2010 (UTC)
I think there are two separate issues with Patient images: (1) legal issues, and (2) ethical issues.
#For the legal issues, we should ask Mike Godwin for a final verdict: who owns the images, who's legally responsible for publishing them?
#For the ethical issues, I think each uploader should follow their own ethical code (but it's obvious that we shouldn't allow identifiable images taken without the patient's consent).
I too can make guesses but like Collin points out, we need (legal) facts rather than opinions. --Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 21:22, 22 March 2010 (UTC)


About the assumption that all images are identifiable:
This, IMO, is driven by a principle of least astonishment rather than a real risk to privacy.  Imagine the patient with an unusual skin disease, resulting in a small spot on his arm or leg.  The derm says, &quot;Wow, I haven't seen one of these in my entire career,&quot; and takes a picture.  The patient happens to notice, some time later, that the doc has published a paper on the rare disease.
Given the patient's personal knowledge, including (importantly) his personal knowledge that the physician was unlikely to have another source for the image, he could logically conclude that the image shows his leg.  However, nobody else could possibly look at a little spot from an apparently random paper and say, &quot;Hey, I'll bet that this bit of skin is my neighbor's/co-worker's/friend's.&quot;
IMO the image I show here is unidentifiable, and it should not require a model release.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 22:34, 22 March 2010 (UTC)

Therefore, my question: does this suffice for copyright holder permission to use all images on dermnet?  If so, can we get a general OTRS ticket number to use with all these images? ---kilbad (talk) 17:47, 23 March 2010 (UTC)

 I think its enough, We have a license made in the form of the standard OTRS form, what do we need more??   10:04, 25 March 2010 (UTC)

We still have the outstanding issues of patient consent, the degree to which Wikipedia considers an image to be &quot;identifiable&quot;, and who exactly the &quot;publisher&quot; is. It might help if Thomas Habif gave us a copy of the consent form he's (presumably) used for his own publication of the images. From what I've read, publication of identifiable patient images without consent could leave the publisher liable to criminal prosecution in addition to any civil damages the patient pursues. As such, I don't think this is a job for the Medicine WikiProject and am disappointed that I've not yet heard back from WPs legal bod. Colin°Talk 10:46, 25 March 2010 (UTC)

 Thank you for the fast replay. I believe that DR.Thomas Habif have consents but we cant ask him for written consents for 23000 images. But I am sure he have consents for publishing those images, since he is a well known publisher and he surly knows everything about consents, and he wont give us license to use these pictures if he didn't had consents. And I ve told him that those pictures will be attributed to him as an author, and will state that his website is the source. So if there was any legal concerns I believe he would not had accepted to release those images. I am disappointed too that its ve been 5 days now since you contacted Mr. godwin. Also for Dr.frank gillard, I ve made it clear previously that he will be attributed as the author on each image. So I think that those authors wont allow us to use their images if they didn't own them, and if they didn't have consents, since they know the legal consequences to that  12:19, 25 March 2010 (UTC)

Editors trying to keep a table which plays down HIV transmission risks

Please comment. See:  Phoenix of9 00:56, 25 March 2010 (UTC)

For &quot;plays down,&quot; read &quot;accurately reports the sources' own numbers&quot; for per-act HIV transmission risks, which seem to surprise people by being pretty low.  One editor may believe that publishing scarier numbers, or at least hiding the accurate ones, might be a good public health move.

Alcoholism up for good article status

I have nominated alcoholism for good article status, anyone who would like to give the article a once over and fix any remaining issues or pass comments or suggestions would be appreciated. A few references need to be put into inline citations which I will hopefully be able to do tomorrow while the article is waiting in the queue, unless someone does it before me. ;-)--Literaturegeek | T@1k? 19:30, 24 March 2010 (UTC)
I went through and fixed some things that popped out at me, but there were a few other things I noticed. 
*In Effects of long term alcohol misuse, the sentence &quot;Approximately 18 percent of alcoholics commit suicide&quot; really surprised me. It seemed to pop right out of the middle of nowhere, and there was no further discussion of it. Maybe a little bit more context would be good?
*I found the sentence &quot;The age at which licit drugs of abuse such as alcohol can be purchased as well as banning or restricting advertising of alcohol has been recommended.&quot; in the Prevention section, and I'm not really sure what it's supposed to say.
*I think the section on Risk factors might be giving  to the age of onset of alcohol use. A few paragraphs are spent on that, when all of the others are just glazed over.
*The way that percentages are written throughout the article should probably be standardized. I saw &quot;1 in 4,&quot; &quot;25%,&quot; &quot;25 percent,&quot; &quot;twenty-five per cent,&quot; and a few other variations while I was reading the article. 
Best of luck at GA. Annalise (talk) 23:17, 24 March 2010 (UTC)

Thanks for the indepth review. :) Good suggestions, I am a bit too tired tonight to work on it but hopefully tomorrow I will get around to addressing those issues in the article. Believe it or not the article a while back was sourced to 25 percent commit suicide but it was disputed so I did more research and found secondary sources claiming 10 percent and others claiming 18 percent or 25 percent, so I chose the middle one, 18 percent. The suicide rate is quite high in sedative-hypnotic abusers, similar to the rates seen in schizophrenia and major depression. I am not sure what context you are looking for? Perhaps, why there is a high suicide rate, eg alcohol abuse both causing mental illness and worsening underlying conditions, social isolation, family loss, job loss etc or the different views on the level of suicide in alcoholics is the context you are thinking of? I agree that there is undue weight to age of onset of use and that there needs to be standardisation in the article and shall fix the poorly worded sentence.--Literaturegeek | T@1k? 23:51, 24 March 2010 (UTC)

That's brilliant! I encountered the alcohol health articles a while ago and got frustrated at that they seemed to be biased pro-alcohol.. I guess there's a lot of money and time in that industry to sway facts towards less negative - but to set the record straight by coming at it from the bottom up is a good idea! I have made a few suggestions ( by applying them ) and will see if I can fit some more time in amongst other stuff. My other thoughts are to stick as closely to our MOS as per other diseases as possible ought to help, ( I wonder if there is an ICD code for example?) Have worn my eyes out for today too! -- (talk •  01:06, 25 March 2010 (UTC)
Thanks Lee, yea they used to be terribly biased; the guy who did it, a sociologist who works for the alcohol industry, was banned indefinitely for sockpuppeteering and seems to have moved on. The long-term effects of alcohol article was the worst, but is in much better shape now; it is frustratinging to see facts being distorted to harmful misinformation. Thanks for your helpful edits and suggestions. I found an ICD9 code but I am not entirely sure that it is correct, needs someone to check it.--Literaturegeek | T@1k? 23:12, 26 March 2010 (UTC)

Should health-related articles be held to a higher standard, like ?

Forgive me if this has already been canvassed here (and Wales' talk page may not be the most appropriate forum) but may I draw your attention to this suggestion? Anthony (talk) 09:55, 25 March 2010 (UTC) To be clear: I have no interest in the above discussion re HIV infection rates. On the face of it, this question about higher standards, if it hasn't already been dealt with, deserves consideration on its own merits. Anthony (talk) 10:29, 25 March 2010 (UTC)
Medically-related articles already benefit from  and . I've commented on how we can raise standards at Jimbo's talk page, but I disagree that standards can be raised by fiat. --RexxS (talk) 16:57, 25 March 2010 (UTC)
Having worked on medical articles at FAC and FAR, I feel they are generally analysed more rigorously than non-medical articles I have worked on. Casliber (talk · ) 19:30, 25 March 2010 (UTC)
I agree with Casliber in the fact that editors are already aware of the problems (and this page plays an essential role). So the question isn't should medical articles be held to a higher standard than articles about #random-subject – they already are and many editors (with more qualifications in the subject than I have) are working to keep it that way. Physchim62 (talk) 19:42, 25 March 2010 (UTC)

 In my opinion: no. Axl ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 19:42, 25 March 2010 (UTC)

I'll c&amp;p this part:
Ah-huh. Incorrect information about risks of HIV transmission (when researchers sound alarm about HIV complacency [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11366820]) is comparable to large animals and carpentry. Very smart comparison there...
RexxS, we can ignore 3RR in BLP articles if there is an inaccuracy. Maybe we can have the same thing for health related articles. Phoenix of9 19:44, 25 March 2010 (UTC)

My responses here are the same as I made on Jimbo's page:
*We should be striving to raise the standard of all Wikipedia articles, and medically-related articles are no exception. Raising a standard requires effort from many contributors and we are fortunate that BLP attracts sufficient input to allow us to set extra criteria for the content. To try to prioritise improvements from the point of view of consequences of misuse of information is to look at it from the wrong end. Volunteer contributors will each make their own decisions about where they contribute, and the only way to raise the standard of articles is to get people interested in them. In fact, medically-related articles already benefit from the remarkably active WikiProject Medicine ... I would also remind you of the very high standard of sourcing required for medical articles, as outlined in , and the additional criteria for content and style as documented at . That these exist is already proof of the willingness of Wikipedians to strive to improve our coverage of medicine.
*All of us would be better off if we stick to 1RR – if something is wrong with an article, BLP or medical, you can find lots of other people at the WikiProjects who are willing to help you combat obvious vandalism and libel.  and  can deal with more contentious cases. There's really no need to get anywhere near 3R other than when combating a persistent vandal, and  is the best solution for that. --RexxS (talk) 22:06, 25 March 2010 (UTC)

I had in mind the outright banning of primary sources from medical articles. I cannot imagine a circumstance when it would be okay for an article to present evidence supported only by primary sources. And if they were banned  type of time-wasting would be avoided, and there would be no opening for . Anthony (talk) 20:11, 25 March 2010 (UTC)

The existing guidelines on OR are pretty clear. WP:MEDRS and WP:MOSMED are good too. I'm against banning any type of verified reliable source based on any arbitrary criteria like primary/secondary. Most articles that present research have an introduction and discussion section that are essentially secondary source information. Maybe Anthony could give some examples of what kind of source is unacceptable?

On the other hand, BLP has a policy of removing contentious unsourced information that I think should also be used for medical articles due to liability purposes. - Stillwaterising (talk) 21:05, 25 March 2010 (UTC)

I think you'll find it's a bit more complicated than that.  
Using primary sources is appropriate in some cases.  Primary sources can provide details (what's interesting to our readers is not always what's interesting to a professional audience), show diversity of opinions on disputed points, and provide useful examples.  We may not have much choice in some cases:  For rare conditions, the overwhelming majority of high-quality sources may be primary sources.  There are thousands of rare diseases, which means (eventually) thousands of articles about rare diseases.  Our readers are not best served by banning as much as 90% of what's been published about exceedingly rare diseases like ODDD (243 cases reported, worldwide, ever).
Also, while inappropriate recentism is deplorable, the academic press is slow.  New information that's getting an enormous amount of media attention shouldn't be suppressed for a year while we wait for someone to write a proper a review paper.  We're usually better off citing peer-reviewed medical sources, even if they're primary sources, than relying on newspaper articles about them, even if the newspaper article is a secondary source. 
There are, in short, good reasons to use primary sources -- with due care, and in strict moderation -- and our articles would frequently be worse if we issued a one-size-fits-all blanket ban on primary sources.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 21:10, 25 March 2010 (UTC)
Standards will not be raised by taking any kind of decision here, standards will only be as high as our work. There are thousands of poorly written med articles, and the solution is not to say that they should be better; but to improve them.--Garrondo (talk) 22:03, 25 March 2010 (UTC)
I agree, Stillwaterising, that the introductions in some primary research papers provide useful independent summaries of a field, and have no problem seeing them used in an article, but the paper's results, and the author's interpretation of them should wait for an independent review. As for examples of sources I find unacceptable, pick anything that's not a peer-reviewed independent summary, a systematic review or a recent university-level textbook. I don't trust myself, let alone you, to cherry pick primary research. (No reflection on you, by the way. I have no idea who you are, but that's the point.)  And I like the idea of erasing all poorly sourced assertions in medical articles. But it looks like I'm alone here, so I bow to the wisdom of the majority. Anthony (talk) 23:51, 25 March 2010 (UTC)

I think that we all agree that articles should ideally be based primarily on secondary sources of exactly the kind you name, and that secondary sources should be relied upon whenever possible (which, for common conditions like hypertension, is &quot;always&quot;).  It's just that primary sources have their place, too (e.g., filling in a minor detail).  WhatamIdoing (talk) 19:18, 26 March 2010 (UTC)

Where Do I Find Free Access to Publications?

Does anybody know how to get free access to research articles through ScienceDirect or other services?

Thanks for the tip Anthony, do you have a link? Free sources are preferred of course, however I can't count the number of times this week I've ran into an article I really needed that had a hefty price tag.
