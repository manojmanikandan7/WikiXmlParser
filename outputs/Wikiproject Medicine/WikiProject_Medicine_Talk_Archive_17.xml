I think the article should be tagged for this project. The lede seems POV in that these are largely untested and unregulated chemicals used recreationally and known to cause medical problems yet the article seems to glow about how harmless they are.

ank Wilson passed away at the end of 2008, and I do remember hearing that he had held on to the causation of poppers with AIDS/KS long after that was abandoned. Here's a [http://www.sfcityclinic.org/moreresources/POPPERSANDIMMUNOSUPPRESSION.pdf bibliography] attributed to him. I don't see anything in the article covering poppers use and increased STD risk due to vasodilation, although there is material on tie to increased high-risk behavior and on use with Viagra. With respect to the pages popularity, I've been working under the assumption that flagged revisions would eventually wind their to way to a lot of med articles at some point for that reason. -ser:Optigan13|Optigan13 (ser talk:Optigan13|talk) 04:47, 19 January 2010 (UTC)

I have just done a bit of a rewrite of the article to resolve poor sourcing and POV issues. Mastcell has also helped improve the article as well. Hopefully the major concerns with the article have been resolved now and fingers crossed the SPA's don't return. Optigan13 with regard to KS the most [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18040808 recent review] seems to give weight to poppers being associated with aposi's sarcoma but a more recent [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19108691 study] found no association. It seems the literature is devided on the issue although the volume and quality of the research into poppers is seriously lacking.--ser:Literaturegeek|Literaturegeek | ser_talk:Literaturegeek |T@1k? 20:33, 19 January 2010 (UTC)

Per P:NAME I think that poppers is the right name for the article as it is most commonly known under this name by lay people. Poppers also gets more pubmed hits in the academic literature. A similar controversy has previously been discussed with regard to the eroin article and whether it should be renamed to diamorphine.--ser:Literaturegeek|Literaturegeek | ser_talk:Literaturegeek |T@1k? 02:01, 20 January 2010 (UTC)

 Curious.. 

..are there any lipid metabolism disorders that may present as a mild case of diabetes that is aggravated by lipid intake? Or any case of diabetes? --ser:CopperKettle|CopperKettle 16:41, 17 January 2010 (UTC)

Do we mean the same thing when we say &quot;lipid metabolism disorder&quot;?  I think of a purely genetic problem (i.e., enzyme mutation).  There are all kinds of much more common things that are &quot;aggravated&quot; by &quot;lipid intake&quot; in some people, e.g., pancreatitis, gall bladder problems, hepatitis...  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:39, 17 January 2010 (UTC)
Yes, I mean the rare species, so to speak. Enzyme mutations and such that sprang up as a strange form of diabetes, possibly with strange neurological side-effects, that vanish when lipid intake drops. --ser:CopperKettle|CopperKettle 04:08, 21 January 2010 (UTC)
The matter is, I have this kind of strange diabetes for 10 years that stubbornly refuses to develop into a full-blown form and is marked as &quot;MODY diabetes (?)&quot; (sic, with a question mark) on my medical card. Personally endocrinologists say to me that they havent met the disease with such course as mine; some say &quot;this is not diabetes&quot;. Sugar load test keeps telling it is diabetes, but with diet the glycated haemo stays normal. For 10 years. And it is aggravated by lipid intake, it seems to me. Excessive lipid\caloric intake leads to strange feelings (left hand numbness, dizzyness, dizziness while performing cognitive tasks) and.. dry mouth without the increase in blood sugar. Also I have eratoconus, and normal\high lipid\caloric intake seems to lead both to increased days of &quot;sore throat&quot; and &quot;cloudy cornea&quot; (that requires topical steroids), so I keep at unnaturally low levels of calories and lipids for years. --ser:CopperKettle|CopperKettle 04:20, 21 January 2010 (UTC)

 Concerns regarding emporomandibular_joint_disorder#Relocating_a_dislocated_jaw|this section of the TMJ syndrome article 

Hey all, I decided to raise this concern here because the contributors to this WikiProject would probably have the most experience dealing with articles that inch too close to crossing the line between articles on medical topics and P:MEDICAL|giving medical advice.  I invite you to take a look at emporomandibular_joint_disorder#Relocating_a_dislocated_jaw|this section of the TMJ syndrome article and comment about what you think.  To me, it seems like a &quot;how-to&quot; guide to treating a medical condition, which is basically giving medical advice, right?  However, I'm a little too inexperienced in this area to P:BOLD|be bold and just remove or rewrite the whole section, so I was hoping for ideas.  The talk page of the article itself is pretty much dead, so I brought this issue here instead of there.  I will, however, link to this discussion there, so interested contributors can make their way here.  --ser:NickW557|Nick—ser talk:NickW557|Contact/pecial:Contributions/NickW557|Contribs 04:05, 25 January 2010 (UTC)

 Policy regarding citation of disease synonyms 

Are there policies out there regarding how disease synonyms are cited?  I think when a disease synonym is included in an article, it should have it's own citation so someone can verify where it has come from.  When there are multiple synonyms, I think they should each be associated with their own citation, even if they all come from the same source.  The reason being that if someone comes along and adds an additional synonym, the sources of the previous ones are not confused.  Any thoughts? ---ser:Kilbad|kilbad (ser talk:Kilbad|talk) 23:46, 22 January 2010 (UTC)

I understand the impulse, but it makes the text less readable, which is highly undesirable.  Additionally, alternate names are usually presented in the first sentence, and citations are P:LEAD#Citations|gently deprecated for the entire lead section, particularly for non-controversial statements.
Inline citations are actually required for only a remarkably small set of facts:
* Direct quotations
* Contentious statements about living people
* Facts whose accuracy is disputable (&quot;challenged or likely to be challenged&quot;)
* Statistics (defined broadly)
* Opinions that need to be attributed to a source
That's the whole list, and making it very slightly harder to vandalize the alternate names for a disease isn't on the list.  
In my experience, it's usually quite easy to verify alternate names, and adding a source tag won't prevent anyone from incorrectly copying an existing source tag over to newly added names.  I really don't think that you'd be gaining much with that practice.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 00:49, 23 January 2010 (UTC)
I support Kilbad's proposal. On many articles, the primary arguments about article content derive from differing underlying assumptions about whether or not two different terms actually refer to the same condition. The best way to resolve these disputes is to provide unambiguous provenance for the assertion of equivalence. --ser:Arcadian|Arcadian (ser talk:Arcadian|talk) 03:15, 23 January 2010 (UTC)

 I agree with WAID.  If something is problematic or disputed, ask for a citation; otherwise, it makes no sense to have to cite that synonyms for Tourette syndrome are Tourette's, TS and GTS, for example.  Current policy already covers this.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 03:20, 23 January 2010 (UTC)

I have a slightly different suggestion. If there are alternate names that may be contentious, then that fact, in itself is interesting. Only in the cases where there disputable alternates, I'd recommend a short section immediately after the lead entitled Naming, or similar, which would be the best place to describe alternate names – and any contention – and cite the sources. The lead would then contain those alternates as part of its function of summarising the rest of the (cited) article. That would have the dual advantage of keeping the lead concise and free of cites, and drawing attention to the issue of alternate names. Although this is not prescribed in P:MEDMOS, it's a common enough tactic elsewhere in wikipedia to make it worth consideration. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 05:13, 23 January 2010 (UTC)
Names might also be reasonably discussed in a history section, and could be appropriately cited in that case.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 23:09, 25 January 2010 (UTC)

 idovudine 

Additional eyes are needed at idovudine, where a ser:Eye.earth|strongly opinionated editor with a block history on the article is stating that cancer is a side effect of AZT.

The influence of antiretroviral therapy in general (and NNRTIs in particular) on the incidence of cancer is a fascinating topic. While HAART leads to clear declines in most AIDS-defining malignancies, the data are much more conflicting and unclear with regard to non-AIDS-defining malignancies. The page on idovudine is probably not the place to cover this, since no one uses zidovudine in isolation - probably more appropriate for the page on HAART. The editor in question, ser|Eye.earth, is a relentless promoter of AIDS denialism on various and sundry pages, from idovudine through aul Gann, and they're not above anything from misrepresenting refs to actual socking. The focus on zidovudine (as if it were still 1993) is typical AIDS-denialist stuff, but despite the unpromising provenance of these edits, it's something we should probably look into covering a bit more deeply. Several recent high-quality papers and reviews are available, which I will collect as time permits. ser:MastCell|MastCell ser Talk:MastCell|Talk 00:58, 25 January 2010 (UTC)

Although AZT and other NRTIs are much more specific for the viral polymerase, they do have some affinity for cellular polymerases. One could certainly envision a possible mechanism for carcinogenesis. However, NRTI-mediated increase in cancer incidence has not yet been established in humans. Until more research is done, I don't see a reason to include carcinogenicity speculation in the idovudine article. ser:Keepcalmandcarryon|Keepcalmandcarryon (ser talk:Keepcalmandcarryon|talk) 14:32, 25 January 2010 (UTC)

Hi gang! You're absolutely spot on, What'!  I'm pretty sure Brangifer will be able to find such a reference, or more.  I suggest that the anonymous Canadian Chiropractor should be invited to present the volumes of references that he or she promised in the edit summary s/he made. A particular treatment modality should not be added without references.  I think it'd be better to tag Chiro Rx as ubious or at least unsourced and flag the information for removal from the article if suitable references are not provided.  At the same time, valid reasons not to opt for a particular course of treatment, properly cited, should also be provided in the interests of  having a balanced POV in the article.  And by valid reasons, I echo What' in saying that just because the FDA does it is not valid in the global sense - that's just the decision of one committee in one country, after all.

 ertebral artery dissection 

In spite of the fact that chiropractic high cervical neck manipulation has been strongly associated with VAD, strokes, and deaths, a recent addition on that subject was [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vertebral_artery_dissection&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=340625171 reverted]. I have to agree that the German study isn't the best one because its language/translation is confusing and it includes numerous examples not performed by chiropractors. It does, quite correctly, show that the technique itself, not the practitioner, is problematic. It is only noted so often in connection with chiropractic because they perform most cervical neck manipulations.

The article is merely a stub and needs development. This was the only mention of chiropractic, which is the most common cause of VAD in persons under 45 years of age, with a [http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/short/32/5/1054 500% increased risk of VAD among those who have visited a chiropractor within 1 week of the VBA]. A California study found a 600% increased risk.

I have collected a number of sources in this somewhat sensationalistic [http://quackfiles.blogspot.com/2006/12/must-see-dangers-of-chiropractic.html blog entry]. Rather than gettting bogged down in my rhetoric (except the short introduction, which should be read), look carefully at the sources and see if some of them can be used to develop the subject. More here:

I reverted the addition of that source as it was blatantly misleading the statistics reported in the article, and I have a problem with the reliability of a source that misrepresents its own facts in the abstract. Rather than reading Ernst from 2002, or such biased sources as Barrett, I would suggest reading the interdiscipinary studies performed by the orld Health Organization Bone and Joint Decade Task Force (2000-2010):

 Obviously the use of chiropractic sources will usually tend to emphasize only one side of the debate, or even whitewash the situation. For example, the two chiropractic sources mentioned above (Cassidy and Boyle), are often used to trump myriad other sources, which is a very biased method of protecting the profession and stopping investigation of this subject. Patient safety is ignored by this approach. The degree of denial is incredible. Every time this subject has been broached and attempted here at Wikipedia it is immediately attacked by chiropractors and their advocates. Deletionism is a favorite ploy. In this case you had a legitimate excuse, but when better sources are used, I'm wondering what your reaction will be.

 There is a debate. Of that there is no doubt, and that debate can be documented using RS, and that should be included in the article. -- ser:BullRangifer|Brangifer (ser talk:BullRangifer|talk) 19:49, 30 January 2010 (UTC)

I believe that describing the World Health Organization Bone and Joint Decade Task Force studies as &quot;chiropractic sources&quot; to be disenguously misleading. These were not &quot;chiropractic sources&quot;, but rather interdisciplinary sources.
The multidisciplinary, international Task Force led by Prof Scott Haldeman from the University of California in Irvine and in L.A., involved more than 50 researchers based in 9 countries and represented 14 different clinical and scientific disciplines in 8 universities. The group assembled the best international research data on neck pain and related disorders – specifically more than 31,000 research citations with subsequent analysis of over 1,000 studies – making this monumental document one of the most extensive reports on the subject of neck pain ever developed, and offering the most current expert perspective on the evidence related to the treatment of neck pain..
It is true that Cassidy was originally trained as a chiropractor, but it is equally true that he also holds a Ph.D and a Dr. Med Sc. It is also true that he is a Professor of Epidemiology with the Department of Public Health Sciences in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Toronto. To simply cast off these sources because a chiropractor was involved is bad logic and bad science.
Boyle on the otherhand, is not a chiropractor. She has a M.Sc and a Ph.D. Other researchers involved include Pierre Cote, who has a chiropractic degree, but also a Ph.D. and is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Public Health Sciences in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Toronto. How about Yaohua He, who is an MD, Ph.D, or Frank Silver MD, FRCPC? You discount their involvement in this massive project when you descripe these articles as &quot;chiropractic sources&quot;. ser:DigitalC|DigitalC (ser talk:DigitalC|talk) 21:03, 30 January 2010 (UTC)

 I only mentioned two names, not the World Health Organization Bone and Joint Decade Task Force, but you're right, Haldeman is also a chiropractor (second third generation IIRC) and uses his MD to give chiropractic good press. My point is that one can't blindly accept a source. The researchers also have their biases, and whenever chiropractors are involved, or, like Haldeman, lead the study, it will usually favor chiropractic.

 BTW, some of the data in the Cassidy study doesn't back up his editorializing conclusions. His conclusions are unrelated to much of the other data which could easily explain away his conclusions. He has lots of statistics in there which he doesn't use to soften his conclusions. 

 The Cassidy data shows that in this population patients are 7-8 times more likely to have consulted a primary care MD than a chiropractor over the time intervals for any reason, as demonstrated by the fact that in the 3164 control cases (no VAD) 29.9% of cases had seen a doctor within the previous month while only 4% consulted chiropractors.

 This doesn't seem to have been allowed for anywhere in his conclusions. These two factors (the other being that patients with actual VADs would normally preferentially consult an MD) could well explain why there appears to be an association of MD consultations with VAD. The strong associations shown in this and other studies of VAD and neck manipulation remains unaccounted for. -- ser:BullRangifer|Brangifer (ser talk:BullRangifer|talk) 07:39, 31 January 2010 (UTC)

It wasn't comparing MDs and DCs, but rather primary care MDs (ie, not the emergency room). Patients with VADs complain of headaches and neck pain, and aren't necessarily likely to consult an emergency room with those symptoms, but would likely consult a chiropractor or their family doctor. However, if they have full-blown symptoms of a VAD, then they would consult an emergency room. Given that both Cassidy and Cote have Ph.D's in epidemiology, and Haldeman is a professor of epidemiology at UCLA, I'm sure that they understand the statistics better than you or I. As an interesting/trivial aside, Haldeman is a third generation chiropractor - his grandmother was the first chiropractor in Canada - might be worth a bio if there are good sources that discuss her. Again, Haldeman is also a medical doctor, so to state that he is biased towards one side or the other seems to be an adhominem attack - &quot;he is a chiropractor and therefore the study will favor chiropractic&quot; (paraphrased). ser:DigitalC|DigitalC (ser talk:DigitalC|talk) 15:31, 31 January 2010 (UTC)

 I have tweaked my comment to make sure that such a misunderstanding doesn't happen again. Writing &quot;MD&quot; was too vague. I didn't imply ER MDs at all, so nothing else needs changing.

 Thanks for the info about Haldeman. 3rd generation! I wasn't too far off. That establishes his bias as more genetic than cognitive and professional. He simply can't do otherwise since he's actually in a familial relationship with the profession. ;-) My comment was based on the fact that nearly all his work involving chiropractic subjects tends to glorify it or subtly run interference for it with his MD colleagues. (He wouldn't get paid if he criticized the profession. He makes lots of money speaking for them and they'd stop hiring him. He'd essentially become &quot;divorced&quot; from his &quot;family&quot;.) He's a favorite poster boy used by the profession when they want the added prestige of an &quot;MD&quot; title promoting their agenda. That's just what I've gleaned from my years of reading his publications, seminars and speeches. In this he's no different than chiropractors in France, who for many years had to become MDs to legally practice chiropractic. Once they graduated, they promptly ignored their scientific learnings and reverted back to chiropractic metaphysics and unethical practices, while being legally protected by their MD title.

 It is very telling that he very rarely (if ever) speaks out clearly and loudly against the unscientific practices, fraud, abuse, and quackery which have been documented by chiropractic researchers to be more prevalent in their own profession than in other professions. (See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiropractic_controversy_and_criticism#Ethics_and_claims here for refs].) Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm very willing to change my mind if you can show me refs where he does criticize his own profession/family. His status as an MD enables him to get acceptance for chiropractic POV where a DC would not get acceptance for saying exactly the same thing. That's what I've observed over the years.

 I'm pretty certain that some of the MDs reading this can identify with the still common attitude in the medical profession, that an MD automatically has more credibility than a DC, IF one only looks at their credentials. There is still a lot of (justified) skepticism toward the chiropractic profession. Chiropractors are in much the same situation, as the old joke goes, that, just like women and blacks, they have to work twice as hard to get half the pay credibility. In some cases it's quite unfair to certain chiropractors, but there are historical reasons for those attitudes. -- ser:BullRangifer|Brangifer (ser talk:BullRangifer|talk) 19:40, 31 January 2010 (UTC)

#I am about to start going through the list of chemicals/health problems listed in [http://database.healthandenvironment.org/ CHE Toxicant and Disease Database], [http://www.scorecard.org/chemical-profiles/ Scorecard.org: Chemical Profiles], and other such sources, and adding known health effects for each chemical to the WP article for that chemical. Anyone interested in helping me with this? Know of any other sources I might use? Thanks ser:Jrtayloriv|Jrtayloriv (ser talk:Jrtayloriv|talk) 06:26, 1 February 2010 (UTC)

Looking at [http://www.healthandenvironment.org/tddb/disease/637 an example from CHE], I appreciate the categorization by strength of evidence.  However, they don't seem to include any information about absolute or relative risk, and that could be misleading to our readers.  For example, something can have very strong evidence to support a link -- but perhaps only one in a thousand people are ever exposed to that level of some uncommon toxin, and only one in a hundred of small group of exposed people ever develop the disease as a result of the exposure... and perhaps it's a common disease, like ypertension.  The result is that you could have a ~99.993% chance that any given case of high blood pressure is not caused by the &quot;strong evidence&quot; toxin.  Simply saying &quot;There is strong evidence that [name of rare thing] causes this disease&quot; -- which  is all this source says -- doesn't begin to communicate P:DUE|the importance of this fact to the reader.  
Also, I don't think that a laundry list of every probably associated substance is going to help our readers; it might be worth limiting such lists to those with strong evidence.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 04:05, 2 February 2010 (UTC)
Agreed -- as far as Wikipedia articles for certain pathologies, I was only going to include chemicals with strong evidence, and was only using the CHE database as a place to get ideas for chemicals to search for in the literature. On the other hand, as far as chemicals, I don't think it would hurt to have a &quot;laundry list&quot; of health effects, since that list will be much shorter than the list of chemicals suspected to cause a certain illness.

Cheers, --ser:CopperKettle|CopperKettle 16:13, 1 February 2010 (UTC)

 I couldn't find any references to suggest that dairy products can increase lactate level, even in MELAS. Neither could I find any evidence to show that diet has a significant effect on lactate level. The closest article I found was [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16145217?itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum&amp;ordinalpos=2 this one], where spoilt milk led to septic shock. The body has a fairly robust homeostatic mechanism to deal with excess lactic acid: actate dehydrogenase. Lactic acidosis is traditionally caused by impaired oxygen utilization in tissues, either due to impaired oxygen delivery, or impaired uptake into the tissues/mitochondria. ser:Axl|Axl ¤ ser talk:Axl|[Talk] 19:44, 2 February 2010 (UTC)

 Redirects and the WPMED banner 

Should unique redirects for disease synonyms (like allorca acne --&gt; cne aestivalis) have a WPMED banner on the talk page, perhaps with a new &quot;redirect&quot; parameter, as there is already a &quot;category&quot; parameter (see ategory talk:Cutaneous conditions for example).  I think there may be utility in seeing unique redirects within the scope of a project or task force.  If WPMED banners on unique redirect pages is not recommended, perhaps you could share your rational. ---ser:Kilbad|kilbad (ser talk:Kilbad|talk) 03:03, 2 February 2010 (UTC)

Like most projects, we don't usually bother with such tags.  Such tags don't seem to be tracked or useful to the P:1.0 team -- or to us, since, unlike a stub-class article, there's not much 'improvement' that you can do for a redirect.  In fact, I routinely remove them, because they are almost always leftovers from a merge, and thus contain invalid/outdated information from the pre-merge state.  
If you decide that it's warranted in any given case, then the tag should be set to |class=Redirect |importance=NA (&quot;NA&quot; means &quot;not an article&quot;; if you don't set this, then the banner may assume it).  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 03:47, 2 February 2010 (UTC)
It may be useful to create redirects banners for sourced synonyms that are used within a condition's article and are assigned to a designated category. For example this would differentiate redirects categorized per P:DERM with a dermatology task force redirect template banner, excluding those created as common misnomers or redirects without the use of difficult to type characters such as ascents or en dashes. ser:Calmer Waters|Calmer ser talk:Calmer Waters|Waters 07:36, 2 February 2010 (UTC)

Dizziness, because it's a noun, and without the (medicine) qualifier, unless there's some entirely non-medical use that (1) needs to have a separate article AND (2) is a more important concept than the medical/physical one.

 Unexplained moves 

Recently, all articles regarding the 2009 flu pandemic by continent was moved by [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&amp;user=Immunize Immunize]. I don't know if consensus needs it to be moved, but I reverted it before when TouLouse made the same thing. This day, Immunize moved all articles. A closing admin on 009 flu pandemic in Europe's requested moved (moving back from 2009-2010 name to its 2009 original name) noted that the disease came up by 2009, so there is nothing worthy to call it &quot;2009-2010&quot;.

 ymptom checker

The risk is in making any such list meaninglessly vague. Hence alaise is such a common symptom as not to be discriminatory. One mighjt expect WP article therefore to list just the top few causes of perhaps &quot;anaemia, thyroid disorder, untreated diabetes, and many other acute and chronic illness, as well as a psychological symptom of depression and anxiety&quot;. However the current article alaise includes conjunctivitis and mouth ulcers which clearly are trivial inclusions in the list, indeed I dispute that malaise is a core feature of eithr of these. The second problem is that WP is not aimed at patients or as a self-diagnosis guide, so setting up comprehensive list of symptom categories such as shoulder pain, shoulder swelling, elbow pain, elbow swelling, wrist pain, wrist swelling, muscle stiffness, muscle ache, muscle swelling etc etc needs to be restrained by what is appropriate for an encyclopedia. ser:Davidruben|David Ruben  ser talk:Davidruben|Talk  10:39, 3 February 2010 (UTC)
Well, the symptom checkers which have impressed me are computer programs with audio and a virtual physician (ie, video of a ER clinician) who asks the user questions: age, gender, what is the complaint, ... . The user answers them from the keyboard or mouse click. The virtual physician asks the next consequential question, the user answers back &amp; forth until the top few candidate diseases are displayed; the virtual physician usually ends up with See your doctor right away, or in the next 2 weeks etc. Perhaps an article which possibly lists the current symptom checkers on the web could be a real service for readers. For example, comparing the URLs after a search yields some surprising differences in ease of use. Some of them can only be used by a computer literate person, some can only be used by a healthy person who is trying to help a sick person, some require medical knowledge to use, some are xxx etc. --ser:Ancheta Wis|Ancheta Wis (ser talk:Ancheta Wis|talk) 13:55, 3 February 2010 (UTC)

 Perception 

Dear all,

I’ve been trying to help folks who were trying to articulate the latest knowledge on Perception article, but my suggestions did not help much. On top of that, some little egos managed to erode even that little clarity we had.

I have decided, therefore, to simply rewrite the article on the basis of currently available knowledge in the following disciplines: cognitive and developmental psychology, medicine (especially genetics), philosophy and complex (adaptive) systems theory with emphasised references to non-monotonic logics. I am contemplating few other disciplines, but these will suffice for the beginning.

I have drafted the lead into the article and the draft can be found on the related discussion page. I am calling now for comments and contributions backed by the latest science and the latest contemporary philosophical thought. My only condition is clarity and brevity wherever possible. If you find other possible references, they will be welcomed too.

Since all but two are in bold type, it might make more sense to bold all of them.

l|WPMED uses l|WPBannerMeta.  Originally in l|WPBannerMeta, task force names were not in bold.  Then, a change was made ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:WPBannerMeta/taskforce&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=329125866 here]), which defaulted the task force names to be bolded.  However, the 2 WPMED task forces that are not bolded use their own custom text, rather than the default in l|WPBannerMeta (although the custom text is identical to the default - &quot;This article is supported by...&quot;).  The reason these task forces require custom settings is that they do not use the default settings for importance - they take the importance from WPMED if no task force importance is specified.  When l|WPBannerMeta was changed, no one noticed and l|WPMED was never changed.  I will go ahead and bold these 2 task forces.  If you want them all to be not bold, I'd recommend bringing it up at emplate talk:WPBannerMeta.  --ser:Scottalter|Scott Alter 03:52, 9 February 2010 (UTC)

 Outdated term 

We've got some confusion about eticuloendotheliosis.  [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reticuloendotheliosis&amp;oldid=288780571 Here] we say that it's a (any) lymphoma of the reticuloendothelial system; then it's [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reticuloendotheliosis&amp;oldid=312190716 redirected] to a specific neoplastic disease, eukemic reticuloendotheliosis (ignoring other uses, such as non-lipid reticuloendotheliosis, which is [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000068.htm an older name] for istiocytosis); finally, it has been [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reticuloendotheliosis&amp;oldid=343066118 redirected] to a fungal infection of the lungs (possibly a corruption of &quot;reticuloendothelial cytomycosis&quot;).

Uploaded, but with problems. File:Hematopoiesis (human) diagram en.svg does not display the notes, and several of the cells render badly. Just checked - cells are also badly rendered on File:Hematopoiesis (human) diagram.svg, which I worked from. It all displays perfectly in Inkscape, so there's obviously some incompatibility with the Wikimedia svg handling. I can export perfect png's at any size from Inkscape - a full sized png is only one-tenth the size of the svg, so maybe that's the best option until I can figure out how to make the svg compatible. As an aside, the Icelandic version actually has the label text converted to shapes, so you can't edit those easily. Any thoughts? --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 16:11, 7 February 2010 (UTC)

To answer my own question: ikipedia:SVG Help says that Inkscape needs the following to be modified before upload:
* Lines with arrow heads (the arrows need to be converted)
* Text
* Compound objects created with the binary path tools (union, intersect etc)
 which pretty much covers everything in the diagram we've been working on. It's really dispiriting to find that the mediawiki software is incompatible with the most common free vector graphic tools (Inkscape and Open Office). Until the software can handle SVGs that anyone can edit without huge effort, I'll recommend the retention of PNGs (although the auto-rendering serves a small-filesize, palletted PNG in to a large-filesize, 32-bit colour version - but that's another story). Anyone with Inkscape can download the SVG I uploaded and export an appropriately sized PNG. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 15:35, 8 February 2010 (UTC)

This might not be directly related but I noticed a curious edit using a 1920's source about sinusitus being connected to psychosis. See [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sinusitis&amp;diff=342637550&amp;oldid=341895945 this diff] and this talk page section alk:Sinusitis/Archive 1#Sinusitis_and_Personality_Disorders_-_Mental_Illness.

 Safety of the blood supply: XMRV 

Chronic fatigue syndrome websites have been abuzz following the October 2009 report in Science suggesting enotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) as the potential cause of CFS. Recently, this buzz has included statements that the US Department of Health and Human Services is planning to screen the blood supply for XMRV (with the implication that the US government agrees that some form of disease causation has been established). However, causation has not yet been established, the association of the virus (with prostate cancer and with CFS) remains uncertain and the US government has made no statements on the matter. An editor at the XMRV page has [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Xenotropic_murine_leukemia_virus-related_virus#Proposed_addition_to_Xenotropic_murine_leukemia_virus-related_virus.23.2FTransmission proposed] a paragraph on blood safety based upon statements made by a CFS advocacy group and by a doctor in a court transcript. I have opposed this addition as premature (until a government agency makes a statement, preferably reported in the media) and as not satisfying P:MEDRS|MEDRS. What's the best way to proceed? ser:Keepcalmandcarryon|Keepcalmandcarryon (ser talk:Keepcalmandcarryon|talk) 21:30, 13 February 2010 (UTC)

The study has not been replicated, and there is very little evidence that this virus is indeed blood-transmissible.

Clarification, the proposed material is about prostate cancer and CFS. It does not presuppose a disease causation, studies have now &quot;associated&quot; XMRV with prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome, the committee will investigate the blood safety threat from XMRV.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Xenotropic_murine_leukemia_virus-related_virus#Proposed_addition_to_Xenotropic_murine_leukemia_virus-related_virus.23.2FTransmission] The doctor stateing this is Jerry A.

The CFIDS Association of America's statement adds more detail and presents no conflicting or controversial material.

Again, this is a transcribed statement (read: personal opinion) by an advisor to an advisory committee.

Sorry, I am confused by this last statement.  Did you actually check the RS before making this statement?  Dr Holmberg is an officer of the HHS and the senior technical advisor for blood policy within the OPHS making this statement on behalf of &quot;his boss, the Assistant Secretary for Health and he is designated as the Blood Safety Officer&quot; and after some more preamble he continued &quot;I have a statement for you. This statement has been coordinated throughout the entire HHS public health services.  Many hours last night -- I have emails on this flying throughout the night, and the majority of us have just got back from the American Association of blood banks meeting in New Orleans where this was a discussion point throughout the meeting. &quot; He then reads the reference [http://www.cfids.org/xmrv/blood-supply-ophs.pdf].

For the avoidance of doubt:
*Keepalmandcarryon: &quot;a doctor&quot;
*The actual facts:Dr Holmberg, the senior technical advisor for blood policy within the OPHS HHS on behalf of the Assistant Secretary for Health, designated Blood Safety Officer within the HHS
*Keepalmandcarryon:&quot;in a court transcript&quot;
*The actual facts:reading a prepared statement that had been reviewed within the OPHS and presented to CFSAC, the committee constituted by the Secretary of Health to advise on CFS policy.

It is well understood that a source's reliablity is not generic but relative to the statement made. If I read the above correctly, Holmberg's statement on behalf of the group is at best a primary source on the advice the HHC gave to HHS.

(outdent) In the verbal preamble which is recorded on the video at the HHS site he does state that &quot;This statement has been coordinated throughout the entire HHS public health services.&quot; [My transcription] and the nature of the audience committee, indicates that this was a veted announcement.  I was suggesting something like (see [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AXenotropic_murine_leukemia_virus-related_virus&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=343873245&amp;oldid=343841843]):

No source is &quot;reliable&quot; for any possible use; no matter how reliable this statement, for example, is about the name of the speaker, it would be worthless for supporting a claim about, say, Chinese astrology.  You've really got to tell us what you want to say here.  That Holmberg issued a press release?  Fine.  That XMRV causes CFS?  Not fine.  Something in between?

Reading Holmberg's words on pages 22-23 of that transcript I don't see very direct support for that statement. He did mention the (then) recent paper in Science on October 9 which identified that XMRV had been found in individuals with CFS. He made that mention in the context of a broader discussion of blood surveillance technology. In that context, he then went on to explain that &quot;the department&quot; (HHS) was &quot;looking at&quot; standardizing the researchers' tests and at applying them to blood repositories as a way to investigate prevalence of XMRV in repository blood. None of that explanation rises beyond a primary statement, even from a very credible individual. You might justify saying something like &quot;The U.S. ffice of Public Health and Science|DHHS OPHS Advisory Committee on Blood Safety and Availability was reported in November 2009 to be planning to investigate just how prevalent XMRV might be in repository blood.&quot; ser:LeadSongDog ser talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl 07:26, 14 February 2010 (UTC)

&quot;Dr. Jerry Holmberg of the ffice of Public Health and Science|DHHS OPHS Advisory Committee on Blood Safety and Availability stated at the hronic Fatigue Syndrome Advisory Committee|CFSAC meeting on 30 Oct 2009 that, because studies have now associated XMRV with prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome, the committee will investigate the blood safety threat from XMRV.[http://www.cfids.org/xmrv/blood-supply-ophs.pdf][http://www.hhs.gov/ophs/bloodsafety/advisorycommittee/pastmeetings/transcripts/acbsa20091119.pdf] A .S.

[http://www.cfids.org/cfidslink/2009/120203.asp]&quot; I don't have objections to condense to approximately the wording LeadSongDog proposed.

Thanks for your feedback.  Yes, we need to reach an agreed consensus on how to reflect an accurate and appropriate length summary of the multiple RS along this sort of discussion.   But this a somewhat different discussion from the original editors position of exclusion on the grounds that the statement given by &quot;some doctor in a court transcript&quot;, when in reality Dr Holmberg is an officer of the HHS who was reading out a prepared statement on the OPHS behalf. -- 12:14, 14 February 2010 (UTC)

 What to do with condition subtypes/variants in the ist of cutaneous conditions 

For any cutaneous condition, there may be (though certainly not always) different subtypes or variants.  Take ichen planus for example, which has many subtypes and variants, or quamous cell carcinoma, which also has multiple subtypes, like ucosal squamous cell carcinoma.

Therefore, for the most complicated cases, you might have something like:

Condition name (Conditions synonym(s))
Condition subtype (Condition subtype synonym(s))
Condition variant (Condition variant synonym(s))

Currently, I have been trying to ist of cutaneous conditions|list the main condition name as well as the specific subtypes/variants, hence quamous cell carcinoma and ucosal squamous cell carcinoma both being in the ist of cutaneous conditions.

However, here are some questions I wanted to get the community's opinion on.  Right now, subtypes/variants are simply listed in alphabetical order, independent of the main condition.  For example, ucosal squamous cell carcinoma is not listed under quamous cell carcinoma.  However, should it be?  Should we be indenting subtypes/variants under the main condition?  What are the pros and cons of that?  

Also, going with that, should the various subtypes/variants have their own stub, or be redirected to the main condition article?  In general, I have been making stubs, though there are times when simply a redirect exists, as with ucosal squamous cell carcinoma.  What do you think is best?

Thanks in advance for your comments! ---ser:Kilbad|kilbad (ser talk:Kilbad|talk) 04:55, 15 February 2010 (UTC)

* My inclination is to merge subtypes and variants, especially if the separated articles would contain relatively little unique information, or would be stubs.  It's often quite useful for the reader to be able to compare and contrast closely related conditions.  If the articles grow significantly, they can always be split later.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 21:15, 16 February 2010 (UTC)

* I may have misunderstood, but it seems to make sense to me that subtypes should be listed alphabetically under the main condition, i.e.
Condition  name
Condition subtype A
Condition subtype B

 HIV/AIDS categories 

FYI, several HIV/AIDS categories have come up for renaming, see ikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2010 February 23. pecial:Contributions/70.29.210.242|70.29.210.242 (ser talk:70.29.210.242|talk) 06:41, 23 February 2010 (UTC)

The renaming is an effort to remove the / (the character used by the software for subpages) from the cat names, if that can be done sensibly.  The initial proposal is to change, e.g., &quot;HIV/AIDS by country&quot; to &quot;HIV and AIDS by country&quot;.  Another editor suggested shortening it to &quot;HIV by country&quot;, and there's a question about whether HIV/AIDS really means &quot;HIV and AIDS&quot; or if it means &quot;HIV or AIDS&quot;.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 19:55, 23 February 2010 (UTC)

 Meningococcemia 

I see that currently eningococcemia redirects to eningococcal disease. However, I feel that it would be more appropriate to redirect eningococcemia to eningoccal septicaemia, as meningococcemia refers to meningococcal bacteremia.

4. Is Google Health a new way to search for health information?
Not really. Google Health is mostly about helping you collect, store, manage, and share your medical records and health information. There is a search box at the top of every page in Google Health, and if you enter a search query there, you go to the Google.com search results page that you are used to. There is also useful health information built into Google Health, but Google Health is not a new health-specific search engine.

At the risk of answering what sounds like a request for medical advice, I will say that those of us who sometimes investigate these disorders in children do not consider a possible diagnosis of a mitochondrial disorder a contraindication to an MRI.

If you copy/paste, it would be best to redirect the en.wikipedia Talk page to the one on Commons, otherwise it's possible (likely) that parallel discussions will occur on different projects.

 Addition of __@Home references to articles 

I would like to make sure that what I'm doing represents community consensus, because I've already reverted a couple of times on a couple of pages.  Currently, an editor at 75.85.14.10x is adding references to a grid project to engue fever [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dengue_fever&amp;diff=348313029&amp;oldid=348197781] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dengue_fever&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=348313029], uscular dystrophy [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Muscular_dystrophy&amp;diff=348164660&amp;oldid=347748411], and proposing same at alk:AIDS [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:AIDS&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=348172376] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:AIDS&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=348312643].  While these grid projects are laudable, the additions are not encyclopedic.  I've tried to make it clear that I mean no disrespect to the grid project but rather have to respect the fact that P:NOT|WP is not a place to promote any cause.   If others disagree with my actions, I'm listening.  If you agree, then I'd appreciate it if others would weigh in so this doesn't come off as my own personal vendetta.

 raniosacral therapy 

The article regarding the pseudoscientific practice of craniosacral therapy needs attention. Take this one example:

* Cranial textbooks propose that motion of the skull is possible during flexion and extension because the sutures are mobile. The sphenobasilar synchondrosis (SBS) - the junction between the base of the sphenoid and the occiput- is thought to fuse by the mid- to late twenties, but still retain limited mobility . An alternative theory to SBS Motion taught in craniosacral training suggests that sutures are &quot;lines of folding&quot;, like pre-folded marks on cardboard, rather than necessarily being fully open.Cook, Andrew, An alternative to Sphenobasilar Synchondrosis (SBS) Motion. Self-published online, September 2005. [http://www.hummingbird-one.co.uk/pdf/sbs_simplified.pdf PDF]

 Outside eyes: alk:Medical Hypotheses 

I would appreciate any outside input at alk:Medical Hypotheses. I have some concerns about edits which one user is repeatedly reinserting.

I have not &quot;repeatedly reinserted&quot; anything. I made one large edit which added some balance to what was at best a flawed article and, while MastCell stated that he objected to one sentence I had put in, he had reverted my entire edit including an entire section saying that it was an &quot;apologia&quot; as the edit description. I reverted his revert and simultaneously revised the statement he objected to, which is not essential to the edit and if he objected to it, all he had to do was take it out. I'm not sure why he didn't do so rather than go to multiple pages on Wikipedia making misleading claims about my edit.--ser:Gloriamarie|Gloriamarie (ser talk:Gloriamarie|talk) 01:56, 9 March 2010 (UTC)

 Hi, WhatamIdoing, thanks for the encouragement. The first edit you link to was just pretty basic and was not what MastCell was talking about when he said I was &quot;repeatedly reinserting&quot; information and the second two were the &quot;one large edit&quot; I was referring to in my original comment, between which MastCell reverted it. It could be accurately stated that I reinserted information, but not that I &quot;repeatedly reinserted.&quot; I'm also puzzled why no one who objected to the sentence just didn't take it out rather than reverting the entire edit (I took the sentence out myself) since my edit on the whole improved the entry a great deal. This is the oddest situation I've ever encountered in all my Wikipedia editing. There was only the one honestly made error, and I corrected a few errors by omission (i.e., what occurred with Medical Hypotheses between its founding and 2009?) in my edit.

 iver cancer 

I noticed that the iver cancer article appears to have information on both Benign and Malignant Hepatic tumors, which I feel is incorrect, as the inclusion of the word &quot;cancer&quot; into the articles title suggests that only malignant hepatic tumors should be discussed in the article. I feel the text on benign hepatic tumors should be removed from that article.

 merging of Category:Medical research and Category:Clinical research

Pedantically, clinical research should be a (large) subset of medical research, but I'm not sure how strongly the distinction is made now. I suppose that, considering the interest drug companies are showing in traditional medicine, you might consider as an example that research done on alternative plant remedies is &quot;medical&quot;, but not &quot;clinical&quot; research. Perhaps on balance there's no harm in leaving Category:Clinical research as a subcategory of Category:Medical research.

This is great, though wouldn't you be uploading them to Commons rather than English Wikipedia? Try ser|Durova, who is heavily involved in images and would be a good person to ask.

I have a concern about the images with black bands across the persons eyes. This is no longer considered an adequate method of ensuring privacy and many of these images are clearly identifiable. What degree of consent has been obtained? Wikipedia is not a medical publication.  I don't think that such images are appropriate for an encyclopaedia for general readers (both because black squares for eyes produces a shocking photo and because the black squares were clearly added for a reason, and that reason is privacy even if it is ineffective).

ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 11:55, 19 March 2010 (UTC)

Agree with the concerns regarding consent.  Blacking out the eye in my opinion makes for a poor image.  When a medical practitioner comes out with a camera however consent is usually either obtained in writing or verbally.  So I assume consent was given.  Just check with the person who is donating the images.ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) 12:18, 19 March 2010 (UTC)

See [http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/insrv/graphicsandmedia/advice/clinicalphotography.html these guidelines on Clinical Photography Consent]. Note that they regard all images as identifiable, not just those of the face, etc. The maximum consent level is &quot;for the images to be used in a medical publication&quot;. This is not a medical publication, and images appearing here or on Commons could be reproduced anywhere, including for example, a site making fun of people or those that find extreme illness to be a form of entertainment. ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 12:24, 19 March 2010 (UTC)

 Is this concern regarding all patient images on Wikipedia or these in particular??, I agree with Doc James, since any physician will take permission before taking any picture, and we can confirm that with Dr.Thomas Habif, who so a well know author of many books as you can see [http://www.amazon.com/gp/search/ref=sr_adv_b/?search-alias=stripbooks&amp;unfiltered=1&amp;field-keywords=&amp;field-author=Thomas+Habif&amp;field-title=&amp;field-isbn=&amp;field-publisher=&amp;node=&amp;field-p_n_condition-type=&amp;field-feature_browse-bin=&amp;field-binding_browse-bin=&amp;field-subject=&amp;field-language=&amp;field-dateop=&amp;field-datemod=&amp;field-dateyear=&amp;sort=relevancerank&amp;Adv-Srch-Books-Submit.x=57&amp;Adv-Srch-Books-Submit.y=9 here].

I am very excited at the prospect of adding many of these images to Wikipedia, and I think they will be a valuable addition for our general readers.  However, I do have a few follow-up questions/comments.  First, with regard to permissions, I would still like to see a correspondence from someone from [http://www.dermnet.com/ dermnet.com], Dr. Habif or whoever, expressly stating that we can use any/all the photos under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license.  I have e-mailed support@dermnet.com twice, and have yet to hear back myself on the issue.  Maybe someone else can try contacting them as well?  Also, perhaps someone at OTRS should be activity involved with this donation to make sure we are doing everything appropriately/legally. Second, with regard to patient consent, what it our actual Wikipedia policy/consensus on this matter?  This issue has never been clear to me.  Does a patient's &quot;consent to be photographed&quot; have to be indicated somewhere on the Wikipedia/Commons file page?  If so, is there a specific form we should be using with he patient?  What does/will this mean for photos in which that information is not provided?  Finally, dovetailing off that, what is our Wikipedia policy/consensus regarding identifiable aspects of medical images?  Many of us have uploaded images from different sources (ourselves, the CDC, etc), all with different degrees of identifiableness (examples File:Basal cell carcinoma2.JPG|1, File:RougeoleDP.jpg|2, File:Verbrennungsnarbe keloid1.jpg|3, File:Pyoderma gangrenosum 01.jpg|4, File:Plaque of mycosis fungoides 2.jpg|5, File:Squamous cell carcinoma.jpg|6).  Sometimes we use a censoring black box, sometimes we do not.  Sometimes we include the face, other times we do not.  I suggest, if there is no clear consensus on this latter issue, perhaps (once we get proper permission) we could still copy all the photos over to Wikipedia, and then edit/delete photos over time as consensus develops?  Alright, just a few thoughts. ---ser:Kilbad|kilbad (ser talk:Kilbad|talk) 04:02, 20 March 2010 (UTC)

 Radiopaedia 

Hi, I have contacted [http://radiopaedia.org/users/frank Dr.Frank Gaillard] who is the CEO of the [http://radiopaedia.org/ Radiopaedia] site, and asked him to give me permission to upload images from radiopedia, he accepted that, and volunteered to upload them him self, but the I found  his commons:User_talk:Frank_Gaillard|talk page on commons and found commons:Template:Radiopaedia_permission|this, then I asked him if we could upload images under this license, he accepted this offer but had some requests that should be done whenever we upload a picture from his site:
*First of all this permission is only valid for cases and images uploaded by Dr.Frank Gaillard, which are currently 1552 case and can be found [http://radiopaedia.org/users/frank/cases here]
*Second request was that whenever we upload an image we should inform Dr.Frank Gaillard by e-mail about that picture
*Third request was that we should add the categories commons:Category:Radiopaedia|Category:Radiopaedia and commons:Category:Frank_Gaillard|Category:Frank_Gaillard to the uploaded images
*Fourth, images uploaded should be tagged with this commons:Template:Radiopaedia_permission|license
*And finally each image should state in its description tag the URL of the original case and image from [http://radiopaedia.org/ Radiopaedia], and as an example Dr.frank told me that images should look like this [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:MesotheliomaCT.jpg file]

So we need a list for images uploaded by Dr.Frank to radiopedia that we need here at wikipedia, so that we inform him, and then upload those images, any one wants to help with that??

Well there's the requests that he makes: are they reasonable? Probably but I don't really know Commons rules. I'm more concerned about the photos than the radiographic images. Although the copyright issue might be straightforward, the ethical/legal issues surrounding the subjects and their identification and publication on Wikipedia is less so. You're talking thousands of images. That's class-action territory if it goes pear-shaped. IMO, if I'd signed one of those consent forms I linked above, that consented to &quot;Medical publication&quot; usage, I'd be fuming if my pic appeared on the home page of Wikipedia in front of 8 million people and then copied to every leaching website in the world. I'd be taking legal advice. ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 21:30, 19 March 2010 (UTC)

 First his requests are reasonable, and we do them by routine, except for notifying him about the uploaded images, and I ll volunteer to do that whenever any images are uploaded, and about the other concerns, the [http://radiopaedia.org/ Radiopaedia] site does not contain any patient images, they are all CTs, MRIs, X-rays, and Ultrasounds. So I believe there is no reason to have any concerns about patient's privacy since no images have name labels. ser:madhero88|MaenK.A.ser_talk:madhero88|Talk 11:42, 20 March 2010 (UTC)

 Patient images: consent issues 

The above very-welcome opportunities raise the issue of consent by the subject of the photo to appear on Wikipedia. It is one thing for the copyright owner to willingly donate images to Wikipedia or to Commons, but permission is still required from any identifiable subject. Have a look at our odel release article and the [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Patient_images Patient images] essay on Commons (see also the talk page: I feel this essay is inadequate and will probably comment over there). Look also at [http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/insrv/graphicsandmedia/advice/clinicalphotography.html], [http://www.rlbuht.nhs.uk/Library/document_downloads/for_patients/Consent___PFF_944_Consent_to_Clinical_Photography_or_Video_Recording.pdf], [http://www.acmg.net/resources/policies/pol-020.pdf], [http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/330/7497/916] which are just a few of the Google results for &quot;clinical photography consent]. Here's some findings:
*&quot;In accordance with guidelines for the Welsh Assembly Government and the General Medical Council, the notion of whether a patient can be identified has been dispensed with. All patients should be considered as identifiable from any of their photographs.&quot; This appears to be the position of all medical journals. This includes pictures of someone's infected toe
*Typical hospital consent forms in the UK have levels of consent that range from ones own medical records to &quot;medical publication&quot;. They do not extend to publishing on Commons, which is effectively a &quot;do what you like with it&quot; permission.
*Blanking out a patient's eyes is ineffective as a privacy measure and went out with the dark ages.
*The legal liability lies with the publisher, not the photographer (though the photographer is usually the one that gets the form signed, because that's convenient). I'm not clear whether the publisher is the uploader or Wikipedia itself or both.

I think, especially given the volume of images involved, we should take legal advice from Wikipedia's legal team. ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 12:37, 20 March 2010 (UTC)

I have emailed Mike Godwin. ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 13:44, 20 March 2010 (UTC)
We have a model release, just like what we do for pornographic images. Just send the permission to OTRS and that takes care of everything. (Plus, in all seriousness, how can you identify someone if it is just a picture of their toe?) ser:Zscout370 ser_talk:Zscout370|(Return Fire) 14:44, 20 March 2010 (UTC)

Yes, the &quot;toe&quot; is an extreme example but I've literally repeated what the BMJ says. I guess they find that deciding what is &quot;identifiable&quot; or not is very hard and if they don't have the resources to do it then we certainly don't -- so we're left with a &quot;assume any patient photo is identifiable&quot; safety position. ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 15:12, 20 March 2010 (UTC)

IANAL but it seems to me if the subject can not be reasonably identified from the photo and the owner releases it to a free license, there should be no problem. Besides look at all the pics of identifiable living people on Commons, just but the &quot;Personality rights&quot; tag on the photo if they are identifiable. — ser:Rlevse|Rlevse • ser_talk:Rlevse|Talk •  15:49, 20 March 2010 (UTC)

I would imaging that we all agree that the medicine project should have a page somewhere discussing the use of medical photography.  Perhaps we could create a page analogous to the ikipedia:Reliable_sources_(medicine-related_articles), but for images?  We could then continue this discussion there, keeping all the related threads together?  Just an idea... ---ser:Kilbad|kilbad (ser talk:Kilbad|talk) 16:17, 20 March 2010 (UTC)

 I would say that patient images where the patient is reasonably identifiable and would require a model release. I wouldn't worry about it, though:
* If the patient is not reasonably identifiable.
* If the image is before some date (I'd suggest 1900).
* Possibly if the image is already published (e.g. in a medical book, magazine, etc.)
 ser:Jmabel|Jmabel | ser talk:Jmabel|Talk 16:32, 20 March 2010 (UTC)

I would encourage folk to read the above linked sources and add any more they find, rather than just guess. Even if we don't take the &quot;assume everything is identifiable&quot; approach, I would say all images that include even part of someone's face should be regarded as identifiable and we accept the widespread view that black boxes over the eyes do not help. But further, I don't think the permission to appear in a medical publication is sufficient for Commons. Medical pictures are different from everyday pictures. They say something negative about the person, which is akin to P:BLP issues. ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 16:43, 20 March 2010 (UTC)

An alternative to black boxing is to selectively blur identifiable features.  It takes less than two minutes on any reasonably powerful image editing program. IMP can do it and GIMP is free.  The only challenging part is that images would need to be reviewed and edited one by one.  

So how does this solution sound?  Form two teams of editors: one to review and one to edit.  Divide up the review tasks so that reviewers don't duplicate each other.  Designate a separate group of editors to do the privacy edits.  I'll train the second group (if you know how to crop a family portrait you can learn this easily).  

Designate a space for reviewers to indicate which images need editing, for image editors to indicate when the editing is done, and for editors to note when a group of images is fully reviewed and ready for batch upload.  (This setup would be organized like the copyright infringement reviews).  Edited images would be uploaded manually.  Sounds workable? ser:Durova|Durovaser talk:Durova|412 17:03, 20 March 2010 (UTC)

I think This is a great idea, and a doable one too, we should start working on that ser:madhero88|MaenK.A.ser_talk:madhero88|Talk 17:31, 20 March 2010 (UTC)
The sheer variety of images mean that on some categories, we could simply not upload any images remotely identifiable and make do with other body parts. We don't need at 1000 images of eczema, for example. The biggest difficulty will be for images that are necessarily of the face. How would you handle [http://www.dermnet.com/Acne-Scar/picture/4833 Acne Scar], [http://www.dermnet.com/Eczema-Face/picture/307 Eczema Face], [http://www.dermnet.com/Tuberous-Sclerosis/picture/23739 Tuberous sclerosis face], [http://www.dermnet.com/Tuberous-Sclerosis/picture/23770 Tuberous sclerosis face2], [http://www.dermnet.com/Neurofibromatosis/picture/23547 Neurofibromatosis face]?

Colin, here's a quick set of edits on four of the five images you linked.[http://www.flickr.com/photos/durova/]  It may be fair to set up the review system so that we bypass potentially sensitive images in situations where nonsensitive substitutes exist.  Otherwise we could increase the size of black boxing, plus implement selective blurs and crops to minimize identifiability.  Sounds fair? ser:Durova|Durovaser talk:Durova|412 18:23, 20 March 2010 (UTC)
In all the stuff I've read today, simply making the black boxes bigger wasn't suggested. In all those pictures you've edited, if I knew the person, I'd recognise them. Let's say that's your English teacher who has a distinctive brown mark on her face. Now you've learned that she has an incurable genetic disease that causes other, perhaps personal, problems. Her employer might worry that her illness could get worse, leading to time off or insurance issues. On another angle, I find the last of the tuberous sclerosis images I linked (which you haven't edited yet) to be simply shocking. The pimples on the face are the least of the problems with that picture. I experimented with white boxes rather than black and it was much improved. But basicaly, such blanked pictures are poor aesthetically and IMO not appropriate for an encyclopeadia for general readers. I appreciate that's getting into personal opinion territory, but I don't see anyone putting one of them on the MainPage any time soon? Wrt the picture editing project, I think we should wait for advice on where the &quot;identifiable&quot; threshold is set. ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 19:32, 20 March 2010 (UTC)
Colin, your points are well taken.  Further advice is not likely to be forthcoming (the featured picture program had a rather difficult discussion on a candidacy of a childbirth a while back).  The best way forward is to identify which images are potentially problematic and deal with them one by one until we reach consensus.  If we at least segregate those from the others, we can move forward with the majority/uncontroversial images. ser:Durova|Durovaser talk:Durova|412 19:43, 20 March 2010 (UTC)

I think we need be really clear, that uploading of medical images involves 2 issues:
# The trivial one (for now) is of copyright and our right to upload/transfer images. Of course normal rules over copyright and permissions to release under free licence apply just as for any WP Commons image, and if we have permission of Radiopedia or DermNet copyright holders to upload, then fine. 
# The tough issue here is of patient confidentially. Confidentiality is not gained by attempts at anonymity with black bars across eyes, or a decision that an image is not identifiable for being say just an X-ray film (if BMJ and leading medical journals take this opinion then we should be wary of making our own decisions that radiographs or photos not showing faces must be OK). Past discussions include ikipedia talk:Manual of Style (medicine-related articles)/Archive 3#Images, and ser:Una Smith kindly did a literature search to be found at ommons:User talk:Davidruben. Per ommons:Commons:Patient images, what counts is the model's consent... so if likes of DermNet/Radiopedia can confirm that images obtained were with patient consent for 'any' redistribution (vs. not just use in the one source or for medical education alone -and Wikipedia is not the closed doors of medical education), then this requirement seems met... I would though for such a large upload, suggest seeking clarification of Wiki Foundation legal advice - so Colin, please let us know when you hear back from Mike Godwin :-)  ser:Davidruben|David Ruben  ser talk:Davidruben|Talk  20:22, 20 March 2010 (UTC)
Thanks David. So if we do get the level of consent we require (any purpose) then we don't need to bother with fiddling with the pictures other than for our own needs (e.g. better composition). ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 20:33, 20 March 2010 (UTC)
Actually ommons:Commons:Patient images is an essay, not a policy or guideline, and medical images have been promoted to featured picture without explicit patient consent.  Perhaps the best solution is to wait for Mike Godwin's response before proceeding. ser:Durova|Durovaser talk:Durova|412 20:53, 20 March 2010 (UTC)

I think there are two separate issues with Patient images: (1) legal issues, and (2) ethical issues.
#For the legal issues, we should ask Mike Godwin for a final verdict: who owns the images, who's legally responsible for publishing them?
#For the ethical issues, I think each uploader should follow their own ethical code (but it's obvious that we shouldn't allow identifiable images taken without the patient's consent).
I too can make guesses but like Collin points out, we need (legal) facts rather than opinions. --ser:Stevenfruitsmaak|Steven Fruitsmaak (ser_talk:Stevenfruitsmaak|Reply) 21:22, 22 March 2010 (UTC)

ile:Bite of midge.jpg|thumb
About the assumption that all images are identifiable:
This, IMO, is driven by a rinciple of least astonishment rather than a real risk to privacy.  Imagine the patient with an unusual skin disease, resulting in a small spot on his arm or leg.  The derm says, &quot;Wow, I haven't seen one of these in my entire career,&quot; and takes a picture.  The patient happens to notice, some time later, that the doc has published a paper on the rare disease.
Given the patient's personal knowledge, including (importantly) his personal knowledge that the physician was unlikely to have another source for the image, he could logically conclude that the image shows his leg.  However, nobody else could possibly look at a little spot from an apparently random paper and say, &quot;Hey, I'll bet that this bit of skin is my neighbor's/co-worker's/friend's.&quot;
IMO the image I show here is unidentifiable, and it should not require a model release.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 22:34, 22 March 2010 (UTC)

We still have the outstanding issues of patient consent, the degree to which Wikipedia considers an image to be &quot;identifiable&quot;, and who exactly the &quot;publisher&quot; is. It might help if Thomas Habif gave us a copy of the consent form he's (presumably) used for his own publication of the images. From what I've read, publication of identifiable patient images without consent could leave the publisher liable to criminal prosecution in addition to any civil damages the patient pursues. As such, I don't think this is a job for the Medicine WikiProject and am disappointed that I've not yet heard back from WPs legal bod. ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 10:46, 25 March 2010 (UTC)

 Thank you for the fast replay. I believe that DR.Thomas Habif have consents but we cant ask him for written consents for 23000 images. But I am sure he have consents for publishing those images, since he is a well known publisher and he surly knows everything about consents, and he wont give us license to use these pictures if he didn't had consents. And I ve told him that those pictures will be attributed to him as an author, and will state that his website is the source. So if there was any legal concerns I believe he would not had accepted to release those images. I am disappointed too that its ve been 5 days now since you contacted Mr. godwin. Also for Dr.frank gillard, I ve made it clear previously that he will be attributed as the author on each image. So I think that those authors wont allow us to use their images if they didn't own them, and if they didn't have consents, since they know the legal consequences to that ser:madhero88|MaenK.A.ser_talk:madhero88|Talk 12:19, 25 March 2010 (UTC)

I went through and fixed some things that popped out at me, but there were a few other things I noticed. 
*In Effects of long term alcohol misuse, the sentence &quot;Approximately 18 percent of alcoholics commit suicide&quot; really surprised me. It seemed to pop right out of the middle of nowhere, and there was no further discussion of it. Maybe a little bit more context would be good?
*I found the sentence &quot;The age at which licit drugs of abuse such as alcohol can be purchased as well as banning or restricting advertising of alcohol has been recommended.&quot; in the Prevention section, and I'm not really sure what it's supposed to say.
*I think the section on Risk factors might be giving P:WEIGHT|undue weight to the age of onset of alcohol use. A few paragraphs are spent on that, when all of the others are just glazed over.
*The way that percentages are written throughout the article should probably be standardized. I saw &quot;1 in 4,&quot; &quot;25%,&quot; &quot;25 percent,&quot; &quot;twenty-five per cent,&quot; and a few other variations while I was reading the article.

Thanks for the indepth review. :) Good suggestions, I am a bit too tired tonight to work on it but hopefully tomorrow I will get around to addressing those issues in the article. Believe it or not the article a while back was sourced to 25 percent commit suicide but it was disputed so I did more research and found secondary sources claiming 10 percent and others claiming 18 percent or 25 percent, so I chose the middle one, 18 percent. The suicide rate is quite high in sedative-hypnotic abusers, similar to the rates seen in schizophrenia and major depression. I am not sure what context you are looking for? Perhaps, why there is a high suicide rate, eg alcohol abuse both causing mental illness and worsening underlying conditions, social isolation, family loss, job loss etc or the different views on the level of suicide in alcoholics is the context you are thinking of? I agree that there is undue weight to age of onset of use and that there needs to be standardisation in the article and shall fix the poorly worded sentence.--ser:Literaturegeek|Literaturegeek | ser_talk:Literaturegeek |T@1k? 23:51, 24 March 2010 (UTC)

That's brilliant! I encountered the alcohol health articles a while ago and got frustrated at that they seemed to be biased pro-alcohol.. I guess there's a lot of money and time in that industry to sway facts towards less negative - but to set the record straight by coming at it from the bottom up is a good idea! I have made a few suggestions ( by applying them ) and will see if I can fit some more time in amongst other stuff. My other thoughts are to stick as closely to our MOS as per other diseases as possible ought to help, ( I wonder if there is an ICD code for example?) Have worn my eyes out for today too! --ser:leevanjackson|Lee∴V ser talk:leevanjackson|(talk • pecial:Contributions/leevanjackson|contribs) 01:06, 25 March 2010 (UTC)
Thanks Lee, yea they used to be terribly biased; the guy who did it, a sociologist who works for the alcohol industry, was banned indefinitely for sockpuppeteering and seems to have moved on. The ong-term effects of alcohol article was the worst, but is in much better shape now; it is frustratinging to see facts being distorted to harmful misinformation. Thanks for your helpful edits and suggestions. I found an ICD9 code but I am not entirely sure that it is correct, needs someone to check it.--ser:Literaturegeek|Literaturegeek | ser_talk:Literaturegeek |T@1k? 23:12, 26 March 2010 (UTC)

 Should health-related articles be held to a higher standard, like P:BLP|Biographies of living persons? 

Forgive me if this has already been canvassed here (and Wales' talk page may not be the most appropriate forum) but may I draw your attention to ser_talk:Jimbo_Wales#Wikipedia_giving_incorrect_medical_information_-_Should_health_related_articles_be_held_to_higher_standards_like_BLP|this suggestion? ser:Anthonyhcole|Anthony (ser talk:Anthonyhcole|talk) 09:55, 25 March 2010 (UTC) To be clear: I have no interest in the above discussion re HIV infection rates. On the face of it, this question about higher standards, if it hasn't already been dealt with, deserves consideration on its own merits. ser:Anthonyhcole|Anthony (ser talk:Anthonyhcole|talk) 10:29, 25 March 2010 (UTC)
Medically-related articles already benefit from P:MEDRS and P:MOSMED. I've commented on how we can raise standards at ser_talk:Jimbo_Wales#Wikipedia giving incorrect medical information - Should health related articles be held to higher standards like BLP|Jimbo's talk page, but I disagree that standards can be raised by fiat. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 16:57, 25 March 2010 (UTC)
Having worked on medical articles at FAC and FAR, I feel they are generally analysed more rigorously than non-medical articles I have worked on. ser:Casliber|Casliber (ser talk:Casliber|talk · pecial:Contributions/Casliber|contribs) 19:30, 25 March 2010 (UTC)
I agree with Casliber in the fact that editors are already aware of the problems (and this page plays an essential role). So the question isn't should medical articles be held to a higher standard than articles about #random-subject – they already are and many editors (with more qualifications in the subject than I have) are working to keep it that way. ser:Physchim62|Physchim62 ser talk:Physchim62|(talk) 19:42, 25 March 2010 (UTC)

 In my opinion: no. ser:Axl|Axl ¤ ser talk:Axl|[Talk] 19:42, 25 March 2010 (UTC)

I'll c&amp;p this part:
Ah-huh. Incorrect information about risks of HIV transmission (when researchers sound alarm about HIV complacency [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11366820]) is comparable to large animals and carpentry. Very smart comparison there...
RexxS, we can ignore 3RR in BLP articles if there is an inaccuracy. Maybe we can have the same thing for health related articles. ser:Phoenix_of9|Phoenixser talk:Phoenix_of9| of9 19:44, 25 March 2010 (UTC)

My responses here are the same as I made on Jimbo's page:
*We should be striving to raise the standard of all Wikipedia articles, and medically-related articles are no exception. Raising a standard requires effort from many contributors and we are fortunate that BLP attracts sufficient input to allow us to set extra criteria for the content. To try to prioritise improvements from the point of view of consequences of misuse of information is to look at it from the wrong end. Volunteer contributors will each make their own decisions about where they contribute, and the only way to raise the standard of articles is to get people interested in them. In fact, medically-related articles already benefit from the remarkably active WikiProject Medicine ... I would also remind you of the very high standard of sourcing required for medical articles, as outlined in P:MEDRS, and the additional criteria for content and style as documented at P:MOSMED. That these exist is already proof of the willingness of Wikipedians to strive to improve our coverage of medicine.
*All of us would be better off if we stick to 1RR – if something is wrong with an article, BLP or medical, you can find lots of other people at the WikiProjects who are willing to help you combat obvious vandalism and libel. P:AIV and P:BLP/N can deal with more contentious cases. There's really no need to get anywhere near 3R other than when combating a persistent vandal, and P:RBI is the best solution for that. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 22:06, 25 March 2010 (UTC)

I had in mind the outright banning of primary sources from medical articles. I cannot imagine a circumstance when it would be okay for an article to present evidence supported only by primary sources. And if they were banned alk:Autism#MIND_Institute_research|this type of time-wasting would be avoided, and there would be no opening for P:SYN|synthesis. ser:Anthonyhcole|Anthony (ser talk:Anthonyhcole|talk) 20:11, 25 March 2010 (UTC)

The existing guidelines on OR are pretty clear. WP:MEDRS and WP:MOSMED are good too. I'm against banning any type of verified reliable source based on any arbitrary criteria like primary/secondary. Most articles that present research have an introduction and discussion section that are essentially secondary source information. Maybe Anthony could give some examples of what kind of source is unacceptable?

On the other hand, BLP has a policy of removing contentious unsourced information that I think should also be used for medical articles due to liability purposes. - ser:Stillwaterising|Stillwaterising (ser talk:Stillwaterising|talk) 21:05, 25 March 2010 (UTC)

I think you'll find it's a bit more complicated than that.  
Using primary sources is appropriate in some cases.  Primary sources can provide details (what's interesting to our readers is not always what's interesting to a professional audience), show diversity of opinions on disputed points, and provide useful examples.  We may not have much choice in some cases:  For rare conditions, the overwhelming majority of high-quality sources may be primary sources.  There are thousands of rare diseases, which means (eventually) thousands of articles about rare diseases.  Our readers are not best served by banning as much as 90% of what's been published about exceedingly rare diseases like DDD (243 cases reported, worldwide, ever).
Also, while inappropriate recentism is deplorable, the academic press is slow.  New information that's getting an enormous amount of media attention shouldn't be suppressed for a year while we wait for someone to write a proper a review paper.  We're usually better off citing peer-reviewed medical sources, even if they're primary sources, than relying on newspaper articles about them, even if the newspaper article is a secondary source. 
There are, in short, good reasons to use primary sources -- with due care, and in strict moderation -- and our articles would frequently be worse if we issued a one-size-fits-all blanket ban on primary sources.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 21:10, 25 March 2010 (UTC)
Standards will not be raised by taking any kind of decision here, standards will only be as high as our work. There are thousands of poorly written med articles, and the solution is not to say that they should be better; but to improve them.--ser:Garrondo|Garrondo (ser talk:Garrondo|talk) 22:03, 25 March 2010 (UTC)
I agree, Stillwaterising, that the introductions in some primary research papers provide useful independent summaries of a field, and have no problem seeing them used in an article, but the paper's results, and the author's interpretation of them should wait for an independent review. As for examples of sources I find unacceptable, pick anything that's not a peer-reviewed independent summary, a systematic review or a recent university-level textbook. I don't trust myself, let alone you, to cherry pick primary research. (No reflection on you, by the way. I have no idea who you are, but that's the point.)  And I like the idea of erasing all poorly sourced assertions in medical articles. But it looks like I'm alone here, so I bow to the wisdom of the majority. ser:Anthonyhcole|Anthony (ser talk:Anthonyhcole|talk) 23:51, 25 March 2010 (UTC)

I think that we all agree that articles should ideally be based primarily on secondary sources of exactly the kind you name, and that secondary sources should be relied upon whenever possible (which, for common conditions like ypertension, is &quot;always&quot;).  It's just that primary sources have their place, too (e.g., filling in a minor detail).  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 19:18, 26 March 2010 (UTC)

 Where Do I Find Free Access to Publications? 

Does anybody know how to get free access to research articles through ScienceDirect or other services? The only two things I can think of are either to find a terminal in a university library with an online subscription or ask with them directly to give out a complimentary subscription as a Wikipedia editor. Any thoughts? - ser:Stillwaterising|Stillwaterising (ser talk:Stillwaterising|talk) 20:20, 25 March 2010 (UTC)
 I use ubmed. I prefer to search for free full-text articles. ser:Axl|Axl ¤ ser talk:Axl|[Talk] 20:26, 25 March 2010 (UTC)
My university, in Western Australia, offers &quot;community membership&quot; which allows access to all it's subscribed journals, for a not-very-big fee.  ser:Anthonyhcole|Anthony (ser talk:Anthonyhcole|talk) 20:36, 25 March 2010 (UTC)
Thanks for the tip Anthony, do you have a link? Free sources are preferred of course, however I can't count the number of times this week I've ran into an article I really needed that had a hefty price tag. I can't in conscious use an abstract as a source without reading the whole paper. Nor can I afford to pay more than $30-$50/month for a subscription. - ser:Stillwaterising|Stillwaterising (ser talk:Stillwaterising|talk) 21:14, 25 March 2010 (UTC)

One of the biggest libraries in North America is in your hometown.  Why don't you call them and ask what kind of resources are available to the general public?

Thank you What, I called them up.  I seems like I can register for guest access to all resources. Webpage [http://lib.utexas.edu/visitors/ here]. I guess I can take a small number of requests for articles from other editors. They said that some can be printed, others have a limit on the numbers of pages that can be printed and most can be emailed from the library. - ser:Stillwaterising|Stillwaterising (ser talk:Stillwaterising|talk) 13:50, 26 March 2010 (UTC)</segment>
