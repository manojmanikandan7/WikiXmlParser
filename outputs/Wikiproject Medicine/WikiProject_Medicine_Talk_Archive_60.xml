After more than a year of negotiations the Khan academy has agreed to release three videos under a CC BY SA license as a trial. I have added them to three articles.

I don't think these videos add anything of value to our articles. The blood flow through the heart video is simply a repeat of what is stated or implied in the article. There's nothing of educational value that is not already described in detail in the main article. I would be more impressed if you could find a video of a cardiomyocyte beating in a petri dish or in vivo, or something similar that expands upon, rather than repeat, the information in the main text.  -ser:A1candidate |A1candidate  14:39, 8 February 2015 (UTC)

 Nitrogen trichloride 

I don't really know anything about this, but I noticed that our articles itrogen trichloride and gene process make medical statements that are poorly sourced -- the latter article is referenced entirely to a paper in Medical Hypotheses, a notoriously unreliable journal.

It looks like itrogen trichloride simply refers to an article about a hypothesis, which is acceptably written/sourced and does not make any medical claims. gene process is written in a potentially biased manner and lacks sufficient sourcing, but the process itself may be notable enough for its own article.

 Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Gets Redefinition  

interesting article..systemic exertion intolerance disease ?[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/chronic-fatigue-syndrome-gets-controversial-redefinition/][http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/10/chronic-fatigue-syndrome-gets-a-new-name/?_r=0]--ser:Ozzie10aaaa|Ozzie10aaaa (ser talk:Ozzie10aaaa|talk) 21:46, 11 February 2015 (UTC)
This is a grave mistake by the panel. The name of a disease should be changed according to its pathophysiologic characteristics rather than clinical manifestations, IMO. -ser:A1candidate |A1candidate  23:46, 11 February 2015 (UTC)
probably,i wonder if they were under some sort of pressure to do so(Leonard Jason, a psychologist at DePaul University in Chicago...“As a community psychiatrist who values citizen participation in critical decisions, I think this was a strategic mistake,” [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/chronic-fatigue-syndrome-gets-controversial-redefinition/].) and the current NIH version[https://prevention.nih.gov/programs-events/pathways-to-prevention/workshops/me-cfs] and finally HHS [http://www.hhs.gov/advcomcfs/]--ser:Ozzie10aaaa|Ozzie10aaaa (ser talk:Ozzie10aaaa|talk) 00:38, 12 February 2015 (UTC)
I'm thinking that if they actually knew what the pathophysiologic characteristics were, then they would have used that to name it.  The diagnostic criteria seem to be:
# being tired,
# being even more tired if you try to do anything,
# unrefreshing sleep (new to the list), and
# rthostatic intolerance (I elide their &quot;or cognitive problems&quot;, because OI can cause cognitive problems). 
I had thought that [a long time ago] they were saying that people with OI do not having ME/CFS by definition, because OI's main symptom seems to be &quot;being tired, and being more tired if you try to do anything&quot;, and ME/CFS was supposed to be something different and unrelated.  OI is also associated with neurocognitive and sleep problems.  Even with this new definition, it's still not clear to me how one would decide that a patient has chronic OI but not CFS.  Is it even possible to differentiate these two now?  Do they intended for these two to be differentiated, or are they trying to define &quot;systemic exertion intolerance disease&quot; as &quot;severe OI&quot;, along the lines of MS vs MDD?  
On the other hand, it sounds like chronic OI plus leep apnea would also seem to fit this definition quite easily.  For that matter, so would untreated severe sleep apnea (which causes fatigue and unrefreshing sleep), having poor physical conditioning (feeling even more tired if you do anything), and early-stage dementia (cognitive problems).  For that matter, I think that chronic depression would probably also fit this bill:  all of those symptoms (except OI, but OI isn't required) can be caused by depression. 
I doubt that this definition will be satisfying to patient advocates.  It doesn't sufficiently differentiate the condition from other conditions.
(My interest in the subject stems largely from having incorrectly merged another article with the OI article years ago.  Fortunately, someone who knows more than I do reverted it.  So take all of these comments with a whole spoonful of salt.)  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 21:01, 12 February 2015 (UTC)

 osebud pornography article 

Seeing [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Sexual_slang&amp;curid=31779833&amp;diff=646793934&amp;oldid=646763100 this edit] by ser:Ulcerspar12|Ulcerspar12, I was brought to the attention of the Rosebud pornography article. Considering the extreme nature of the activity, meaning the involvement of ectal prolapse, it is more of a medical article than a sexual article. The sources therefore generally need to adhere to P:MEDRS. Ulcerspar12 also made [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rectal_prolapse&amp;diff=646819833&amp;oldid=637121419 this edit] to the Rectal prolapse article concerning rosebud pornography. Googling the topic of rosebud pornography, as seen [https://www.google.com/search?q=Rosebud+pornography&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8 here] and [https://www.google.com/search?q=Rosebud+pornography&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1 here], it does not seem significantly P:Notable; it has a few P:Reliable sources discussing how dangerous the rosebud practice is.

Thoughts? ser:Flyer22|Flyer22 (ser talk:Flyer22|talk) 22:28, 12 February 2015 (UTC)

I take your point that it could do with better referencing. I wonder whether the article would survive an AfD. It is a bit like the ay Nigger Association of America. The argument there was the offensive nature of the group meant that no one would write about it preventing the requisite sources for it to be covered.  Other pornographic niches like ukkake seem far better covered in literature both academic and non-academic. While &quot;rosebudding&quot; is undoubtedly a thing it seems a recently coined term and from what I can gather (being no expert in this area *blushes*) rectal prolapse porn seems to be a fairly recent invention.

Probably the best solution, if this particular topic warrants coverage—as noted, the sourcing is rather thin.

 volutionary medicine 

Don't know how many folks here are aware of this.  seems like a boatload of crystalball/pseudoscience to me, especially the section on evolutionary psychiatry.  oy. ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 20:32, 15 February 2015 (UTC)

You may be thinking of something else.  Evolutionary medicine is a modern area of scientific research.  They're the people who make pronouncements like 'eczema is common because humans evolved to live in a dirty environment full of pathogens and parasites, and now we wash our hands and don't let little kids roll around in fecal matter'.  
(Speaking of which, I saw a charity claiming that wearing diapers prevents intestinal worms in babies.  They wanted money to send cloth diapers to kids in developing countries whose families normally left them naked.  If anyone knows anything about this claimed health effect, then it would probably make a good addition to iaper.)  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 22:17, 15 February 2015 (UTC)

 Pirie's Bone 

Hi evereybody,

I wrote the Article de:Os talonaviculare dorsale. I found that it was described by A. Howard Pirie (Montreal) in 1921 and lots of references on that article. Medical Eponyms states, that the name is from an Scottish Radiologist. (See German article).

OK, there is a difference in Anglo-Saxon Literature, where Pirie's bone often refers to Os supratalare, I found. I added that to the article. 
May be, the Pirie's bone for the supratalare is related to the Scottish Radiologist? For supranaviculare/talonaviculare dorsale it is not. ser:Anka Friedrich|Anka Friedrich (ser talk:Anka Friedrich|talk) 16:22, 19 February 2015 (UTC)

You find both. Pirie's work in 1921 is on the bone today named Os talonaviculare dorsale or Os supranaviculare. I took an x-ray out of it, you find it in the article. You find that work referenced as work on Pirie's bone. Here is the original article: [https://archive.org/stream/americanjournroen08ameruoft#page/569]. Here is a reference: [https://books.google.de/books?id=DYErAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA544 Mann's Surgery of the Foot and Ankle. page 544].

 Yes, as described [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK27998/ here], the lood–cerebrospinal barrier (BCB) is both anatomically and physiologically quite distinct from the lood–brain barrier (BBB).

I think this is a tangent, but it reminds me of a discussion I had with a physical therapist a few years ago.  She used ENS a lot in her job, and she said that some ineman (occupation)|powerline workers who had received really bad electric shocks were very sensitive to the TENS units.  I guess that if a normal person would be treated at 50% power, than these men (it's a male-dominated occupation) would be in pain at just 10%.  Is there a name for this?

ake heading|sub=2|Double standards re notability

Hello Wikipedia Editor,

I should like to highlight a glaring disparity in the way, for example, a film due for release in the coming year, with no independent reviews as yet, is able to make it onto the pages of Wikipedia and yet another product that is not a film but has beneficial applications to mental health is not.

I refer of course to your disapproval of the page for the Hushe A-CES, a device which I used last year as part of a research study and found to be exceptionally good at alleviating my insomnia. As with anything that is relatively new, is it not a surprise there exists little third party subject matter on it? And yet a future release of a film is allowable by mere mention by the producer?

One feels a tiny bit like a character in George Orwell's 1984, with knowledge being controlled by the whim of those in control. The article I submitted about the Hushe A-CES cranial electrotherapy stimulator manufactured by Hushe Limited in the United Kingdom should not be suppressed just because it is little known of. As with a future film, or a past event, these are all real things. The mere fact that I have not identified a third party as a source of information should not be ground for exclusion and smacks of pedantry. If you look at the research study cited in my article you will find references to comments I and other third parties gave to the study administrator. Am I to infer from your stance that you do not regard this as third party material? If so, do you therefore agree that this implies falsification on the part of the author of that study? I am sure you appreciate the gravity of such an implied statement.

I would therefore encourage you to suggest a review of Wikipedia's notability policy and look forward to my article's equal treatment to the countless others which are permitted merely for adhering to cultural precepts of acceptability.

Kind regards

Original comment:

I would disagree. This absolutely smacks of the censorship this foundation was originally set up to overcome, so I congratulate you on stifling freedom of information. The chap who produces this device is not deserving of such disparaging remarks as have been implied. He has overcome a great deal of upset in his life from what I gather and now to have his work referred to as &quot;tries to look like a study&quot; would be quite unkind for him to know.
 
By all means, continue your locked-down attitude to your principles and ignore the blatant hypocrisy of having an &quot;other stuff exists&quot; get-out clause. In our reality there is such a thing as precedent, and without it you have a dictatorship.

 Hi Sandy, I am happy to be friendly when my comments are not get ng removed. The above comment was a complaint at what I see as an implied allegation of fraud levelled at a third party who happens to be an upstanding person, so you may appreciate my concern. Defamation and censorship are more unnacepatable than the grumblings (with perfectly decent language) of someone like me, I'm sure you would agree. ser:Friendlymilk|Friendlymilk (ser talk:Friendlymilk|talk) 17:56, 21 February 2015 (UTC)

Friendly it is a common misconception that Wikipedia is a forum for freedom of information or free speech, P:NOTFREESPEECH|we are not. We strive for a neutral point of view and that means that scientific articles need sources that meet scientific standards. All of our articles need independent reliable coverage, primary sources are not enough.

The difference between us and the inistry of Truth is that we don't try to control all information, just the information we choose to publish.

Censorship is when somebody says that you cannot publish something, not when they refuse to publish something for you. When someone refuses to publish something for you it is not censorship, it is editorial discretion. There are plenty of web hosts out there where you can express your freedom of speech but Wikipedia is a project to build an encyclopedia and you cannot expect you have freedom to post whatever you want.

Your topic may deserve coverage but that must be demonstrated through the standards of the project, claiming you are being censored or that you are suffering a dictatorship will not help your case. If you remain civil and present proper sources for your article then you will make much better progress. ser talk:Chillum|Chillum 18:16, 21 February 2015 (UTC)

Their relevant qualification is that they understand the policies governing editing Wikipedia. In this case P:SELFPUB which says:
quote|Self-published and questionable sources may be used as sources of information about themselves, usually in articles about themselves or their activities, without the self-published source requirement that they be published experts in the field, so long as:
* the material is neither unduly self-serving nor an ikipedia:Verifiability#Exceptional claims require exceptional sources|exceptional claim;
* it does not involve claims about third parties;
* it does not involve claims about events not directly related to the source;
* there is no reasonable doubt as to its authenticity;
* the article is not based primarily on such sources.
The article you wanted published was based solely on self-published sources and that disqualifies it immediately. You need to find reliable sources published by people other than the manufacturer. Check P:RS for tips on identifying reliable sources. Hope that helps. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 22:21, 21 February 2015 (UTC)

You're new here and we're all trying to educate you. Instead of taking our advice, you're getting offended. That's too bad. Was my comment above a bit impatient? Yes, it was. You come here making demands without knowing the policies and rules. We have provided you with information and links to them, but you show no evidence that you have read those rules or intend to follow them. When that happens, we tend you lose patience. &quot;Participants' commentaries&quot; are not third party sources. They barely even fit the lowest grade of evidence. They are merely necdotes and we can't use them for anything, and any website which uses them is skirting the limits of what's ethically allowable. It's VERY poor practice. We are asking for secondary and tertiary sources which show the notability of the subject. Without that, there will be no article. -- ser:BullRangifer|Brangifer (ser talk:BullRangifer|talk) 22:23, 21 February 2015 (UTC)

ser:Friendlymilk|Friendlymilk, this kind if thing is complicated.  There are two things that need to be considered.  The first is whether it gets its own, separate article.  To do that, it needs to meet the &quot;notability&quot; standards for being a manufactured product.  For that purpose, it needs to meet the same requirements as, say, a new type of mobile phone.  (There aren't special rules for medical devices.)  You can read about those at P:CORP.  The most important and usually most difficult requirement is a couple of P:INDY|independent source – nothing written by anyone involved in the organization.  A few regular magazine articles talking about its invention, manufacturing, marketing style, last year's sales, or things like that will do.  

Once you know whether a separate article is possible, or P:FAILN|whether this might be better briefly mentioned in a list of similar products or in a larger article, then you can contemplate what to say about it.

 Not if one editor can go around willy-nilly claiming moves are non-controversial, without noticing talk, and then removing the text at the top of the article that shows it was controversial!  If people don't read, they don't read ... ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 01:16, 22 February 2015 (UTC)
The alternative to &quot;one editor going around willy-nilly claiming moves are non-controversial&quot; is setting up a bureaucracy. Perhaps a committee should vote every time? It's just not workable. Punctuation normally does represent a non-controversial page move, and it can be reverted when someone really cares. In this case, liberal use of hyphenation is recommended in professional guidelines about writing for international audiences, and the ICD-10 use the hyphenated version. The DSM's style guide avoids hyphenatation. It is not entirely unreasonable for editors to assume that the general rule is &quot;follow the international spelling, not the American one&quot;, since that is the general rule (just not one that we apply very often to psychiatric conditions).
If you (like me) really didn't care where it ends up, then why are choosing to spend so much time and energy contesting the move?  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 01:41, 22 February 2015 (UTC)

 Is Scientific American crappy as a medical source... ? 

I remember seeing Sci Am [http://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/wikipedia-dicey-as-medical-info-source1/ slamming WP] by referring to a crappy study that was discussed previously. Well, here is an example where they use a Wikipedia image I created and say it is something different:
[http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2015/02/09/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-americas-greatest-health-risk-of-2015/?WT.mc_id=SA_Twitter NFLD - America's Greatest Health Risk (scientificamerican.com)]

The picture of cirrhosis Sci Am used is due to alcohol! 

How could anyone know?  It is stated right in the image notes - https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cirrhosis_high_mag.jpg 
Above said, the image isn't suggestive of NAFLD. It isn't fatty.

The really unfortunate thing is... I created an image of NAFLD that they could have used. It is right here:  https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Non-alcoholic_fatty_liver_disease1.jpg  and it is on the atty liver page and on-alcoholic fatty liver disease page. Sheesh! ser:Nephron|Nephron ser_talk:Nephron| T|pecial:Contributions/Nephron|C 06:34, 14 February 2015 (UTC)
I've always regarded SciAm as a fairly entertaining pop-sci source, a sort of light bed-time reading. It's decent, but I'm not surprised they make this type of error. That said, it clearly fails P:MEDRS. Just out of curiousity, is it possible to differentiate NAFLD from alcohol induced cirrhosis through morphology alone? I was under the impression they look the same?

Also the article they're referring to has been discussed a lot here, and it's down to very poor methodology of the original article.

The distinction between ASH and NASH is essentially clinical. Abundant eutrophils slightly favour ASH -- but this is a soft finding. The cirrhosis picture is really end-stage -- the etiology cannot be ascertained from it. NAFLD usually has fat in it... so, I think the end-stage cirrhosis picture is a bad one for an article about NAFLD. Speaking more generally, the same applies for lung and kidney pathology... if it is really end-stage, it is (with few exceptions) hard or impossible to ascertain the underlying cause from a pathologic perspective. ser:Nephron|Nephron ser_talk:Nephron| T|pecial:Contributions/Nephron|C 16:22, 14 February 2015 (UTC)

I've said it a million times—'reliability' (on Wikipedia or anywhere else) isn't a magic, binary property that a particular publication has or doesn't have; it is assessed on a case-by-case basis based on the source, the particular claims in question, and the overall context. ser:TenOfAllTrades|TenOfAllTrades(ser_talk:TenOfAllTrades|talk) 17:30, 16 February 2015 (UTC)

Many thanks to Looie496 for bringing this to my attention. The mistake with the image was mine. As Nephron points out, I should've caught the distinction in the image notes. My apologies. I've now swapped out the image for the one showing NAFLD. Accuracy is incredibly important to us at Scientific American, and when errors are made we try to correct them as quickly as possible. To that end, I would encourage all of you reach to out to me or my colleagues whenever you spot something that's amiss. I think you'll find that we're quite responsive. As far this conversation about MEDRS is concerned, while we strive to produce content that is reliable and trustworthy, we are a news outlet, not a scholarly journal or medical publication, and when it comes to medical advice, people should rely on the primary literature or qualified medical professionals, just as we and other journalists do in the course of reporting. ser:Curtis Brainard|Curtis Brainard (ser talk:Curtis Brainard|talk) 19:27, 24 February 2015 (UTC)

With respect to EU law it states &quot;Member States must prohibit the advertising to the general public of medicinal products which are not intended for use without the intervention of a medical practitioner.&quot; 
&quot;All advertising to the general public of a medicinal product must be clearly identifiable as such&quot;
&quot;The Directive bans the inclusion in advertising of medicinal products to the general public of any information which compares the medicinal product with other treatments or products&quot; so it appears this company may be breaking EU law [http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/internal_market/single_market_for_goods/pharmaceutical_and_cosmetic_products/l21230_en.htm] ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk · pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 00:03, 25 February 2015 (UTC)

I'm betting that wasn't actually a copyvio.  It still would have been a violation of the Wikipedia policy, because we require proof via an OTRS ticket that the company intends to release the material under CC-BY-SA, but there's a difference between what we choose to accept and what's actually legal.  Generally the company, and therefore its agents, has the right to use its own copyrighted material however it wants (including posting it to Wikipedia), and that would make it a P:COPYVIO problem but not actually (legally) a copyright violation.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 04:06, 25 February 2015 (UTC)

Primary/Secondary sources

I would like some more guidance on the use of primary/secondary sources.  In eophagia I have been trying to improve the eophagia#Health risks section.  I thought it would be a good idea to give some examples of reports of roundworm ova in the soil samples, and so referenced some papers (two found the ova present, one found none).  Another editor removed the refs citing P:MEDRS.  So the question I would like help with is this: is it really better to find a review article which cites these findings than the papers reporting the findings themselves?  Does P:MEDRS apply in this case - ie that of giving examples of particular descriptive situations? ser:JMWt|JMWt (ser talk:JMWt|talk) 17:54, 25 February 2015 (UTC)
Does P:MEDRS apply in this case - yes, it does. You might be able to cite findings about the prevalence of eggs in soil to primary studies, as these are not strictly medical claims. But these are old papers (that's also a problem) and there should be secondary coverage of the matter. ser:Johnbod|Johnbod (ser talk:Johnbod|talk) 18:02, 25 February 2015 (UTC)

An article on the syndrome is not the same thing as an article about a foundation designed to research the syndrome.  I think this decision should be appealed, especially since a single user's opinion does not make a consensus to reject a draft.  Will somebody help me figure out how to appeal this?  Regardless, the page is an article about a non-profit and really any discussion of the science behind it is not relevant.  It meets both standards of notability - it has been involved in scientific research in both Europe and North America and garnered sufficient interest in sources like Bloomberg and other newspapers. ing|Bluerasberry, you did not actually provide any explanation for why you did not think it is notable other than state your conclusion.  Would you care to elaborate? ser:Doors22|Doors22 (ser talk:Doors22|talk) 01:27, 26 February 2015 (UTC)

Might be good to review P:NONPROFIT.

Your commentary is very much off point.  If you look at the P:NONPROFIT page it meets both criteria.  It is not a coatrack as the article only contains factual information about the foundation leaving no room for biased material.  The post finasteride syndrome page is not very relevant to this discussion so I suggest you take your agenda elsewhere.ser:Doors22|Doors22 (ser talk:Doors22|talk) 02:29, 26 February 2015 (UTC)
NONPROFIT says nothing about &quot;being cited in multiple reliable sources&quot;.  If you've gotten that impression, then I obviously need to re-write the guideline.  What you need is a source that is talking about the organization.  Something like  &quot;Foo Foundation, which was founded in 2006, has 10 paid staff and a thousand volunteers working to raise money for research&quot; is good.  &quot;According to Joe at the Foo Foundation, more research is needed&quot; is not.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 05:45, 27 February 2015 (UTC)

(there is really 1 solid independent source; there is the somewhat bizarre mention in the Bloomberg article which stricltly counts as independent but hm.. and  the other 4 are press releases by the organization or are scantily dressed news pieces based on press releases).   I remain concerned that if it is created it will become a coatrack, but i don't think that is grounds for failing.  if it is created, we'll just have to watch it. ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 15:16, 1 March 2015 (UTC)

The ikiversity:Wikiversity_Journal_of_Medicine/Editorial_board|editorial board of Wikiversity Journal of Medicine is seeking more members, to participate in deciding what articles to include in the journal, which in turn largely depends on whether they can be used to improve Wikipedia articles. Those interested may sign up directly in the list there.
The article on the table now is titled ikiversity:A case of Aerococcus urinae|A case of Aerococcus urinae, and it's discussion entry is located at ikipedia talk:Wikiversity#Aerococcus urinae case|Wikipedia talk:Wikiversity. ser:Mikael Häggström|Mikael Häggström (ser talk:Mikael Häggström|talk) 14:04, 3 March 2015 (UTC)
We have a medical journal now? We publish papers? They get assigned DOIs? Other journals exist too? Things happen quickly. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 15:34, 4 March 2015 (UTC)
Any decision as to whether the journal can be 'used to improve Wikipedia articles' will have to be taken on Wikipedia - and policy hasn't changed, we don't cite Wikis as sources. If you wish to propose a change of policy in this regard, I suggest you do so in the appropriate place, rather than repeatedly spamming this page. ser:AndyTheGrump|AndyTheGrump (ser talk:AndyTheGrump|talk) 17:45, 4 March 2015 (UTC)

I'm a bit confused by one comment suggesting that I post too seldom and another one that I post too often. In any case, the work currently on the table is not aimed at being used as a source, but to be used as one or two images in the Wikipedia article erococcus urinae, which currently lacks any images. ser:Mikael Häggström|Mikael Häggström (ser talk:Mikael Häggström|talk) 20:02, 4 March 2015 (UTC)
Images of course can be used. We allow &quot;primary research&quot; pictures else we would have very few. I do not mind if this source is cited when pictures from it are used.
Not a good source to support text, but hopefully the references it uses are suitable per P:MEDRS and blocks of text with refs may be usable ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk · pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 20:19, 4 March 2015 (UTC)

On a separate note, it's been problematic to find a proper talk page to discuss article submissions to Wikiversity Journal of Medicine. I've been posting at ikipedia:Wikiversity because it is easier to watch for those that frequent their Wikipedia watchlists more often so than their Wikiversity ones. On the other hand, I've gotten frequent complaints that the said page should be used for discussing technical matters such as how to link to Wikiversity pages. I therefore request to have a subpage of WikiProject Medicine for such article submissions, such as ikipedia:WikiProject_Medicine/Wikiversity_Journal (thanks ser:CFCF|CFCF for the idea). It would allow for an clear overview of article submissions rather than having them dispersed in the archive of this page. ser:Mikael Häggström|Mikael Häggström (ser talk:Mikael Häggström|talk) 20:53, 4 March 2015 (UTC)

If there could be one list of all current health articles (or any class of articles) and the alert here could be a notice that another has been added to the list of all classes which need watching, then that might be ideal. Do you have any suggestions from the Wiki Ed side of how this could work in a way that is best for you guys?

 Request Input on Evidence Aid Draft page 

Hi I am new and am working on a web page for Evidence Aid. It is in my sandbox https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:AmyEBHC/sandbox Please could someone look and see it it looks OK and also is there a template for the headings for pages like these or a checkpoint list where I can check I am in compliance before I send it for review  Thanks 
ser:AmyEBHC|AmyEBHC (ser talk:AmyEBHC|talk) 03:48, 5 March 2015 (UTC)

Is the goal to P:MOVE it into the mainspace (=make it a regular article)?  If so, then you might find some useful information at P:BFAQ.  However, there is no single checklist, because no checklist can cover everything, and editors often have different ideas about what's important. 
For the &quot;template for the headings&quot;, I'm not sure what you mean.  Do you want an elp:Infobox|infobox?  You P:DISINFOBOX|aren't required to have one, but they're very common for articles about organizations.  Use l|infobox organization if you want to have one.

The information in the article will need to be supported by references, meaning reputable published sources that are independent of the organization.  Also, parts of it are not written neutrally enough -- please remember that the purpose of a Wikipedia is to inform readers, not to change their attitudes.

 Template cleanup -- help needed! 

I've had a look at almost all medicine-related templates now as part of a general biology-related template cleanup effort. I've identified a list of 38 or-so medicine-related templates that I feel are especially in need of cleanup (about 5%). Most of these need cleanup in terms of making them easier or more logical to read, or easier for lay readers to understand and use. I'd be very grateful if other editors could help out by selecting one or two and helping out. The relevant templates are:

# Endocrine templates: variably split off content, almost all are sorted in a haphazard way according to the HPA, and l|Endocrine pathology is in need of a general cleanup.

If any users could have a look (or disagree with my assessment) I'd be very grateful... I've reached a loggerheads in terms of my editing of templates. Cheers, --ser:LT910001|Tom (LT) (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 10:30, 1 March 2015 (UTC)
Seems a good idea, but if they are correct, I don't personally have a problem with medics-only templates at the bottom of an article for complicated and technical things like the classification of tumours. It's keeping wads of such stuff from dominating the main text that is important. If a lay reader comes across such a term this may help them find our article.  ser:Johnbod|Johnbod (ser talk:Johnbod|talk) 17:49, 1 March 2015 (UTC)

 TBI 
I don't think my pingie thingies are working.  Could someone with journal access and knowledge of the topic please look at the edit request at alk:Traumatic brain injury?    Since that articles is (listed as ... ) a GA, and is an area I'm unfamiliar with, I don't want to add content.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 20:43, 2 March 2015 (UTC)
