After more than a year of negotiations the Khan academy has agreed to release three videos under a CC BY SA license as a trial. I have added them to three articles. I think videos are a good idea for Wikipedia and there is the potential of more videos to come. Doc James (talk ¬∑  ¬∑ ) 11:50, 8 February 2015 (UTC)
Wonderful, what do you make of these by the way? Entire channel is CC-BY https://www.youtube.com/user/awolfnp It takes me a few hours to download, convert, upload so I haven't gotten to it yet. -- CFCF üçå () 12:08, 8 February 2015 (UTC)

Doc James, blood flow through the heart is very good--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 14:25, 8 February 2015 (UTC)

I don't think these videos add anything of value to our articles. The blood flow through the heart video is simply a repeat of what is stated or implied in the article. There's nothing of educational value that is not already described in detail in the main article. I would be more impressed if you could find a video of a cardiomyocyte beating in a petri dish or in vivo, or something similar that expands upon, rather than repeat, the information in the main text.  -A1candidate  14:39, 8 February 2015 (UTC)
Different people learn in different ways. There videos on math would be excellent especially as much of our math content is difficult to understand. Doc James (talk ¬∑  ¬∑ ) 14:51, 8 February 2015 (UTC)
And what is so difficult to understand about blood flow through the heart? This isn't rocket science. -A1candidate  14:59, 8 February 2015 (UTC)
I think quite a few people would disagree with you there, the Frank-Starling mechanism isn't very straightforward. -- CFCF üçå () 15:10, 8 February 2015 (UTC)
Cardiac physiology is a suitable topic for videos, but a 2-minute discussion about the differences between veins and arteries would be more appropriate in the Simple English Wikipedia. -A1candidate  15:23, 8 February 2015 (UTC)
A1candidate, not everyone is an A1candidate. Wikipedia is not written (just) for medical students. Johnbod (talk) 15:24, 8 February 2015 (UTC)
It is written for the general reader, who I presume has a decent amount of general knowledge and knows what lungs, arteries, and veins are. -15:29, 8 February 2015 (UTC)
 A1Candidate, while that is true the reader gets more if he/she reads and sees what the article is about, I wonder if a Western blot would be so easy on paper as opposed to seeing where restriction enzymes must cut, how transformation works or transfection is done on a video?--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 15:40, 8 February 2015 (UTC)
It's generally a good idea to demonstrate specific laboratory techniques with the aid of diagrams and videos. Perhaps we could approach the Journal of Visualized Experiments to see if they're willing to donate something. The main issue I have with the Khan Academy is that they are neither a medical organization nor an academic publisher. As far as I know, none of their videos are peer-reviewed. -A1candidate  16:03, 8 February 2015 (UTC)
well then, im in partial agreement with you, (I would think peer review is best)--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 16:09, 8 February 2015 (UTC)
Very few of our pictures are &quot;peer reviewed&quot;. Why would it be different with videos. Of course if the above journal is interested in donating than would welcome them. Doc James (talk ¬∑  ¬∑ ) 12:53, 11 February 2015 (UTC)

Simple English is not for simplified information.  It is for people who do not speak English as their native language.  This project, on the other hand, is supposed to be able to educate native English speakers, including teenagers and people who didn't finish high school (or never even attended it).  It's true that 90% of American kids finish high school or get equivalent education now, but more than a quarter of American senior citizens didn't finish high school.[http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d13/tables/dt13_104.20.asp]  This project is supposed to be for those readers, too.

Nitrogen trichloride

I don't really know anything about this, but I noticed that our articles nitrogen trichloride and agene process make medical statements that are poorly sourced -- the latter article is referenced entirely to a paper in Medical Hypotheses, a notoriously unreliable journal.  It's not clear to me whether those articles (and a related section in List of food contamination incidents) are promoting a fringe theory. Looie496 (talk) 16:24, 11 February 2015 (UTC)
the latter might benefit from a hazard report[https://www.osha.gov/dts/chemicalsampling/data/CH_257450.html]--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 16:34, 11 February 2015 (UTC)
It looks like Nitrogen trichloride simply refers to an article about a hypothesis, which is acceptably written/sourced and does not make any medical claims. Agene process is written in a potentially biased manner and lacks sufficient sourcing, but the process itself may be notable enough for its own article. I think that the list of incidents falls more under a journalism than medical category, so does not need medically qualified sourcing. Mamyles (talk) 16:42, 11 February 2015 (UTC)

Dry Needling

The Dry Needling page could use more eyes if anyone is interested. It has a few IP's that have introduced unsourced promotional material. Herbxue (talk) 21:32, 10 February 2015 (UTC)

It's a mess of a modality. PT's are needling deep into the thoracic after 24 hours of training. Most of the recent incidents of pneumothorax in the US and Canada are caused by PT's or Chiro's needling people with minimal training. For reference, licensed acupuncturists have at least 2000 hours of training.Herbxue (talk) 06:16, 12 February 2015 (UTC)

Articles for Previous ICD-1 though ICD-8 codes?

We currently have articles with the codes for ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes (as well as ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS). I've seen the lists of the others on the web, including for example, ICD-6 at paho.org (Pan American Health Organization). http://www.wolfbane.com/icd/index.html appears to have the all, but hoping for clearcut public domain examples. Is this something that would be better at Wikisource?Naraht (talk) 15:58, 9 February 2015 (UTC)

Cholesterol
It appears that the guidelines are finally going to be changed to match the evidence. There is no and never was any good evidence that dietary cholesterol is &quot;bad&quot; for you.

Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Gets Redefinition 

interesting article..systemic exertion intolerance disease ?[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/chronic-fatigue-syndrome-gets-controversial-redefinition/][http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/10/chronic-fatigue-syndrome-gets-a-new-name/?_r=0]--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 21:46, 11 February 2015 (UTC)
This is a grave mistake by the panel. The name of a disease should be changed according to its pathophysiologic characteristics rather than clinical manifestations, IMO. -A1candidate  23:46, 11 February 2015 (UTC)
probably,i wonder if they were under some sort of pressure to do so(Leonard Jason, a psychologist at DePaul University in Chicago...‚ÄúAs a community psychiatrist who values citizen participation in critical decisions, I think this was a strategic mistake,‚Äù [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/chronic-fatigue-syndrome-gets-controversial-redefinition/].) and the current NIH version[https://prevention.nih.gov/programs-events/pathways-to-prevention/workshops/me-cfs] and finally HHS [http://www.hhs.gov/advcomcfs/]--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 00:38, 12 February 2015 (UTC)
I'm thinking that if they actually knew what the pathophysiologic characteristics were, then they would have used that to name it.  The diagnostic criteria seem to be:
# being tired,
# being even more tired if you try to do anything,
# unrefreshing sleep (new to the list), and
# orthostatic intolerance (I elide their &quot;or cognitive problems&quot;, because OI can cause cognitive problems). 
I had thought that [a long time ago] they were saying that people with OI do not having ME/CFS by definition, because OI's main symptom seems to be &quot;being tired, and being more tired if you try to do anything&quot;, and ME/CFS was supposed to be something different and unrelated.  OI is also associated with neurocognitive and sleep problems.  Even with this new definition, it's still not clear to me how one would decide that a patient has chronic OI but not CFS.  Is it even possible to differentiate these two now?  Do they intended for these two to be differentiated, or are they trying to define &quot;systemic exertion intolerance disease&quot; as &quot;severe OI&quot;, along the lines of PMS vs PMDD?  
On the other hand, it sounds like chronic OI plus sleep apnea would also seem to fit this definition quite easily.  For that matter, so would untreated severe sleep apnea (which causes fatigue and unrefreshing sleep), having poor physical conditioning (feeling even more tired if you do anything), and early-stage dementia (cognitive problems).  For that matter, I think that chronic depression would probably also fit this bill:  all of those symptoms (except OI, but OI isn't required) can be caused by depression. 
I doubt that this definition will be satisfying to patient advocates.  It doesn't sufficiently differentiate the condition from other conditions.
(My interest in the subject stems largely from having incorrectly merged another article with the OI article years ago.  Fortunately, someone who knows more than I do reverted it.  So take all of these comments with a whole spoonful of salt.)  WhatamIdoing (talk) 21:01, 12 February 2015 (UTC)
I agree with you WhatamIdoing , I don't believe it will satisfy patient advocates either--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 21:43, 12 February 2015 (UTC)



Hello, everyone.  Here's another of those old AfC submissions.  The text of this article indicates a tenured professor with many published articles.  Is this a notable subject?

Rosebud pornography article

Seeing [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Sexual_slang&amp;curid=31779833&amp;diff=646793934&amp;oldid=646763100 this edit] by Ulcerspar12, I was brought to the attention of the Rosebud pornography article. Considering the extreme nature of the activity, meaning the involvement of rectal prolapse, it is more of a medical article than a sexual article. The sources therefore generally need to adhere to . Ulcerspar12 also made [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rectal_prolapse&amp;diff=646819833&amp;oldid=637121419 this edit] to the Rectal prolapse article concerning rosebud pornography. Googling the topic of rosebud pornography, as seen [https://www.google.com/search?q=Rosebud+pornography&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8 here] and [https://www.google.com/search?q=Rosebud+pornography&amp;btnG=Search+Books&amp;tbm=bks&amp;tbo=1 here], it does not seem significantly ; it has a few  discussing how dangerous the rosebud practice is.

Thoughts? Flyer22 (talk) 22:28, 12 February 2015 (UTC)

I take your point that it could do with better referencing. I wonder whether the article would survive an AfD. It is a bit like the Gay Nigger Association of America. The argument there was the offensive nature of the group meant that no one would write about it preventing the requisite sources for it to be covered.  Other pornographic niches like bukkake seem far better covered in literature both academic and non-academic. While &quot;rosebudding&quot; is undoubtedly a thing it seems a recently coined term and from what I can gather (being no expert in this area *blushes*) rectal prolapse porn seems to be a fairly recent invention. Wikipedia does throw up some wonderful topics doesn't it?! Ulcerspar12 (talk) 23:34, 12 February 2015 (UTC)

If it were simply a term matter, I'd cite . Flyer22 (talk) 01:39, 13 February 2015 (UTC)

 The article is currently short enough to be simply moved to Rectal_prolapse#In_pornography, which would avoid the neologism problem. ‚Äî Sebastian 05:53, 13 February 2015 (UTC)

Probably the best solution, if this particular topic warrants coverage‚Äîas noted, the sourcing is rather thin.  (Honestly, Rule 34 means that just about any article would otherwise eventually attract a corresponding article (pornography).) TenOfAllTrades(talk) 15:59, 13 February 2015 (UTC)

Lunaception

Apparently &quot;a practice that purports to enable a woman to know ahead of time when she will be fertile each month, based on practices stated by its advocate to be found in many non-urban cultures&quot; which were it to work would mean the women involved &quot;would no longer need to use any form of contraception such as pills and devices&quot;. I was tempted to AfD this, but wondered if anyone from WikiProject Medicine had suggestions as to whether any of it should be merged with another article - if only to say that it doesn't work, which seems to my admittedly-untrained opinion to quite possibly be the case. Especially since the only supposed evidence for it is based on &quot;testimonials&quot;, with the obvious difficulties that entails... AndyTheGrump (talk) 07:42, 13 February 2015 (UTC)

Hyalophagia
I've searched PubMed and Google books, and can only find definitions of hyalophagia-- that it is a manifestation of pica (disorder). I've come up with no MEDRS-compliant discussion beyond one speculative case report in an Indian journal ([http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3452446/pdf/12262_2008_Article_40.pdf PDF]).   If anyone has access to DSM-5, could they let me know if there is anything written there on hyalophagia that cannot be included at pica (disorder)?  Otherwise, I will propose a merger to pica; there's no reason for a student to start chunking in content here that may belong at pica.  I can't find anything that can be said on this topic.  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 18:07, 12 February 2015 (UTC)

Related -- article naming
Related to the dearth of info on hyalophagia, see geophagy.  There are a whole ton of types of pica (disorder),  but some of the articles are phagia, while others are phagy. What should that be standardized to (see [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pica_%28disorder%29&amp;oldid=646586803#Signs_and_symptoms here])?  And an uncited mess at Coprophagia; which of these article should be merged and redirected to pica (disorder)?  How much distinguishing info can be found in DSM-5?  I do not have the DSM.  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 18:14, 12 February 2015 (UTC)
 At , only geophagy is differently named.  The rest are agias.  Should it be moved?  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 18:20, 12 February 2015 (UTC)
I took a quick look and it seems that geophagy is used more than geophagia as the name in the general lexicon, and dictionaries list geophagia as an alternate to geophagy (ex: [http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/geophagia Merriam-Webster]. However, Pubmed gives me 83 hits for geophagy and 2661 for geophagia...so perhaps we should move it, dictionaries be damned. Keilana|Parlez ici 19:21, 12 February 2015 (UTC)
 I've been digging around in the suite, and it does seem that the agais are the way to go.  But I will wait to see what anyone who has access to DSM-5 says.  Thanks, Keilana!  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 19:23, 12 February 2015 (UTC)
 Wow, I, uh, just realized I have access to the DSM-5 (d'oh!). The entry on pica didn't mention geophagy or geophagia, and a search turned up nothing. So that's not particularly useful.  Keilana|Parlez ici 19:53, 12 February 2015 (UTC)
 THanks, .  Does the DSM mention any of these subtypes?  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 20:12, 12 February 2015 (UTC)
  Anytime! :) Unfortunately the DSM only talks about the subtypes in terms of what unusual things people eat. Would you like a copy of the DSM article on pica? Keilana|Parlez ici 20:52, 12 February 2015 (UTC)
 Unless it goes into detail on the sub-types, thanks but no thanks :)  I just want to know if we should redirect.  I propose, then, that any of the sub-type articles for which I cannot locate other-than-case reports should be merged and redirected to pica (disorder) ... anyone else ?   And we should standardize them to &quot;phagia&quot; instead of &quot;phagy&quot;.  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 20:56, 12 February 2015 (UTC)
 It doesn't particularly go into detail, unfortunately. So I agree, where there's no MEDRS available the subtypes should redirect. Nice work on these. Let me know if you ever need anything else from the DSM, though - happy to provide! :) Keilana|Parlez ici 21:00, 12 February 2015 (UTC)

Geomelophagia
Similarly, I cannot find enough sources to convince me that Geomelophagia should not be a redirect to pica (disorder).  It looks like there is one case report in PubMed.  Is it listed in DSM5 ?  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 19:34, 12 February 2015 (UTC)

Same at Amylophagia; several case reports in PubMed, but I can't find a review.  Should all of these redirect to pica (disorder)?  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 19:56, 12 February 2015 (UTC)
I don't think that one (which involves eating actual food) should be re-directed to a subject defined as &quot;an appetite for substances that are largely non-nutritive, such as paper, clay, metal, chalk, soil, glass, or sand.&quot;  Eating flour right out of the canister doesn't appeal to me (I'll take my flour with butter and eggs and dark chocolate, please), but it's definitely not &quot;non-nutritive&quot;.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 23:02, 12 February 2015 (UTC)
 That troubled me as well, but the source I found (that appears highly reliable ??) lists it as a Pica disorder.

Even i it's true, and there's some sort of &quot;if it seems weird enough to me&quot; clause in the pica definition, I think that a merge would be confusing to readers.  Imagine that you want to look this up.  You search for the name, and you get re-directed to an article that says &quot;This page is about eating non-food&quot;.  You'll assume that you're in the wrong place.  It would be less confusing to leave it separate and write &quot;Although this involves food, Dr Big says that this is a form of pica&quot; in the article.

Evolutionary medicine

Don't know how many folks here are aware of this.  seems like a boatload of crystalball/pseudoscience to me, especially the section on evolutionary psychiatry.  oy. Jytdog (talk) 20:32, 15 February 2015 (UTC)
Probably. Practicing medicine, is the opposite of evolutionary theory as medical care is helping the sick and weak to survive and potentially thrive and reproduce etc.--WholeNewJourney (talk) 21:37, 15 February 2015 (UTC)
You may be thinking of something else.  Evolutionary medicine is a modern area of scientific research.  They're the people who make pronouncements like 'eczema is common because humans evolved to live in a dirty environment full of pathogens and parasites, and now we wash our hands and don't let little kids roll around in fecal matter'.  
(Speaking of which, I saw a charity claiming that wearing diapers prevents intestinal worms in babies.  They wanted money to send cloth diapers to kids in developing countries whose families normally left them naked.  If anyone knows anything about this claimed health effect, then it would probably make a good addition to Diaper.)  WhatamIdoing (talk) 22:17, 15 February 2015 (UTC)
Ah yes, you are right WAID. The article in question still needs a good clean up though like many of our articles.--WholeNewJourney (talk) 20:59, 16 February 2015 (UTC)

Pirie's Bone

Hi evereybody,

I wrote the Article . I found that it was described by A. Howard Pirie (Montreal) in 1921 and lots of references on that article. Medical Eponyms states, that the name is from an Scottish Radiologist. (See German article). Anybody interested to work on this? --Anka Friedrich (talk) 10:08, 19 February 2015 (UTC)

OK, there is a difference in Anglo-Saxon Literature, where Pirie's bone often refers to Os supratalare, I found. I added that to the article. 
May be, the Pirie's bone for the supratalare is related to the Scottish Radiologist? For supranaviculare/talonaviculare dorsale it is not. Anka Friedrich (talk) 16:22, 19 February 2015 (UTC)

You find both. Pirie's work in 1921 is on the bone today named Os talonaviculare dorsale or Os supranaviculare. I took an x-ray out of it, you find it in the article. You find that work referenced as work on Pirie's bone. Here is the original article: [https://archive.org/stream/americanjournroen08ameruoft#page/569]. Here is a reference: [https://books.google.de/books?id=DYErAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA544 Mann's Surgery of the Foot and Ankle. page 544].

RfC on appropriateness of medical sources

An RfC on Safety of electronic cigarettes has been started regarding the appropriateness of statements released by medical organizations as sourcing for medical content.

Blood‚Äìbrain barrier &amp; Blood‚ÄìCSF barrier

The blood-brain barrier article has a redlink to blood‚Äìcerebrospinal-fluid barrier, while blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier redirects to blood-brain barrier. Are the blood-brain barrier and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier functionally/structurally distinct?  We either need a new redirect to BBB or a new article on the B-CSF barrier to fix this inconsistency. Seppi333 (Insert 2¬¢ | ) 04:09, 20 February 2015 (UTC)

 Yes, as described [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK27998/ here], the blood‚Äìcerebrospinal barrier (BCB) is both anatomically and physiologically quite distinct from the blood‚Äìbrain barrier (BBB). A separate article on the BCB would be appropriate. Boghog (talk) 07:33, 20 February 2015 (UTC)

Perhaps, but what about changing the redirect to choroid plexus? Looie496 (talk) 17:00, 20 February 2015 (UTC)

I think this is a tangent, but it reminds me of a discussion I had with a physical therapist a few years ago.  She used TENS a lot in her job, and she said that some powerline workers who had received really bad electric shocks were very sensitive to the TENS units.  I guess that if a normal person would be treated at 50% power, than these men (it's a male-dominated occupation) would be in pain at just 10%.  Is there a name for this?

Braverman

The Eric R. Braverman article needs attention. The hagiography was written by a research assistant at his &quot;PATH Foundation&quot;.

Braverman is a fringe doctor with many issues: unscientific and unethical practices, questionable claims and testing methods, seriously misleading billing methods, exorbitant fees, disciplinary issues involving medical boards and state Attorney General, lawsuits by patients, Better Business Bureau rating of &quot;F&quot;, recent arrest, etc..

The current hagiography needs to be worked over and balanced with other aspects about his career and practices, per NPOV, which requires that documented controversies and criticism are included. Barrett has recently done a thorough in-depth investigation, using many RS which we can also use: [http://www.quackwatch.org/11Ind/braverman/overview.html Some Notes on Dr. Eric Braverman and his PATH Medical Clinic]. -- Brangifer (talk) 16:23, 21 February 2015 (UTC)

Comment on Draft:Hushe A-CES

Earlier today I rejected the submission of , a cranial electrotherapy stimulator, as it is solely referenced by two primary sources
* - the product manual, and
* - a &quot;research paper&quot; hosted on the manufacturers web page; a 10 sec glance reveals that it just tries to look like a study, it has not been published, and the author, Christopher D. James, appears to be the [http://www.cranialelectrotherapy.co.uk/ces-information/about-us designer of the product].

The submitter, , has left the following message on my talk page:

Talkquote|


Hello Wikipedia Editor,

I should like to highlight a glaring disparity in the way, for example, a film due for release in the coming year, with no independent reviews as yet, is able to make it onto the pages of Wikipedia and yet another product that is not a film but has beneficial applications to mental health is not.

I refer of course to your disapproval of the page for the Hushe A-CES, a device which I used last year as part of a research study and found to be exceptionally good at alleviating my insomnia. As with anything that is relatively new, is it not a surprise there exists little third party subject matter on it? And yet a future release of a film is allowable by mere mention by the producer?

One feels a tiny bit like a character in George Orwell's 1984, with knowledge being controlled by the whim of those in control. The article I submitted about the Hushe A-CES cranial electrotherapy stimulator manufactured by Hushe Limited in the United Kingdom should not be suppressed just because it is little known of. As with a future film, or a past event, these are all real things. The mere fact that I have not identified a third party as a source of information should not be ground for exclusion and smacks of pedantry. If you look at the research study cited in my article you will find references to comments I and other third parties gave to the study administrator. Am I to infer from your stance that you do not regard this as third party material? If so, do you therefore agree that this implies falsification on the part of the author of that study? I am sure you appreciate the gravity of such an implied statement.

I would therefore encourage you to suggest a review of Wikipedia's notability policy and look forward to my article's equal treatment to the countless others which are permitted merely for adhering to cultural precepts of acceptability.

Kind regards

 The following comment was deleted but has been reinstated to allow freedom of expression. The censors remark has itself been censored so he may feel treated equally:

Original comment:

I would disagree. This absolutely smacks of the censorship this foundation was originally set up to overcome, so I congratulate you on stifling freedom of information. The chap who produces this device is not deserving of such disparaging remarks as have been implied. He has overcome a great deal of upset in his life from what I gather and now to have his work referred to as &quot;tries to look like a study&quot; would be quite unkind for him to know.
 
By all means, continue your locked-down attitude to your principles and ignore the blatant hypocrisy of having an &quot;other stuff exists&quot; get-out clause. In our reality there is such a thing as precedent, and without it you have a dictatorship.

 Hi Sandy, I am happy to be friendly when my comments are not get ng removed. The above comment was a complaint at what I see as an implied allegation of fraud levelled at a third party who happens to be an upstanding person, so you may appreciate my concern. Defamation and censorship are more unnacepatable than the grumblings (with perfectly decent language) of someone like me, I'm sure you would agree. Friendlymilk (talk) 17:56, 21 February 2015 (UTC)

Friendly it is a common misconception that Wikipedia is a forum for freedom of information or free speech, . We strive for a neutral point of view and that means that scientific articles need sources that meet scientific standards. All of our articles need independent reliable coverage, primary sources are not enough.

The difference between us and the Ministry of Truth is that we don't try to control all information, just the information we choose to publish.

Censorship is when somebody says that you cannot publish something, not when they refuse to publish something for you. When someone refuses to publish something for you it is not censorship, it is editorial discretion. There are plenty of web hosts out there where you can express your freedom of speech but Wikipedia is a project to build an encyclopedia and you cannot expect you have freedom to post whatever you want.

Your topic may deserve coverage but that must be demonstrated through the standards of the project, claiming you are being censored or that you are suffering a dictatorship will not help your case. If you remain civil and present proper sources for your article then you will make much better progress. Chillum 18:16, 21 February 2015 (UTC)

Why exactly are some of you so condescending? What exactly are your qualifications if you don't mind my asking?Friendlymilk (talk) 22:05, 21 February 2015 (UTC)

Their relevant qualification is that they understand the policies governing editing Wikipedia. In this case  which says:
cquote|Self-published and questionable sources may be used as sources of information about themselves, usually in articles about themselves or their activities, without the self-published source requirement that they be published experts in the field, so long as:
* the material is neither unduly self-serving nor an ;
* it does not involve claims about third parties;
* it does not involve claims about events not directly related to the source;
* there is no reasonable doubt as to its authenticity;
* the article is not based primarily on such sources.
The article you wanted published was based solely on self-published sources and that disqualifies it immediately. You need to find reliable sources published by people other than the manufacturer. Check  for tips on identifying reliable sources. Hope that helps. --RexxS (talk) 22:21, 21 February 2015 (UTC)

 Not that it makes any difference, but I'm a health care professional, but the ONLY qualification that is relevant here is that I know the rules here better than you. We all do. You're new here and we're all trying to educate you. Instead of taking our advice, you're getting offended. That's too bad. Was my comment above a bit impatient? Yes, it was. You come here making demands without knowing the policies and rules. We have provided you with information and links to them, but you show no evidence that you have read those rules or intend to follow them. When that happens, we tend you lose patience. &quot;Participants' commentaries&quot; are not third party sources. They barely even fit the lowest grade of evidence. They are merely anecdotes and we can't use them for anything, and any website which uses them is skirting the limits of what's ethically allowable. It's VERY poor practice. We are asking for secondary and tertiary sources which show the notability of the subject. Without that, there will be no article. -- Brangifer (talk) 22:23, 21 February 2015 (UTC)

Friendlymilk, this kind if thing is complicated.  There are two things that need to be considered.  The first is whether it gets its own, separate article.  To do that, it needs to meet the &quot;notability&quot; standards for being a manufactured product.  For that purpose, it needs to meet the same requirements as, say, a new type of mobile phone.  (There aren't special rules for medical devices.)  You can read about those at .  The most important and usually most difficult requirement is a couple of  source ‚Äì nothing written by anyone involved in the organization.  A few regular magazine articles talking about its invention, manufacturing, marketing style, last year's sales, or things like that will do.  

Once you know whether a separate article is possible, or , then you can contemplate what to say about it.  Claims about sales need ; claims about  need .  WhatamIdoing (talk) 22:49, 21 February 2015 (UTC)

The alternative to &quot;one editor going around willy-nilly claiming moves are non-controversial&quot; is setting up a bureaucracy. Perhaps a committee should vote every time? It's just not workable. Punctuation normally does represent a non-controversial page move, and it can be reverted when someone really cares. In this case, liberal use of hyphenation is recommended in professional guidelines about writing for international audiences, and the ICD-10 use the hyphenated version. The DSM's style guide avoids hyphenatation. It is not entirely unreasonable for editors to assume that the general rule is &quot;follow the international spelling, not the American one&quot;, since that is the general rule (just not one that we apply very often to psychiatric conditions).
If you (like me) really didn't care where it ends up, then why are choosing to spend so much time and energy contesting the move?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 01:41, 22 February 2015 (UTC)
It's very easy to do an &quot;uncontroversial&quot; move. Fortunately it's also very easy to get it put back. Johnbod (talk) 04:28, 23 February 2015 (UTC)

World Health Organization textbook &quot;borrows&quot; from Wikipedia
I was happily updating our cardiovascular disease articles today when I came across a picture of mine in a WHO textbook.[http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241564373_eng.pdf] There are about 11 images in the book taken from Wikipedia and thus they make up an integral part of the total. Attribution is not of great quality.

I am currently requesting that the WHO consider release the entire book under a CC BY SA license.  are the maps in this document copyrightable by WHO? Or do they not contain enough originality to be copyrightable? Doc James (talk ¬∑  ¬∑ ) 19:01, 23 February 2015 (UTC)

It's being used in a similar way to references, so each entry in the &quot;figure reference&quot; list can be used multiple times.

Is Scientific American crappy as a medical source... ?

I remember seeing Sci Am [http://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/wikipedia-dicey-as-medical-info-source1/ slamming WP] by referring to a crappy study that was discussed previously. Well, here is an example where they use a Wikipedia image I created and say it is something different:
[http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2015/02/09/non-alcoholic-fatty-liver-disease-americas-greatest-health-risk-of-2015/?WT.mc_id=SA_Twitter NFLD - America's Greatest Health Risk (scientificamerican.com)]

The picture of cirrhosis Sci Am used is due to alcohol! 

How could anyone know?  It is stated right in the image notes - https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cirrhosis_high_mag.jpg 
Above said, the image isn't suggestive of NAFLD. It isn't fatty.

The really unfortunate thing is... I created an image of NAFLD that they could have used. It is right here:  https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Non-alcoholic_fatty_liver_disease1.jpg  and it is on the fatty liver page and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease page. Sheesh! Nephron  T| 06:34, 14 February 2015 (UTC)
I've always regarded SciAm as a fairly entertaining pop-sci source, a sort of light bed-time reading. It's decent, but I'm not surprised they make this type of error. That said, it clearly fails . Just out of curiousity, is it possible to differentiate NAFLD from alcohol induced cirrhosis through morphology alone? I was under the impression they look the same?

Also the article they're referring to has been discussed a lot here, and it's down to very poor methodology of the original article. SciAm just report it, and let's face it they're also interested in selling magazines ‚Äì slamming Wikipedia is popular among some academics, even if the study cited is objectionable. -- CFCF üçå () 09:11, 14 February 2015 (UTC)

The distinction between ASH and NASH is essentially clinical. Abundant neutrophils slightly favour ASH -- but this is a soft finding. The cirrhosis picture is really end-stage -- the etiology cannot be ascertained from it. NAFLD usually has fat in it... so, I think the end-stage cirrhosis picture is a bad one for an article about NAFLD. Speaking more generally, the same applies for lung and kidney pathology... if it is really end-stage, it is (with few exceptions) hard or impossible to ascertain the underlying cause from a pathologic perspective. Nephron  T| 16:22, 14 February 2015 (UTC)

Yup Sci Am is not a very good source. Doc James (talk ¬∑  ¬∑ ) 12:41, 14 February 2015 (UTC)

We currently allow Scientific American for some medical aspects; see [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources_%28medicine%29&amp;diff=646736293&amp;oldid=646735225#Popular_press this section] of WP:MEDRS, which certainly permits its use. But, as noted above, it is not a good medical source; unless restricted to non-medical cultural material or historical medical material, it's rather a decent or poor medical source, depending on the topic at hand. Flyer22 (talk) 15:27, 14 February 2015 (UTC)
Nephron, I'm happy to hear from you.  I wish I saw your name more often.  
Have you written to SciAm to request a correction?  What makes a source reliable isn't a belief that they're 100% right, but a reputation for prudent editorial control, including correcting their mistakes.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 05:31, 15 February 2015 (UTC)
I wrote them. I guess we'll see if things change. I would like to be around more... but another project and personal circumstances are currently limiting the time I have. I am still uploading things to the WikiCommons every once in a while. Nephron  T| 23:26, 16 February 2015 (UTC) 

*Note that this was a &quot;guest blog&quot; post.  Those would not be considered reliable sources for Wikipedia's purposes, because Scientific American disavows responsibility for their contents.  In other words they have basically the same status as a post on somebody's personal blog.  Their articles and news pieces are much more thoroughly checked, as I know from experience, having written for them.  Even so, I have sent an email to Curtis Brainard, Scientific American's blog editor, explaining the issue and giving a pointer to this page. Looie496 (talk) 16:19, 16 February 2015 (UTC)

A related question.  Where would the mag Nature fit in here?  Gandydancer (talk) 17:10, 16 February 2015 (UTC)

Nature is a top-quality source.  Most of their &quot;letters&quot; and &quot;articles&quot; constitute primary sources in the sense of , but when they publish reviews or perspectives, we can't ask for anything better. Looie496 (talk) 17:28, 16 February 2015 (UTC)

(ec) Generally we expect Nature to hold to a higher standard, being a publisher of peer-reviewed scientific research, rather than a newsstand popular science magazine.  That said, it depends where in Nature (articles? editorials? in-the-news blurbs?), the type of article (primary research articles versus review articles, etc.), and of course the nature of the claim.  I've said it a million times‚Äî'reliability' (on Wikipedia or anywhere else) isn't a magic, binary property that a particular publication has or doesn't have; it is assessed on a case-by-case basis based on the source, the particular claims in question, and the overall context.

Scientific American (informally abbreviated SciAm) is an American popular science magazine. It has a long history of presenting scientific information on a monthly basis to the general educated public, with careful attention to the clarity of its text and the quality of its specially commissioned color graphics... Many famous scientists, including Albert Einstein, have contributed articles in the past 168 years[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American]--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 15:22, 17 February 2015 (UTC)

MEDRS is clear on this, in the  section.  SciAm is not an RS for health-related content per se but is OK for &quot;social, biographical, current-affairs, financial, and historical information in a medical article.&quot;  If folks want to change MEDRS, the place to do that is on its Talk page.

Many thanks to Looie496 for bringing this to my attention. The mistake with the image was mine. As Nephron points out, I should've caught the distinction in the image notes. My apologies. I've now swapped out the image for the one showing NAFLD. Accuracy is incredibly important to us at Scientific American, and when errors are made we try to correct them as quickly as possible. To that end, I would encourage all of you reach to out to me or my colleagues whenever you spot something that's amiss. I think you'll find that we're quite responsive. As far this conversation about MEDRS is concerned, while we strive to produce content that is reliable and trustworthy, we are a news outlet, not a scholarly journal or medical publication, and when it comes to medical advice, people should rely on the primary literature or qualified medical professionals, just as we and other journalists do in the course of reporting.

Paid editing
Interesting case of this company Premia Spine Limited paying this Wikipedian  to write content about them and their products.

&quot;The Directive bans the inclusion in advertising of medicinal products to the general public of any information which compares the medicinal product with other treatments or products&quot; so it appears this company may be breaking EU law [http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/internal_market/single_market_for_goods/pharmaceutical_and_cosmetic_products/l21230_en.htm] Doc James (talk ¬∑  ¬∑ ) 00:03, 25 February 2015 (UTC)

I'm betting that wasn't actually a copyvio.  It still would have been a violation of the Wikipedia policy, because we require proof via an OTRS ticket that the company intends to release the material under CC-BY-SA, but there's a difference between what we choose to accept and what's actually legal.  Generally the company, and therefore its agents, has the right to use its own copyrighted material however it wants (including posting it to Wikipedia), and that would make it a  problem but not actually (legally) a copyright violation.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 04:06, 25 February 2015 (UTC)
Yes thanks for the clarification WAID. As this was likely an agenda of the company writing the article in question it was more likely undisclosed paid advocacy editing / spam.
If the person is not paid by the company than it is a copyright violation. Definitely two possibilities. Doc James (talk ¬∑  ¬∑ ) 04:31, 25 February 2015 (UTC)

Primary/Secondary sources

I would like some more guidance on the use of primary/secondary sources.  In Geophagia I have been trying to improve the Geophagia#Health risks section.

Another editor removed the refs citing .

Does  apply in this case - ie that of giving examples of particular descriptive situations? JMWt (talk) 17:54, 25 February 2015 (UTC)
Does  apply in this case - yes, it does. You might be able to cite findings about the prevalence of eggs in soil to primary studies, as these are not strictly medical claims.

NONPROFIT says nothing about &quot;being cited in multiple reliable sources&quot;.  If you've gotten that impression, then I obviously need to re-write the guideline.  What you need is a source that is talking about the organization.  Something like  &quot;Foo Foundation, which was founded in 2006, has 10 paid staff and a thousand volunteers working to raise money for research&quot; is good.  &quot;According to Joe at the Foo Foundation, more research is needed&quot; is not.

Dear medical experts:  This draft seems medical-related, and the subject seems to have a lot of accomplishments.  Is this notable, and should it be kept and improved? ‚ÄîAnne Delong (talk) 03:27, 25 February 2015 (UTC)
He is a busy fellow, isn't he? I wonder when he last wrote a prescription, if ever. I think he has to be notable, and the reasons for holding up the draft are rather flimsy, though it is very puffy in tone. Johnbod (talk) 18:07, 25 February 2015 (UTC)
Johnbod, I have removed some of the promotional language, and also some excessive detail and opinion.  I'm not sure how much of the content in the extensive lists is appropriate.  Anyway, since I've edited it, it won't be deleted any time soon.‚ÄîAnne Delong (talk) 07:09, 28 February 2015 (UTC)

Schizophrenia
At Featured article schizophrenia, in the section Schizophrenia#Environment, I tagged a statement with MEDRS, which isn't really the right tag.  For this statement
Childhood trauma, separation from a parent, and being bullied or abused increase the risk of psychosis.

the source is a position paper by a Commission in London.  Since Schizophrenia is an FA, we should have the strongest possible sources, and I suspect this statement is not just the position of one commission in one country, rather is info that can be found in recent secondary reviews.  Anyone?  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 21:56, 3 March 2015 (UTC)
That bit seems to be referenced to Di Forti M, Lappin JM, Murray RM (2007). &quot;Risk factors for schizophrenia ‚Äì All roads lead to dopamine&quot;. European Neuropsychopharmacology, 17, S101-S107..  Not wholly clear though. The commission is not an official one. Johnbod (talk) 22:27, 3 March 2015 (UTC)

Invitation to the Wikiversity Journal editorial board

The  is seeking more members, to participate in deciding what articles to include in the journal, which in turn largely depends on whether they can be used to improve Wikipedia articles. Those interested may sign up directly in the list there.

Any decision as to whether the journal can be 'used to improve Wikipedia articles' will have to be taken on Wikipedia - and policy hasn't changed, we don't cite Wikis as sources. If you wish to propose a change of policy in this regard, I suggest you do so in the appropriate place, rather than repeatedly spamming this page. AndyTheGrump (talk) 17:45, 4 March 2015 (UTC)

Images of course can be used. We allow &quot;primary research&quot; pictures else we would have very few. I do not mind if this source is cited when pictures from it are used.

On a separate note, it's been problematic to find a proper talk page to discuss article submissions to Wikiversity Journal of Medicine. I've been posting at  because it is easier to watch for those that frequent their Wikipedia watchlists more often so than their Wikiversity ones. On the other hand, I've gotten frequent complaints that the said page should be used for discussing technical matters such as how to link to Wikiversity pages. I therefore request to have a subpage of WikiProject Medicine for such article submissions, such as  (thanks CFCF for the idea). It would allow for an clear overview of article submissions rather than having them dispersed in the archive of this page. Mikael H√§ggstr√∂m (talk) 20:53, 4 March 2015 (UTC)

Infobox for an exercise health effects article

Pretty sure the answer is no, but that doesn't stop us from creating one. That is if you have a suggestion of what type of article it could be used on.

 I have looked at a lot of general articles about non-medical health interventions, including physical therapy, exercise, and caregiving. I am not happy with any of these or others.

 I like these alerts here. If there could be one list of all current health articles (or any class of articles) and the alert here could be a notice that another has been added to the list of all classes which need watching, then that might be ideal. Do you have any suggestions from the Wiki Ed side of how this could work in a way that is best for you guys?

Request Input on Evidence Aid Draft page

Hi I am new and am working on a web page for Evidence Aid. It is in my sandbox https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:AmyEBHC/sandbox Please could someone look and see it it looks OK and also is there a template for the headings for pages like these or a checkpoint list where I can check I am in compliance before I send it for review  Thanks 
AmyEBHC (talk) 03:48, 5 March 2015 (UTC)

Is the goal to  it into the mainspace (=make it a regular article)?  If so, then you might find some useful information at .  However, there is no single checklist, because no checklist can cover everything, and editors often have different ideas about what's important. 
For the &quot;template for the headings&quot;, I'm not sure what you mean.  Do you want an ?  You , but they're very common for articles about organizations.  Use  if you want to have one.  Or did you want a tag at the top (like )?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 06:13, 5 March 2015 (UTC)
Thanks really helpful I will work on this and yes I will move it out of sandbox into main space once it is usable AmyEBHC (talk) 01:57, 7 March 2015 (UTC)

The information in the article will need to be supported by references, meaning reputable published sources that are independent of the organization.  Also, parts of it are not written neutrally enough -- please remember that the purpose of a Wikipedia is to inform readers, not to change their attitudes.

Template cleanup -- help needed!

I've had a look at almost all medicine-related templates now as part of a general biology-related template cleanup effort. I've identified a list of 38 or-so medicine-related templates that I feel are especially in need of cleanup (about 5%). Most of these need cleanup in terms of making them easier or more logical to read, or easier for lay readers to understand and use. I'd be very grateful if other editors could help out by selecting one or two and helping out. The relevant templates are:
