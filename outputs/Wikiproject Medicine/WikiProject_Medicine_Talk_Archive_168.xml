Hi all, I just stumbled upon International Classification of Headache Disorders which reprints the named classification system's hierarchy, but not the actual diagnostic criteria for each condition. My assumption is that this verbatim copy/paste violates the International Headache Society's copyright and should be removed from that article, but I figured I'd check-in here for others' thoughts. I recall a past discussion on the larger ICD codes (, I think), but I didn't follow the aftermath of that to see if there was pushback on the subsequent AfD(s). For reference, the relevant copyright declaration for ICHD is [https://ichd-3.org/copyright/ here]: &quot;...may be reproduced freely for scientific, educational or clinical uses by institutions, societies or individuals. Otherwise, copyright belongs exclusively to the International Headache Society. Reproduction of any part or parts in any manner for commercial uses requires the Society’s permission, which will be granted on payment of a fee.&quot; so clearly not compliant with our license. Thanks. Ajpolino (talk) 15:53, 7 October 2023 (UTC)

It's an interesting question. Simple names of phrases themselves cannot be protected by copyright ([https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-protect.html#:~:text=Copyright%20does%20not%20protect%20names,may%20be%20protected%20as%20trademarks.]). Also, there is no creative content, such as description of diseases in the list. But some of the entities might be considered to be more than just simple names or phrases (like with &quot;precursors of migraine&quot; which are &quot;commonly&quot;), I cannot judge here. Also, the arrangement of the data might be protected by copyright if it is not just simple sorting and uses some creative criteria (see  for details). For example, ICD-11 is under the Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivs 3.0 IGO license ([https://icd.who.int/en/docs/ICD11-license.pdf]). You'd better ask at  or report the problem to the . D6194c-1cc (talk) 17:57, 7 October 2023 (UTC)
Also, doesn't the list violate  since it doesn't have any additional information? D6194c-1cc (talk) 18:32, 7 October 2023 (UTC)
If the absence of additional information made it be a telephone directory, then we'd have to delete a lot of our lists.   WhatamIdoing (talk) 22:04, 7 October 2023 (UTC)
 Time for some pedantry, but fair use can be quite broad - so I'm not sure this would be violating. I think the that came up were with a material getting reused in so many places to violating fair use, and the fact that wikipedia was getting complained at by some lawyers (though this may have been related to another standard).

Atelectasis claim

Is [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atelectasis&amp;diff=1012797949&amp;oldid=1000078119 this](Atelectasis develops in 75-90% of people undergoing general anesthesia for a surgical procedure.) plausible?

The cited source says &quot;Atelectasis occus in between 75% and 90% of healthy individuals having general anaesthesia with muscle paralysis.&quot;  The end of that paragraph is perhaps important:  &quot;The percentage of atelectasis during anaesthesia recorded in this way seems small...equates to around 10% of lung tissue.&quot;
From a practical perspective, the lungs are underinflated, but only by ~10%. WhatamIdoing (talk) 22:01, 7 October 2023 (UTC)
Thanks, a 10% underinflation seems quite plausible, but I would not have thought it sufficient to class as atelectasis. Then again, it is a bit outside my field of expertise. Cheers, · · · Peter Southwood (talk): 10:54, 12 October 2023 (UTC)

Verdict on AI Translations?

I know that some wikipedias prohibit automatic translations, but what is the policy on using AI tools like DeepL and even ChatGPT to start a translation?

I had to write something in English and French a few days ago. I wrote it in English first, but then I put it into ChatGPT to translate it into French. When I went in to review the output, it looked better than anything I could have come up with. It even translated some very technical terms and translated the acronyms where possible. I've looked around on Reddit and people there seem to agree that it even accurately translates colloquial and slang terms.

So, could I use ChatGPT to translate articles and then do a manual review to ensure accuracy? IrateSpecialist (talk) 01:54, 8 October 2023 (UTC)

Look at . I use Google Translate to speed up translations of my texts into English, and it uses neural networks, too (see Google Neural Machine Translation). Also, according to the laws of my country, copyrights of works created using assistant software tool belong to the author. So, you probably need to check the laws of your country, too.

It's about content generation rather than content transformation. Anyway, this project is not an appropriate place for such a discussion. What is the most relevant forum to move this topic to? D6194c-1cc (talk) 17:11, 8 October 2023 (UTC)
 I put this topic in WikiProject Medicine because I contribute to WikiProject Med Translation. Maybe move the discussion there then?  How do I do that? IrateSpecialist (talk) 18:29, 8 October 2023 (UTC)
It is related to copyright and laws. Translators might not know all about those legal topics. D6194c-1cc (talk) 20:50, 8 October 2023 (UTC)

Are we missing an article on vector-borne diseases?

I am surprised we don't have an article on vector-borne diseases (VBD) yet. For now, I've created one that is a redirect to disease vector. I don't think this is sufficient though. We do have an article on waterborne diseases. Or perhaps it exists but under a different name that I haven't found yet? 

I am coming to this topic because I am currently improving content about climate change impacts on health, e.g. climate change and infectious diseases. The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report has a chapter on this (see [https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGII_Chapter07.pdf here]) and this chapter mentions vector-borne diseases (or VBD) 33 times. Mainly because climate change will make some of those diseases more common in areas where they were not before. In a nutshell, those &quot;tropical&quot; diseases are moving further North and South and up the mountains... Maybe those &quot;groupings of diseases&quot; articles are not so satisfying to work on (the overarching article infection is also only C class (1400 pageviews per day)). Anyone interested to help with this effort? EMsmile (talk) 12:24, 12 October 2023 (UTC)

Improving Medical Articles in Malay on Wikipedia

Thanks!

@JenOttawa, is this ms.wikipedia.org?  (There are several languages whose English monikers are very similar.) WhatamIdoing (talk) 17:53, 16 October 2023 (UTC)
Hi @WhatamIdoing thanks for the quick reply. I believe that ms is the correct language. I am verifying. JenOttawa (talk) 18:18, 16 October 2023 (UTC)
Here's how I'd go about finding people at the smaller wikis.  If it's a different wiki, then you can repeat my process there.
* Check  for familiar names and/or people who have put a Babel box on their userpage that indicates they speak English (or another language you can write in).  Admins can generally be counted on to know the rules for their local wiki, and also to be watching each other's talk pages, so if you leave a note for one of the 15 admins, then some of the others will likely see it as well.
* Look at  for familiar names and/or people who make a lot of edits.  This wiki (&quot;mswiki&quot;) has about 600 editors making at least one (1) in any given month.  Assume that a third of them make a couple of edits and a few percent make a lot of edits.  In this case, there are about 20 editors who made 100+ edits during the last month.  Those people are the ones you would want to talk to.  
* Check this history for a handful of &quot;big&quot; articles and see if there are any active editors listed there.  For example,  translated a COVID-19 article.
* They have a WikiProject Medicine (; see  for the complete list), but there are no comments on the talk page.   lists the six members, four of whom –  – are active editors.
At the smaller wikis, communication mostly happens on User_talk: pages.  But if you want a central forum, then  (&quot;Village pump (proposals)&quot;) gets the most discussion, and  (&quot;Village pump (miscellaneous)&quot;) is where official announcements get dumped.
If this group mostly wants to translate articles, then there may still be useful information on pages like  or . WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:34, 16 October 2023 (UTC)
These are excellent tips. Thank you for taking the time to share them.JenOttawa (talk) 19:37, 16 October 2023 (UTC)

Asperger syndrome

Picked up from the hot articles list that Asperger syndrome is currently under going a rewrite. Might need some WP:MED input (the lead is off and the rest is not within my competency). Thanks, Little pob (talk) 12:36, 17 October 2023 (UTC)

What's the goal of the re-write?  Asperger's officially stopped existing (though it's still a personal identity for some people) some years ago, but we haven't re-written the article to reflect this. WhatamIdoing (talk) 15:11, 17 October 2023 (UTC)
It looks to be turning in to quite a mess, and best I can tell,  has never posted to the talk page.  It would be good to hear from them as to their understanding of ,  and , as starters. The article was dated, but a dated article may be preferred to what is there now, and Ruedi33a's work may be heading towards a revert if they don't seek more collaboration. SandyGeorgia (Talk)  15:46, 17 October 2023 (UTC)
I saw the message &quot;This article needs to be updated. The reason given is: some parts of the article do not accurately reflect either the new DSM-5 or ICD-11 criteria, February 2022)&quot; and started my standard approach: migrate every citation to sfn and check whether it still exists, can it be replaced or is outdated (DSM-4 or ICD-10). You are the first to contact me, so let us start talking. For me, the scientific journey of &quot;Asperger syndrome&quot; has come to an end and the article I found was a mess in terms of citations and being up-to-date. What rules exist for articles about &quot;dead&quot; diagnoses?Ruedi33a (talk) 17:23, 17 October 2023 (UTC)
, let's start with the simple things; as  mentions, the lead is quite off, and I suggest that [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Asperger_syndrome&amp;oldid=1179902896 the older version should be restored] and converted to past tense where necessary.  From there, updating and switching to past tense where applicable in the body would be the next step.  Then, it is usually helpful to re-write the lead last, as leads are summaries of the body.  And finally, your edits are introducing a very odd structure with respect to the , and I am hoping that you understand .  Whether the condition still exists as a separate diagnosis doesn't change any of what needs to be done, other than it affects present vs. past tense, and no special &quot;rules&quot; exist or apply to past tense diagnoses as far as I know.

PS, you should  without gaining consensus; for example, in this case, Asperger syndrome was long a , so has a well-established citation style. SandyGeorgia (Talk)  18:07, 17 October 2023 (UTC)

Penile Cancer in Circumcision lead

On the circumcision article, many users were divided on whether or not to describe penile cancer as “rare” (or “relatively rare”) in the lead. A collapsible footnote which read “Penile cancer is a rare disease in the developed world, but much more prevalent in the developing world” ended up being the  compromise we settled on, until it was recently reverted by a user. Please review these discussions:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Circumcision/Archive_84#Does_anyone_object_to_these_lead_improvements/changes? 1] &amp; , and advise on how we could move forward. Prcc27 (talk) 05:00, 21 October 2023 (UTC)
 Without prejudice to the rights and wrongs, this summary needs a touch more context. Prcc27 added the &quot;compromise&quot; boldly in this edit [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Circumcision&amp;diff=1136185735&amp;oldid=1135959669] which claims (see following dummy edit for wording correction). Yet someone had opposed the compromise [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ACircumcision&amp;diff=1135689178&amp;oldid=1135664430]. So this bold edit cannot be said to have enjoyed . Rather, it appears that, tucked away in a footnote, no one noticed it. Sirfurboy🏄 (talk) 08:48, 21 October 2023 (UTC)
 Indeed. The wider context is that although it's true penile cancer is rare in the developed world (though not extremely rare like say heart cancer), anti-circumcision activists don't like mentioning that circumcision reduces penile cancer risk, so always seem to want to have some wording to ensure nobody thinks this risk reduction is a good reason to get circumcised. Hence the kerfuffle. In any event, the rareness (in the West) of penile cancer is an attribute of penile cancer and not of circumcision, so trying to add adjectives into the lede to 'steer' POV seems unwise. We can go into the weeds in the article body, if there is sourcing. Bon courage (talk) 15:00, 21 October 2023 (UTC)
 Indeed. It seems like there is a sneaky attempt to imply that circumcision might have some causative effect on penile cancer, which is a ridiculous idea. At the same time, there is likewise an attempt to bury the fact that circumcision has a preventive effect on penile cancer, regardless of the rarity of such cancer. -- Valjean (talk) () 17:38, 21 October 2023 (UTC)
 Adding “rare” or “relatively rare” does not bury the information about circumcision’s preventive effect on penile cancer. What do you think the wording should be? Prcc27 (talk) 19:59, 21 October 2023 (UTC)
@Valjean, the &quot;idea&quot;, as I heard it more than a decade ago, was that circumcision reduced HIV and HPV infections, both of which appear to be causative agents for penile cancer.  The rebuttal, if memory serves, was to claim that it was a case of correlation rather than causation (i.e., that baby boys who were circumcised for religious reasons tended to grow up into men with a smaller number of lifetime sex partners and therefore a smaller number of sexually transmitted infections).  I've no idea what the current research says, but it's a biologically plausible mechanism. WhatamIdoing (talk) 01:21, 22 October 2023 (UTC)
 I can imagine that a comparison between Israel, where it's mostly Jews and for religious reasons, and America, where it's a custom adopted by Jews and non-Jews, would show a difference if that hypothesis had any merit. I'm pretty sure this has all been the subject of analysis. -- Valjean (talk) () 02:51, 22 October 2023 (UTC)
There's quite a lot of detail in the (well-sourced) content at Circumcision#Cancers. Bon courage (talk) 03:11, 22 October 2023 (UTC)
 Not entirely true. Bon Courage expressed opposition to a collapsible footnote with the “rare” or “relatively rare” wording in the lead. I then asked him if he would support a footnote without “rare” or “relatively rare” being in the lead. When he did not make an objection, I went ahead with my BOLD edit, and unchallenged, I assumed we had consensus. Prcc27 (talk) 19:55, 21 October 2023 (UTC)
What we have now is a simple, well-sourced summary. You have not given any rationale for your desire to say that penile cancer is rare, add footnotes about that, or whatever else you're proposing. WHY do you want to do this? Please explain. Bon courage (talk) 03:01, 22 October 2023 (UTC)
It is  as is in the lead. We should not insinuate that penile cancer prevention is on the same level as HIV and UTI prevention. We don’t list every single possible circumcision complication in the lead, we do not need to mention every single possible circumcision benefit in the lead either. But if we do mention penile cancer, it is worth clarifying that it is a rare disease. Prcc27 (talk) 03:11, 22 October 2023 (UTC)
It's a rare disease in high-income Western countries, but it constitutes up to 10% of malignancies in men in some African, Asian and South American regions.[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33574340/] I know American exceptionalism is all the rage on Wikipedia, but people in other countries should matter too. We have a big section on this in the article, so a sentence in the lede if . The current wording is factual and &quot;insinuates&quot; nothing. As we say in the article, there is a debate about the merits of circumcision for penile cancer prophylaxis. You have already said your personal POV is that it is not merited. Trying to get that POV into the lede in a problem. Bon courage (talk) 03:25, 22 October 2023 (UTC)
“Relatively rare” would be a concise summation of the nuances in the body paragraphs about developed world vs. developing world. We don’t want to give undue weight to America, but the same should go for giving undue weight to African, Asian, and South American regions. Prcc27 (talk) 03:40, 22 October 2023 (UTC)
&quot;Relatively rare&quot; is just unhelpfully vague (relative to what?). I think we're done here and I won't be responding further unless some new sourcing or consideration lands. Bon courage (talk) 03:53, 22 October 2023 (UTC)
Relative to what region of the world you are in. The body explains it further; a collapsible footnote, which you oppose, would also explain what it means. You do not have to participate, that is your . But the discussion will continue regardless. Prcc27 (talk) 04:04, 22 October 2023 (UTC)
Looking at List of continents and continental subregions by population, Asia + Africa + South America = 83% of the people in the world.  I don't think it's possible for us to give undue weight to 83% of the people in the world. WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:54, 22 October 2023 (UTC)
Looking at [https://www.wcrf.org/cancer-trends/worldwide-cancer-data/ worldwide stats for men], penile cancer is the 30th most common cancer site, which means it a little less common than Hodgkin lymphoma and Gallbladder and a little more common than cancer of the Salivary glands and Kaposi sarcoma.  
 indicates that it is somewhat less deadly than average (for comparison, breast cancer is less deadly than average, lung cancer is more deadly than average, and colon cancer is pretty close to average). WhatamIdoing (talk) 19:10, 22 October 2023 (UTC)
Per the source: “it constitutes up to 10% of malignancies in men in some African, Asian and South American regions”, not all. Prcc27 (talk) 19:13, 22 October 2023 (UTC)
The 30th most common cancer worldwide is still a big deal. WhatamIdoing (talk) 02:52, 23 October 2023 (UTC)
Nobody said penile is no big deal.. But let’s not use  to argue whether it is a “big (enough) deal” or not. Do the sources call penile cancer a rare disease or a common disease? Well, the source we are currently using in the lead mentions that it is a rare disease in the very first sentence of the abstract. Prcc27 (talk) 05:06, 23 October 2023 (UTC)

Fluoride toxicity: newer study MEDRS?

Is the ref added by  sufficient to support the substantive change of meaning in [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fluoride_toxicity&amp;diff=1179809659&amp;oldid=1170360910 this edit]? DMacks (talk) 15:52, 12 October 2023 (UTC)

It's a review in a good journal (see the [https://www.scopus.com/sourceid/145480 Scopus rankings]).  I think that not providing any sort of Effect size is a problem for comprehension, but having skimmed most of the source, I don't really see that we can say.  He's got numbers showing that there's probably some dose-dependent effect, but he doesn't even try to produce a simple statement like &quot;2.0 mg/L costs five IQ points&quot; (the US recommends 0.7 mg/L).  I assume that's because the data simply isn't strong enough to support any simple conclusions.

I'm not sure it's an extraordinary claim, but I'm not sure that stating it as a certainty is DUE.  I find [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=fluoride+iq&amp;filter=pubt.meta-analysis&amp;filter=pubt.review&amp;filter=pubt.systematicreview&amp;filter=other.medline&amp;filter=years.2013-2023 seven recent-ish review articles] (including the cited one) in MEDLINE-indexed journals at PubMed.   complains about the confounding factors while agreeing that the existing studies indicate an IQ effect.  found no correlation in &quot;non-endemic fluorosis areas&quot; and says that Further research is needed for high-fluoride areas.  None of them say that fluoride is harmless or has no potential for neurodevelopmental harm.  The closest we get to the conventional belief is that some of them suggest (but can't prove) that lower levels might not have a clinically significant effect.
The one I'd particularly recommend to Wikipedia editors is https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9922476/, subtitled &quot;when new evidence doesn't conform with existing beliefs&quot;.  This is worth at least a skim even if you have no interest in the specific subject area.  The tendency to stick with &quot;what we know that ain't so&quot; is not a new problem.

Title request: what's a country-neutral term for dietary intake reference levels?

Countries tend to all have their own versions of a Reference Daily Intake and Daily Value for food labels and general recommendations. Existing articles for things that are similar to, but are not DV and RDI, include Acceptable daily intake (≈UL), Dietary Reference Values, Guideline Daily Amount, and Reference Intake.

But even with all these articles we fail to cover a large chunk of the world's population: what about the &quot;NRV&quot; used by AU and NZ, the separate &quot;NRV&quot; used by China, the [https://www.nin.res.in/rdabook/brief_note.pdf Indian (ICMR) RDA], or the Korean and Japanese &quot;RDIs&quot;? It just seems less than practical to create an article for every large-enough country's nutritional recommendations, especially when they all start with largely similar principles and get similar conclusions. 

We should get an article that talks about and lists these things in general. But what do we call it? Artoria2e5  00:22, 8 November 2023 (UTC)

Maybe human nutrient requirements?  I'm imagining a page that says something like &quot;Humans have both minimum and maximum nutrient requirements.  Getting enough calories, protein, vitamins and other nutrients prevents some illnesses, such as vitamin deficiencies.  In other cases, these values are set to prevent overconsumption of potentially harmful additives, such as food dyes.  Different countries have different legal standards.&quot;  
Is that the sort of thing you have in mind? WhatamIdoing (talk) 02:19, 8 November 2023 (UTC)

Welcome to Wikipedia, @Asto77.  I appreciate your efforts to help.  
One of the problems with &quot;One study found...&quot; is that we've had people (not you – in the past) who pick very unusual studies as the &quot;one study&quot; to mention.  It will just &quot;accidentally&quot; happen to be the one study that aligns with their beliefs, supports the product they're selling, agrees with the decision they want their relative to make, etc.  Sometimes the results of an individual study really are interesting (here's one example of an individual study being famously wrong, and thereby screwing up researchers for years afterwards), but for the most part, and unless you're dealing with an incredibly rare disease, we do try to avoid those.

&quot;Suggestions&quot; and &quot;appearances&quot; not science?

An editor has suggested a post here to ascertain the validity or worthiness of a citation to a meta-analysis which has no firm conclusion but uses the above terms.

While we have cited it only as saying it 'suggests', the weight given to it is considered undue and possibly trivial by some. Any input would be welcome. Thelisteninghand (talk) 16:12, 14 November 2023 (UTC)

@Thelisteninghand, if a scientific review article writes something like &quot;This suggests that...&quot; or &quot;It appears that...&quot;, they are usually trying to tell you that this is something:
* &quot;Many researchers in this field currently believe...&quot; (a statement about the strength of scientific consensus) and
* &quot;It is not absolutely proven yet&quot; (a statement about the current levels of evidence).
WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:29, 14 November 2023 (UTC)
Regardless, it’s  trivia. Prcc27 (talk) 23:05, 14 November 2023 (UTC)
Agreed. I want to add that it's medically trivial in that Meissner's corpuscles are but a part of the innervation. All the other nerve endings are omitted from the study/meta-analysis so the 'suggestion' it makes is just about worthless. It's like saying a car runs on gas, if it breaks down it's probably out of gas. It currently bears great weight because the cite concludes the section. Thelisteninghand (talk) 22:14, 15 November 2023 (UTC)
That you personally dislike a source's methodology isn't really relevant. MrOllie (talk) 22:21, 15 November 2023 (UTC)
The other nerve endings don't seem as relevant to me (nor apparently to the authors of that reliable source), but if you can find a source that has information on the detection of sustained pressure, or skin stretching, or vibration, then that could be added, too. WhatamIdoing (talk) 20:24, 16 November 2023 (UTC)
It's not trivia. It's highly relevant if the article is going to talk about nerves - which it does in the preceding paragraph. MrOllie (talk) 22:20, 15 November 2023 (UTC)

To be clear, we're talking about this source

This is relevant biomedical knowledge in a  source. It is not &quot;suggestion&quot; or &quot;trivia&quot;. We don't exclude content just because it doesn't accord an anti-circumcision agenda. Bon courage (talk) 06:40, 16 November 2023 (UTC)

That's a review article in a [https://www.scopus.com/sourceid/21100434606#tabs=1 decent] journal.  I would still encourage editors to focus accurately representing the main conclusions of the article, rather than pulling individual numbers out of the middle.  
If we decide to include this information, it may help to explain it in simpler words.

The lack of MEDLINE indexing. Bon courage (talk) 02:39, 20 November 2023 (UTC)
Restricting the search to MEDLINE-indexed journals (which is not a requirement in MEDRS), I find nine review articles in the last five years.  [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36059125/ This one] says that GET helps some and hurts others.  [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37434321/ This one] complains about NICE's process (which resulted in discouraging GET).  [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35656619/ This one] is the same thing, except in Danish.  [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34091377/ This one] sort of supports GET, saying that people doing GET are less likely to report getting much worse but more likely to drop out of trials (but maybe because they got much worse?).  [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33646528/ The next] in the list is about the cost-effectiveness.  [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32568149/ This one] basically agrees with the one you dislike:  GET is oversold.   [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31073713/ This one] is a minority POV (ME ≠ CF ≠ CFS – the idea that it might be several conditions is common enough [e.g., mitochondrial vs autoimmune], but this isn't it) and can be ignored.  [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31072121/ This one] says the GET trials are poor.  [ht The last] is more directly useful for the fact that patients object to the idea that their behavior has anything to do with their health (&quot;many patients reject the notion their illness is perpetuated by dysfunctional...behaviors&quot;) than for whether GET is helpful to anyone, and if so, to whom and at what cost.  Overall, it's not really different from the review article you think isn't so great. WhatamIdoing (talk) 17:26, 20 November 2023 (UTC)
Sure. The problem isn't what it says but that there's better sourcing available, some of which is already in the article. Bon courage (talk) 17:33, 20 November 2023 (UTC)
And since Femke is well versed at working at the FA level, may as well use the highest quality sources now, so the article can progress further up the assessment scale. SandyGeorgia (Talk)  17:52, 20 November 2023 (UTC)
I'm not sure that &quot;highest quality&quot; is a black-and-white thing.  For example, is it more important to be MEDLINE indexed, or is it more important to be rated higher in your specific field?  The one that says GET is oversold (and specifically, that even those patients who improve after GET almost never improve enough to be able to hold down a job) is MEDLINE indexed but lower ranked; the one Bon courage dislikes is not MEDLINE indexed but is higher ranked.  I don't think we can say that either is obviously better than the other. WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:22, 20 November 2023 (UTC)

For GET, we have the German IQWiG's HTA as well [https://www.iqwig.de/en/presse/press-releases/press-releases-detailpage_93184.html ] (they agree with NICE that potential harms of GET are not sufficiently quantified, and do not recommend it).

Confusion regarding Dysgammaglobulinemia

I'm just going to preface this by saying that I'm not using the talk page because it is innactive and I doubt I will get a response.

I'm currently trying to go through all of the disease stubs and stumbled upon Dysgammaglobulinemia. I'm having a hard time finding consistant information on it. Here's the definitions i've found so far:

Selective deficiency of one or more, but not all, classes of immunoglobulins.[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/41679][https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM196502182720702]

Common variable immunodeficiency, also known as dysgammaglobulinemia, is a group of disorders involving both B-cell and T-cell immune function.[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780124559004502749][https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9781437707748100417]

Immunoglobulin class switch recombination deficiencies (CSR-Ds, which were previously named “dysgammaglobulinemia” and then “hyper-IgM syndromes”) are characterized by elevated serum IgM levels and a considerable decrease in IgG, IgA and IgE.[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780124071797000163]

From what I can gather it's either a synonym for Common variable immunodeficiency or hyper-IgM syndrome or it's a separate disorder. If anyone has any insight that would be helpful. CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 17:05, 23 November 2023 (UTC)

My impression is that &quot;dysgammaglobulinemia&quot; is more a technical term with a fuzzy definition than a medical diagnosis with precise criteria. Jo-Jo Eumerus (talk) 07:44, 25 November 2023 (UTC)
I'm kind of getting that impression as well just based off what someone else responded with. How would I go about making an article for dysgammaglobulinemia considering it's loose definition? CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 20:57, 25 November 2023 (UTC)

STI vs STD

I brought this to the talk page of the relevant article but failed to draw much discussion. @Autisticeditor 20—who was pinged there as well but did not respond—has been on a mission to eliminate all mentions of the term &quot;sexually transmitted disease&quot; in favor of &quot;sexually transmitted infection&quot; (the current title of our article on the subject). I can't see the need for such drastic action, and I would imagine it should be treated as we treat other alternative names, provided that they are not biased or misleading (for instance, our article is titled color, but the spelling colour is also acceptable to use as long as there is consistency within an article, and should not be purged from the encyclopedia). However, perhaps there are other users who agree with such actions, so I would love to hear them out. I considered bringing this matter to RfC, but it seems appropriate to begin here.  04:18, 3 December 2023 (UTC)
I get it. I've seen a lot of efforts to destigmatize language. I got publicly chastised in a staff meeting (by a yoga instructor, of all people) for saying a patient had a &quot;clean urine STI screen,&quot; the adjective clean obviously being judgmental. Sigh. I don't know that we want to remove all accurate but potentially stigmatizing language in every context: diseases are diseases, and not all infections are diseases nor are all diseases infectious. Jclemens (talk) 04:23, 3 December 2023 (UTC)
 It's probably worth looking through the user's revisions if you want to try and ascertain what uses of &quot;STD&quot; would be better kept. I'm not really an expert in that area, but I would take a stab myself were I more knowledgeable.  05:02, 3 December 2023 (UTC)
As I recall, the idea was that some people think of &quot;a disease&quot; as something that produces symptoms, and HIV (in particular) often spends years in an asymptomatic state, during which time is it more intuitive for most people to think of it as &quot;an infection&quot; than &quot;a disease&quot;.  STD became less preferred in the 1990s, when HIV was the flagship pathogen.
It's true that disease ≠ infection (e.g., lupus is a disease, but not an infection), but all sexually transmitted diseases are also infections.
I don't think that changing to the STI wording should be considered &quot;drastic action&quot;.  If this editor thinks this is worth his time to make these changes, then that's okay with me.  I don't feel that it would be worth my time to make the changes.  I equally don't feel that it would be worth my time to oppose them, nor even to pay much attention to them.  It is IMO just not important. WhatamIdoing (talk) 05:42, 3 December 2023 (UTC)
 see . It provides a pretty strong backbone for the point I'm making. (Per the Arb Committee, &quot;when either of two styles is acceptable it is inappropriate for a Wikipedia editor to change from one style to another unless there is some substantial reason for the change.&quot;) If STI were better that would be another thing, but as long as neither is explicitly favored, we should retain the existing phrase.  06:03, 3 December 2023 (UTC)
STI is &quot;better&quot; because it is more accurate wrt some medical conditions.
Choosing to use a term that became popular in the 1970s (when they wanted to stop talking about &quot;VD&quot;) or a term that became popular in the 1990s (when they were very much concerned about HIV [infection] vs AIDS [disease]) is not necessarily &quot;a style&quot; in the same way that American spelling, DMY date formats, or whether to use citation templates are &quot;a style&quot;.  We're talking about a single word, not something that affects the article throughout. WhatamIdoing (talk) 06:09, 3 December 2023 (UTC)

I have made a complete list: https://nctr-crs.fda.gov/fdalabel/ui/spl-summaries/criteria/343802                                            (query: https://nctr-crs.fda.gov/fdalabel/ui/#/search/spl-summaries/criteria/343802) using [https://www.fda.gov/science-research/bioinformatics-tools/fdalabel-full-text-search-drug-product-labeling The FDALabel Database].

It produces a result of &gt;16k labels with boxed warnings.  https://nctr-crs.fda.gov/fdalabel/services/spl/summaries/csv/criteria/343802. 
Broad strokes: It seems like it would be appropriate to put the relevant info into wikidata and have https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Infobox_drug#Input_from_Wikidata cause it to be displayed. 

RudolfoMD (talk) 05:14, 5 August 2023 (UTC)
That could be a useful approach.  , is this Wikidata idea something that  could handle?  One would ideally want both to have the information added to Wikidata and also to have the bot watch for human-involved errors. WhatamIdoing (talk) 00:18, 6 August 2023 (UTC)
Thanks for the feedback and relaying the idea to @Andrawaag.  If we proceed, this way, how is sourcing handled? In each article or in Wikidata?
(Since opening this discussion, someone reverted my fixing the omission of the fact that a drug had a black box warning. That omission is what prompted me opening it.  https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brincidofovir&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1168856210 ) RudolfoMD (talk) 04:51, 12 August 2023 (UTC)
@RudolfoMD, I think that a &quot;both/and&quot; approach to sourcing is better than &quot;either/or&quot;.  Sources are pretty easy to add in Wikidata.  It doesn't look easier, at first glance, but all you do is:
# Look for &quot;Add references&quot; to the side of whichever detail you're adding a source for, and click on it;
# In the confusing little box, start typing in the kind of source you're adding (e.g.,:  &quot;URL&quot;, &quot;PubMed&quot;, &quot;PubChem&quot;, or &quot;ISBN&quot;);
# Choose the correct item from the list (e.g., &quot;PubChem CID&quot; if you have the official compound id number);
# Paste the id number/URL into the next field.
# Click &quot;publish&quot; for the item (about 2–3 cm above where you originally clicked on &quot;Add references&quot;).
It handles everything else about the citations automatically.
Here, of course, you need to supply a source.  I suspect the reason @Sundayclose reverted you is because you added a source in
External links
instead of in tags.  (For the actual purpose of , your link to PubChem should replace the dead URL that's there now, rather than being added after it, and we don't usually put those in citation templates.  I'll go fix that now.) WhatamIdoing (talk) 23:20, 12 August 2023 (UTC)
NB: I'm proposing a project to programmatically identify and remedy all such articles.  Not go through 16,000 drugs, and for those with articles, perform manual steps on each of a significant fraction of them!  Maybe this (WT:MED) isn't a good place to connect with folks with the relevant skills.  
Idea!  I'm thinking a smaller / more feasible project would be to add those of the 16,000 drugs with articles to a category - i.e. Drugs with Black Box warnings, and with the  [https://nctr-crs.fda.gov/fdalabel/ui/spl-summaries/criteria/343802 https://nctr-crs.fda.gov/] citations on the category page.  - any thoughts on this (or the original) idea?

Are most readers in tune to categories?  I think the infobox idea might be better ... SandyGeorgia (Talk)  16:48, 1 September 2023 (UTC)
Page views say that more readers go to cat pages than editors.  (I assumed that they were really just being used by editors, and I asked someone at work to pull the numbers for me.  I was wrong.  The skew isn't as huge as, say, page views for a popular page like Taylor Swift, but some readers do use them.)
It would be possible to do both/and.  In fact, the infobox could trigger the category. WhatamIdoing (talk) 01:34, 2 September 2023 (UTC)
This use of &quot;infobox could trigger the category&quot; sounds like a good concept, but it's against .

I've got some domain knowledge and could help out with code. I'm a little surprised that there is not an existing bot verifying . Looks like  by  and  by  are doing some work, but do not verify against any external compendia. If we go to the trouble of adding a field to the infobox, should probably later add a task to verify the existing fields in passing.
There's also a little ethical issue here. Once we start supplying drug warnings i think it kind of imposes a duty to be accurate and up-to-date.

Thanks for that.  It would be helpful if you could explain what discoveries led to your hesitance - what hurdle or hurdles your looking at some articles made apparent, especially any surprising ones.  (I accept you are free to choose, of course.)
Would it be right to say that the ethical issue you raise is very close to one that exists for those other bots editing drug articles - in that once a botmaster starts supplying drug info arguably it might impose a duty to keep it up-to-date?  Or are they thus far all adding info that can't become out-of-date?  I doubt that the FDA often removes black box warnings. RudolfoMD (talk) 08:29, 9 September 2023 (UTC)
As far as hurdles go i think the presentation to the reader would require the most consideration and a few other issues would probably arise. Labels are for a drug product which the consumer has in hand whereas the WP articles are for the drug and in some cases drug combinations. Just technical issues which can be overcome and i think what you suggest would be a doable and fairly simple improvement. 
But looking at the drug articles they are listing contraindications, adverse effects, and interactions. They are purporting to provide comprehensive consumer safety information. I'm sure editors are covered by the medical disclaimer, but that is buried in the footer and two clicks away—in my opinion not good enough for the reader. You were disturbed to see the black box warnings missing from articles, i'm leery of attempting to provide drug safety information at all. I would want to have a professional i could trust looking over my shoulder to ensure i was doing things correctly and that it was an actual benefit to the reader vs. simply sending them elsewhere to obtain that information.
I don't see that the other bots are touching anything that would be a safety issue, tho i could be wrong. fiveby(zero) 15:19, 9 September 2023 (UTC)

&quot;A clear algorithm&quot; in this case probably means a list of drug articles with the source that supports the claim.

However, due to Wikidata being much more detailed than Wikipedia (information that fits into one Wikipedia article is often split into multiple Wikidata items), it is not clear to me right now, whether this type of information should be included in the item describing the active substance or in items describing specific pharmaceutical products like .

She means that when you make a small edit, it appears in , even if the edit didn't add anything that you think is substantive.

 It depends.  can be seen here as a 'main' statement, so every qualifier applies to this particular statement and you can't have a qualifier added to a qualifier (second level of qualifiers), so you can't add an additional information that would apply for .

My example above would mean in WD something like: FDA approved paracetamol as a drug and every drug containing paracetamol in the US must be sold with a black box warning ≈ FDA approval is closely related to the obligation to indicate a black box warning. This is the simplest solution here I can think of, however, adding references to such a statement could be not so simple and would require using  (main statement/qualifier) in the references section if there was no single source for information about FDA approval and black box warnings.
You need to think about the scope of information you need for . Do you want to specify that the black box warning should be placed from a certain date? Or for certain doses etc.?
 I still don't know why some parts of my comments on my talk page are not properly visible for you. And I still suggest that proper discussion should be conducted in WD, because any consensus reached here has no validity in WD.  mentioned here as a example is in fact an interesting discussion which I followed from the beginning, although I did not participate in it. We had similar in chemistry and in many other areas in WD. To put it very briefly: ontologies (not only in WD) are logical but in many cases counter-intuitive. But it also shows that there is some exchange of views in this project, it is not dead, so an attempt to discuss this topic there is not a priori doomed to failure.
Be bold in WD states that On Wikidata, no clear policy of this kind exists, and the following is thus just an emerging guideline. The page was created by an en.wiki user, edited thrice and never approved as any guideline (I corrected the false template on this page). This doesn't mean you can't make undiscussed edits. However, these types of edits, without specific preparation, often hit a wall in the form of Wikidata's complexity. Wostr (talk) 19:37, 1 October 2023 (UTC)
I added sourcing thus: https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q879952&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1981610608
Do you want to specify that the black box warning should be placed from a certain date? Or for certain doses etc.?  No, I haven't proposed that. That's not in the source indicated above, is it? (and which, incidentally, it seems should be put into an online spreadsheet.) 
Good, so [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Project_chat#Basic_question._How_do_I_mark_that_a_drug_has_a_en:boxed_warning? Wikidata:Project_chat#] is serving adequately- I see no objection.
On to proceed to seek help with the importing? RudolfoMD (talk) 07:59, 5 October 2023 (UTC)
 The easiest way to import a large set of data is to use  (or a bot). But the first thing (regardless of the import method) is to prepare the data. If [https://nctr-crs.fda.gov/fdalabel/ui/spl-summaries/criteria/343802] is the dataset, I don't see right now an easy way to associate an entry from this dataset with an item in WD. These entries are for pharmaceutical products, not for active substances. There are UNII numbers, however, if there is an entry for 'Epzicom' does it mean that the 'black box warning' statement should be added to , , ,  or ? This should be sorted out first, before thinking about the method of import.  is one way to do it, if you have a prepared dataset. Association based on UNII may work, but it won't be perfect, there may be many incorrect additions (judging on previous mass imports that were based on only one identifier). There is also  tool. It's not an automatic tool and way slower than QS, but may yield better results here. Wostr (talk) 17:40, 5 October 2023 (UTC)
Once again, you come across as throwing up roadblocks.  Surely you know I want to use QS but can't yet and that I'm arguing that [https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q57055&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1981617113 this] is the way to do it, which you've surely seen, and unlike my previous edit, haven't reverted. There is an entry in the table for all four, so , ,   and ?  should all have the same.  I believe I already stated that it's not selected brands, but APIs that the warnings are mandated for.  I don't see how to use the UNII with quicksource, but would welcome help/guidance; as I mentioned, I want to use 'em if they'd improve the import. You say &quot;These entries are for pharmaceutical products, not for active substances&quot; but they are the latter too. We can ignore the per-row redundancy.  Is there a previous mass import based on UNII and government data where there were many incorrect additions that you can point to?  What's your concern exactly?  Are you claiming the FDA's own data on its own actions is highly erroneous?  That's quite a claim.  I'll look at .
At least on .en, the API is used for article names, and the appropriate infoboxes would be tweakable to use the info to display something like 
* US: ℞-only ◼︎⚠️ 
as suggested above.  RudolfoMD (talk) 05:24, 9 October 2023 (UTC)
As a lay reader; US: ℞-only ◼︎⚠️ is no more understandable than US: ℞-only ◼︎ and looks awkward when you know the intent is to indicate the same idea. Can we explain what the ◼︎ and ▼ mean instead?
Here are some ways of doing this (with some comments of potential drawbacks): 
* link them to boxed warning – though might have to ignore that we're duplicating wikilinks when there is more than one regulatory body warning, unless there are articles for the equivalent from non-USA bodies (example, the EMA)
* link to an  within the article – does require the content to exist
* adding a  – would need to consider wording as &quot;has a boxed warning&quot; is just as unhelpful and it is not possible to wikilink within a tooltip (though the tooltip itself can be wrapped in a wikilink)
* using  +  – this is my preferred solution and I'm struggling to argue against it (whilst the MOS for infoboxes discourages references that are used elsewhere in the article, there is no mention of other types of footnote.  seems to have no problem with footnotes within an infobox either)
These are off the top of my head, there are probably alternatives. Little pob (talk) 13:04, 9 October 2023 (UTC)
I'm just trying to handle the FDA warnings, at least to start - seems plenty complicated.  In general, the content doesn't exist, which precludes  at least most of the time and at least as an initial solution. I am not familiar with  + .   What would that look/code like?  I'm guessing/sounds complicated. 
Maybe something like this would be good for what appears in the drugbox, speaking of complicated, under US, in the Legal Standard section.  (Warning in a black box): 
\begin{array}{|} \hline WARNING \\ \hline \end{array}  or
 \begin{array}{|} \hline W\!ARNING \\ \hline \end{array}  !? (clickable!) (I guess with  +  something similar but better could be achieved?)  RudolfoMD (talk) 05:16, 10 October 2023 (UTC)
Using  could look something like the examples here:  
As others have alluded to , have kept the footnotes generic rather than along the lines of &quot;FDA says X when taking this medication&quot;. Little pob (talk) 09:14, 10 October 2023 (UTC)
I'd love to get this to work.  If there's no notes section, this doesn't degrade gracefully, and I've no idea how to get the notes  section added to the hundreds of articles it would need.  Perhaps there's a bot that does that already when it sees it's needed.  I could test to find out? RudolfoMD (talk) 17:31, 30 November 2023 (UTC)
1. If you want to call them roadblocks, go ahead. Without my initial intervention, you could have added thousands of entries to WD, which would then all have to be deleted. Now, slowly, the idea of adding this information is taking shape and may become valuable information in WD. I spent many years in WD, millions of edits in the field of chemical compounds, and I have already seen many different cases where hasty actions led to the need for mass corrections, deletions, merging, etc.
2. I don't see how to use the UNII with quicksource, but would welcome help/guidance – the way I see it, you would have to download the FDA data, download all the WD items with UNII (two .xls spreadsheets) and then properly compare both files based on UNII so that you are left with a list of items in WD for which there is a corresponding record on the FDA list.
3. This is not the problem with FDA data, it's the problem of the data in WD. In the past there were many mass imports, most of the importers didn't care about the data consistency. In many cases we also did not have defined procedures and data models. This means that existing data problems in WD (e.g. unresolved constraint violations) cause errors to propagate to subsequent statements/items during such imports. A solution such as mix'n'match, which involves semi-automatic and manual addition of statements, is much more resistant to such problems; the use of QS, in which you are not able to manually review thousands of results and the entire adding process will take little time, is more susceptible – and in the past, QS imports based on only one identifier, e.g. the CAS number, led to many errors.
4. It is also possible that the information would first be added to the infoboxes in en.wiki, and then exported to WD as there are tools for that. Only then it would be a duplication of work, because data from WD can be imported automatically to the infoboxes in en.wiki.
5. By the way, seeing the proposal of what it could look like in the infobox and as an advocate for accessibility in my home wiki, I would like to point out your Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility guidelines. Probably, an image with an alt= attribute or abbr tag for this unicode character would be sufficient. Wostr (talk) 14:58, 9 October 2023 (UTC)
1. I sought feedback and got none, so I made one edit, and got some.  I continue to proceed prudently. 
I've just [https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q411188&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1989514447 edited a second item]. I intend to use QS on a handful of items and scale up in steps, checking the results and leaving time for others to do the same.
2. I don't follow.   As I said twice, I want to use 'em if they'd improve the import.  Not seeing an argument that they would.  At the moment, it seems baroque - an unnecessary complicated detour around an ... obstacle.
3. Of course there have been bulls in the china shop. But it's important to not forget why Wikipedia works, and Nupedia didn't.  I could well be wrong, but mix'n'match does not seem appropriate, as I don't anticipate much of the ambiguity it's designed to help with. 
4. I see  Albendazole is pulling data from WikiData. I can see the wikitext in the template, but can't make heads or tails of it: 
(
 from Wikidata 


)
- RudolfoMD (talk) 06:21, 10 October 2023 (UTC)
2. Now I don't follow either. Quickstatements is an extremely powerful tool. In minutes or hours, you can do work that would normally take months of manual editing. However, the problem at the beginning is always the preparation of data that is then used in QS. For example, in recent months, using Wikidata Query Service and Quickstatements, I made tens of thousands of edits – in 30 seconds I could prepare the data allowing me to make 20,000 edits in QS (which were performed automatically). It appears that there are at least several thousand edits, if not a dozen, to be made to add the FDA data. From my point of view, it seems reasonable, instead of making these edits manually, to first properly process the data, and then be able to run QS and make all the edits automatically. In my opinion, it would be a big time saver, but I'm not going to impose this on you. I am presenting the possibilities that I know about.
4. While I am maintaining the equivalent of the Chembox template in pl.wiki, both projects are far from each other in terms of technical solutions. Based on what I see I think that the easiest way to import data from WD to en.wiki infobox would be to use something like: |pattern=boxed warning|plain=true|boxed warning|output ('String' module with 'match' function checks if the imported values of P3493 property contain 'boxed warning' statement; if yes, the result is then checked using 'ifeq' function and displays an 'output' text; you can test this in e.g. paracetamol in edit preview). However, this is a very clumsy solution, it would be best to write it in an appropriate module in Lua. Wostr (talk) 18:55, 10 October 2023 (UTC)
PS There is also . Maybe this tool will help. Wostr (talk) 12:01, 12 October 2023 (UTC)
2. I spotted the/a source of our confusion.  What I've been saying is I want to use UNIIs iff they'd improve the import.  I think you were reading a pronoun as referring to something else (QS or mix'n'match).  Note, I said, &quot;I intend to use QS on a...&quot;
4. Thanks!   |pattern=boxed warning|plain=true|boxed warning|\begin{array}{|} \hline W\!ARNING \\ \hline \end{array}  works at [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol&amp;action=edit§ion=1] and is a no-op at [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Albendazole&amp;action=edit§ion=1]. That's helpful.  And thanks to my edits with  mix'n'match, now I'm eligible to use QS.  So thanks for that too.  Now where to put it to get it in the infobox....

 I do intend to go back over and read this entire block of text, but for now it appears that you want a warning box to appear in articles, such as at . That's a page I created to test the warning box specifically, although I see it in many of the other test cases I viewed. I'm no Wikidata expert, but it seems that the data from WD is not drawn in preview, so we must rely on test cases to check for the warning box. As I said, I'm no expert, but it does appear to work. Hope this helps. P.I. Ellsworth , ed. put'er there 11:11, 21 October 2023 (UTC)
Looks like earlier you mentioned Brincidofovir – checked that one in preview and the warning box appears, so I seem to be wrong about Wikidata, and I don't have a clue why the boxes don't appear in the Paracetamol article. (???) Need to dig more and I do wish that editor  could be available, because they've done so much work on these chem pages. P.I. Ellsworth , ed. put'er there 12:43, 21 October 2023 (UTC)
Thanks for the replies.  
Paine, how does one check Brincidofovir in preview of Template:Infobox_drug/sandbox as you did (or I think you're saying you did) to see if the warning box appears? Is there a URL you can share that previews what Brincidofovir (or Paracetamol) looks like with Template:Infobox_drug/sandbox? 
The gist is, I'm wanting help with editing Template:Infobox_drug/sandbox.  I've made some edits but I'm skeptical I got 'em right, and I can't figure out how to test 'em.
Context: I've got a list of ~1600 drugs that have FDA-mandated black box warnings and so far I've marked a few of them manually in wikidata and intend to mark the rest.  I think it indicates consensus to use something like |pattern=boxed warning|plain=true|boxed warning|\begin{array}{|} \hline W\!ARNING \\ \hline \end{array} in Template:Infobox_drug/sandbox to make a warning appear in response to the wikidata.  [Note, this is the previously posted code snippet but modified to link to boxed warning, and have a reference, as of course it should, but now it's much longer. ]  [PPS: Edit: Whoops, forgot, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Little_pob/scratchpad&amp;oldid=1179464669 User:Little_pob/scratchpad] is the plan. I should be sleeping, not editing, right now.]
(PS My bad paging 3 people, expecting maybe 1 would respond.  Lesson learned. And not initially providing a clearer summary of the need, so you don't have to read this long, noisy thread.) RudolfoMD (talk) 08:11, 22 October 2023 (UTC)
Thank you for that! No problemo. To check in preview, I just go to the article, bring up the edit screen, add the sandbox to the code such as in , and then click on . When I do this in the Brincidofovir article, the Warning box does appear. So what I've learned is that if the Wikidata item is correct, then the infobox in the article will be correct, even in preview. I've also learned that we cannot go by the test cases. They might show the Warning box while the infobox in an article might not, as was in the case of . We seem to be almost there, but not quite. Another tip is to be sure to use the full template name, &quot;Infobox drug&quot;, when you preview the sandbox in an article. You might get an erroneous outcome for those which use the redirect, . So, in other words,  in preview might not work as expected, so instead, be sure to use . P.I. Ellsworth , ed. put'er there 11:25, 22 October 2023 (UTC)
My primary concern regarding the warning box image is the space it occupies in an already constrained area. Initially, I wanted to highlight the linebreak between the box and the reference, as seen in the Brincidofovir testcases-warning. Adjusting this by a few pixels could potentially address the issue. However, upon closer inspection, I noticed another opportunity for space optimization: the repeated &quot;Legal status&quot; label, as illustrated in [https://i.imgur.com/hgdBy43.png this image] (for the 2C-B drug). I'm uncertain if simply implementing a colspan=&quot;2&quot; would be the solution, given potential style disruption, but I wanted to offer this perspective for brainstorming purposes. Arthurfragoso (talk) 11:05, 26 October 2023 (UTC)
Your primary concern is no small issue, as I also have thought that the warning box would be helped by a bit smaller rendering of it in the ibox. Perhaps a new template () is needed that has a parameter for size adjustment? or maybe the size can be controlled/decreased in Wikidata? P.I. Ellsworth , ed. put'er there 12:10, 26 October 2023 (UTC)
I have the template working now.  @Arthurfragoso, your optimization eliminates the link to Regulation_of_therapeutic_goods.  I presume avoiding that is the reason behind the repeated &quot;Legal status&quot; label.
I don't know how to make the warning box resizable or make the template's subheadline a wikilink.  Both changes are nice-to haves, but out of scope. Either could be worked on anytime, once someone with the relevant skills shows/expresses interest.  In the mean time there's a fix to the disturbing, important issue that some drugs with FDA-mandated Black box warnings have articles that are missing any mention of the box or the risk.  A fix that I struggled for some time to accomplish. RudolfoMD (talk) 01:45, 15 November 2023 (UTC)

As I said, this is not a sophisticated solution, but it should work in any article as long as there is a statement in P3493 in WD with a label 'boxed warning'. It won't work on a template page.

Most important medical articles?

See ongoing discussions at  and the current list at  and feel free to suggest what is missing or needs to be swapped :) Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here 09:20, 10 December 2023 (UTC)

If someone wants to engage with this, the breakdown is:
* Level 1:  0 out of 10 articles (unless you count Human and Science as medical subjects)
* Level 2:  2 out of 100 articles (Medicine and Disease)
* Level 3:  41 out of 1,000 articles ()
* Level 4:  280 out of 10,000 articles ()
* Level 5:  1,200 out of 50,000 articles ()
They are looking for a couple hundred suggestions about what to put in that last group.
@Piotrus, for the last 10 years or so, we have tried to keep  to 100 articles and  to 1,000 articles, although I haven't checked them for a while (sometimes an inexperienced or optimistic editor declares their favorite subject to be our top priority, in the misguided hope that we'll focus on their article first).  These categories should probably align pretty closely with the vital articles lists. WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:34, 11 December 2023 (UTC)
@WhatamIdoing Thanks, that's good to know. I see the assessments count at 100 and 1,071, but I am not aware of how to check which artcles were assed most recently (i.e. what may be the 71 extras). In either case, that's quite useful. Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here 23:32, 11 December 2023 (UTC)
@TonyTheTiger Perhaps you know if there's a way to check what we list at vital vs the assessmens here? Wikidata query might be possible. 
There is a lot of mismatch with what we list and what is not high+. Ex. from recent proposals, from those I checked, Syringe is mid, Hypodermic needle is low, scalpel is low, Bandage is low (seriously?), Sling (medicine) is mid (a pathethic stub too, folks...), Crutch is mid, Splint (medicine) is mid, Tourniquet is mid.  Ventilator is mid. Only stretcher lucked out as being high. I wonder if there is some rating bias against tools (which is what Tony has recently proposed as additions)? @WhatamIdoing Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here 23:39, 11 December 2023 (UTC)

Confused about set index articles.

I was going through some of the disease stubs and found Organ-limited amyloidosis. Since it has so many subtypes, would it be appropriate to turn it into a set index article? 

I'm only asking because the concept of set index articles are new to me and I easily get confused by them.

CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 06:37, 13 December 2023 (UTC)

I think everyone is confused by them.  The general concept, AIUI, is that  are written for a single group of things that are related through both their names and their identity/type (e.g., hurricanes named Bob, but not anything and everything named Bob).
In terms of writing them, it's partway between a  page and an article, and usually maintains a list structure.  In a well-developed SIA, the description of the items are often longer than permissible for a DAB page, and may even lean heavily on  and  links.  
For the specific page you linked, I suspect that SIA is not technically the right model, as it's a general type (like &quot;hurricanes&quot;).  That is, the individual items in it are all types of organ-limited amyloidosis (also:  types of amyloidosis, types of disease), but they aren't actually called organ-limited amyloidosis under normal circumstances.  People would say &quot;Do you remember what happened on the morning that Hurricane Bob struck?&quot;, when they mean a specific storm named Bob that happened in a particular year and not any of the other hurricanes named Bob.  But people wouldn't normally say &quot;Remember what happened the morning Grandma was diagnosed with organ-limited amyloidosis?&quot;  They'd talk about when Grandma was diagnosed with Alzheimer's or Parkinson's or whatever the specific thing is.

Brain tumor - Network communication also plays an important role in the spread of the disease
&quot;It was discovered that the tumor cells communicate with each other in a large network, exchange substances that are essential for survival, and can thus evade the effects of radiation or chemotherapy. Network communication also plays an important role in the spread of the disease. The tumor cells are even networked with healthy nerve cells and receive direct signals from them – in this way, the tumors can grow faster. The mechanisms that are investigated not only offer fundamentally new explanations for the highly aggressive growth of this type of tumor. They also provide approaches for novel therapies – to stop brain tumor growth and make existing therapies more effective. The disruption and even destruction of tumor cell networks is thus becoming a completely new therapeutic principle in oncology, with the first clinical trials building on these findings.&quot;

Asthma phenotyping and endotyping

@AndyTheGrump, it's probably fine.  There are multiple review articles with non-overlapping lists of authors, so we have multiple independent sources. WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:51, 23 December 2023 (UTC)

New student-created article

A student created a new article on Ovarian squamous cell carcinoma. Give the length of the article, I don't feel confident doing even a basic once-over to make sure it doesn't content anything risky. And since it comes from an advanced pharmacology class rather than a medical class, I don't want to just assume it's probably good.

I have no specific concerns about the article - it looks mostly ok to me - but I would really appreciate if someone could take a critical look at it. Thanks all! Ian (Wiki Ed) (talk) 17:19, 8 December 2023 (UTC)

Is this a good redirect?

Childhood accidental spiral tibial fracture
&gt; Toddler's fracture

Would this be a good idea?  On one hand, the article seems to distinguish the two kinds of fractures, while on the other hand, it notes that recent work has considered one a subset of the other.  Since the latter is more recent, and obviously they're very similar to the layman, I'm wondering whether it should be left red (either to encourage article creation or to avoid confusion), or whether a redirect would be good, both because they're related and because we want to discourage content forking.  The phrase doesn't appear in the body of any other article; its only other appearances, in Bone fracture and Crus fracture, are limited to this citation.  Nyttend (talk) 17:59, 27 December 2023 (UTC)

@Nyttend I personally think it's a good redirect because any effort to expand or create a page for childhood accidental spiral tibial fracture would result in a lot of overlap with Toddler's fracture. 
Here is some more references that imply or state that they are synonyms: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6184974/] [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2341287920300582] [https://pedemmorsels.com/toddlers-fracture/]
