Have people seen this one yet? : Another study of publication bias, with a different statistical approach.  (The pubmed commons comment is also interesting.)  () 22:42, 25 May 2015 (UTC)
In the largest study on publication bias in meta-analyses to date, we found evidence of publication bias in Cochrane systematic reviews. In general, publication bias is smaller in meta-analyses of more recent studies, indicating their better reliability and supporting the effectiveness of the measures used to reduce publication bias in clinical trials [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25988604?dopt=Abstract]...interesting...for my part,i use textbooks, position statements and journal articles you can count on...however my opinion runs along the same lines as &quot;PubMed commons&quot; (same link )... These authors used a scraper they have made available on Github to extract meta-analyses from Cochrane reviews. They looked at reviews with placebo or &quot;no treatment&quot; control groups and 10 or more included studies. Whether or not these results are applicable to interventions with active or usual care control groups is unknown -- () 23:13, 25 May 2015 (UTC)

good information-- () 15:10, 24 May 2015 (UTC)
Thanks . I am surprised regarding [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4174509/ this one about pharmaceuticals]. That our accuracy is 99.7% and our completeness in 83.8% in En and De as compared to standard textbooks I find amazing. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 05:54, 25 May 2015 (UTC)
It accords with my own experience.  These are precisely the sort of articles that Wikipedia handles best:  articles that can be written in a more or less stereotyped way without requiring mastery of a large body of literature.  Actually I would expect that our coverage of individual drugs is considerably better than any textbook's.  It's in articles such as pharmaceutical drug that Wikipedia fails to impress.  () 12:44, 25 May 2015 (UTC)
As the textbook is deemed the gold standard we cannot by the study design be better. Even though we likely do contain some content textbooks don't. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 13:45, 25 May 2015 (UTC)
We're better in the sense that we include detailed information about far more drugs than any textbook.  Incidentally I've written a review of the paper, at .  Comments or revisions are welcome.  () 14:58, 25 May 2015 (UTC)
 benzodiazepine article...the latter article contains a lot of good information but is poorly organized. Our article pharmaceutical drug shows this flaw to an even greater degree. The general take-home message, supported by the German study, is that our medical articles can be very useful to people who are looking for specific facts, but tend to be less useful to people who are trying to understand broad principles. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2015-05-27/Recent_research] ...your comment only confirms that wikipedia is a &quot;work-in-progress&quot; we must all give 100% effort-- () 15:53, 25 May 2015 (UTC)
I think perhaps it's in the nature of the beast.  When I was growing up my family had a set of the Encyclopedia Britannica, which was divided into two parts, the Macropedia, which contained large articles covering broad topic areas, and the Micropedia, which contained many small articles about specific things.  Wikipedia is, in a sense, the ultimate Micropedia.  Nobody can beat us for breadth of coverage, and our articles about small things are often quite good.  But on the whole we don't do a very good job of being a Macropedia, and I have doubts that we ever will.  But also I don't think we need to in order to be valuable.  () 19:19, 25 May 2015 (UTC)

   Just glancing at the benzodiazepine article, the organization doesn't appear to be that bad.  Are you referring to the organization of the entire article or the organization within certain sections, and if so, which sections?  () 18:43, 25 May 2015 (UTC)
It's not that bad, really not bad at all, but some of the most important facts are buried.  A reader who comes to the article not knowing anything about these drugs is going to have difficulty grasping that (a) these are some of the most widely prescribed drugs; (b) they are most commonly prescribed for anxiety and insomnia; (c) their great advantage over other drugs is the extremely low risk of fatal overdose; (d) they are only available by prescription.  () 19:19, 25 May 2015 (UTC)
 Excellent points that should be included in the lead as part of the &quot;big picture&quot;. I will try to work on this.  () 04:40, 26 May 2015 (UTC)
I will give the references a &quot;look&quot;-- () 12:20, 26 May 2015 (UTC)

Non-MEDRS example why MEDRS is essential

So, I've just flagged a news item at . In [http://www.nature.com/news/reproducibility-crisis-blame-it-on-the-antibodies-1.17586 this article] Monya Baker explains the ongoing scientific catastrophe (I don't think the term is too strong) with inconsistent antibody testing materials, earlier commented on in [http://www.nature.com/news/reproducibility-standardize-antibodies-used-in-research-1.16827 this item] from Andrew Bradbury and Andreas Plückthun in February. The scale of the work invalidated (or at least called into question) is huge, going back for many years. Essentially, if a paper relied on commercial antibodies and has not been independently reproduced, it can not be trusted, no matter how sterling the reputation of the researchers. This is as clear an example as I've seen for why we should not trust primary sources.  [[User talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl!]] 16:02, 22 May 2015 (UTC)
(Well, that was a fun string of Edit conflicts...)  [[User talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl!]] 16:32, 22 May 2015 (UTC)
I agree with your statement, MEDRS is very important-- () 16:38, 22 May 2015 (UTC)
 Sorry for the accidental reversion (the danger of reading your watch list on a cell phone).  Just to play the devils advocate: It has long been recognized that many antibodies are unselective.  Nevertheless, what if everyone is using the same unselective antibody to immunostain a particular protein and comes to the same erroneous conclusions?  A review is later published that says the results are reproducible and hence implies that the conclusions reliable. This review is in turn cited in a Wikipedia article. Everything is hunky-dory, right?  () 16:58, 22 May 2015 (UTC)
No problem, it might have started with a caching problem at this end. Of course it would not be &quot;hunky-dory&quot;, but at least we can say that the published expert reviewer overlooked a systematic weakness in the primary works reviewed, rather than a pseudonymous Wikipedian. It might argue for an even tighter standard, but of course that's a difficult idea to advance. I expect we'll see a flurry of retractions over the next year or two based on this. If there's any discipline left in science, we should. Retraction Watch may be our new best friend.  [[User talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl!]] 17:20, 22 May 2015 (UTC)
I had not seen this site before to be honest, it seems ideal,also it shows the &quot;not-so-good side&quot; of science The blog argues that retractions provide a window into the self-correcting nature of science, and can provide insight into cases of scientific fraud.[7] Its operators say that as science journalists, they have &quot;found retractions to be the source of great stories that say a lot about how science is conducted.&quot;[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retraction_Watch] [http://retractionwatch.com/]-- () 18:16, 22 May 2015 (UTC)
I agree that Retraction Watch is enormously useful, although it should be pointed out that this blog mainly deals with why a publication has been retracted rather than simply documenting that a retraction has occurred. PubMed itself does a good job with the later. Perhaps what we need is a bot that scans PubMed for newly retracted papers and adds  if appropriate.  () 19:16, 22 May 2015 (UTC)
Yep, not to be a party pooper but my first reaction was the same as Boghog's. This is a big mess but not one that has much to do with how Wikipedia articles are written. There is no  sourcing guideline that will prevent articles from being wrong when the whole scientific field is wrong. Annotating retracted papers is a good idea, though. (Hey, a use for citation metadata!)  () 19:37, 22 May 2015 (UTC)
There is already some discussion in MEDRS of the reproducibility problem, warning against using PRIMARY sources, at the bottom of the  section.  I've added a link to Nature's reproducibility initiative  ([http://www.nature.com/news/reproducibility-1.17552 here]) to that section, which links to this stuff about antibodies as well as other content.  () 11:16, 23 May 2015 (UTC)

It is true that antibody producers have very low standards - I remember a case something like 20 years ago where reportedly a certain antibody from Santa Cruz didn't work because it had been made up from a nucleotide sequence with a frameshift in it.  Which gives you an idea of how closely they check.  But compensating for such problems isn't rocket science either:  You use a positive control, a negative control, and reproduce everything with two separate antibody products recognizing the same target protein.  But the caveat-emptor quality of scientific papers is exactly the reason why we should cite primary data.  Because you never really know what to think of reported results until you look at them yourself.  Anybody can do a meta-study and work statistics to make a review that 3 people got one result and 2 got another, but how many of those papers have you ever seen mention which antibody suppliers the 3 and the 2 were using?  () 15:31, 23 May 2015 (UTC)
that is a good point(in regards to antibody suppliers)-- () 16:21, 23 May 2015 (UTC)

* irreproducibility of work with mAbs is not just an academic problem.  this is a slightly different angle, but one of the reasons why Cetuximab (Erbitux) stumbled in clinical trials, was that they were conducted using a mAb-based diagnostic.  Turned out that different labs used 5 different mAbs that bound to different epitopes (some were even intracellular vs extracellular!) and used different sample prep methods -- and the different epitopes and preps mattered.  See comments by David Rimm in the discussion [http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/41539/title/Validating-Antibodies--An-Urgent-Need/ here] and if you care enough to hear/listen, you can watch [https://vimeo.com/96806907 this video] (shows data) starting at 25 minutes and going to 30 minutes.  () 16:52, 23 May 2015 (UTC)

*Meh.  Don't get me wrong, it's a big problem, but the fact that someone finally got around to writing about it in Nature doesn't mean that scientists (the experienced, competent ones) weren't already aware that there were some pretty dodgy antibodies out there in the catalogs.  It's bad, in that it wastes substantial time and resources, but it's not catastrophic.  Robust conclusions are those supported by more than one line of evidence (and certainly by more than one antibody).  MEDRS, if anything, will have insulated us from at least some of the problem. That said, getting anything &quot;immuno-&quot; (that is, &quot;-blots&quot;, &quot;-histochemistry&quot;, &quot;-fluorescence&quot;, &quot;-therapy&quot;) right is something that is hard.  It takes care and caution. (See also all the dodgy ELISAs and bad technique that are used to support the primary fringe literature on so-called chronic Lyme  and Morgellons.)

High fructose corn syrup

I had been watching some bad things happening to this article for a while, with content about health based on PRIMARY sources getting loaded into this.  I worked this over today (and ending up merging a subarticle on health effects back into the main article).  Would appreciate review of the article as it stands, and eyes on it going forward.  People get intense about food.  () 02:05, 26 May 2015 (UTC)

&quot;TMD&quot;

Opinions requested regarding the most appropriate title for the WP article on the condition typically referred to as &quot;TMD&quot; (temporomandibular disorder) in North America and &quot;TMJ-PDS&quot; (temporomandibular joint pain-dysfunciton syndrome&quot; in the EU; characterized by pain and dysfunction of the TMJ.

Temporomandibular disorder would seem more widely used, however pubmed, google books and google websearch results give a different picture. One thing I am almost sure of is that the current title, Temporomandibular joint dysfunction (a hybrid of both US and UK terms), is not as commonly used.

This is coming up again because I want to write an article covering pathology of the TMJ generally and not necessarily confined to this vaguely defined syndrome. Because not all disorders which affect this joint might cause pain and/or dysfunction. thoughts?  () 10:57, 24 May 2015 (UTC)

very good example...Slim by Chocolate!” the headlines blared. A team of German researchers had found that people on a low-carb diet lost weight 10 percent faster if they ate a chocolate bar every day. It made the front page of Bild, Europe’s largest daily newspaper, just beneath their update about the Germanwings crash. From there, it ricocheted around the internet and beyond, making news in more than 20 countries and half a dozen languages. It was discussed on television news shows. It appeared in glossy print, most recently in the June issue of Shape magazine (“Why You Must Eat Chocolate Daily,” page 128). Not only does chocolate accelerate weight loss, the study found, but it leads to healthier cholesterol levels and overall increased well-being.

Article on Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase appears to need attention of medically informed editors

Hi, everyone, 

An online discussion elsewhere in cyberspace made me aware of an [http://mthfr.net/ external website run by a naturopath] that appears to promote treatments for human disease based on patient testing for variants in the MTHFR (methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase) gene. There are patients who believe extraordinary claims regarding a gene × treatment (that is, gene × environment) interaction at that locus, which is not a replicated claim in the reliable sources on human genetics. I think it may be worthwhile for editors more informed than I am to take a look at the Wikipedia article Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, which has had a rather quiet article talk page, to assess how well the better sources are reflected in that article. --  (, ) 15:29, 29 May 2015 (UTC)

A series of &quot;embedded navboxes&quot; are present within all medical navboxes. These provide links to templates within a relevant area -- for example, all cardiovascular disease-related templates are linked alongside cardiovascular anatomy and treatment templates. This is designed to help readers navigate a large amount of medically-related articles grouped by template. This was previously announced . The set of templates are here: [[:Template:Medicine navs]] and during editing many medical editors have provided feedback.

lung cancer screening/medicare coverage  nejm

Lung cancer is the third most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Attention to lung cancer is especially relevant for the Medicare population, because the median age at diagnosis is 70 years. A suitable screening test has long been sought to accurately detect lung cancer at earlier stages, when treatments are more effective and survival is more likely. Currently, more than half of cases are diagnosed after the cancer has metastasized..i deem this a good read.[http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1502598?query=TOC]. thank you-- () 19:53, 30 May 2015 (UTC)
 This isn't really news. Our article's [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer#Screening screening] section already describes this. Although coverage in NEJM will help to inform more people (healthcare professionals) about it. [[User:Axl|Axl]] ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 09:46, 1 June 2015 (UTC)

Disorders of magnitude - POV question

I was wondering in regard to the extent to which articles labelled disorder may be expressing a negative POV.  

I first raised related issues at [[Talk:Sadistic personality disorder#Possible moves: &quot;Sadistic personality&quot; or similar]] where it was noted by  who I think fairly expressed the view &quot;&quot;

Of similar concern are the articles:
*Sexual masochism disorder described as being: &quot;&quot; and 
*Sexual sadism disorder described as being: &quot;&quot;
For me I think that, to some extent, this may simply be a case in which the phrase [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/different-strokes-for-different-folks different strokes for different folks] may have an extremely literal application.  Some people may respond to the gentle caress of fingertips while for other people a more violent form of stroking may alternatively/also be desired.  In modern society any man or woman may only find sexual stimulation in a person of either their own or of the opposite sex and yet people are no longer widely described as having a disorder if they have homosexual tendencies and I think that the same issues may logically apply to articles perhaps with similar themes to those mentioned.  

Articles that are arguably questionably placed in [[:Category:Sexual and gender identity disorders]] include:

*Analloerotic, described as &quot;&quot;
*Blanchard's transsexualism typology described as &quot;&quot; 
*Gender identity disorder in children described as &quot;&quot;
*Polymorphous perversity, described as &quot;&quot;
*Transvestic fetishism, described as &quot;&quot;

In many cases I think that there is little justification for placing the various topics into categories of disorder as, arguably, there may be circumstances in which problems may not universally be considered to be exhibited.  

However see also:

*Hybristophilia, described as &quot;&quot;

In some cases sexual drives may be considered to lead to generally undesired  outcomes.  

I was wondering whether, in some cases, terminologies such as Psychological typologies might be used as alternatives in categories or whether different titles might be adopted in cases such as when word such as &quot;disorder&quot; are used.   11:17, 29 May 2015 (UTC)

*From a medical point of view, I would say that if an entity is defined as a disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-5) or the ICD, then it is desirable to have a &quot;disorder&quot; article.  This certainly applies to sexual masochism disorder and sexual sadism disorder.  If the standard authorities don't define something as a disorder, then the question is more complex -- it basically comes down to whether or not MEDRS-quality sources exist that label it as a disorder.  () 11:28, 29 May 2015 (UTC)
**I agree...a disorder is defined as  derangement or abnormality of function; a morbid physical or mental state.[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/disorder]...therefore the two articles in question fall under this category, Sexual masochism disorder is the condition of experiencing recurring and intense sexual arousal in response to enduring extreme pain, suffering, or humiliation[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_masochism_disorder]  and Sexual sadism disorder, has a very similar introduction/meaning....IMO-- () 11:38, 29 May 2015 (UTC)
* This may be a simpler way to think about it:  The English Wikipedia doesn't care whether something &quot;should&quot; be considered a disorder.  It only cares whether it &quot;is&quot; (currently, subject to change) considered a disorder (by mainstream professionals). Also, categories don't define the subject.  They're navigation aids.  The idea is that if you're interested in reading about &quot;Sexual and gender identity disorders&quot;, then you should be able to find most of the articles that you're interested in by looking at that category (including subcats).  Putting a page in that category doesn't mean this &quot;is&quot; a disorder; it only means that a person who is interested in these disorders is probably going to be interested in this page, too.   () 22:02, 30 May 2015 (UTC)
*, ,  Thank you all for your comments on this matter.  I would be interested on your opinions on the potential applicability of other wording such as &quot;(medical) condition&quot; which (while, admitedly, reference may come from a wide range of books) seems to enjoy a lot of support in [https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=medical+condition%2Cmedical+disorder&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2015&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2Cmedical%20condition%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cmedical%20disorder%3B%2Cc0 Ngrams.]  I can imagine that a certain individual may potentially have a very sadistic or masochistic (or both) physiological-psychological make up and yet have no desire to cause &quot;hurt&quot; (in the human suffering sense) to anyone.  
In potential parallel to this topic, I personally consider that the high rate of news results on a search on [https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#tbm=nws&amp;q=homosexuality+(cure+OR+illness+OR+disorder) homosexuality (cure OR illness OR disorder)] may be cause for external concern and am wondering about parallels to content as presented in the article Homosexuality and psychology.  I do not personally view &quot;disorder&quot; to be a neutral term but recognise that, in p &amp; g on article titles,  is given one step up in the content pecking order in comparison to .  None the less, I think that if a word like &quot;condition&quot; might be applied then this may present greater neutrality.    10:05, 31 May 2015 (UTC)
right...so medical condition is defined as A disease, illness or injury; any physiologic, mental or psychological condition or disorder (e.g., orthopaedic; visual, speech or hearing impairments; cerebral palsy; epilepsy; muscular dystrophy; multiple sclerosis; cancer; coronary artery disease; diabetes; mental retardation; emotional or mental illness; specific learning disabilities; HIV disease; TB; drug addiction; alcoholism). A biological or psychological state which is within the range of normal human variation is not a medical condition.[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/medical+condition]...what your indicating is that the article  Homosexuality_and_psychology uses the term disorder in its place (and in so , give the example to  [http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/homosexuality-cure-delhi-doctors-exposed-conversion-therapy/1/440416.html] news link ) I think you could be correct that the article might use a more neutral tone, I for my part would support such a move (but not everyone might see it this way) -- () 13:56, 31 May 2015 (UTC)
I think that WP should use whatever terminology reliable sources use regardless of what the common sense understanding of the term is. This might mean that there needs to be qualifications indicating that this term is a neutral descriptor and doesn't imply a negative judgment. But people interpret terms differently and I think we should be using the terms that medical and psychological studies use rather than preferred, more &quot;neutral-sounding&quot; words. [[User:Liz|Liz]] [[Special:Contributions/Liz|Read!]] [[User talk:Liz|Talk!]] 15:50, 31 May 2015 (UTC)
Greg, the Wikipedia concept of &quot;neutral&quot; doesn't mean using the positive-sounding words for a negatively viewed subject.  It means accurately and fairly representing the reliable sources.  If the sources use negative-sounding words, then we should too.  If they use positive-sounding words, then we should too.  If the reliable sources consistently call something &quot;a disorder&quot;, then we must follow their word choice.  This is just a stick-to-the-sources issue.  Individuals (including editors) might disagree with our sources' word choice, but individual opinion just don't matter.  We can no more remove the potentially stigmatizing but very mainstream label of &quot;disorder&quot; from this subject than we can remove the definitely stigmatizing and equally mainstream labels of &quot;massacre&quot; and &quot;rebellion&quot;, even if someone personally believes that &quot;legitimate military action against military personnel illegally fighting without wearing their uniforms&quot; and &quot;freedom fighters&quot; would be more neutral.  (Also, because of the problem of overmedicalization, some individuals might disagree with calling it a &quot;medical condition&quot; at all.)   () 22:45, 31 May 2015 (UTC)
Note: I commented about the matter [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Flyer22&amp;diff=664914898&amp;oldid=664876023#Non_med_opinion on my talk page.]  () 20:55, 31 May 2015 (UTC)
Thanks again to all.  As a potentially alternative route forward I was wondering if the content and presentation of the articles could be looked into so that, if they are labelled as disorders, they present disorders.  I personally do not feel qualified to make appropriate changes or to assess whether they need to be made.  In the American Psychiatric Association's The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (2013), the third page ref in [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_VzzAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=American+Psychiatric+Association.+%282013%29.+Diagnostic+and+Statistical+Manual+of+Mental+Disorders&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=g-1rVYrXO6PW7AbU_4KgDg&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=F65.51&amp;f=false this link] presents the first part of a description on &quot;Sexual Masochism Disorder&quot;, misses a page and then seems to present the second part of a description on &quot;Sexual Sadism Disorder&quot;.  In the first case &quot;Diagnostic Criteria&quot; are presented as &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;.  Do both of these need to be fulfilled for the definition &quot;Disorder&quot; to be correctly applied?  Any other thoughts?   06:03, 1 June 2015 (UTC)
in regards to the article it would be connected to (  Sexual masochism disorder), I think it best to cite both A and B (with link) so the reader can get a good idea of the criteria that must be met,(for the disorder)-- () 10:50, 1 June 2015 (UTC)

Tagging old Cochrane reviews for which there is an updated version
I would like have created a bot that would check if Wikipedia is using old Cochrane reviews. The bot would go through all Cochrane reviews let's say every three months, it would pull the PMID from the citation template and put that number into Pubmed.

For example  gives http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17943917

Than if the bot finds the heading &quot;Update in&quot; it would add to Wikipedia after that reference the . And than for &quot;reason&quot; it would add the PMID for the updated version of that review http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23990350

The bot would also created a page were all Cochrane reviews in need of updating are listed. Do people support this idea? If there is support I will try to have it built / get bot approval.

I'm not really worried about Doc James, but I have seen so many instances of editors &quot;going botty&quot; that I think it's something we need to keep an eye out for.

RFC: Proposal to revert article Psychiatry to version of 28 June 2012

 has suggested reverting the article Psychiatry to a [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Psychiatry&amp;oldid=499825194#Transinstitutionalization_and_the_aftermath revision of 28 June 2012]. The editor argues that this is necessary to address issues of  in the controversy section of the current version of the article. They also argue that the article has experienced a general degradation of wording and phrasing compared to the 28 June 2012 revision. Regardless of whether the proposed reversion is justified, in the interests of article stability, it might be worthwhile to solicit a wider spectrum of opinion before applying such wide-ranging changes. Hence, I've begun a [[Talk:Psychiatry#RFC: Proposal to revert article Psychiatry to version of 28 June 2012|RFC]] on this issue.

IEG: Medical Translation Project
Hi everyone!

I've applied for a renewal of the IEG- (Individual Engagement Grant) I received last year as part of the [[:WP:TTF|Medical Translation Project]]. We had great success during those months, but I would like to keep working within the project, to make sure we can reach some of our long-term goals as well. I plan to dedicate my summer, and a large portion of my time this fall towards the project, and hope you think it's worthwhile. I'd be very happy if you took some of your time to take a look and to add your comments on the project – perhaps what could be improved and if you see anything you like.

Renewal request:

Manufacturing of drugs

Hi everyone,  and I have been discussing the utility of having manufacturing/administration safety data in various drug articles, and decided to ask for some wider input here. OSHA has set permissible exposure limits for workers who are involved in manufacturing certain drugs, and there are other health concerns for workers who may be exposed to drugs like chemotherapy drugs. Aspirin currently has an example of what I'd like to insert in several of these articles. I think this is relevant to include because it concerns the manufacture of the drug and it also concerns the health of the workers manufacturing it. But before including it in any more drug articles, it'd be nice to have some input. If its place isn't in the drug articles, is there another place where this important information could go?   () 02:46, 4 June 2015 (UTC)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aspirin&amp;diff=664347124&amp;oldid=664197198 This]?  In general, I think that kind of information is great.  Including &quot;non-medical&quot; information about drugs is necessary to make an article comprehensive.  I might include it under a
Manufacturing
(or similar) section, when the focus is mostly on exposure during manufacturing.  () 09:28, 4 June 2015 (UTC)
Not a big fan of the Template:PGCH. &quot;Cite web&quot; is more consistent with what the rest of the article is using. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 09:53, 4 June 2015 (UTC)
the Aspirin article is better off with cite web...IMO-- () 10:47, 4 June 2015 (UTC)
 In general, it's encyclopedic information, even if somewhat US-centric, so I'd agree it's worth inclusion. There are some issues, though. In the aspirin article, it is stated that &quot;OSHA has not set a legal permissible exposure limit&quot;, but OSHA did set a PEL for aspirin in 1989, which was overturned by a court decision in 1993. It's probably beyond the scope of the article to discuss this, but I don't think we do a service to our readers by stating untruths. A different form of words may avoid this problem, or perhaps a link to an article discussing the 1993 AFL-CIO v. OSHA decision? The other point is that we shouldn't leave our readers wondering what TWA means and ought to simply write 'time-weighted average' if that's the only occurrence. In passing, I'm left wondering why a limit which is an average over a 10-hour period is used for an explosive risk? -- () 11:36, 4 June 2015 (UTC)
 I've switched the citation in aspirin over to .  That's a good point - I've reworded that bit to say &quot;In 1989, OSHA set a legal permissible exposure limit for aspirin of 5 mg/m3, but this was vacated by the AFL-CIO v. OSHA decision in 1993.&quot; I've also replaced TWA with time-weighted average. And, to answer your question, the TWA is for the inhalation risk to workers, the explosive risk is different and difficult to quantify.   () 18:13, 4 June 2015 (UTC)

 to be clear the original dif on the aspirin article was [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aspirin&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=664195074 this], about the danger of aspirin powder exploding without any context.  i [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aspirin&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=664195074 reverted] that - holy exploding aspirin batman!  Not relevant to 99.9% of our readers, who do not work in places where they are exposed to aspirin powder.  the current dif above is good and put it in context.   I am glad to have all GLAM editors around, but adding occupational hazards related to manufacturing seems weird to me in health-related articles, as we rarely say anything about manufacturing drugs/devices/diagnostics (we do sometimes have content on benchtop lab synthesis of chemicals but that is not content about manufacturing).  Likewise, our articles about drugs/devices/diagnostics and about disease management rarely discuss what doctors and nurses and technicians actually do, so again content about the occupational hazards faced by them seems strange. A point without a locus.  Do you see what I mean?  () 12:37, 4 June 2015 (UTC)
 I do see what you mean, but it pre-supposes that an article about aspirin must focus on health-related content. Much of the information in any encyclopedia is not relevant to 99.9% of its readers, but that does not make it unencyclopedic. One could argue that an all-encompassing article about Manufacture of drugs or List of recommended exposure levels of substances might be a better place for them, but in the absence of such articles, I can't see any good reason why the REL for workers manufacturing aspirin shouldn't belong in the aspirin article. -- () 16:36, 4 June 2015 (UTC)

I agree with WAID that the manufacturing information could use its own section - 'chemical properties' seems like a slightly odd place to find information about a specific form of the bulk substance. I like the idea of including it in general, though - with a clear distinction of the difference between manufacturing safety and drug safety. I doubt anyone who lives on this planet and isn't currently wearing a tinfoil hat would suspect he was in danger from an exploding medicine cabinet, but other cases could have more plausibly generalizable occupational hazards.
I don't like the idea of defining articles about chemicals that happen to be used as drugs as &quot;health-related articles&quot; and excluding information not relevant to that specific use case. And to use Jytdog's example, if a device/diagnostic/etc. does produce a significant and interesting occupational hazard for the medical staff, surely that should be in the article too.  () 17:14, 4 June 2015 (UTC)
I take Jytdog's accurate statement that &quot;we rarely say anything about manufacturing drugs/devices/diagnostics&quot; to be a clear statement of a significant policy violation:  We are not giving DUE weight to these things as being commercial products.  Perhaps we should address this common omission in MEDMOS?   () 19:33, 4 June 2015 (UTC)
i don't know if i would go so far as to say policy violation, WAID. From what i have seen, WP:MED is primarily concerned with health and biology and that is what folks here seem to write about. I am interested in the science/medicine/business aspects of bringing new medical products to market, so i often include that stuff in articles i work on, but i feel i am a bit of a freak in that in regard. i don't think anybody here cares much about how how things are actually manufactured (although i have written a bit about industrial fermentation and Pharming (genetics)) but that is about as far as that goes, that i have seen anyway.  the kinds of sourcing for drug/device/diagnostic manufacturing are not pub-med things.. not generally in the wheelhouse of really any editors i have ever come across in WP...  interested to hear what others have to say!   () 19:50, 4 June 2015 (UTC)
I'll stick with policy violation.  Most of our articles do not comply.  This isn't the fault of any , but our articles are not giving due weight to these aspects.  Proposed solution:  Let's find more &quot;freaks&quot; like you.  ;-)   () 09:07, 5 June 2015 (UTC)

I have run into resistance from a number of editors regarding this.

I favor simplicity, but I also favor correctness.  The first version is actually wrong -- or at least, doesn't have the intended meaning.  The first version is equivalent to, &quot;After people eat or drink water that has tapeworm eggs in it, they usually get cysticercosis&quot;.  Possibly that's true, but it isn't what the second version says.  Complexity is bad, but ambiguity is worse.  () 21:03, 5 June 2015 (UTC)

Notice of an RFC regarding the E-Meter article
I have recently performed a major overhaul of the E-meter article in an effort to bring the article into what I see as &quot;compliance with  and  policies&quot;.  While none of the other editors there have denied my concern about the article's aparent non-ccompliance with WP policy, no other editor there has yet endorsed my wholesale overhaul of the article.   I have essentially restored the article to a &quot;properly contemporized&quot; 2007 edition of the article, in order to achieve this.  The question there is whether or not to keep the major overhaul edition of the article, which I am calling the &quot;restored&quot; article, or to merely try to make gradual edits to the &quot;pre-restored&quot; version to bring about WP Policy compliance.  Which path is best? The major overhaul path, or the incrimental path?  Any input at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:E-meter#RFC:_The_best_way_to_keep_this_article_in_compliance_with_WP:Due.2F_Undue the E-meter article's RFC] from editors here would be most appreciated.

Given that the ethics of more or less any practice is liable to have been disputed by someone or other [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilet_paper_orientation], I'd have to suggest that it is either useless (because everything belongs in it), or arbitrary (because everything isn't included in it). Delete because its use in an encyclopaedia is unethical...  () 21:56, 5 June 2015 (UTC)

Just in general I don't find categories very useful and think they're almost always used by editors with opinions about a topic to &quot;tag&quot; the topic. I saw the back-and-forth at Birth control over this, if I could turn AGF off I'd say add the cat was more intended to be point-y than an article improvement, but the content in the article does support the category as there's a bit of content related to ethics. Does anybody even see or use the cats? Can't say I'd burn a lot of energy over that one. [[User:Zad68|Zad]][[User_Talk:Zad68|68]] 21:59, 5 June 2015 (UTC)
Actually now I am reading  and a category should be a defining characteristic of an article.  I wouldn't say that birth control has ethical disputes as a &quot;defining characteristic&quot; so I'd argue against that cat.  There's actually only a brief mention of ethics in the article, so probably not enough to meet .  [[User:Zad68|Zad]][[User_Talk:Zad68|68]] 22:07, 5 June 2015 (UTC)
I suspect that whether an ethical dispute is a &quot;defining characteristic&quot; depends upon your point in history.  For example, when fire insurance was a new idea, there were many debates about whether subscribing was ethical (or even moral).  The same for anesthesia, especially during childbirth.  We have ethical disputes over gene therapy now, but a millenium from now, they may look back at us and condemn us for not properly treating people.  I'm therefore inclined to agree with Andy:  this is either useless or arbitrary.    () 01:04, 6 June 2015 (UTC)
In general categories are extremely useful, but less so in this subjective kind of area. No doubt the contents will look rather different in 2115, but there we go.

 I would venture that an impalement is a kind of penetrating trauma, but one that specifically involves an object penetrating the body that is solid for the length of the penetration.

 Agreed. Referencing Rosen's (8th edition, online), in medical literature an impalement is simply a form of penetrating trauma, however the difference is when using the word impalement, it means the object is still present. For that reason, I propose a redirect from impalement injury to penetrating trauma.

cerebral palsy/university of Adelaide

University of Adelaide researchers have discovered cerebral palsy has an even stronger genetic cause than previously thought, leading them to call for an end to unnecessary caesareans and arbitrary litigation against obstetric staff. In an authoritative review published in the American Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology, members of the Australian Cerebral Palsy Research Group, based at the University of Adelaide’s Robinson Research Institute, argue that up to 45% of cerebral palsy cases can have genetic causes. This builds on research published in February this year by the group which found at least 14% of cerebral palsy cases are likely to be caused by a genetic mutation. And the group expects the percentage of genetically caused cerebral palsy cases will continue to increase as genetic sequencing techniques evolve. The University of Adelaide’s Emeritus Professor Alastair MacLennan, leader of the research group, says the realisation by courts that many cases of cerebral palsy cannot be prevented by differences in labour management should reduce the adverse influence of obstetric litigation. “For many years it was assumed, without good evidence, cerebral palsy was caused by brain damage at birth through lack of oxygen.,” [http://www.adelaide.edu.au/news/news78442.html]-- () 18:26, 8 June 2015 (UTC)

Doc James is on the board of the Wikimedia Foundation

, a contributor here at WikiProject Medicine, has been elected to the board of the Wikimedia Foundation. More information can be found in these places.
*[[:meta:Wikimedia Foundation elections 2015/Results#Board elections]]
*[https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikimedia-l/2015-June/078087.html James accepts on Wikimedia-l mailing list]
*

James announced his candidacy on this board.
*

James would comment about this whenever he wished to do so, but leaving aside anything that James has done, here are some possible implications of his being elected:

*Health-related content on Wikimedia projects may get more attention and be taken more seriously in the greater health community
*The Wikimedia Foundation, which has in the past been hesitant at times to acknowledge its contributors to health content, may begin a cultural change to consider itself a health organization along with everything else that it is.
*WikiProjects related to health may get more contributors from this point.
*More organizations external to Wikimedia communities may begin to consider investing in the development of the health content of Wikimedia projects.
*More social movements external to Wikimedia communities but in the open knowledge / free culture space may begin to be more comfortable in making their content free and open to share and remix.

I list these things just as being possible outcomes of being able to say &quot;the Wikimedia Foundation has a medical doctor on its board and this person endorses Wikipedia as a channel for distributing health information&quot;. I say this because in the past, certain demographics on Wikipedia have benefited from having board representation, even without actually interacting with the relevant board member. 

If anyone has thought of proposing any kind of project on-wiki related to health, or of encouraging any group or organization to develop Wikipedia's health content, now might be a good time to think more of doing that. The Wikipedia brand is a powerful thing that opens a lot of doors off-wiki. Speaking of the WMF board's connection to health could be useful also.

Tremendous congrats to James. While health is obviously his main focus, I hope and expect he will not just concern himself with health-related angles to issues. The first thing that needs to happen, before the things Leigh lists can, is for the WMF to stop seeing itself as a software business, which it now does, and instead see itself as an online publishing business (as well). The WMF needs to start taking some responsibility for the content and its quality. That in itself will be a huge change for them, and not easily accomplished.  I hope James can help this much needed change along.  () 15:12, 8 June 2015 (UTC)
My primary efforts at least initially are going to be to try to improve WMF / communities relations. I see part of the issue being that the WMF sort of dose its own thing without getting input from those who are going to be using the software. This needs to change. For one the community needs access to tech resources to build tools that will help them build Wikipedia and two the communities needs a greater say and greater involvement during the entire development process. I see this change as benefiting not only those here but all editors.
Additionally while a lot of the work I do pertains to medicine I also do a fair bit with respect to copyright and issues surrounding undisclosed paid editing. We now have a bot that checks all edits over a certain size globally for copyright issues [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:EranBot/Copyright/rc here]. It is in serious need of people to follow up on the issues it has found. Plus it still needs further development.

Robert Ira Lewy

I am wondering if Robert Ira Lewy would fall within the scope of this Wikiproject. The subject of the article, Lewy himself, created the article back in 2007 and has been editing off and on since then. However, he is now aware of  so he has stopped editing and moved to discussing things on  instead. I and some others have been trying to help him out, but I do not have much experience with BLP's about medical doctors/researchers so I'm not sure how to best proceed. Any feedback or suggestions from the editors of this Wikiproject would be most appreciated. Thanks in advance. -  () 13:27, 8 June 2015 (UTC)

Thanks  for that link. To be totally honest, however, I am not sure exactly what that means. Does that mean they are all worthy of being mentioned in Wikipedia or only some? Any suggestions you may have on how to determine which articles should be mentioned in the article would be most appreciated. Could you please post then at  if you do have any? The more experienced editors looking at this article, the better. Thanks again.  -  () 21:50, 8 June 2015 (UTC)

Abstinence-only sex education

I am concerned about the use of [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18346659 this study] in this article. It is cited several times, but it doesn't seem to meet MEDRS, so I think it should be removed. What do others think?   00:55, 11 June 2015 (UTC)
Seems to fall flat in terms of MEDRS in terms of being a primary source, so I'd remove it. That being said, I did find 3 reviews citing it on Web of Science:
#The effectiveness of group-based comprehensive risk-reduction and abstinence education interventions to prevent or reduce the risk of adolescent pregnancy, human immunodeficiency virus, and sexually transmitted infections: two systematic reviews for the Guide to Community Preventive Services. [http://www.cdc.mynmi.net/Hover/hiv/AE_CRR_Evidence_Review.pdf]

I did not go through the reviews to see what they said, but WoS gave the first source 40 citations, while the second and third had one and none citations, respectively. If there is anything worth citing, it might be in the first source.  () 01:40, 11 June 2015 (UTC)

Try http://cmr.asm.org/content/23/1/99.full, in the Definitions section.

Coulrophobia

section (of a *claimed* condition).  says &quot;Include only if addressed by significant sources.&quot; PubMed currently does not seem to return any hit for the term &quot;coulrophobia&quot; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=coulrophobia]. Related studies mainly seem to regard hospital clowning (see [https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=coulrophobia+study] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=%28fear+OR+phobia%29+AND+clown*]). My query is basically: what to do with this &quot;Research&quot; section?  () 11:37, 11 June 2015 (UTC)
It is claiming to be a medical condition?  Can a child &quot;abnormally scared of clowns&quot; be really said to be an issue for medicine?  It seems to me that this depends on the extent or notion of &quot;abnormally&quot;, but I'm not convinced the papers in that page are suggesting that it is a medical condition, just that there is evidence that children in hospitals sometimes get scared of clowns - and so on. That seems to me to be more psychology than medicine, and a descriptive idea at that.  I can't see that it is suggesting treatment nor really medically framed diagnosis. The references are rubbish and formatted badly, but I don't think  can be used for subjects which are tangentially related to medicine, otherwise it would apply to almost all of wikipedia. But I am not a medic, so I might be a minority voice here.  () 11:58, 11 June 2015 (UTC)
 That's interesting , thank you. The claim that it's  [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Coulrophobia&amp;oldid=665259084 &quot;a type of specific phobia&quot;] has been removed by me. I agree the broader issues are nuanced (and also of some more general relevance, imo [http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/jun/07/why-clowns-are-dying-out]). I'll try posting at WT:PSYCH to see if anyone there is interested in improving the content/framing.  () 12:27, 11 June 2015 (UTC)

Are Calluses really a type of Calcification?

The latter article does not seem to mention calcification is possible.  () 22:30, 10 June 2015 (UTC)
the &quot;symptom&quot; section of the latter article has been marked with an inline citation needed-- () 11:19, 11 June 2015 (UTC)
The term might apply better to &quot;fracture callus&quot; (partly discussed in Bone healing) rather than a callosity or tyloma, which has different etiology. If calluses are a type of calcification then so are keratoses and any number of skin growths. I suggest removing the item to avoid such confusion.  () 19:12, 11 June 2015 (UTC)
Neither keratosis or hyperkeratosis  mention calcification (and presumably these processes define calluses).  () 22:14, 11 June 2015 (UTC)
Agreed. Although calcium levels might have an effect on keratosis, I don't see any references linking calluses to calcification/malabsorption. Friction/pressure is really the only established etiology. Removed the item from Calcification#Symptoms. I think Callus#Other_meanings could be expanded, though, to mention the orthopedic use of the word.  () 05:31, 12 June 2015 (UTC)

Global burden of disease report

The Lancet has just published the new [http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2815%2960692-4/fulltext Global burden of disease] report but looking at the Results section of the wiki page, I think the existing information is wrong. It is talking about the 2013 report, which as far as I can tell does not give the results to 2013 but 2010 (the one just published in 2015 is to 2013, they take some time to collate the information).  The last edit was before the Lancet published this report (and the 2013 report just published in 2015 is not cited on the wiki page).  I therefore think this section needs checking and rewriting - just a warning in case anyone is watching and wonders what I'm doing.  () 09:47, 12 June 2015 (UTC)

Correction, it looks like the Results section is talking about some of the preliminary results released last year. The problem is a lack of cited reference. I will add the correct ref to what is there, but the substantial results also need to be included.  () 10:11, 12 June 2015 (UTC)</segment>
