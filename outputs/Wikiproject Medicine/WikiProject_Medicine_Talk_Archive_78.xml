are [http://i.walmart.com/i/if/hmp/fusion/genericdruglist.pdf Walmart's pricelist] and [http://www.target.com/pharmacy/generics-alphabetic Target's pricelist] reliable sources for drug pricing?  Am asking because of [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aciclovir&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=708673206&amp;oldid=707188455 this dif].  Thanks. Jytdog (talk) 02:29, 7 March 2016 (UTC)
The two best sources available for the cost of prescription and over-the-counter drugs (that I am aware of) are [http://micromedex.com/products/product-suites/clinical-knowledge/redbook Red Book Online] and the [http://erc.msh.org/mainpage.cfm?file=1.0.htm&amp;module=DMP&amp;language=english International Drug Price Indicator Guide]. I have done some work with Red Book in the past, and even for drugs that are widely available as cheap generics, you will see that prices vary a lot (just search ibuprofen to get an example). And the average wholesale price listed can sometimes be substantially higher than the $10 for a 90-day supply that you can get at discount mail-order pharmacies. NW (Talk) 02:51, 7 March 2016 (UTC)
Thanks, so if everyday people read WP and make comments like the one in the dif, the right answer is.... Jytdog (talk) 02:54, 7 March 2016 (UTC)
See also  for information about finding the average US costs.  In the specific instance, I think the right answer is &quot;see how much the price has changed since this article was last updated&quot;.  (Or even &quot;check for typos&quot;, since one of those sources seems to say 5 cents, not 50.)  WhatamIdoing (talk) 05:19, 7 March 2016 (UTC)
 See . I think the policy is not developed enough to give clear guidance on how to manage prices.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 16:33, 7 March 2016 (UTC)
, where do you see the 5 cents?  I don't see that [http://www.drugs.com/price-guide/acyclovir at the drugs.com site], where the lowest price is over a dollar per pill (ignoring the different dosage forms, which include a solution)  The other source at that article is micromedex, a  proprietary database that i don't have access to. Jytdog (talk) 18:39, 7 March 2016 (UTC)
I was looking at [http://erc.msh.org/dmpguide/resultsdetail.cfm?language=english&amp;code=ACI400T&amp;s_year=2014&amp;year=2014&amp;str=400%20mg&amp;desc=Aciclovir&amp;pack=new&amp;frm=TAB-CAP&amp;rte=PO&amp;class_code2=06.4.1.&amp;supplement=&amp;class_name=%2806.4.1.%29Antiherpes%20medicines%3Cbr%3E this source], which gives the 2014 &quot;buyer price&quot; in South Africa as US $ &quot;0.0553/tab-cap&quot; or approximately five cents per pill.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 22:12, 7 March 2016 (UTC)
I see.  thanks for answering.  Jytdog (talk) 22:16, 7 March 2016 (UTC)
If you want US prices specifically, then [https://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-Information/By-Topics/Benefits/Prescription-Drugs/Pharmacy-Pricing.html Medicare says] that they're running around 10 or 11 cents per pill this week.  I don't know whether that's wholesale or retail, but presumably there is a relatively fixed cost for just filling the prescription.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 22:22, 7 March 2016 (UTC)
just fyi, per [https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid-chip-program-information/by-topics/benefits/prescription-drugs/ful-nadac-downloads/nadacmethodology.pdf this], the NADAC is the average cost for pharmacies in the US to acquire the drug. This remains a thorny issue. If that is what we are going to report in articles, then the content should say &quot;the average cost for a pharmacy in the US to acquire the drug on X date was Y&quot;  We need to careful naming what we report.... Jytdog (talk) 22:43, 7 March 2016 (UTC)
Trascon Pharmacopoeia gives the rough price for a course of treatment. US is generally more than many other places in the world. While some expensive meds are only available in the USA at least initially. 
Would prefer to stick with more general rather than retail specific sources especially with more generic sources being available. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 02:36, 8 March 2016 (UTC)
I think I'd be happy to use NADAC numbers and call it &quot;wholesale price&quot; (when US-specific numbers are wanted).  WhatamIdoing (talk) 02:40, 8 March 2016 (UTC)
Yes I am happy with the NADAC price and calling it wholesale. By the way the drug.com site[http://www.drugs.com/price-guide/acyclovir] if you click on 400mg you see that it is 0.41 USD per dose (when buying 50 doses a typical course of treatment). Which makes a course of treatment 21USD or in the range of what Tarascon states. This is about the same as 0.50 USD per dose as we stated in our article. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 02:43, 8 March 2016 (UTC)
 this makes sense to me.  i feel like i am being a dick about this, but it kills me to have someone be able to so easily show our content to be unreliable based on their actual experience of buying drugs (like the dif in my OP), and tons of people get prescriptions filled at places like target and walmart. Jytdog (talk) 02:47, 8 March 2016 (UTC)
Here [http://www.target.com/pharmacy/generics-alphabetic] it appears to be saying that 90 tabs is 10 USD. But these are the 200s and you need to take two for a single dose. So 10 for 45 doses which is 0.22 USD per dose or 11 USD for a 10 day, 5 doses per day course of treatment. IMO saying less than 25 USD per course of treatment is better but either way. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 02:58, 8 March 2016 (UTC)
thanks that math is helpful!  part of what is complicated in the cost for treatment is that we get into dosing to calculate that, and per MEDMOS we don't go there. i don't know the origin of that prohibition as I wasn't around and haven't done my homework, but i understand we keep a firm line on that.

Access to a couple journal articles for the wiki article &quot;self-disorder&quot;

Self-disorders, ipseity disturbance, disturbance of minimal self, etc., in schizophrenia

On PubMed, I have been seeing lots of articles lately relating to a rediscovered phenomenon in schizophrenia spectrum disorders that has been variously referred to as self-disorders, ipseity disturbance, and disturbance of basic or minimal self. A manual for a semi-structured interview that assesses self-disorders was published in the journal Psychopathology in 2005 called the Examination of Anomalous Self-Experience (EASE).There are some review articles and books I have seen that reference this phenomenon, but they are hard to access. The research I've seen has found that the EASE can distinguish patients with schizophrenia and schizotypal personality disorder from patients with psychotic bipolar disorder, non-schizophrenic psychotic disorders, or borderline personality disorder.

Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any article or even section on Wikipedia that addresses this issue. The lack of reference to this phenomenon in Wikipedia is I think evident in the article Center for Subjectivity Research, about an interdisciplinary research center located at the University of Copenhagen. If you look at the lead, every one of the phenomena you see that they study has a wiki-link, except for self-disorders, which is kinda strange. The only reference to self-disorders, and it is a rather oblique reference, is in this article about the causes of schizophrenia. It is only one sentence long and doesn't really impress upon the reader what it is.

Now, I believe there are going to be issues of  as well as organizing an article or section on the phenomenon. I would like assistance on organizing an article or section as well as assembling references for it to achieve . --Beneficii (talk) 19:31, 6 March 2016 (UTC)

 I have done work on the sex reassignment therapy article, removing the &quot;for&quot; and &quot;against&quot; sections (which I believe are inappropriate for a medical article) and creating an effectiveness section that looks at the literature, as guided by secondary sources.

Using the word child maltreatment instead of child abuse at the Child abuse article

Opinions are needed on the following matter: . Specifically, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Child_abuse&amp;diff=708951597&amp;oldid=708951331 this issue], which originally concerned whether or not to use the term child maltreatment instead of child abuse, and now concerns whether the term child neglect should be included when stating &quot;the definitions of child abuse or child maltreatment can vary across the sectors of society which deal with the issue&quot; and that, because of this, &quot;communication across disciplines can be limited, hampering efforts to identify, assess, track, treat, and prevent such abuse.&quot; Opinions on either aspect (use of the term child maltreatment instead of child abuse, or whether to include the term child neglect when relaying the aforementioned &quot;can vary&quot; and &quot;communication across disciplines can be limited&quot; aspects) would be fine. 

Doc James or Jytdog, willing to add an opinion on this and/or mediate? Flyer22 Reborn (talk) 11:03, 8 March 2016 (UTC)
They are synonymous from what I understand. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 16:59, 8 March 2016 (UTC)
I believe that different sources use those terms differently.  For some sources, maltreatment = (abuse+neglect), and for others, maltreatment = abuse.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:59, 8 March 2016 (UTC)

Request review of HIV posters in Commons

Currently there is a deletion review in Wikimedia Commons of 2600 educational posters from the 1980s-90s giving HIV/AIDS information. I am posting to request that anyone please go into Commons, browse through the posters, and if you see one that does not contain copyrighted art, then please make a post that it should not be deleted. The issue is lack of copyright. However, if a poster contains only text and geometric shapes, then it is considered to be in the public domain.
*
Also, the organization which provided these images would recognize feedback and I would appreciate any positive comments about their attempt at 
*

Previously I had shared this poster project as follows -
*
*

Here is a recap -
Wellcome Trust is one of the largest medical nonprofit foundations in the world. They have a large archive including public health materials, and they have shared more than a million health media files in Wikimedia Commons at . Among the files they have provided, they shared these 2600 historical HIV/AIDS educational posters. This was an unprecedented donation because the art came from 2000+ organizations and artists, and I think Wikimedia projects have never before had an organization claim to have managed so many relationships including copyright claims. In the end, Wellcome presumed too much. On reflection they have announced that in fact, they did not control the copyright to these HIV posters, and that they spoke incorrectly when they said that they did. Right now they are saying that their copyright agreement with the organizations is that the original copyright holders are demanding CC-By-NC-ND. At this point, my perspective is that everyone involved is confused about copyright. The big lesson that I take away from this is that the most respected librarians and archivists at the best funded archives in the world have a different understanding of copyright than an average Wikipedia contributor. It surprises me a little that many organizations are not conscious of the copyright of the content they hold. I encourage Wikipedians who try to negotiate with institutions to have clear discussions with staff about the meaning of copyright and what it means to share content on Wikipedia. I really appreciate the Wellcome Trust taking initiative to try to share good content with Wikimedia projects. They were the first to attempt an innovative sharing model. In the end, they realized that they tried to donate something that was not theirs to share. Because the HIV posters were never theirs, all of the posters that are not in the public domain will need to be deleted from Commons in the next week or so. The posters will remain on the Wellcome Trust website as CC-By-NC-ND.

The Wellcome Library participants in this are the best. I appreciate their enthusiasm, support, and willingness to try new things.

I'm dubious about the claim that a work that contains &quot;only text and geometric shapes&quot; is not eligible for copyright.  If that were true, then a great deal of modern art, including Piet Mondrian's most famous works, would not be copyrightable.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:42, 24 February 2016 (UTC)
For reference, . According to the US Copyright Office anyway; it's not the equivalent to a court ruling but one can generally trust their decisions to stand. (talk, ) 16:48, 24 February 2016 (UTC)
The US Copyright Office interprets that logo (which was submitted sans company name) as merely an irregular blue pentagon and the letter &quot;W&quot;.  The artist who drew a &quot;W&quot; to look like a crown (from the old logo) probably disagrees with their decision, and I would not be surprised if the W/crown had been submitted by itself, and labeled as artwork, that it would have been accepted.  
What we don't see in that ruling is any assertion that all works containing only text and geometric shapes, regardless of arrangement, color, amount of text, originality, etc., are ineligible for copyright – and we never will, because such a rule would make it impossible to hold a copyright on a poem.

Dotage

Dotage is currently a soft redirect to Wiktionary, which seems odd for a normal term describing a medical condition.  Would it be better as a redirect to Dementia perhaps (I thought to redirect it to Senility, but that's a redirect to Dementia), or is there a better target, or is the current setup the best of all worlds (to make a Voltaire allusion) at the moment?  Nyttend (talk) 04:43, 9 March 2016 (UTC)
The second definition at Wiktionary would give me pause: &quot;Fondness or attentiveness, especially to an excessive degree&quot;, since this is at least as common as the senility usage in common day use. --Izno (talk) 13:13, 9 March 2016 (UTC)

Writing Articles Like How-to Guides

That might be a misleading title. I don't want to do that, but I was reading the article on &quot;abdominal examination&quot; as I was adding a source, and it reads almost like a how-to on performing an abdominal exam.

Is that encyclopedic, does that have value, is that the goal of this project?

I'm just curious, because before I go in and try to change too many things, I'd like to have a better idea of the approach that's taken toward this sort of article.

Thanks, PiousCorn (talk) 01:50, 9 March 2016 (UTC)

Go right in and try to improve it.  
That kind of article can be pretty hard to write well, so a lot of people end up straying into &quot;how to&quot; territory.  For example, they'll write &quot;First, press here&quot; instead of &quot;A typical exam starts by pressing here&quot;.  And most people don't actually know enough to write interesting encyclopedic things, such as &quot;In Europe and the Americas, they usually start by pressing here, but in Asia, they usually start in this other spot&quot;.
If you can clean it up (even a little bit), that would be very helpful.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 04:27, 9 March 2016 (UTC)

Throat lozenge

Earlier we worked on merging brand name instances of drugs into the article on the generic version, unless there was something NOTABLE about the brand per se.  I just came across Throat lozenge which has a bunch of brands linked to it each of which has its own article, such as this one Strepsils which is a big nothing and should be deleted in my view.

What's going on with SUDs?

Right now there are at least 4 separate articles on essentially the same topic: Substance abuse, Substance dependence, Substance-related disorder and Substance use disorder. All of them have old banners that link to closed merge proposals, but I can't tell what went down and why none of the merges ever happened. The discussions are hard to follow, because they don't really correspond with the proposed merges either. For example, in June 2015, there was a  , but the conversation is all over the place. It starts off strong. Then derails into someone suggesting a merger of 6 articles (the 4 I mentioned above plus Substance intoxication and Substance abuse prevention) to someone suggesting a merge with the article on general Dependence, which triggered vehement opposition. Somehow the conclusion (of the proposed merge between Substance-related disorder and Substance dependence) was to merge Substance-related disorder with Substance abuse prevention and Substance intoxication, and to leave Substance dependence as a stand-alone article. IMHO that was a less than ideal outcome, but none of those merges ever happened anyway. And then at some point, the lead to Substance-related disorder was made to be identical to the lead of Substance abuse (including the bolded words), even though the original proposal was for it to be merged with Substance dependence. 

There was also a proposed merge between Substance abuse and Substance use disorder and the conversation goes like this: 
 IP editor1: &quot;&quot; Wuh??
 Doc James: Concise and logical argument for merging in less than 3 sentences
 IP editor2: &quot;: The end. No more comments. No merge.
What the heck? Should I bother trying again? PermStrump(talk) 07:12, 16 March 2016 (UTC)
Yeah... those articles need a lot of attention. I was considering merging some of those a while back, but I never really got around to it because of the amount of work involved. Seppi333 (Insert 2¢) 11:39, 16 March 2016 (UTC)
 I'm willing to work on it (with help ideally), but I don't know the best way to go about it. If it were up to me, these would the articles:
* Substance-related disorder - an umbrella article with a brief explanation of the following types of disorders with links to the main articles:
* Substance use disorder (merger of Substance abuse and Substance dependence with the current Substance use disorder article)
* Alcohol use disorder (is already merged with Alcohol dependence, but IMHO the title should be switched to Alcohol use disorder instead of dependence. Also, Alcohol abuse should be redirected there instead of to Substance abuse.)
* Cannabis abuse+Cannabis dependence&gt;Cannabis use disorder (same as alcohol)
* Benzodiazepine abuse+Benzodiazepine dependence&gt;Benzodiazepine use disorder, Amphetamine Abuse+Amphetamine dependence&gt;Amphetamine use disorder etc., etc. (same as alcohol and cannabis)
* Opioid addiction and dependence at least already gets redirects from Opioid abuse, Opioid dependence, Opiate dependency and Opioid use disorder. Not sure how I feel about the official title though vs &quot;use disorder.&quot; It would be cool to keep it all consistent. 
* Substance intoxication and could probably be fully covered in a section of Substance-related disorder and probably doesn't need its own article
* Substance abuse prevention - not sure, maybe should stay separate or merge with Drug treatment
* Drug treatment should be renamed Substance abuse treatment since it also includes alcohol.
I know that's wishful thinking, but just throwing it out there. BTW I'm running late for a conference on substance use disorders... shoot. (Seriously) PermStrump(talk) 12:23, 16 March 2016 (UTC)
Am supportive of merging very closely related articles. Would go with &quot;X user disorder&quot; for most of these. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 16:57, 16 March 2016 (UTC)
Yes, these articles need significant clean-up. Is the proposed terminology standard? Sizeofint (talk) 18:19, 16 March 2016 (UTC)
 , yes, that's the official terminology in the DSM-5. Technically, if you were making a formal diagnosis, you'd rate the severity -- mild/moderate/severe (e.g. alcohol use disorder, moderate) based on the # of symptoms and/or qualify it with: intoxication, withdrawal, [X]-induced disorder (e.g. alcohol-induced anxiety disorder). But &quot;substance use disorder&quot;/&quot;[X] use disorder&quot; is the standard catchall term at least in the US. I'm pretty sure that's how it's worded in research articles I've read that were published in Europe, but maybe someone else can weigh in on that. It looks like the ICD-10 still lists &quot;abuse&quot; and &quot;dependence,&quot; and WHO refers to &quot;psychoactive substance use disorders,&quot; which consists of abuse, dependence, intoxication, withdrawal, etc. I'm almost positive though that in the majority of the world, practitioners and researchers refer to it as &quot;[X] use disorder&quot; now, even if the publications haven't caught up yet. We'd been using that terminology for a while before the DSM 5th edition came out in 2013. I think that's usually how it happens (like, we completely stopped saying &quot;mentally retarded&quot; out loud a long time before they finally took it out the DSM in 2013). I'm less sure about how common it is to say &quot;psychoactive substance use disorder&quot; vs &quot;substance use disorder&quot; outside of the US though. If &quot;psychoactive...&quot; is more common internationally, I'm cool with that. Colloquially, I think  people have different connotations for different words even within the same country, and half the time they're talking nonsense (like when people argue there's a difference between addiction and dependency... addiction was never a clinical word, so I have no idea what they think the difference is). My point is... it makes the most sense to go with the medical terminology IMHO. (Sorry if that was more than you ever wanted to know.) 

 , where do you think makes sense to start? Like, should I start by posting new  proposals to merge/redirect/rename articles or does it makes sense to start by cleaning up the articles that seem like they'd be keepers and defer worrying about getting consensus to merge after that? Also, is there ever a way when articles are so messy and redundant like this that there can be an executive decision made about which ones to keep/merge without getting consensus? :) PermStrump(talk) 02:37, 17 March 2016 (UTC)
I have moved the opioid one to opioid use disorder. The only one that should IMO stay with its common name is alcoholism. 
I have also adjusted the cannabis one. The benzo one requires merging and than moving to benzo misuse disorder. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 02:53, 17 March 2016 (UTC)
 Substance dependence needs to be split apart to separate the diagnostic concept (which would be merged) from the neuropsychological concept (which would need to be moved to a new name, e.g., something like &quot;drug dependence&quot; or &quot;stimulus dependence&quot;) if you intend to go ahead with a merge of that article and substance abuse into SUD.  The current dependence article currently covers both concepts, but doesn't really do a good job differentiating between the two in the text. Other than that, I don't really see any issues with this proposal. Seppi333 (Insert 2¢) 03:08, 17 March 2016 (UTC)
 : Sweet, thanks! Here's something weird though... when I type cannabis abuse into the search bar, it correctly redirects me to cannabis use disorder, but when I start to type in &quot;cannabis use...&quot; the only prompt I get is for cannabis use disorders,&quot; which redirects to plain old cannabis. : What do you mean by &quot;stimulus dependence&quot;? My only guess is that it might be what the DSM refers to as, &quot;non-substance related disorders.&quot; Gambling is the only one recognized in the DSM, which I'm sure that has and deserves its own article. Is that the kind of thing you're talking about though, like video games, gambling, shopping, etc? PermStrump(talk) 03:35, 17 March 2016 (UTC)
 When I say &quot;stimulus dependence&quot;, I'm not referring to a diagnostic model.  &quot;Dependence&quot; is not a diagnostic label, but &quot;substance dependence&quot; is. The neuropsychological concept of dependence is defined in the glossary in substance dependence, whereas the diagnostic concept of a &quot;substance dependence&quot; (as of the DSM-IV) is defined at the end of the lead in that article.  If it helps to clarify the difference, both addiction and dependence (i.e., psychological dependence and physical dependence) refer to actual diseases; &quot;substance dependence&quot; and &quot;substance use disorder&quot; refer to diagnostic models that group both addiction and dependence together under one diagnosis. Seppi333 (Insert 2¢) 03:55, 17 March 2016 (UTC)
 Are you saying that &quot;stimulus&quot; dependence and &quot;psychological&quot; dependence are synonymous? I'm having a really hard time following what you're saying and I don't see what you're talking about in the article or the glossary. There are no hits if I do ctrl F &quot;stimulus dependence&quot; in the article Substance dependence. That phrase isn't in the glossary. There are references to stimuli, but it doesn't help me understand what you're terming &quot;stimulus dependence.&quot; Can you please explain like I'm 5? PermStrump(talk) 05:44, 17 March 2016 (UTC)
I'm suggesting that we use an article titled &quot;stimulus dependence&quot; to cover &quot;dependence&quot;, i.e., an article that covers both physical and psychological dependence.  The ideal title would just be &quot;dependence&quot;, but there's no consensus to move the disambiguation page to cover the concept there. The only reason I suggested the term &quot;stimulus dependence&quot; is that dependence is a disambiguation page and withdrawal syndromes aren't unique to drugs. It's not the only suitable title in which to cover the topic; e.g., dependence (medicine) would be another candidate IMO.  
To make it easier on you, just let me know when you merge the substance dependence article into the SUD article and I'll create the page that I have in mind using some of the existing content from the substance dependence article (only the first 3 sections are relevant). Some of the redirects to the substance dependence article will need to be adjusted as well, but I can handle that. Seppi333 (Insert 2¢) 06:31, 17 March 2016 (UTC)
 Sorry to bug you again, and actually anyone can feel free to respond, but as far as merging benzo articles goes... Is the first step proposing a merge and letting people discuss it or is it cleaning up the articles? Would it help garner consensus if I made a draft in a separate userspace of what I think a merge should look like or would that be a waste of time until there's consensus?

 Did you mean to move it to Benzodiazepine use disorder, as opposed to misuse? When do we get to nuke articles and start fresh? How bad does it have it be? I'm totally willing to rewrite the worst of them from scratch (one at a time). I keep getting overwhelmed every time I open one to try to clean it up, so then I try another substance thinking I'll work on some easy ones first and save the worst ones for last, but they're really all atrocious. They all have some kind of POV pushing, either a drug company or super pro-drug people who don't want anyone to say anything bad about any drug. I had in mind all day yesterday to go back to the cannabis use disorder article to edit out the part of the lead that said something like, &quot;Research has never conclusively shown that it's possible to have a physical dependence to cannabis.&quot; But when I got there, I couldn't find it anymore. I assumed Doc James took it out b/c I saw he'd made some recent edits. Thank you to whoever it was. :) PermStrump(talk) 00:33, 18 March 2016 (UTC)

Good ledes — for translation!

I would like to present the idea of good-lede articles to you. This is a simpler step towards getting content translated into many different languages. As of the last year we've refocused much of the  work towards translating shorter  articles. This has allowed us to grow the number of articles and the number of languages we reach immensely.

As of now all articles pass by our own Dr. James Heilman prior to translation as a part of quality-control. But the way we've chosen which articles are prepared is not entirely transparent — so I've devised a set of criteria similar to the  which can help even more people to help write for translation.

We're currently focusing which articles to translate on a number of important topics:
*Emergency medicine
*Preventable cancers
*WHO's list of Neglected Diseases
*WHO's list of Essential Medicines

A full list of summaries we've prepared so far can be found  !

There's no magic in the words here.  Lede is only a deliberate misspelling of lead from the heyday of the Linotype machine.  The spelling change was created so that the difference between comments on the opening words and comments on the leading (line spacing created by putting strips of blank Pb-based metal alloys between rows of type) would be more obvious to typesetters.  There isn't any absolute length limitation; it just happens that the lead for a news article is most commonly a single-sentence paragraph.  Other dictionaries, e.g.,  and [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lede Merriam-Webster], do not mention the number of sentences at all.

Psychotherapeutic postural integration#Validation

I started a discussion at  about using [http://www.courtenay-young.co.uk/courtenay/articles/Body_Psychotherapy_Europe.pdf this website] as a source for this statement, &quot;&quot; A few days ago I removed that statement on the grounds that the source wasn't , but it was reverted this morning with this edit summary, &quot;this is a reliable referenced second source validation.&quot; I'm looking for some outside input before reverting it again. This article is one of a number of articles that all seem to cover essentially the same topic. I posted about it on  the other day, but haven't gotten any responses, so I figured I'd mention it here too while I'm at it. PermStrump(talk) 17:23, 20 March 2016 (UTC)
Zero reviews or primary sources on the topic and books that cover it are created from Wikipedia. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 18:05, 20 March 2016 (UTC)
The name sounds like &quot;Stand up straight; you'll feel better&quot;.  I've never heard of this, but Google Scholar finds a few sources written by &quot;C Young&quot; (the apparent owner of the website above).  The link that Permstrump gives is listed in Google Scholar as being from the International Journal of Psychotherapy in 2007.  His website also talks about Body psychotherapy; perhaps that's (basically) the same thing?  Or bodymind?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 22:08, 20 March 2016 (UTC)
 , I do think it's the same thing as Body psychotherapy and Bodymind plus... Postural Integration, Bodymind (in meditation traditions) (not to be confused with other bodymind article), Bodywork (alternative medicine), Sensorimotor psychotherapy, Somatic psychology, Somatics, Embodied cognition, Somatherapy, Somatic Experiencing, Kinetic Awareness, Bioenergetic analysis, Rolfing, Vegetotherapy, and Trager approach. A lot of those are trademarked interventions and most say they're based off of vegetotherapy and/or rolfing. A panelists at a conference I went to the other day wanted clinicians to sign up for Sensorimotor Psychotherapy trainings through her company. (I figured out that the panel consisted of the vendors and was purely promotional, but I guess it paid for lunch.) Anyway, I had planned to spend my time cleaning up substance use disorder articles during the panel, but I googled Sensorimotor Psychotherapy and got sidetracked removing dubious claims of scientific validity from all of these articles. As far as I can tell, they're all essentially about the same topic or are closely-enough related FRINGE that they should share one article. They have such vague wording though, so it's hard to tell what any of them are really about and how similar/different they are to each other. I posted on  the other day to ask what is the best way to propose consolidating this many articles, also to get a sense if other people agree that they're all the same topic, but I still haven't gotten any response. Anyone here have a suggestion? PermStrump(talk) 21:26, 21 March 2016 (UTC)
A source that does some compare-and-contrast for these closely related things would be (as always) helpful here.  Presumably the &quot;original&quot; ones would benefit from their own articles.  Beyond that, an article about Rolfing-related treatments (or something like that, with another for vegetotherapy-related ones) might be a potential target for the merge.  
In terms of the technical side of the process, if your &quot;target&quot; exists (&quot;ThisPage&quot;), then I think you'll want to tag &quot;ThisPage&quot; with , tag all the targets with , and then start the discussion.  If your target page is new, then we should pick a page for the discussion (maybe this one, if nothing else seems appropriate), and adjust accordingly.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 22:14, 22 March 2016 (UTC)

Help expand an article? 

Hi! I recently chose to redirect the article Postpartum confinement, as someone nominated it for deletion saying that it didn't expand on Postpartum_period#East_Asia. It looks like the section Postpartum_period#Cultures covers confinement, but I can see the merit in having a separate article that goes into this in greater detail across the various cultures and discussing this in more general detail on a cultural level. 

Anyone interested in taking a crack at this to see if this is warranted? I know that this is more of an anthropological thing (I'm going to hit them up too) but I figured that it'd be worth mentioning here as well. Tokyogirl79 (｡◕‿◕｡) 05:40, 23 March 2016 (UTC)

New York City market research company presents health survey discussing Wikipedia

The takeaway of the data is that the survey respondents ranked Wikipedia as the least-trusted health information source. Wikipedia ranked #2 for accessibility, with 56% of people saying WebMD was accessible while 55% of respondents said that Wikipedia was. I think 55 and 56 are the same based on my feelings for the precision of New York commercial survey research, and it is fair to say Wikipedia ties for #1. The most interesting part of this to me is that the survey assumes that accessibility and accuracy are complementary aspects of health communication. The traditional criticism of Wikipedia is that its accuracy is poor and its accessibility is irrelevant, whereas the accuracy of traditional publishing is good and its inaccessibility is irrelevant.

Part of the weirdness of these sorts of surveys is that despite the publication announcement, the survey is difficult to access unless one is with a firm that might purchase health media consulting. Here are discussions about the survey but I cannot find the actual survey.

*[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sixth-annual-pulse-of-online-search-survey-finds-consumers-weighing-trust-ease-of-use-when-seeking-health-guidance-300234002.html Sixth Annual &quot;Pulse of Online Search&quot; Survey Finds Consumers Weighing Trust, Ease-of-Use When Seeking Health Guidance]

I am fairly sure these discuss the same survey, despite their website saying this is the 5th annual survey and the press release calling it the 6th. I found out about this through

similar/same[http://hitconsultant.net/2016/03/14/32586/]--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 11:05, 22 March 2016 (UTC)
 I'd really love to know what people's reasons are for thinking the health information is untrustworthy. Don't get me wrong, I agree, but I wonder if most people would say it's because (a) it's factually inaccurate, outdated and/or contrary to expert opinion, (b) it doesn't confirm their biases or (c) they feel too much weight is given to fringe views even when multiple views are presented. I think we all know it's probably a combination of the 3, but I wonder how it would break down in a large survey. PermStrump(talk) 17:48, 22 March 2016 (UTC)
 Like you said, there are multiple reasons why believe Wikipedia is untrustworthy. I think the most relevant reason is that the Wikimedia movement has not provided reasonable evidence to the contrary. &quot;Reasonable evidence&quot; could mean research on the order of a single graduate student's masters thesis on any aspect of Wikipedia quality. A great research project, regularly suggested by Doc James, would be to test 1st year medical students. Half of them get Wikipedia to help, and the other half get another source (perhaps the entire Internet minus Wikipedia). I think a study that had interested entry-level students try to use Wikipedia versus any other source in their field would be a provocative demonstration of Wikipedia's usefulness for answering questions. No such thing has gotten off the ground yet. The existing academic research is almost uniformly dubious, incomplete, or has fundamental misconceptions about Wikipedia that make the results weird. Routine research has not yet been done on Wikipedia, and if that research existed, then I think that would increase the public profile of Wikipedia.
Of the three points you raise, I hear (a) the most and (c) second. The usual comment about (c) is not usually complaints in terms of fringe views, but instead about perceived instability of Wikipedia's content and a tendency for Wikipedia articles to get worse over time. I wish that Wikipedia's public image could more closely match its actual strengths and weaknesses, so that people's judgement of it had more basis in reality.
I wrote more about the study on my blog at &quot;[http://bluerasberry.com/2016/03/content-accuracy-versus-accessibility/ Content accuracy versus accessibility]&quot;.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 19:40, 24 March 2016 (UTC)
(Drive-by comment) I'd say with pretty near certainty that for the overwhelming majority of those who believe Wikipedia's medical information is untrustworthy, it has nothing to do with the medical content per se, but with the fact that for the last decade we've been trying to hammer home &quot;You should not trust Wikipedia&quot; (or  if you want chapter and verse). That there are still people who do trust Wikipedia uncritically is what gives cause for concern, since even in the best-maintained areas like medicine and military history, dubious woo pops up with wearying regularity, especially when you get away from the high-profile hotspots with multiple watchers like cancer and homeopathy; just head on over to  and pick an article at random. ‑ Iridescent 19:57, 24 March 2016 (UTC)

Artificial ventilation article missing

Was working on an article about Dr, Edward George Fell, an early developer of methods of artificial ventilation[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18052905] and noticed a problem with linking that term in Wikipedia: 
*By definition Artificial ventilation (synonymous with artificial respiration) is &quot;any means of producing gas exchange mechanically or manually between the lungs and the surrounding air, which is not performed entirely by the person's own respiratory system&quot;[http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php/?t=98071] ([http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/artificial+ventilation more defs]), making mechanical ventilation[http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/mechanical%20ventilation] and rescue breathing sub-types of artificial ventilation. 
*In Wikipedia Artificial ventilation redirects to an article mainly about rescue breathing incorrectly titled artificial respiration (rescue breathing is just one type of artificial ventilation/respiration). 

Artificial ventilation should be an over-all term/topic article and the article on rescue breathing should have a more correct name than artificial respiration. Fountains of Bryn Mawr (talk) 20:39, 26 March 2016 (UTC)

Asking readers directly for input on articles

One metric NIOSH uses to measure impact is the number of page views, including page views to Wikipedia articles. This tells us about the volume of traffic, but nothing about who is reading it, or where they are from, or what motivated them to look up the article (curiosity, affected worker, employer trying to improve workplace safety, etc). While we are good at getting feedback from editors, we don't have mechanisms that are as reliable for getting feedback from readers, and I would like to report more &quot;impact&quot; information to NIOSH. Has there been any thought in embedding optional reader surveys in very select groups of articles? I understand there was the article feedback tool many years ago, but it applied to too many articles (instead of a very select subset) and collected open-ended feedback rather than more useful, structured information. I ask this project because I imagine you all would have had a similar idea. If something like I am proposing has been tried I would like to hear more about it. If it hasn't, but you think it is a good idea, let me know and I can begin thinking about implementation. James Hare (NIOSH) (talk) 05:08, 17 March 2016 (UTC)

YELLOW FEVER WARNING from ProMED mail

I've added it to the page on the Angola outbreak but it might warrant more prominent attention. juanTamad (talk) 02:30, 29 March 2016 (UTC)

 From ProMED: &quot;My concern is that with so many pressing demands on public health agencies in the dengue-endemic counties -- malaria in many, Chagas disease in some, schistosomiasis in others, hepatitis and other enteroviral diseases in most, to mention a few -- long-range planning and pre-outbreak preparation gets short shrift until an outbreak such as yellow fever hits. Vaccination of 70-80 percent of the population at potential risk is one obvious approach, but adequate supplies of the vaccine are necessary, and trained vaccination teams must be available for its administration. With vaccination, vector control and avoidance, the eternal question is: Who will pay for what is needed in the absence of a crisis? Prevention is cheaper than crisis response, as Angola health authorities are in the process of finding out. Gambling that yellow fever will never hit costs nothing -- until it does. - Mod.TY]&quot; juanTamad (talk) 04:10, 29 March 2016 (UTC)

On the use of Frontiers journals as sources

 appears to be on a mission to remove from all articles citations of articles from &quot;predatory open access publishers&quot;.  That might or might not be a good thing, but in the process he is removing citations to articles in Frontiers journals; see Frontiers Media.  In my view that is wrong -- I have read dozens of high-quality review articles in Frontiers journals.  The question I would like to open for discussion is (a) is it possible for Frontiers citations to meet ; (b) is is possible for citations of review papers in Frontiers journals to meet ? Looie496 (talk) 16:03, 17 March 2016 (UTC)
 As Frontiers Media states, they're listed in the Jeffrey Beall [https://scholarlyoa.com/publishers/ list of predatory journals] but there seems to be a significant group who disagree with the designation [http://www.nature.com/news/backlash-after-frontiers-journals-added-to-list-of-questionable-publishers-1.18639] and others who agree [http://deevybee.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/my-collapse-of-confidence-in-frontiers.html].
It seems to me that the proper course of action is to be cautious about claims from Frontier journals (but then, it makes sense to be cautious about any claim made anywhere). As far as  is concerned, AFAIU it, the emphasis is on reviews - and I don't know whether Frontier journals publish that kind of paper.  If they did, I think I'd be very cautious about using it in isolation, given the various complaints about it. JMWt (talk) 17:03, 17 March 2016 (UTC)
The publisher isn't the only thing that matters.  Albert Einstein's publications on physics would be acceptable no matter who published them. 
 is replacing these citations with , which is probably better than leaving the material completely uncited.  Adding  after the citation (and leaving the citation present) is another approach that might work better for some purposes, especially if the source might be generally acceptable.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 17:39, 17 March 2016 (UTC)
 Could you provide an example of a citation which was removed but which you think might be worth keeping?  Blue Rasberry (talk) 18:36, 17 March 2016 (UTC)
Sure: [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Synapse&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=710464813 diff]. Looie496 (talk) 18:58, 17 March 2016 (UTC)
 I like  idea of leaving Frontiers citations in place with the  tag. Some of the stuff on Beall's list is just irrefutable trash, but this one sounds like it could be an exception, at least on a case by case basis (I haven't looked into it). But as long as Frontiers isn't being used to support a contentious statement or an idea that's expressed equally as well in a stronger source, I could see rare, hypothetical scenarios where removing those references could be detrimental to some articles (e.g. if the Frontiers piece pulled together several widely accepted concepts that otherwise couldn't be expressed without OR).

This is more or less the only review on the topic.[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4241821/] What to do than? Doc James (talk ·  · ) 01:09, 18 March 2016 (UTC)
Unless you have a specific concern about that particular review article, then I'd recommend keeping it.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 02:33, 18 March 2016 (UTC)
It is not used as far as I am aware. I have suggested using it instead of primary sources though. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 02:47, 18 March 2016 (UTC)
 OK, well that's at least a review which might suggest a more considered overview of the topic than a primary source. I think I'd be inclined to cite [http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4939-1056-4_2 a book chapter, where it exists] rather than the article  suggests above. I don't really know what to do about this instance; it seems to be a review, but I don't know how much confidence one can or should have in a publication which has been flagged as having issues. I think one has to ask questions about why academics would choose to publish in this kind of journal. JMWt (talk) 08:10, 18 March 2016 (UTC)
 In general I suppose one would look to see how exceptional the claim being made is. If it is truly exceptional - say a claim of treatment efficacy that is not backed-up by any other reasonable secondary sources - then alarm bells should ring. Alexbrn (talk) 10:52, 18 March 2016 (UTC)
That's something to consider for any source.  It depends upon context (one does not really expect multiple studies on the treatment efficacy for a rare disease or co-morbidities of uncommon ones), but information present in only one source is not necessarily  even if it's in a highly respected publication.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:16, 18 March 2016 (UTC)
What WAID said. &quot;It depends on the context&quot; is the only right answer to this question and anyone running around blanket-removing or even blanket-tagging should stop. This is the kind of conversation that makes me think there was a wrong turn taken in trying to provide general guidance that centers on the perceived quality of the source rather than the type of information the source is being used for. Opabinia regalis (talk) 19:29, 18 March 2016 (UTC)
* I generally avoid Frontiers journals.  They often put out guest-edited issues, and those issues are often full of woo for pet theories and misrepresent what is actually seen by the field as &quot;accepted knowledge&quot;.  These  issues often have crazy big woo (they fail ).   So if a Frontiers review is the only source on something, I look to see if it is from a guest-edited issue and read it carefully first to try to decide how even-handed it appears to be.  if it appears to be woo-full I just don't bring it to Wikipedia at all.  Even if it seems OK I use it gingerly.  But generally I don't even click to read the abstract for reviews from Frontiers when looking for sources on pubmed, and just skip right over them. Jytdog (talk) 16:05, 18 March 2016 (UTC) (missed some nuance; added it Jytdog (talk) 20:17, 18 March 2016 (UTC))
The Committee on Publication Ethics have no problems with Frontiers and Beall's list has been plenty criticised. Plenty of Frontiers journals are well-respected, AFAIK. COI declaration: I'm currently co-editing a Frontiers special issue. Bondegezou (talk) 17:47, 18 March 2016 (UTC)
 :) i hope you bring in people with a real diversity of opinion on the topic!  Jytdog (talk) 19:24, 18 March 2016 (UTC)
Seeing this thread was began about my actions, here's my penny's worth. The above COI working there said &quot;Plenty of Frontiers journals are well-respected&quot; which suggests that other Frontier journals are not well-respected prob due to lack of peer review. The internet is becoming a cesspool of crank science misinformation, is Wikipedia beginning to reflect this? Yes maybe it is if it uses non-peer reviewed articles as source in supporting scientific theory. So which Frontier journals does proper-science use, and how can we tell which ones are crank and non-crank? I guess if the paper is published elsewhere where peer-review can be guaranteed then it's OK. But scientific theory needs to toughen-up and avoid any link to crank otherwise Wikipedia continues to merge with that misinformation superhighway cesspool, and W.P. becomes untrusted (if it's not already viewed that way). (BTW I'm currently involved where non-scientists are pushing crank begun in that well respected science journal Rolling Stone magazine.) Others good editors, much more familiar with the science topic being discussed above will know where to find more solid respected cites to support text. I can't necessarily help with that. Thanks.

Basic symptoms of schizophrenia

This http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/1/5.long discusses the basic symptom concept, which has been applied in Europe partly to assess people at high risk for schizophrenia (and it may be used in the States as well). But there isn't an article on it and any information on it is hard to find outside of the self-disorder article. Considering that self-disorders are a type of basic symptom, it would seem to make sense to create an organization of articles revolving around the basic symptom concept. Any feedback? --Beneficii (talk) 08:53, 30 March 2016 (UTC)

Fish oil drugs

I completely worked over Omega-3 acid ethyl esters, Ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid, and Omega-3 carboxylic acids tonight, and made them into drug articles.  It is not totally clear to me if they should remain separate or be combined into one.  They are different molecules but so similar... down to having the exact same label indications (except for the first one which got broader coverage in the EU.  The second is the one from which arose the 2012 court case about off-label marketing of drugs and I added a section on that.

Also we are still kind of stuck as what to do what health content in fish oil and omega-3 fatty acid - there is discussion at .  Would appreciate review of the 3 drug articles if anyone is interested.  They were each very, very bad and clearly edited by company people. Jytdog (talk) 06:25, 1 April 2016 (UTC)
