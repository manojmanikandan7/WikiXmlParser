 Reliable sources for drug pricing? 

are [http://i.walmart.com/i/if/hmp/fusion/genericdruglist.pdf Walmart's pricelist] and [http://www.target.com/pharmacy/generics-alphabetic Target's pricelist] reliable sources for drug pricing?

The two best sources available for the cost of prescription and over-the-counter drugs (that I am aware of) are [http://micromedex.com/products/product-suites/clinical-knowledge/redbook Red Book Online] and the [http://erc.msh.org/mainpage.cfm?file=1.0.htm&amp;module=DMP&amp;language=english International Drug Price Indicator Guide]. I have done some work with Red Book in the past, and even for drugs that are widely available as cheap generics, you will see that prices vary a lot (just search ibuprofen to get an example). And the average wholesale price listed can sometimes be substantially higher than the $10 for a 90-day supply that you can get at discount mail-order pharmacies. ser:NuclearWarfare|NW (ser talk:NuclearWarfare|Talk) 02:51, 7 March 2016 (UTC)

See also ikipedia talk:WikiProject Medicine/Archive 67#Prices for information about finding the average US costs.  In the specific instance, I think the right answer is &quot;see how much the price has changed since this article was last updated&quot;.

If ser:Jytdog|you want US prices specifically, then [https://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid-CHIP-Program-Information/By-Topics/Benefits/Prescription-Drugs/Pharmacy-Pricing.html Medicare says] that they're running around 10 or 11 cents per pill this week.

just fyi, per [https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid-chip-program-information/by-topics/benefits/prescription-drugs/ful-nadac-downloads/nadacmethodology.pdf this], the NADAC is the average cost for pharmacies in the US to acquire the drug.

Trascon Pharmacopoeia gives the rough price for a course of treatment. US is generally more than many other places in the world. While some expensive meds are only available in the USA at least initially. 
Would prefer to stick with more general rather than retail specific sources especially with more generic sources being available. ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk · pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 02:36, 8 March 2016 (UTC)

Yes I am happy with the NADAC price and calling it wholesale. By the way the drug.com site[http://www.drugs.com/price-guide/acyclovir] if you click on 400mg you see that it is 0.41 USD per dose (when buying 50 doses a typical course of treatment). Which makes a course of treatment 21USD or in the range of what Tarascon states. This is about the same as 0.50 USD per dose as we stated in our article. ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk · pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 02:43, 8 March 2016 (UTC)
d this makes sense to me.  i feel like i am being a dick about this, but it kills me to have someone be able to so easily show our content to be unreliable based on their actual experience of buying drugs (like the dif in my OP), and tons of people get prescriptions filled at places like target and walmart. ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 02:47, 8 March 2016 (UTC)
Here [http://www.target.com/pharmacy/generics-alphabetic] it appears to be saying that 90 tabs is 10 USD. But these are the 200s and you need to take two for a single dose. So 10 for 45 doses which is 0.22 USD per dose or 11 USD for a 10 day, 5 doses per day course of treatment. IMO saying less than 25 USD per course of treatment is better but either way. ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk · pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 02:58, 8 March 2016 (UTC)
thanks that math is helpful!  part of what is complicated in the cost for treatment is that we get into dosing to calculate that, and per MEDMOS we don't go there. i don't know the origin of that prohibition as I wasn't around and haven't done my homework, but i understand we keep a firm line on that. ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 03:20, 8 March 2016 (UTC)

 Self-disorders, ipseity disturbance, disturbance of minimal self, etc., in schizophrenia 

On PubMed, I have been seeing lots of articles lately relating to a rediscovered phenomenon in schizophrenia spectrum disorders that has been variously referred to as self-disorders, ipseity disturbance, and disturbance of basic or minimal self. A manual for a semi-structured interview that assesses self-disorders was published in the journal sychopathology (journal)|Psychopathology in 2005 called the Examination of Anomalous Self-Experience (EASE).There are some review articles and books I have seen that reference this phenomenon, but they are hard to access. The research I've seen has found that the EASE can distinguish patients with schizophrenia and schizotypal personality disorder from patients with psychotic bipolar disorder, non-schizophrenic psychotic disorders, or borderline personality disorder.

Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any article or even section on Wikipedia that addresses this issue. The lack of reference to this phenomenon in Wikipedia is I think evident in the article enter for Subjectivity Research, about an interdisciplinary research center located at the niversity of Copenhagen. If you look at the lead, every one of the phenomena you see that they study has a wiki-link, except for self-disorders, which is kinda strange. The only reference to self-disorders, and it is a rather oblique reference, is in auses_of_schizophrenia#Other_views_of_what_is_called_mental_illness|this article about the causes of schizophrenia. It is only one sentence long and doesn't really impress upon the reader what it is.

Now, I believe there are going to be issues of P:NOTABILITY as well as organizing an article or section on the phenomenon. I would like assistance on organizing an article or section as well as assembling references for it to achieve P:NPOV. --ser:Beneficii|Beneficii (ser talk:Beneficii|talk) 19:31, 6 March 2016 (UTC)

Request review of HIV posters in Commons

Wellcome L0052822.jpg|thumb|right|example poster which is not copyrightable due to containing only simple text and shapes
Currently there is a deletion review in Wikimedia Commons of 2600 educational posters from the 1980s-90s giving HIV/AIDS information. I am posting to request that anyone please go into Commons, browse through the posters, and if you see one that does not contain copyrighted art, then please make a post that it should not be deleted. The issue is lack of copyright. However, if a poster contains only text and geometric shapes, then it is considered to be in the public domain.

Also, the organization which provided these images would recognize feedback and I would appreciate any positive comments about their attempt at 
*ommons:Commons talk:Deletion requests/Files in Category:AIDS Poster from Wellcome Images (check needed)

Previously I had shared this poster project as follows -
*ikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine/Archive_54#Amazing_multilingual_AIDS_advertisements
*ikipedia talk:WikiProject Medicine/Wellcome Library Editathon 2014

Here is a recap -
ellcome Trust is one of the largest medical nonprofit foundations in the world. They have a large archive including public health materials, and they have shared more than a million health media files in Wikimedia Commons at ommons:Category:Wellcome Collection. Among the files they have provided, they shared these 2600 historical HIV/AIDS educational posters. This was an unprecedented donation because the art came from 2000+ organizations and artists, and I think Wikimedia projects have never before had an organization claim to have managed so many relationships including copyright claims. In the end, Wellcome presumed too much. On reflection they have announced that in fact, they did not control the copyright to these HIV posters, and that they spoke incorrectly when they said that they did. Right now they are saying that their copyright agreement with the organizations is that the original copyright holders are demanding CC-By-NC-ND. At this point, my perspective is that everyone involved is confused about copyright. The big lesson that I take away from this is that the most respected librarians and archivists at the best funded archives in the world have a different understanding of copyright than an average Wikipedia contributor. It surprises me a little that many organizations are not conscious of the copyright of the content they hold. I encourage Wikipedians who try to negotiate with institutions to have clear discussions with staff about the meaning of copyright and what it means to share content on Wikipedia. I really appreciate the Wellcome Trust taking initiative to try to share good content with Wikimedia projects. They were the first to attempt an innovative sharing model. In the end, they realized that they tried to donate something that was not theirs to share. Because the HIV posters were never theirs, all of the posters that are not in the public domain will need to be deleted from Commons in the next week or so. The posters will remain on the Wellcome Trust website as CC-By-NC-ND.

The Wellcome Library participants in this are the best. I appreciate their enthusiasm, support, and willingness to try new things.

I'm dubious about the claim that a work that contains &quot;only text and geometric shapes&quot; is not eligible for copyright.

The US Copyright Office interprets that logo (which was submitted sans company name) as merely an irregular blue pentagon and the letter &quot;W&quot;.  The artist who drew a &quot;W&quot; to look like a crown (from the old logo) probably disagrees with their decision, and I would not be surprised if the W/crown had been submitted by itself, and labeled as artwork, that it would have been accepted.  
What we don't see in that ruling is any assertion that all works containing only text and geometric shapes, regardless of arrangement, color, amount of text, originality, etc., are ineligible for copyright – and we never will, because such a rule would make it impossible to hold a copyright on a poem.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 22:25, 28 February 2016 (UTC)

otage is currently a soft redirect to Wiktionary, which seems odd for a normal term describing a medical condition.

 Writing Articles Like How-to Guides 

That might be a misleading title. I don't want to do that, but I was reading the article on &quot;bdominal examination&quot; as I was adding a source, and it reads almost like a how-to on performing an abdominal exam.

Is that encyclopedic, does that have value, is that the goal of this project?

Go right in and try to improve it.  
That kind of article can be pretty hard to write well, so a lot of people end up straying into &quot;how to&quot; territory.  For example, they'll write &quot;First, press here&quot; instead of &quot;A typical exam starts by pressing here&quot;.  And most people don't actually know enough to write interesting encyclopedic things, such as &quot;In Europe and the Americas, they usually start by pressing here, but in Asia, they usually start in this other spot&quot;.

 Everything is going to break 

Just a note for those who don't follow the tech stuff:  Ops will be upgrading the servers in about two weeks (tentatively, Tuesday, 22 March).  One result is that you will not be able to edit pages for 15 to 30 minutes.  You will still be able to read, but not save pages.  This will affect all the wikis and some non-wiki services, such as Tool Labs.  I have two requests:

* If you happen to be online then and see an error message that &quot;This wiki is in read-only mode&quot;, then just try again in half an hour.  Ops believes that you'll be able to save your changes then (but do please copy them to a doc or something just in case).
* If you are active at other wikis, then please share the news with your friends.  The more editors who know about this, the less worried people will be.

 What's going on with SUDs? 

Right now there are at least 4 separate articles on essentially the same topic: ubstance abuse, ubstance dependence, ubstance-related disorder and ubstance use disorder. All of them have old banners that link to closed merge proposals, but I can't tell what went down and why none of the merges ever happened. The discussions are hard to follow, because they don't really correspond with the proposed merges either. For example, in June 2015, there was a alk:Substance dependence#Merger proposal|merge proposed between the articles called Substance-related disorder and Substance dependence , but the conversation is all over the place. It starts off strong. Then derails into someone suggesting a merger of 6 articles (the 4 I mentioned above plus ubstance intoxication and ubstance abuse prevention) to someone suggesting a merge with the article on general ependence, which triggered vehement opposition. Somehow the conclusion (of the proposed merge between Substance-related disorder and Substance dependence) was to merge Substance-related disorder with Substance abuse prevention and Substance intoxication, and to leave Substance dependence as a stand-alone article. IMHO that was a less than ideal outcome, but none of those merges ever happened anyway. And then at some point, the lead to Substance-related disorder was made to be identical to the lead of Substance abuse (including the bolded words), even though the original proposal was for it to be merged with Substance dependence. 

There was also a proposed merge between Substance abuse and Substance use disorder and the conversation goes like this: 
 IP editor1: &quot;q|It would be foolish to group these together, as substance abuse is usually, though not limited to, factors other than mental illness. This is a subtopic for substance abuse purely relate to mental illness, so the grouping would be, in my view, abhorrent and completely incorrect.&quot; Wuh??
 Doc James: Concise and logical argument for merging in less than 3 sentences
 IP editor2: &quot;:q|I strongly disagree too against merge with Substance abuse article... anyhow is a broad situation, so there are more relate; while for example a simple one time substance abuse (although important, and endangering health and even life, so even so encyclopaedic topic) may be not a broad situation as a substance use disorder. More simply; how you can surely say that every substance abuse is a substance use disorder as set and delimited in DSM?&quot; The end. No more comments. No merge.
What the heck? Should I bother trying again? ser:Permstrump|PermStrumpser:Permstrump|(talk) 07:12, 16 March 2016 (UTC)

 I'm willing to work on it (with help ideally), but I don't know the best way to go about it. If it were up to me, these would the articles:
* ubstance-related disorder - an umbrella article with a brief explanation of the following types of disorders with links to the main articles:
* ubstance use disorder (merger of Substance abuse and Substance dependence with the current Substance use disorder article)
* lcohol use disorder (is already merged with lcohol dependence, but IMHO the title should be switched to Alcohol use disorder instead of dependence. Also, lcohol abuse should be redirected there instead of to Substance abuse.)
* annabis abuse+annabis dependence&gt;annabis use disorder (same as alcohol)
* enzodiazepine abuse+enzodiazepine dependence&gt;enzodiazepine use disorder, mphetamine Abuse+mphetamine dependence&gt;mphetamine use disorder etc., etc. (same as alcohol and cannabis)
* pioid addiction and dependence at least already gets redirects from pioid abuse, pioid dependence, piate dependency and pioid use disorder. Not sure how I feel about the official title though vs &quot;use disorder.&quot; It would be cool to keep it all consistent. 
* ubstance intoxication and could probably be fully covered in a section of Substance-related disorder and probably doesn't need its own article
* ubstance abuse prevention - not sure, maybe should stay separate or merge with rug treatment
* rug treatment should be renamed ubstance abuse treatment since it also includes alcohol.
I know that's wishful thinking, but just throwing it out there. BTW I'm running late for a conference on substance use disorders... shoot. (Seriously) ser:Permstrump|PermStrumpser:Permstrump|(talk) 12:23, 16 March 2016 (UTC)

Yes, these articles need significant clean-up. Is the proposed terminology standard? ser:Sizeofint|Sizeofint (ser talk:Sizeofint|talk) 18:19, 16 March 2016 (UTC)
 |Sizeofint, yes, that's the official terminology in the DSM-5. Technically, if you were making a formal diagnosis, you'd rate the severity -- mild/moderate/severe (e.g. alcohol use disorder, moderate) based on the # of symptoms and/or qualify it with: intoxication, withdrawal, [X]-induced disorder (e.g. alcohol-induced anxiety disorder). But &quot;substance use disorder&quot;/&quot;[X] use disorder&quot; is the standard catchall term at least in the US. I'm pretty sure that's how it's worded in research articles I've read that were published in Europe, but maybe someone else can weigh in on that. It looks like the ICD-10 still lists &quot;abuse&quot; and &quot;dependence,&quot; and WHO refers to &quot;psychoactive substance use disorders,&quot; which consists of abuse, dependence, intoxication, withdrawal, etc. I'm almost positive though that in the majority of the world, practitioners and researchers refer to it as &quot;[X] use disorder&quot; now, even if the publications haven't caught up yet. We'd been using that terminology for a while before the DSM 5th edition came out in 2013. I think that's usually how it happens (like, we completely stopped saying &quot;mentally retarded&quot; out loud a long time before they finally took it out the DSM in 2013). I'm less sure about how common it is to say &quot;psychoactive substance use disorder&quot; vs &quot;substance use disorder&quot; outside of the US though. If &quot;psychoactive...&quot; is more common internationally, I'm cool with that. Colloquially, I think  people have different connotations for different words even within the same country, and half the time they're talking nonsense (like when people argue there's a difference between addiction and dependency... addiction was never a clinical word, so I have no idea what they think the difference is). My point is... it makes the most sense to go with the medical terminology IMHO. (Sorry if that was more than you ever wanted to know.) 

 |Doc James, where do you think makes sense to start? Like, should I start by posting new  proposals to merge/redirect/rename articles or does it makes sense to start by cleaning up the articles that seem like they'd be keepers and defer worrying about getting consensus to merge after that? Also, is there ever a way when articles are so messy and redundant like this that there can be an executive decision made about which ones to keep/merge without getting consensus? :) ser:Permstrump|PermStrumpser:Permstrump|(talk) 02:37, 17 March 2016 (UTC)

 Substance dependence needs to be split apart to separate the diagnostic concept (which would be merged) from the neuropsychological concept (which would need to be moved to a new name, e.g., something like &quot;drug dependence&quot; or &quot;stimulus dependence&quot;) if you intend to go ahead with a merge of that article and substance abuse into SUD.  The current dependence article currently covers both concepts, but doesn't really do a good job differentiating between the two in the text. Other than that, I don't really see any issues with this proposal. ser:Seppi333|Seppi333 (ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert 2¢) 03:08, 17 March 2016 (UTC)

My only guess is that it might be what the DSM refers to as, &quot;non-substance related disorders.&quot; Gambling is the only one recognized in the DSM, which I'm sure that has and deserves its own article. Is that the kind of thing you're talking about though, like video games, gambling, shopping, etc? ser:Permstrump|PermStrumpser:Permstrump|(talk) 03:35, 17 March 2016 (UTC)
d When I say &quot;stimulus dependence&quot;, I'm not referring to a diagnostic model.  &quot;Dependence&quot; is not a diagnostic label, but &quot;substance dependence&quot; is. The neuropsychological concept of dependence is defined in the glossary in ubstance dependence, whereas the diagnostic concept of a &quot;substance dependence&quot; (as of the DSM-IV) is defined at the end of the lead in that article.  If it helps to clarify the difference, both ddiction and dependence (i.e., sychological dependence and hysical dependence) refer to actual diseases; &quot;substance dependence&quot; and &quot;substance use disorder&quot; refer to diagnostic models that group both addiction and dependence together under one diagnosis. ser:Seppi333|Seppi333 (ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert 2¢) 03:55, 17 March 2016 (UTC)
 Are you saying that &quot;stimulus&quot; dependence and &quot;psychological&quot; dependence are synonymous? I'm having a really hard time following what you're saying and I don't see what you're talking about in the article or the glossary. There are no hits if I do ctrl F &quot;stimulus dependence&quot; in the article ubstance dependence. That phrase isn't in the glossary. There are references to stimuli, but it doesn't help me understand what you're terming &quot;stimulus dependence.&quot; Can you please explain like I'm 5? ser:Permstrump|PermStrumpser:Permstrump|(talk) 05:44, 17 March 2016 (UTC)
I'm suggesting that we use an article titled &quot;timulus dependence&quot; to cover &quot;dependence&quot;, i.e., an article that covers both physical and psychological dependence.  The ideal title would just be &quot;dependence&quot;, but there's no consensus to move the disambiguation page to cover the concept there. The only reason I suggested the term &quot;stimulus dependence&quot; is that ependence is a disambiguation page and withdrawal syndromes aren't unique to drugs. It's not the only suitable title in which to cover the topic; e.g., ependence (medicine) would be another candidate IMO.  
To make it easier on you, just let me know when you merge the substance dependence article into the SUD article and I'll create the page that I have in mind using some of the existing content from the substance dependence article (only the first 3 sections are relevant). Some of the redirects to the substance dependence article will need to be adjusted as well, but I can handle that. ser:Seppi333|Seppi333 (ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert 2¢) 06:31, 17 March 2016 (UTC)

I'm totally willing to rewrite the worst of them from scratch (one at a time). I keep getting overwhelmed every time I open one to try to clean it up, so then I try another substance thinking I'll work on some easy ones first and save the worst ones for last, but they're really all atrocious.

Good ledes — for translation!
mage:Medical_translation.svg|frameless|250px|right
I would like to present the idea of good-lede articles to you. This is a simpler step towards getting content translated into many different languages. As of the last year we've refocused much of the ikipedia:WikiProject_Medicine/Translation_task_force|Translation Task Force work towards translating shorter ikipedia:WikiProject_Medicine/Translation_task_force/RTT(Simplified)|summary articles. This has allowed us to grow the number of articles and the number of languages we reach immensely.

As of now all articles pass by our own ser:Doc James|Dr. James Heilman prior to translation as a part of quality-control. But the way we've chosen which articles are prepared is not entirely transparent — so I've devised a set of criteria similar to the ikipedia:Good article criteria|Good Article Criteria which can help even more people to help write for translation.

We're currently focusing which articles to translate on a number of important topics:
*Emergency medicine
*Preventable cancers
*HO's list of Neglected Diseases
*HO's list of Essential Medicines

A full list of summaries we've prepared so far can be found  ikipedia:WikiProject_Medicine/Translation_task_force/RTT(Simplified)|here!

Check out the guide at: ikipedia:Good lede (keep in mind, it's still only a draft)

There's no magic in the words here.  Lede is only a deliberate misspelling of lead from the heyday of the inotype machine.  The spelling change was created so that the difference between comments on the opening words and comments on the eading (line spacing created by putting strips of blank ead|Pb-based metal alloys between rows of type) would be more obvious to typesetters.  There isn't any absolute length limitation; it just happens that the lead for a news article is most commonly a single-sentence paragraph.  Other dictionaries, e.g., ikt:lede#Etymology 2 and [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/lede Merriam-Webster], do not mention the number of sentences at all.

There is no sense wasting time on portals, particularly one that only draws 5 page views per day.  The basic problem is that the Wikipedia system doesn't give any effective way of attracting the reader's attention to portals, so nobody is interested in maintaining them.  Even ortal:Medicine, which draws about 190 page views per day, has not been edited since August 2015.

This article is one of a number of articles that all seem to cover essentially the same topic.

The name sounds like &quot;Stand up straight; you'll feel better&quot;.  I've never heard of this, but Google Scholar finds a few sources written by &quot;C Young&quot; (the apparent owner of the website above).  The link that Permstrump gives is listed in Google Scholar as being from the International Journal of Psychotherapy in 2007.  His website also talks about ody psychotherapy; perhaps that's (basically) the same thing?  Or odymind?  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 22:08, 20 March 2016 (UTC)
 |WhatamIdoing, I do think it's the same thing as ody psychotherapy and odymind plus... ostural Integration, odymind (in meditation traditions) (not to be confused with other odymind article), odywork (alternative medicine), ensorimotor psychotherapy, omatic psychology, omatics, mbodied cognition, omatherapy, omatic Experiencing, inetic Awareness, ioenergetic analysis, olfing, egetotherapy, and rager approach. A lot of those are trademarked interventions and most say they're based off of vegetotherapy and/or rolfing. A panelists at a conference I went to the other day wanted clinicians to sign up for Sensorimotor Psychotherapy trainings through her company. (I figured out that the panel consisted of the vendors and was purely promotional, but I guess it paid for lunch.) Anyway, I had planned to spend my time cleaning up substance use disorder articles during the panel, but I googled Sensorimotor Psychotherapy and got sidetracked removing dubious claims of scientific validity from all of these articles. As far as I can tell, they're all essentially about the same topic or are closely-enough related FRINGE that they should share one article. They have such vague wording though, so it's hard to tell what any of them are really about and how similar/different they are to each other. I posted on P:Fringe theories/Noticeboard#Mind-body/Bodymind the other day to ask what is the best way to propose consolidating this many articles, also to get a sense if other people agree that they're all the same topic, but I still haven't gotten any response. Anyone here have a suggestion? ser:Permstrump|PermStrumpser:Permstrump|(talk) 21:26, 21 March 2016 (UTC)
A source that does some compare-and-contrast for these closely related things would be (as always) helpful here.  Presumably the &quot;original&quot; ones would benefit from their own articles.  Beyond that, an article about olfing-related treatments (or something like that, with another for vegetotherapy-related ones) might be a potential target for the merge.  
In terms of the technical side of the process, if your &quot;target&quot; exists (&quot;ThisPage&quot;), then I think you'll want to tag &quot;ThisPage&quot; with erge |OtherPage1 |OtherPage2 |OtherPage3 |discuss=Talk:ThisPage#Merge discussion |date=March 2016, tag all the targets with erge to|ThisPage |discuss=Talk:ThisPage#Merge discussion |date=March 2016, and then start the discussion.

 New York City market research company presents health survey discussing Wikipedia 

The takeaway of the data is that the survey respondents ranked Wikipedia as the least-trusted health information source. Wikipedia ranked #2 for accessibility, with 56% of people saying WebMD was accessible while 55% of respondents said that Wikipedia was. I think 55 and 56 are the same based on my feelings for the precision of New York commercial survey research, and it is fair to say Wikipedia ties for #1. The most interesting part of this to me is that the survey assumes that accessibility and accuracy are complementary aspects of health communication. The traditional criticism of Wikipedia is that its accuracy is poor and its accessibility is irrelevant, whereas the accuracy of traditional publishing is good and its inaccessibility is irrelevant.

Part of the weirdness of these sorts of surveys is that despite the publication announcement, the survey is difficult to access unless one is with a firm that might purchase health media consulting. Here are discussions about the survey but I cannot find the actual survey.

 I'd really love to know what people's reasons are for thinking the health information is untrustworthy. Don't get me wrong, I agree, but I wonder if most people would say it's because (a) it's factually inaccurate, outdated and/or contrary to expert opinion, (b) it doesn't confirm their biases or (c) they feel too much weight is given to fringe views even when multiple views are presented. I think we all know it's probably a combination of the 3, but I wonder how it would break down in a large survey. ser:Permstrump|PermStrumpser:Permstrump|(talk) 17:48, 22 March 2016 (UTC)
|Permstrump Like you said, there are multiple reasons why believe Wikipedia is untrustworthy. I think the most relevant reason is that the Wikimedia movement has not provided reasonable evidence to the contrary. &quot;Reasonable evidence&quot; could mean research on the order of a single graduate student's masters thesis on any aspect of Wikipedia quality. A great research project, regularly suggested by Doc James, would be to test 1st year medical students. Half of them get Wikipedia to help, and the other half get another source (perhaps the entire Internet minus Wikipedia). I think a study that had interested entry-level students try to use Wikipedia versus any other source in their field would be a provocative demonstration of Wikipedia's usefulness for answering questions. No such thing has gotten off the ground yet. The existing academic research is almost uniformly dubious, incomplete, or has fundamental misconceptions about Wikipedia that make the results weird. Routine research has not yet been done on Wikipedia, and if that research existed, then I think that would increase the public profile of Wikipedia.
Of the three points you raise, I hear (a) the most and (c) second. The usual comment about (c) is not usually complaints in terms of fringe views, but instead about perceived instability of Wikipedia's content and a tendency for Wikipedia articles to get worse over time. I wish that Wikipedia's public image could more closely match its actual strengths and weaknesses, so that people's judgement of it had more basis in reality.
I wrote more about the study on my blog at &quot;[http://bluerasberry.com/2016/03/content-accuracy-versus-accessibility/ Content accuracy versus accessibility]&quot;. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 19:40, 24 March 2016 (UTC)
(Drive-by comment) I'd say with pretty near certainty that for the overwhelming majority of those who believe Wikipedia's medical information is untrustworthy, it has nothing to do with the medical content per se, but with the fact that for the last decade we've been trying to hammer home &quot;You should not trust Wikipedia&quot; (or q|Please be advised that nothing found here has necessarily been reviewed by people with the expertise required to provide you with complete, accurate or reliable information.

However, Wikipedia cannot guarantee the validity of the information found here. if you want chapter and verse). That there are still people who do trust Wikipedia uncritically is what gives cause for concern, since even in the best-maintained areas like medicine and military history, dubious woo pops up with wearying regularity, especially when you get away from the high-profile hotspots with multiple watchers like ancer and omeopathy; just head on over to Category:Medicinal plants and pick an article at random. ‑ ser:Iridescent|Iridescent 19:57, 24 March 2016 (UTC)

 Artificial ventilation article missing 

Was working on an article about Dr, Edward George Fell, an early developer of methods of artificial ventilation[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18052905] and noticed a problem with linking that term in Wikipedia: 
*By definition Artificial ventilation (synonymous with artificial respiration) is &quot;any means of producing gas exchange mechanically or manually between the lungs and the surrounding air, which is not performed entirely by the person's own respiratory system&quot;[http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php/?t=98071] ([http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/artificial+ventilation more defs]), making echanical ventilation[http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/mechanical%20ventilation] and rescue breathing sub-types of artificial ventilation. 
*In Wikipedia Artificial ventilation redirects to an article mainly about rescue breathing incorrectly titled rtificial respiration (rescue breathing is just one type of artificial ventilation/respiration). 

Artificial ventilation should be an over-all term/topic article and the article on rescue breathing should have a more correct name than artificial respiration. ser:Fountains of Bryn Mawr|Fountains of Bryn Mawr (ser talk:Fountains of Bryn Mawr|talk) 20:39, 26 March 2016 (UTC)

 Asking readers directly for input on articles 

One metric IOSH uses to measure impact is the number of page views, including page views to Wikipedia articles. This tells us about the volume of traffic, but nothing about who is reading it, or where they are from, or what motivated them to look up the article (curiosity, affected worker, employer trying to improve workplace safety, etc). While we are good at getting feedback from editors, we don't have mechanisms that are as reliable for getting feedback from readers, and I would like to report more &quot;impact&quot; information to NIOSH. Has there been any thought in embedding optional reader surveys in very select groups of articles? I understand there was the article feedback tool many years ago, but it applied to too many articles (instead of a very select subset) and collected open-ended feedback rather than more useful, structured information. I ask this project because I imagine you all would have had a similar idea. If something like I am proposing has been tried I would like to hear more about it. If it hasn't, but you think it is a good idea, let me know and I can begin thinking about implementation. ser:James Hare (NIOSH)|James Hare (NIOSH) (ser talk:James Hare (NIOSH)|talk) 05:08, 17 March 2016 (UTC)

 From ProMED: &quot;My concern is that with so many pressing demands on public health agencies in the dengue-endemic counties -- malaria in many, Chagas disease in some, schistosomiasis in others, hepatitis and other enteroviral diseases in most, to mention a few -- long-range planning and pre-outbreak preparation gets short shrift until an outbreak such as yellow fever hits. Vaccination of 70-80 percent of the population at potential risk is one obvious approach, but adequate supplies of the vaccine are necessary, and trained vaccination teams must be available for its administration. With vaccination, vector control and avoidance, the eternal question is: Who will pay for what is needed in the absence of a crisis? Prevention is cheaper than crisis response, as Angola health authorities are in the process of finding out.

 On the use of Frontiers journals as sources 

ser|Gongwool appears to be on a mission to remove from all articles citations of articles from &quot;predatory open access publishers&quot;.  That might or might not be a good thing, but in the process he is removing citations to articles in Frontiers journals; see rontiers Media.  In my view that is wrong -- I have read dozens of high-quality review articles in Frontiers journals.  The question I would like to open for discussion is (a) is it possible for Frontiers citations to meet P:RS; (b) is is possible for citations of review papers in Frontiers journals to meet P:MEDRS? ser:Looie496|Looie496 (ser talk:Looie496|talk) 16:03, 17 March 2016 (UTC)
 As rontiers Media states, they're listed in the effrey Beall [https://scholarlyoa.com/publishers/ list of predatory journals] but there seems to be a significant group who disagree with the designation [http://www.nature.com/news/backlash-after-frontiers-journals-added-to-list-of-questionable-publishers-1.18639] and others who agree [http://deevybee.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/my-collapse-of-confidence-in-frontiers.html].
It seems to me that the proper course of action is to be cautious about claims from Frontier journals (but then, it makes sense to be cautious about any claim made anywhere). As far as P:MEDRS is concerned, AFAIU it, the emphasis is on reviews - and I don't know whether Frontier journals publish that kind of paper.  If they did, I think I'd be very cautious about using it in isolation, given the various complaints about it. ser:JMWt|JMWt (ser talk:JMWt|talk) 17:03, 17 March 2016 (UTC)

 I like |JMWt|JMWt's idea of leaving Frontiers citations in place with the l|better source tag. Some of the stuff on Beall's list is just irrefutable trash, but this one sounds like it could be an exception, at least on a case by case basis (I haven't looked into it). But as long as Frontiers isn't being used to support a contentious statement or an idea that's expressed equally as well in a stronger source, I could see rare, hypothetical scenarios where removing those references could be detrimental to some articles (e.g. if the Frontiers piece pulled together several widely accepted concepts that otherwise couldn't be expressed without OR). ser:Permstrump|PermStrumpser:Permstrump|(talk) 01:04, 18 March 2016 (UTC)

If it is truly exceptional - say a claim of treatment efficacy that is not backed-up by any other reasonable secondary sources - then alarm bells should ring. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 10:52, 18 March 2016 (UTC)
That's something to consider for any source.  It depends upon context (one does not really expect multiple studies on the treatment efficacy for a rare disease or co-morbidities of uncommon ones), but information present in only one source is not necessarily P:DUE even if it's in a highly respected publication.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:16, 18 March 2016 (UTC)
What WAID said. &quot;It depends on the context&quot; is the only right answer to this question and anyone running around blanket-removing or even blanket-tagging should stop. This is the kind of conversation that makes me think there was a wrong turn taken in trying to provide general guidance that centers on the perceived quality of the source rather than the type of information the source is being used for. ser:Opabinia regalis|Opabinia regalis (ser talk:Opabinia regalis|talk) 19:29, 18 March 2016 (UTC)
* I generally avoid Frontiers journals.  They often put out guest-edited issues, and those issues are often full of woo for pet theories and misrepresent what is actually seen by the field as &quot;accepted knowledge&quot;.  These  issues often have crazy big woo (they fail P:INDY).   So if a Frontiers review is the only source on something, I look to see if it is from a guest-edited issue and read it carefully first to try to decide how even-handed it appears to be.  if it appears to be woo-full I just don't bring it to Wikipedia at all.  Even if it seems OK I use it gingerly.  But generally I don't even click to read the abstract for reviews from Frontiers when looking for sources on pubmed, and just skip right over them. ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 16:05, 18 March 2016 (UTC) (missed some nuance; added it ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 20:17, 18 March 2016 (UTC))

Seeing this thread was began about my actions, here's my penny's worth. The above COI working there said &quot;Plenty of Frontiers journals are well-respected&quot; which suggests that other Frontier journals are not well-respected prob due to lack of peer review. The internet is becoming a cesspool of crank science misinformation, is Wikipedia beginning to reflect this? Yes maybe it is if it uses non-peer reviewed articles as source in supporting scientific theory. So which Frontier journals does proper-science use, and how can we tell which ones are crank and non-crank? I guess if the paper is published elsewhere where peer-review can be guaranteed then it's OK. But scientific theory needs to toughen-up and avoid any link to crank otherwise Wikipedia continues to merge with that misinformation superhighway cesspool, and W.P. becomes untrusted (if it's not already viewed that way). (BTW I'm currently involved where non-scientists are pushing crank begun in that well respected science journal Rolling Stone magazine.) Others good editors, much more familiar with the science topic being discussed above will know where to find more solid respected cites to support text. I can't necessarily help with that.

 Basic symptoms of schizophrenia 

This http://schizophreniabulletin.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/1/5.long discusses the basic symptom concept, which has been applied in Europe partly to assess people at high risk for schizophrenia (and it may be used in the States as well). But there isn't an article on it and any information on it is hard to find outside of the elf-disorder article. Considering that self-disorders are a type of basic symptom, it would seem to make sense to create an organization of articles revolving around the basic symptom concept. Any feedback? --ser:Beneficii|Beneficii (ser talk:Beneficii|talk) 08:53, 30 March 2016 (UTC)

 Fish oil drugs 
ile:Ethyl eicosapentaenoate.png|thumb|Ethyl eicosapentaenoate
I completely worked over mega-3 acid ethyl esters, thyl eicosapentaenoic acid, and mega-3 carboxylic acids tonight, and made them into drug articles.  It is not totally clear to me if they should remain separate or be combined into one.  They are different molecules but so similar... down to having the exact same label indications (except for the first one which got broader coverage in the EU.  The second is the one from which arose the 2012 court case about off-label marketing of drugs and I added a section on that.

Also we are still kind of stuck as what to do what health content in ish oil and mega-3 fatty acid - there is discussion at alk:Omega-3 fatty acid.

Addiction medicine
I'm not particularly interested in editing articles on medical specialties; since these refs (intended for ddiction#Epidemiology) seem to attribute a lot of significance to the establishment of a new ABMS-recognized specialty,ite web|author=Nora Volkow|title=A Major Step Forward for Addiction Medicine|url=https://www.drugabuse.gov/about-nida/noras-blog/2016/03/major-step-forward-addiction-medicine|website=National Institute on Drug Abuse|publisher=National Institutes of Health|accessdate=3 April 2016|date=31 March 2016|quote=Only about 10 percent of the 21 million Americans who meet the need for care for an alcohol or drug use disorder receive any form of treatment, and much of the treatment available does not meet standards for evidence-based care. There are many attitudinal and systemic reasons for this treatment gap, including stigma against treating people with addictions and institutional barriers to providing or funding addiction treatment. ... A major milestone was reached on March 14, 2016, when the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) formally announced recognition of the field of Addiction Medicine as a medical subspecialty. ... In a statement issued to mark this milestone, ABAM President Robert J. Sokol summed up its significance: 'This landmark event, more than any other, recognizes addiction as a preventable and treatable disease, helping to shed the stigma that has long plagued it. It sends a strong message to the public that American medicine is committed to providing expert care for this disease and services designed to prevent the risky substance use that precedes it.'ite web|title=AMERICAN BOARD OF MEDICAL SPECIALTIES RECOGNIZES THE NEW SUBSPECIALTY OF ADDICTION MEDICINE|url=http://www.abam.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/1.-News-Release-ADM.pdf|website=American Board of Addiction Medicine|accessdate=3 April 2016|date=14 March 2016|quote= Sixteen percent of the non-institutionalized U.S. population age 12 and over – more than 40 million Americans – meets medical criteria for addiction involving nicotine, alcohol or other drugs. This is more than the number of Americans with cancer, diabetes or heart conditions. In 2014, 22.5 million people in the United States needed treatment for addiction involving alcohol or drugs other than nicotine, but only 11.6 percent received any form of inpatient, residential, or outpatient treatment. Of those who do receive treatment, few receive evidence-based care. (There is no information available on how many individuals receive treatment for addiction involving nicotine.) Risky substance use and untreated addiction account for one-third of inpatient hospital costs and 20 percent of all deaths in the United States each year, and cause or contribute to more than 100 other conditions requiring medical care, as well as vehicular crashes, other fatal and non-fatal injuries, overdose deaths, suicides, homicides, domestic discord, the highest incarceration rate in the world and many other costly social consequences. The economic cost to society is greater than the cost of diabetes and all cancers combined. Despite these startling statistics on the prevalence and costs of addiction, few physicians have been trained to prevent or treat it. I figured I'd just mention it here in the event anyone is interested in updating the relevant specialty/organization articles. ser:Seppi333|Seppi333 (ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert 2¢) 14:09, 3 April 2016 (UTC)
