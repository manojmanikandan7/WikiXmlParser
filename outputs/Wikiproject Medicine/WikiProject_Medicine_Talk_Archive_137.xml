Does all of that really need to be in the same navbox? WhatamIdoing (talk) 01:53, 27 May 2020 (UTC)

 - not sure. It was all in the navbox before, I just reorganized it. If it *were* split, the only logical split I can think of is “oral agents” versus “injection” agents, but even that would be blurry because of things like semaglutide which is available as both, and would still result in a large navbox. I posted here and on the talk page of the template to see about suggestions (and advice as to why my edit has broken the “lining up” of the various parts, but I’m happy to work further on it if a split can be identified. bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez (User/say hi!) 02:03, 27 May 2020 (UTC)
I've replaced the regular &quot;child&quot; navboxes with collapsible ones, which makes it a little bit cleaner. It seems that all the ATC code based navboxes vary in size greatly depending on the organization/size of the code, and *very* few are split further within a code. See  and  for examples of other large ones. Those two don't use collapsible navboxes, but they also aren't as clearly separated as &quot;insulins&quot; and &quot;non-insulins&quot; are. bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez (User/say hi!) 02:34, 27 May 2020 (UTC)

Covid-19 denial, disinformation, and propaganda

One of the most highly shared propaganda pieces that coronavirus deniers like to bring up on social media is an anonymous website now known as “Swiss Policy Research” (swprs.org). The German Wikipedia has courageously dealt with these people by creating an [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Propaganda_Research informative article] about the group. Unfortunately, we don’t have anything in English, and people are still actively sharing links to their coronavirus denial website without knowing who they are and how they’ve been debunked in Europe.  Would it be a good idea to translate this for the English Wikipedia or to incorporate this information elsewhere?  When gullible people post links to the group on social media and elsewhere, it would be helpful to have an English article on Wikipedia to point them to in the future.  Whatever you decide, I leave this in your capable hands.  Thanks. Viriditas (talk) 01:46, 21 May 2020 (UTC)

Based on those German sources, it looks like a candidate for inclusion into misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  It’s only notable in relation to its use by coronavirus deniers and by the German media which successfully debunked it.  Unfortunately, the source is widely cited on US social media, and because there is no link or entry for it here in English, nobody has been able to adequately point to a rebuttal, so it is being used without a counterpoint hundreds of times per day, and that indirectly promotes coronavirus misinformation and denial.

Malignant chondroid syringoma
malignant chondroid syringoma - hi! I have a strong interest in this topic and have been researching it for a while. I just added some information to the page and was wondering if anyone experienced in the field would be interested in reading over the page. I wouldn't want to give out false information, but everything I have written has a source. Thanks so much! 

Malignant chondroid syringoma Julia9909 (talk) 23:29, 25 May 2020 (UTC)

Julia9909, I took a quick look at it, and I think you're on the right track.  You've managed to turn a one-sentence stub into a significant article.  You're doing really well for being a new editor!  
I have added a bunch of links to the top part of the article, and I encourage you to:
(a) check the links I added, and change or remove any that you don't like or don't agree with!
(b) add more links to the rest of the article.  (We don't usually duplicate links, but there are other opportunities for new links.)
You have probably used &quot;direct quotations&quot; more often than is strictly necessary, but copyediting can be sorted out later.  I am really glad that you included the
Prognosis
information.  When we collected feedback from readers some years back, that was one of the topics that was often overlooked in articles, and of very high importance to them.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 00:21, 27 May 2020 (UTC)

WhatamIdoing, thank you very much for your feedback! I really appreciate it. Thank you also for adding the links. I have also attempted to add some more relevant information. Hopefully I can remove some of the direct quotations - I have mainly included them as I don't want to plagiarise my sources and I find it difficult to paraphrase medical terms and diagnoses. I will continue to work at the article. Thanks again! Julia9909 (talk) 12:41, 27 May 2020 (UTC)

Vaccine trial


I was a bit surprised to see there's no information about the general success of trials Phase I/II, Phase II/III, III/approved, and then approved/phase IV trials. Like, for every 1000 vaccines/drugs in phase 1 trial, how many go on to phase 2? In phase 2, how many go on to phase 3? etc.

This seems of high interest for covid times.  Headbomb {t ·  ·  · } 21:29, 26 May 2020 (UTC)

I don't know if there have been enough vaccine attempts to give numbers for that.  For more common types of drugs, I believe that if a molecule starts Phase 1 testing, it has about a 10–20% chance of getting approval.  
&quot;Success&quot; might be a hard thing to define, as safety and efficacy depend upon what you're treating.  You can have a &quot;successful&quot; trial that convinces you to stop development.  
Also, the same side effect profile could be wonderful or unacceptable, depending upon whether you're treating a life-threatening condition or a minor illness, and what the alternatives are.  As I'm fond of pointing out occasionally, the pre-modern-medicine skin cancer treatment Black salve, which our article is calling &quot;pseudoscientific&quot; and &quot;alternative&quot;, actually does kill a small fraction of thin, superficial skin cancers.  It would never get approval because its efficacy is about one-tenth of the standard treatment (which is a quick, simple surgical removal), and the side effects are dramatically worse (click the link and see the pictures if you want to know how bad it is).  But that same profile would be acceptable, if the treatment in question were proposed for a disease that was otherwise an untreatable death sentence. WhatamIdoing (talk) 01:47, 27 May 2020 (UTC)
Success being defined as going to the next phase. If not for vaccines, then for drugs in general.  Headbomb {t ·  ·  · } 10:13, 27 May 2020 (UTC)
Five days ago VRT reported on progress of the COVID-19 vaccine being developed at KU Leuven ([https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2020/05/22/coronavaccin-ku-leuven/] – in Dutch). Theirs is one of an estimated 120 COVID-19 candidate vaccines under development worldwide that will make it to trials on humans, and around 10% of these candidate vaccines are expected to be still in the running after these trials. So, according to the interviewed professor, ultimately around 10 different vaccine types becoming commercially available would be good, while different vaccines that make it that far might still behave different (e.g. one being more effective than another); and for production capacity, while so many doses will be necessary, it is also good that there are multiple vaccine manufacturers. A vaccine ready for roll-out is not expected before 2021. --Francis Schonken (talk) 11:39, 27 May 2020 (UTC)

Nicorette - brand name given special treatment?

I just ran across , which seems to be getting special treatment as a brand of nicotine replacement therapy products. I'd like to remove it from , and hope someone more familiar with such articles would look it over for other problems.

Also, the page is rendering improperly, suggesting there are formatting problems somewhere inside the article. --Hipal/Ronz (talk) 19:17, 28 May 2020 (UTC)

 I've removed the category: nicorette is not on the [https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/325771/WHO-MVP-EMP-IAU-2019.06-eng.pdf 2019 list]. I can't see a rendering problem, can you be more specific, please?
 For the article itself, my inclination would be to merge it into Nicotine replacement therapy and get rid of the advertising sections like yacht and car racing sponsorship. I see that Nicoderm has already been merged there. It would need a , though. --RexxS (talk) 19:37, 28 May 2020 (UTC)
Thanks.
The rendering problem disappeared as I was tracking it down. I'm guessing it was from a template. --Hipal/Ronz (talk) 19:41, 28 May 2020 (UTC)
If you have a separate article on Nicorette, it should focus on the business, marketing, and historical aspects of the subject, and merely summarize the things that it has in common with the generics.  We have several articles about health-related brands.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 23:26, 28 May 2020 (UTC)

Nicorette is something of a special case; it was the first and for a long time only nicotine replacement therapy, so was at the center of all the early court cases and regulatory hearings. As such, there's undoubtedly a viable article to be written on it, independently of the now-genericized product. (We wouldn't consider merging Ford Model T into Automobile.) ‑ Iridescent 23:56, 28 May 2020 (UTC)

 Yes, but there's no advertising agenda behind the Ford Model T article. I can't say the same for Nicorette. --RexxS (talk) 13:57, 29 May 2020 (UTC)

Make it &quot;We wouldn't consider merging iPhone into Smartphone&quot; or &quot;We wouldn't consider merging Tesla Roadster into Electric car&quot; if you prefer; the principle of &quot;the brand that opened the market is more likely to be notable since when it had a monopoly it was by definition mentioned in all coverage of the topic&quot; is the same, and we certainly spend an inordinate amount of time shooing away Apple and Tesla's corporate puffery. That a brand still has commercial value and said value is potentially affected by the contents of its Wikipedia article, doesn't render the brand non-notable, it just means we need to be careful to cover it neutrally. ‑ Iridescent 17:53, 29 May 2020 (UTC)
 Yes, we do a good job of keeping Apple and Tesla's corporate puffery out of iPhone and Tesla Roadster (2008). I still can't say the same for Nicorette. --RexxS (talk) 18:10, 29 May 2020 (UTC)

I didn't see anything about it in  or in  Whywhenwhohow (talk) 07:01, 29 May 2020 (UTC)
I see two distinct patterns here, each one followed reasonably well: &quot;[isotope][element]&quot; vs &quot;[element]-[isotope]&quot;. When the isotope precedes the element (its symbol), it's superscripted; a different way is to have it hyphenated after (usually the element name not symbol). Both of those are standard IUPAC/ACS style...one more chemical-symbol the other more linguistic. DMacks (talk) 07:24, 29 May 2020 (UTC)
 As there is consensus on using international nonproprietary names for pharmaceuticals, we should stick to the WHO's convention as far as drugs are concerned, which is along the lines of &quot;cyanocobalamin (60Co)&quot; (see https://www.who.int/medicines/services/inn/FINAL_WHO_PHARM_S_NOM_1570_web.pdf p 12).

Pegylated interferon - another questionable World Health Organization essential medicines category entry

* is another questionable entry in . It's a class of medication rather than a specific one, so I believe it should be removed from the category.

The article is simply a list with three entries: Pegylated interferon-alpha-2a (redirects to Peginterferon alfa-2a), Pegylated interferon-alpha-2b (redirects to Peginterferon alfa-2b, and Pegylated interferon-beta-1a. Both the peginterferon articles are entries in the WHO category.

Are there any problems with removing this? --Hipal/Ronz (talk) 17:25, 29 May 2020 (UTC)

Why shouldn't that category contain links to classes of medications?  (Are you also proposing to remove condoms from it?) WhatamIdoing (talk) 17:44, 29 May 2020 (UTC)
That's why I'm bringing it up here. I've gone over maybe 3/4 of the entries in the category, and I believe it's the only link to a class of medications. I've not looked for any discussion on what the category should contain, but the category is being used to identify all the individual medicines in the WHO list. --Hipal/Ronz (talk) 17:50, 29 May 2020 (UTC)
All the individual medicines, plus  and  – all of which are &quot;class of medication&quot; articles, even though nobody actually gets a generic vaccine (because they don't exist.  Biologics produced by different companies are not identical).  I'm inclined to leave that page in there.  As for whether there ought to be more, price is a factor for the WHO EM list.  The result is that only some of the statins are on the list (for example).  In an area that sees few or no new drugs, then including the &quot;class of medication&quot; article is probably reasonable. WhatamIdoing (talk) 20:24, 29 May 2020 (UTC)
Speaking of classes of medicines, entries in the EML that are tagged with a square box symbol are examples of a drug in a pharmacological class. How should the category be applied to those entries and to other medicines in the same class?

Whywhenwhohow (talk) 06:31, 31 May 2020 (UTC)

Wasn't there a template we were using to mark old Cochrane reviews that needed to be updated?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:44, 22 May 2020 (UTC)
Thanks for noticing these edits and for posting this Sandy. I will touch base with this volunteer to clarify  and . Yes WAID, you are correct. Cochrane Reviews cited in Wikipedia articles for which a more recent version exists (an update) are flagged by a bot that includes with a link to the updated version. This bot runs once a month. JenOttawa (talk) 02:16, 25 May 2020 (UTC)

This is an ongoing problem that we might all be on the look out for; I am unsure why there is an idea that old Cochrane information should be added to articles, or why it is being added without making sure the information is still accurate and up to date.

Should &quot;mechanical asphyxia&quot; redirect to &quot;smothering&quot; or something else?

I came across this article [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12935542] which stated:  As such I am wondering whether the redirect is correct or not, because it seems that there can be multiple forms of mechanical asphyxia. starship (talk) 12:32, 2 June 2020 (UTC)

It redirects to Asphyxia#Smothering. WhatamIdoing (talk) 20:45, 2 June 2020 (UTC)
 - yes, it does. I'm questioning if that is correct. From the above, it seems that both strangulation and traumatic asphyxia are also mechanical asphyxia. So why should it redirect to smothering? starship (talk) 00:29, 3 June 2020 (UTC)
  The problem is that there are no consistently agreed classifications of asphyxia. You can search Google Scholar and get lots of different interpretations, and I found an article on [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44685788_Classification_of_Asphyxia_The_Need_for_Standardization Researchgate] devoted to the very issue. I agree that a redirect to smothering isn't the best target, so perhaps an extra section on Mechanical asphyxiation which discusses the possible meanings might be a useful addition to Asphyxia. In the meantime, I think that if the principal meanings of mechanical asphyxia are likely to be positional asphyxia and traumatic asphyxia, then the redirect might be better pointing to Asphyxia #Compressive asphyxia or perhaps even to Positional asphyxia. --RexxS (talk) 01:17, 3 June 2020 (UTC)

's instructions are about a million miles long, but it's easier than it looks.  Your mission, should you choose to accept, is to see that the article isn't a copyvio, that it's in basically okay shape (for having been started recently), and that the &quot;hook&quot; (the bit that appears on the Main Page) corresponds to a sentence with an  in the article.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 22:07, 7 June 2020 (UTC)
And (the most important part, but which gets skipped surprisingly often): check the cited source for the hook actually says what the hook claims that it says. It's astonishing how many people try to slip bullshit through, and even more astonishing how often they succeed. ‑ Iridescent 22:39, 7 June 2020 (UTC)

This is an easy game.  Fixing this normally requires only basic wikitext skills, so if you're a newer editor and you like medical jargon (or geography), then try this.

# Click on one of these articles.
# Search (⌘F, ^F, or equivalent on your device) for &quot;disamb&quot; to find the link that needs to be fixed.  For example, it's a link to &quot;Toxemia&quot; in the infobox at Kidney disease.
# Re-point the marked link to something sensible.  For example, switch that link to Bacteremia.  Usually, the link that you want is listed on the currently linked page. 
# If you were able to fix the page, then mark the fixed page off this list.  If you couldn't figure out the right link, then leave a note here, and we'll all try to figure it out together.

Any interest in a WP:MED newsletter?

Hi all, while much of my editing overlaps with the WP:MED scope, I often find there's so much activity here that I have trouble keeping up. Someone recently mentioned the possibility of a WP:MED newsletter, and so I figured I'd post here to gauge interest. I'd imagine a format based on 's  newsletter, which I think has been a really valuable resource (a recent example ). A section to recognize newly reviewed GAs and FAs, as well as outstanding nominations at either forum (which could benefit from knowledgable reviewers). A section to note outstanding RfCs on WP:MED-tagged articles that are seeking comments. A section to note discussions from around Wikipedia that could influence WP:MED editors. And if anyone is interested in crafting one, perhaps a section to highlight some rotating topic (as the ToL newsletter often does). The newsletter would be crafted on a subpage of this project, and &quot;delivered&quot; monthly to the talk pages of those who opt-in. If folks find it valuable, anyone can contribute and it'll continue. If not, it'll fizzle out no harm done (it looks like there was  in the past?). If people are interested, I'm happy to draft a newsletter to get us started. Thoughts? Ajpolino (talk) 02:19, 1 June 2020 (UTC)

Draft transcluded from my sandbox below (formatting shamelessly ripped from the ToL newsletter). The hope is that a newsletter could serve two purposes: (1) display, at a glance, places where medical-interested editors could be useful, and (2) provide some small project cohesion. This would use the same page structure as the old WP:MED newsletter, so if you're interested in having it delivered to your talk page, add your name at . If anyone is interested, I'm happy to draft monthly newsletters for the time being. If no one is interested, I won't bother. I hope all are staying well. Ajpolino (talk) 03:00, 4 June 2020 (UTC)




, I like the way that it starts with good content and acknowledges the role of both writers such as SandyGeorgia, Tom (LT), and SpicyMilkBoy and reviewers such as yourself and Cinadon36. 
I don't want to volunteer anyone for a lot of work, but I wonder whether people would be interested in occasionally involving other groups, such as , or  or the  regulars?

 Thanks for the ping, WAID ... Ajpolino, very nice work!  Regards, SandyGeorgia (Talk)  20:52, 4 June 2020 (UTC)
 Thanks, I agree it looks great. From my experience trying to write the newsletter here and also doing the ones at  a short-form newsletter like the one you've done is best; just putting in the links and such to active discussions along with some small updates is useful. I don't think the focus section is 100% necessary every issue - I found it is the most time-consuming element by far to write. --Tom (LT) (talk) 23:27, 4 June 2020 (UTC)
 Great idea. I'll try to rope in med-adjacent groups from time to time. If anyone has particular ideas they'd like to see, feel free to post at . I'll leave the June issue as is, and move on to starting  (to be delivered at the beginning of July). All are welcome to pitch in.

Also, off-topic, but I'd like to highlight to everyone the great work that  has done at Full blood count. I think it's a complex topic and difficult to write about and to structure an article about, and that this article has been written in a particularly easy to understand and pretty comprehensive format.

, might I suggest two changes before you publish?
# You have not mentioned the amazing save at  of Chagas disease by yourself and ; this is the equivalent of new Featured content, since the two of you restored it top to bottom and it would have otherwise been defeatured.  If you are too modest to add mention of yourself, perhaps one of us can add this to your draft?  It would be most encouraging to see this kind of work highlighted, since at least Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Multiple sclerosis, Management of multiple sclerosis, autism and so many other medical FAs are no longer at , and would benefit from similar work and recognition, so please do toot your own horn on the work done to save a bronze star!
# I am uncomfortable describing dementia with Lewy bodies as &quot;by SandyGeorgia&quot;; it would not have been possible for that article to be featured without the collaboration of about a dozen other editors.  Perhaps you could change it to &quot;nominated by SandyGeorgia&quot;, and rather than linking to my name, link to the FAC instead, where all the collaborators are listed? 
Generally, I am very happy to see this effort, as the newsletter contains the kind of information that was once displayed on the WP:MED page and encouraged collaboration; I do not agree that the newsletter should be linked at the top of this talk page, and if it takes hold, it should be linked prominently on the main project page, at .  Regards, SandyGeorgia (Talk)  13:29, 6 June 2020 (UTC)
I'll reply in reverse order. To your second point, in the future I'll ping all listed names a week before the newsletter goes out to ask if they'd like to add collaborators or change the attribution in some way. I agree &quot;by&quot; is not ideal attribution for a wiki. &quot;Nominated by&quot; is probably better going forward. To your first point, thank you. I've added it with a short note to say that it's an FARC cleanup. Consider our horns tooted. I won't bother delivering the June issue since all the subscribers have seen it here. But I've updated it above (transcluded from ) for good measure. The July issue will be delivered at the beginning of July. Anyone's welcome to fiddle with it . Otherwise, those listed will get pings in a few weeks. Thanks for the thoughts! Ajpolino (talk) 17:26, 6 June 2020 (UTC)

List of oldest fathers

What's up doc? I was recently looking at the List of oldest fathers page which has an entry for an anonymous 66 year old man who was proven to be the father of his kid. The study that confirmed his paternity also concluded that male fertility had a biological upper limit of 65 or 66 years old. For that reason, I would like to find scientific evidence proving any man has fathered a child after age 66. Does it exist in the literature? Thanks for any help. Geographyinitiative (talk) 07:21, 7 June 2020 (UTC)
 I intend to add any scientific evidence of men fathering children after 66 to the page. If that evidence is not forthcoming, then I would say the page needs to be divided into two parts: scientifically confirmed dads and journalistically confirmed dads. Geographyinitiative (talk) 09:02, 7 June 2020 (UTC)
 There is obviously no hard limit. This is the sort of terrible article that makes me think Wikipedia is a bad idea. Alexbrn (talk) 10:55, 7 June 2020 (UTC)
 I agree, but is there any scientific backing, namely a known positive paternity test, supporting the claim that any specific man over 66 sired an offspring? Once I have that, then the study cited on that page is &quot;rekt&quot; so to speak. Geographyinitiative (talk) 19:40, 7 June 2020 (UTC)
If you're referring to PMID 25694621 then that's a primary source, so not  and unreliable for any assertion about human biology. The idea that a small sample of immigration testing DNA can be used to infer something universal about an upper age limit of male fertility is beyond ridiculous, as is the entire premise of the Wikipedia article. Alexbrn (talk) 19:53, 7 June 2020 (UTC)

Geographyinitiative (talk) 02:44, 9 June 2020 (UTC)
 As I've said there is obviously no hard upper age, and any claim that there is unreliably-sourced, misunderstood and wrong. How many fathers over 65 have there been: 1,000? 10,000?, 100,000? more?

 I get it! Based our recent interactions, someone has moved the age limit up to 75 and deleted the entries 65-75. What do you think of it now? Getting any better? I'm trying to find a way for Wikipedia to address fatherhood at extreme old age in a rational way that doesn't make you laugh at us! haha! The REAL question is: are ANY of the births on the page scientifically confirmed? Is there anything in medical literature that shows a man 75 years or older has been proven to have had a child?

In terms of -compliant sourcing, there are plenty of articles about the effects of paternal age on mutation rates, fertility &amp;c., but I couldn't see much on very old fathers. There was  that cites Myers (1972), saying &quot;however it an assumed fact that men are capable of spermatogenic activity beyond age 60 with world oldest father procreating at age 97.

 According to [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3253726/#B17 Fertility and the Aging Male], &quot;In 1969, Sasano and Ichijo first described the decrease in sperm concentration as men age. They reported that 90% of seminiferous tubules in men in their 20s and 30s contained spermatids, whereas men in their 40s and 50s had spermatids in 50% of their seminiferous tubules. Only 10% of seminiferous tubules from men aged &gt; 80 years contained spermatids&quot;. That suggests that male fertility declines over time, but there is definitely a presence of viable semen being produced in some percentage of octogenarian testes. BD2412 T 14:07, 10 June 2020 (UTC)

 The sources look like good quality primary studies supporting a novel hypothesis, but without a secondary review of them (considering they span 2015–2020), it seems to me undue to make as much of them as the requester suggests, and they certainly are not strong enough to justify a section in Causes.

I saw a change ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Keratoconus&amp;diff=961615582&amp;oldid=961577025 link]) where a contributor added a reference which they likely (partly) wrote themselves. Is the COI template I posted to the contributor's Talk page appropriate? Kind regards, Robby.is.on (talk) 17:36, 9 June 2020 (UTC)
yes that's COI[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Dr_Himal_Kandel]--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 19:13, 9 June 2020 (UTC)
 Thank you. :-) Robby.is.on (talk) 09:02, 10 June 2020 (UTC)
See also ; citing a paper that you wrote is a permitted action (when the source is otherwise appropriate). WhatamIdoing (talk) 19:11, 10 June 2020 (UTC)
 It's always appropriate when the editor is genuinely trying, first and foremost, to improve the article and not promote their own work. The problem with a CoI is the editor is all too often the least able to make that determination dispassionately. --RexxS (talk) 23:29, 10 June 2020 (UTC)

Ah, yes, thank you, it's serendipity time :-) A couple of analogous instances (by the same good-faith, newly registered account - @) [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kawasaki_disease&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=962007360&amp;oldid=961964795 here] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paediatric_multisystem_inflammatory_syndrome&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=962010634&amp;oldid=961616522 here]. I'll welcome the new contributor and try to do my best to communicate when I have a moment, though others might be better at that and get there first. Of course, in many real-world borderline individual  situations there's no bright line between trying to improve an article and promote one's own work. (Fwiw, my own first medical content edit here, over a decade ago, was actually also both technically  and a genuine attempt to improve a page with relevant peer-reviewed information, though I had no idea then about Wikipedia guidelines such as reliable medical sourcing , etc. Anyway, I'm still here or hereabouts, albeit now as an ip contributor :).

This RFC – or &quot;vote&quot;, really – is about the wording for the introduction.  They're now voting on options 1a, 1b, 2, 2b, 3, and 4.  A vote is not usually an effective method of writing a good introduction.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 23:23, 28 May 2020 (UTC)

This discussion needs better attention:  a new editor who appears to know what they are talking about (of the type we should be interested in retaining) is seeking to make improvements but not getting much help. (Telling an editor who knows the field that the best sources are less than five years old could be off-putting if this editor knows what the most authoritative sources are.)   might you look in here? Some more structured and sustained help might be useful here. SandyGeorgia (Talk)  13:59, 12 June 2020 (UTC)

Splits

Yes, we have no bananas, so I'm here to talk about Wikipedia's kind of .  

We have three old proposals to split articles that need to be closed:

* Pemphigoid ()
* Abortion in the United Kingdom#Northern Ireland ()
* Dysfibrinogenemia (no discussion; ask Ozzie)
** Left a comment in the talk page :) Dr. Vogel (talk) 19:00, 13 June 2020 (UTC)

All of these have been open for more than a year.  If someone could either split these articles () or remove the tags, that would be great.  Thanks,  WhatamIdoing (talk) 20:28, 7 June 2020 (UTC)
yesDysfibrinogenemia... Hereditary fibrinogen Aα-Chain amyloidosis, at the least should be split out of there but feedback would be nice--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 21:52, 7 June 2020 (UTC)
Hi, I'm really sorry to contribute to the problem rather than to the solution as I'd prefer, but I've never understood why Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer and Lynch syndrome are merged into a single article. Dr. Vogel (talk) 23:11, 8 June 2020 (UTC)
[https://www.cdc.gov/genomics/disease/colorectal_cancer/lynch.htm CDC:Lynch syndrome, also known as hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), is the most common cause of hereditary colorectal (colon) cancer.]--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 23:17, 8 June 2020 (UTC)
But that's like merging water and drowning! :)
Lynch syndrome and HNPCC are conceptually different.
I'm not saying we definitely should split it, but it's the example that always comes to my mind when I think about articles within WP Medicine being split or merged. Dr. Vogel (talk) 23:51, 8 June 2020 (UTC)
the source is CDC and NIH[https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/9905/index] and [https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/lynch-syndrome#synonyms]US national Library of Medicine/Genetics Home Reference--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 00:22, 9 June 2020 (UTC)
Of course. I agree with you about the quality of the sources. But it's also true that those same sources also say that Lynch Syndrome can give you other things that are not HNPCC, and that you can get colon cancer that is non-polipotic and hereditary without having Lynch syndrome. So they're conceptually different. Dr. Vogel (talk) 00:32, 9 June 2020 (UTC)
DrVogel, you are not contributing to any problems.  :-)
Those are different things – just like those sources explain, when you read a little further along.  Perhaps a more obvious comparison would be merging genetic mutation and cancer.  You can have a genetic mutation without getting cancer, and you can have Lynch syndrome (the mutations) without getting HNPCC (the most common eventual result of those mutations).  
The cause and the result don't always belong in the same article, but if we put them together, we should explain the difference.  I wonder whether any of the content in [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lynch_syndrome&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=323419425&amp;oldid=323415129 this series of edits from 2009] would be helpful. WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:28, 9 June 2020 (UTC)
Yes, I agree that they're 2 separate things, that was exactly my point! :) I had seen those old edits when somebody merged the 2 articles into 1. I personally would prefer to have 2 separate articles, because, albeit highly correlated, they are a) conceptually different and b) you can get any of the 2 without the other. I'm not saying this is urgent, but I am interested in knowing how people feel about this one. Dr. Vogel (talk) 18:45, 13 June 2020 (UTC)

Code of conduct for WikiProjects?


I propose that WikiProject Medicine, along with other WikiProjects, commit to being an especially friendly place in Wikipedia. WikiProject Medicine should do this by adopting a code of conduct which requires that people posting here avoid negativity, and instead be a front-facing community space for new users and people who want friendly enjoyment of Wikipedia.

I have a proposed draft here
*

The Wikimedia Foundation itself is in the process of developing a &quot;Universal Code of Conduct&quot;.
*https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-52779899
*
*

The WMF has not shared many details of what this will mean, but they have said that they intend to implement it across Wikimedia projects by 30 August. When there is opportunity to post comment on the universal code of conduct, I wish to advocate that among community forums in Wikipedia, that the WikiProjects be exceptionally friendly spaces with highly positive interaction and the avoidance of negative interaction.

I am proposing this in the context of an  case, &quot;&quot;, in which various people including me made claims that this WikiProject was a place with negative social interaction. I would like to make some effort to improve the environment here.

Thoughts from others? Under what circumstances could participants at this WikiProject support the adoption of a code of conduct?  Blue Rasberry (talk) 17:52, 31 May 2020 (UTC)
The think the code of conduct is too vague. &quot;Say nice things&quot; doesn't cover the range of things that need to be expressed in an environment such as this. I'd recommend basing any code of conduct on existing work which has received a lot of effort, such as [https://www.iso.org/files/live/sites/isoorg/files/store/en/PUB100397.pdf this one from ISO]. Alexbrn (talk) 18:00, 31 May 2020 (UTC)
 Fine, I support adopting the ISO code of conduct instead of the one I proposed. I also added the ISO one to the list at . Alexbrn, would you propose any changes to the ISO one, or is it ready to adopt now and revise as needed?  Blue Rasberry (talk) 20:13, 31 May 2020 (UTC)
It's focussed on deliverables &amp; formal meetings but I think all of the underlying principles could be usefully considered. One of the interesting ones is the call for quick escalation of disputes - better surely than letter things fester. Alexbrn (talk) 20:23, 31 May 2020 (UTC)
Seems great, if we enforced that one rule alone then that would prevent many problems. Let's do it.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 20:29, 31 May 2020 (UTC)
Alex, I believe that Lane's goal isn't really captured by &quot;Say nice things&quot;.  It appears to be more like &quot;Don't say not-nice things&quot;, or more specifically, &quot;Don't use any phrases that an artificial intelligence system would match, in isolation, with phrases marked in its database as having 'negative sentiment'&quot;.  
If you write, for example, &quot;I don't think that will work&quot; or &quot;That's a serious copyright violation&quot;, then these AI systems would ding you for expressing negative sentiments.  On the other hand, if you write something like &quot;The marvelous thing about Wikipedia is that it lets editors rise above their true levels of real-world competence&quot;, then you're a positive asset to the community who can shortly expect to win a trip to ANI.
I've got no problems with a universal code of conduct, but &quot;Let's not sound negative&quot; isn't what I'd recommend for the contents.  The contents I'd like to see in it sound more like &quot;We don't care where you're from, what your politics are, what your identity is, whether you speak the 'wrong' language:  Anyone can edit, and we'll back that up even to the point of getting rid of editors who 'just happen' to only attack editors from the 'wrong' groups.&quot; WhatamIdoing (talk) 00:55, 1 June 2020 (UTC)
 &quot;we'll back that up even to the point of getting rid of editors who 'just happen' to only attack editors from the 'wrong' groups&quot; What do you mean by this? Can you restate please?  Blue Rasberry (talk) 01:30, 1 June 2020 (UTC)
Imagine that your Code of Conduct decides that real-world disputes should not be imported to Wikipedia.  It might say, for example, &quot;No attacking the McCoy editors at the Hatfield Wikipedia, and no attacking the Hatfield editors at the McCoy Wikipedia.  Everyone is welcome to edit both Wikipedias, no matter which side of the real-world dispute they're on&quot;.
Now imagine that an editor in one of those communities decides that it's important to drive away as many editors from the &quot;wrong&quot; group as possible.  Your code of conduct doesn't mean much if that editor isn't stopped. WhatamIdoing (talk) 01:40, 1 June 2020 (UTC)

I think WT:MED should be a place where editors can discuss medical related issues on Wikipedia and expect to get feedback and discussion from editors who are interested in medical related topics on Wikipedia. Anything beyond that expectation is something to discuss and agree at a Wikipedia level, not a project level. The same goes for all other Wiki Projects. I think BlueRasberry's proposal is quite fundamentally flawed, but most importantly, is nothing to do with medicine or healthcare.  -- Colin°Talk 10:51, 1 June 2020 (UTC)

(ec with Colin) Sorry Blue, but Wikipedia already has a whole slather of  that apply site-wide, and if they're deemed inadequate, I'd rather we improve (or just better enforce) those.  I don't want a suite of policies for the site as a whole and then an additional code for WikiProjects.  Wikipedia is widely ridiculed for being overly bureaucratic as it is ([https://slate.com/technology/2014/06/wikipedias-bureaucracy-problem-and-how-to-fix-it.html eg]); let's not facilitate further , as it just raises the barrier to participation.

**I think it's premature to be voting about this idea.  The community as a whole is still struggling with the definition of &quot;civility&quot;.  Some people think that &quot;civility&quot; means being friendly, or hospitable, or positive, and others have less cheery definitions, like not swearing very much.
**As a matter of verifiable facts, &quot;the cut direct&quot; (deliberately making eye contact with a [former] friend, looking away, and then refusing to speak to them or acknowledge their presence) is civil behavior.  It is &quot;civil&quot; both in the sense that etiquette manuals endorsed it (so much less messy than a duel!) and also in the sense that its goal and effect built up the civitas (by letting society in general, rather than just the law, punish any civis who was believed to have engaged in anti-social behaviors).  I doubt that Blue's notion of civility includes deliberate snubs and shunning behaviors, but the community has long endorsed them, e.g.,  and .
**IMO until we figure out what we mean by &quot;civil&quot;, we'll never get agreement on whether we're being civil. WhatamIdoing (talk) 15:22, 1 June 2020 (UTC)

* I do not see how it can be a good idea for one WikiProject to get ahead of other Wikipedia-wide Policy discussions.  If we want WPMED to “be a front-facing community space for new users and people who want friendly enjoyment of Wikipedia”, we have plenty of policy and guideline-based ways to do that.  Avoid editwarring, avoid casting aspersions, avoid personal,attacks, call out those who do these things, welcome newcomers, respect the frustration of experts who are trying to improve articles but may not yet know how and don’t just give them pat answers that overinterpret guidelines, respond to requests for help on this page ... and so on.

*support a code of conduct is important if some editor(s) wont leave this project and edit elsewhere(Arbcom case and the individual(s) involved) there should be a policy to keep these/this editor(s) in place and civil and contribute in a positive manner--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 14:43, 12 June 2020 (UTC)
**I would like to keep our editors (&quot;keep them in place&quot;, which means that I want them here at WT:MED and in WPMED-tagged articles.  I don't want to &quot;keep them in their places&quot;, meaning &quot;make sure that they act like they're inferior to others&quot;).  However, I disagree that we want editors to be &quot;positive&quot;.  I want people to be &quot;constructive&quot;, even when that means telling me that I'm wrong or have a bad idea.

*comment: it seems susceptible to gaming: literal/strict interpretation of expressing *negativity* about another person's ideas or *contributions* could commonly be used to chill reasoned censure of any new content (and therefore as an aid to pov pushing of particular &quot;ideas&quot;, etc).  (talk) 14:10, 13 June 2020 (UTC)
**Sometimes, &quot;chilling reasoned censure&quot; is appropriate, or people wouldn't have invented (and kept using) approval voting.  But a literal interpretation of expressing negativity means that you don't want people saying .  I just put that in one of the many online short-phrase sentiment analyzers, and that's a &quot;negative&quot; statement.  It's also one of the most helpful and constructive things that an editor writing medical content could say on wiki.  This is why I don't want to focus on negativity. WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:19, 13 June 2020 (UTC)

*oppose I'm relatively new here, so I'm aware that most of you are more wiki-experienced than me and that perhaps if I was more experienced I would think differently. Feel free to dismiss what I'm going to say, I'm fine with that because I am aware that I know very little about the dynamics of all this. I know that I don't know.
Having said that, I can't support this proposal, for the following reasons:
The best thing about working in healthcare is you can make people better. The worst thing about working in healthcare is the bureaucracy. The last thing I'd like to see here is more rules and regulations.
Here, it should just be about never being horrible to your fellow editors, assuming good faith (even with a low threshold) and writing with a neutral point of view in mind.
If someone is chronically disruptive and won't listen to the group, I don't think having a book of rules that we can get out of the cupboard to throw at them is the right way to deal with it - there are several things wrong with that.
And from what I've seen so far, Wikipedia seems to have procedures to deal with disruption anyway. So I don't see the need for another layer of bureaucracy in the form of project-specific rules and regulations. 
To be honest with you all, I feel far more satisfaction when the group comes together to get stuff done, than when my particular opinion is on the &quot;winning&quot; side of a discussion. Dr. Vogel (talk) 23:18, 13 June 2020 (UTC)

Hi guys, bit of a silly question today. Is there a reliable source, or at least consensus, for whether we should say &quot;hep-sid-in&quot; or &quot;hep-sigh-din&quot;? Even the Oxford dictionary won't answer this question. Dr. Vogel (talk) 14:44, 29 May 2020 (UTC)
I've heard it both ways but in the US I hear the latter much more frequently, for what that's worth. Most video lecture-type things I've seen say /heːp'saɪdɪn/ as opposed to /'he:psɪdɪn/ as well. This may very well be an American/British thing? Keilana (talk) 15:14, 29 May 2020 (UTC)
Yes, it may well be, because although I keep hearing both, I hear /'he:psɪdɪn/ much more often than /heːp'saɪdɪn/ around here. Dr. Vogel (talk) 15:39, 29 May 2020 (UTC)

Archive, resolved? SandyGeorgia (Talk)  13:25, 13 June 2020 (UTC)

Hi, sorry, please don't archive it yet, I've been working silly hours the last few days, things are pretty much still crazy IRL.
So, from the kind replies that there have been, people have heard both pronunciations. So I'd like to add both of them to the article. But the trouble is we only have the 1 source that Whywhenwhohow found.
Would it be acceptable to add both pronunciations to the article but only cite a source for one of them? That feels somewhat wrong. But I do want to add them. Dr. Vogel (talk) 06:24, 14 June 2020 (UTC)

Serge Voronoff

Looking at Reputation_and_legacy I'm concerned that there's an attempt to push  by trying to paint the subject as a pioneer for modern techniques such as those related to Sertoli_cells. I don't have a medical background, so I'm not the best judge of what is a reliable source in this context. Could someone please take a look at this? I realise that it's a low priority article, so I'm not asking for anything urgent. Autarch (talk) 14:52, 14 June 2020 (UTC)
I had a quick look. It looks like a case of alternative views since what is cited is fun mainstream publishing, plus breaking the  by linking it into diabetes. Quote a few weasel words. The start is a vague and poorly worded sentence that does not have adequate support. There are statements without any sources, plus the last source is primary research which when you go to the bottom of the pubmed page https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16131605 PMID 16131605] shows two strong letters doubting the results and criticizing the ethics. I don't see how that article establishes that Voronoff was right in his monkey testies transplants.  does state to be wary of primary sources in case the results aren't repeatable. Anyone can complain to a newspaper (as cited) but there's no indication of who complained, or of others showing support for that. That section appears to have been changed well over 6 months earlier, and wasn't great before. I quick search of his surname in pubmed brings up many commentaries and articles reflecting on his work, including whether it may have caused AIDS or not (probably not). Amousey (they/them pronouns) (talk) 16:39, 14 June 2020 (UTC)

 you were quite right; I did quite a bit of rewriting and puffery removing, incorporating newer secondary review sources as well; the sources there were not only poor, but poorly summarized, including synthesis.  SandyGeorgia (Talk)  17:13, 14 June 2020 (UTC)

Archiving

It's difficult to find a good balance between a short auto-archiving period like 10 days, when we may have to fetch prematurely archived discussions back out of the archive, and a long auto-archiving period like 30 days, when we may have to manually archive threads to stop the page growing too large. This is a page with high activity I count 25 new threads started in the last two weeks so I'm going to try a compromise period of 20 days. Can we see if that works well enough to reduce manual interventions either way? --RexxS (talk) 14:15, 12 June 2020 (UTC)
thank you RexxS (manual archiving is disruptive[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine&amp;action=history], yours is a better idea)--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 14:23, 12 June 2020 (UTC)
 20 is better than the older 10, but manual archiving of resolved threads is not difficult either ... let’s see if 20 works for a while. SandyGeorgia (Talk)  15:48, 12 June 2020 (UTC)
not in agreement, manual archiving as done today is disruptive if editors are relying on the bot/archive not a person who archives without consensus(that is being disruptive, lets hope it doesn't happen again)--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 16:06, 12 June 2020 (UTC)
I can not agree that manual archiving of long-finished discussions is disruptive. WhatamIdoing (talk) 03:42, 13 June 2020 (UTC)
Im not so certain everything that was archived yesterday was long-finished...IMO, thank you--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 15:03, 13 June 2020 (UTC)
 Ozzie10aaaa, the archiving days parameter was set to 10 until I updated it a few days ago to 30, because things were being archived too fast.  Rexx's 20 is a compromise, to see how things work. Nothing that I archived yesterday would not have been archived at the previous 10 days anyway, so nothing changed. Because I was the editor who upped the number of days, I took the responsibilty to archive those older than the previous 10 days. If you think something was prematurely archived, by all means, bring it back. The objective on a busy talk page is to make sure that things that are unresolved receive attention rather than getting lost amid things already addressed.  SandyGeorgia (Talk)  15:17, 13 June 2020 (UTC)
no worries, RexxS (is a very good administrator)and has set it to 20 days, thank you (hopefully when Doc James gets back he can mind this page)--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 15:48, 13 June 2020 (UTC)

You wrote &quot;hopefully when Doc James gets back he can mind this page&quot;.  I want to know why you think Doc James should be the person minding this page.  In fact, I want to know why any single individual should mind this page.  I think it belongs to the whole group:  you, me, SandyGeorgia, RexxS, Doc James, and anyone else who likes hanging out here.

It's our collective responsibility to mind this page. I feel that saying otherwise would be unfair in at least 2 ways: it would be unfair to us as a group and it would also be unfair to throw that responsibility at Doc James. Dr. Vogel (talk) 18:29, 14 June 2020 (UTC)

Watching all the pages

This is your occasional reminder that  exists, and that you can use it as an alternative to .  For example,  will give you a list of all the changes that have been made to any article that is linked in the COVID-19 article.

 It's a report of preliminary findings of a study. That's really not the sort of evidence we can use to make definite biomedical claims. However the research is interesting and the [http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2020-06-16-dexamethasone-reduces-death-hospitalised-patients-severe-respiratory-complications Oxford announcement] contains expert commentary which elevates it above the run-of-the-mill reporting like BBC news, I've tried to ameliorate some of the language used in those articles and I've replaced BBC news with the Oxford announcement.

My understanding is that the wider WP:MED community decided against using medical claims backed by preprints in the discussion at . The text added to the dexamethasone article about the use of it for COVID-19 is based essentially on a press release which is less useful than a preprint.  states &quot;Consensus among a limited group of editors, at one place and time, cannot override community consensus on a wider scale.&quot; Given that, why is it okay to add that information to the dexamethasone and Coronavirus disease 2019 articles among others? Whywhenwhohow (talk) 01:40, 18 June 2020 (UTC)
I think some editors are in a hurry to get any promising information posted right away, with the hope that we'll clean it all up to normal standards .  The middle source in that section, which is to https://www.gpni.co.uk/, might be more useful than the others, but I don't know what GPNI is, and the website declines to provide information about itself.  It doesn't even have so much as the organization's name in the terms of use.
On the subject, I've wondered whether it's really dexamethasone, or if any corticosteroid would have a similar benefit.  When (eventually) we get proper sources, we'll probably know whether it's  to put this in the specific article, or if it ought to be in a more general article. WhatamIdoing (talk) 03:01, 18 June 2020 (UTC)
 The GPNI seems to have been set up recently as a resource site for General Practitioners in Northern Ireland, but whether it has any official status is indeed [https://www.nominet.uk/whois/?query=gpni.co.uk unclear]. Nevertheless, it does contain online texts of some useful documents, for example https://www.gpni.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DEXAMETHASONE-IN-COVID-19.pdf which is a letter from the UK Chief Medical Officers and the Medical Director of NHS England. That source looks to me to meet our standards for MEDRS, so I expect it can be used to replace the press releases and news reports that editors have been attempting to use so far. --RexxS (talk) 15:49, 18 June 2020 (UTC)

Populate medical resources in disease articles with information from curated sources

The purpose of [https://www.ilae.org/journals/ilae-wikipedia the ILAE Wikipedia Epilepsy Project] () is to improve the coverage of epilepsy related articles on Wikipedia. This would involve tagging the existing articles, assessing their quality, making a to do list for those articles, making the changes, submitting them for evaluation by epilepsy experts, and to make further changes as needed. The scope will also extend to creation of new articles either using article drafts and new article review process or by overall following the process delineated above. You can learn further by reading [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bgAEmzs4q2TkmyO9mrgm-h6BKiaSGHTV4Jl2_dcr-uA/edit a more detailed project plan].

Secondary sources: Non-systematic reviews

How can we determine what counts as a non-systematic review? I usually use pubmed but many things are not in there, and a few articles have dubious categorization eg a potential secondary source classed by pubmed as &quot;Randomized controlled trial&quot; when it actually refers to one already conducted. I see many article with &quot;A review&quot; in part of the title that are clearly not systematic reviews.   
I've come across too many to list, but surely there are more places to check than pubmed? If it's peer reviewed and in an established non-predatory journal should these be classified as a secondary source due to not containing original research? If so are these classed as reviews as per ? 
   
Examples [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30522980/ 1-Scoping review not classed as review] [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28376571/ 2- text begins &quot;this review&quot;] [https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2015.00052/full 3 dubious hypothesis /review classed as review in Frontiers and pubmed]
-Also book chapters in a book by others that were previously published as primary sources - do these now class as secondary? Amousey (they/them pronouns) (talk) 14:33, 20 June 2020 (UTC)
For medical reviews, it would be quite unusual not to be &quot;in&quot; PUBMED, and searching for &quot;reviews&quot; and &quot;meta-analysis&quot; should give the secondary material which isn't systematic reviews. I would never user Frontiers journals for any non-mundane claims. Sometimes, on rare occasions, the PUBMED classification seems doubtful. Alexbrn (talk) 14:39, 20 June 2020 (UTC)
Review articles come in two types:  &quot;systematic&quot; and &quot;narrative&quot;.  You will be able to identify a systematic review because it will say something like &quot;We searched PubMed for keywords.  We found 103 articles, of which 12 met our criteria for inclusion.&quot;   Both types of reviews (also practice guidelines and textbooks) are treated equally under MEDRS.  You should , but they're all secondary sources.
The (near) opposite of &quot;review article&quot; is &quot;original paper&quot;.  You can identify original papers by the fact that they are reporting research for the first time, so they're describing research (e.g., number of patients enrolled, what they did to the participants, etc.)  There is no document type that means &quot;bad science&quot;.  You can have an excellent original paper (which MEDRS usually won't let you use for much) and a lousy review article (which MEDRS does accept).
For example, that paper that you describe as having a &quot;dubious hypothesis&quot; is a review article.  It is also from [https://www.scopus.com/sourceid/21100212316 one of the better-ranked neurology journals], even if it is published by Frontiers.  It is important that our own beliefs don't interfere with presenting all the relevant viewpoints.  Maybe there really is a dopamine problem in MS, and if more than one or two sources mention this, then the Wikipedia article should, too.  We don't have to present it as The Truth™, but we do have to present it as something that researchers are talking about. WhatamIdoing (talk) 21:48, 20 June 2020 (UTC)
 And that's why we have Research sections in many articles. I'm not keen to see our content opened up to every half-baked hypothesis that happens to get a couple of op-ed pieces written. --RexxS (talk) 22:00, 20 June 2020 (UTC)
I agree.  Also, since MS is heavily researched, it should be possible to find at least two sources for any idea that really needs to be mentioned in the article.  If you wanted to make a statement, for example, that fatigue in MS might have something to do with dopamine, then you could additionally cite , which comes from a [https://www.scopus.com/sourceid/16757 top-tier neurology journal] and which calls it &quot;a potentially highly relevant mechanism for fatigue&quot;. WhatamIdoing (talk) 05:30, 21 June 2020 (UTC)
Thank you all for those helpful and detailed replies. To see a review article on a hypothesis was somewhat odd to say the least. The Op-ed stuff is irrating when used to challenge widely accepted facts. Amousey (they/them pronouns) (talk) 11:43, 24 June 2020 (UTC)

Great work fixing up the draft. The original page came from a student in . I have just run into a couple articles from this group at NPP and there are some problems with them, mainly making medical claims without MEDRS sources, and using sources about the general topic of the film rather than sources that actually discuss the film itself. See e.g. Fasting (2017), Hepatitis Country. The articles from this group could use a closer look, some need various kinds of cleanup and some might have to go to AFD. Spicy (talk)

Medical film and book articles from this course to be checked
This list is from the courses at , , and .  I did not look at  or .Most of the course articles are medical-related films or books.  Many of the articles have already been deleted or redirected when notability was not established. Quite a few of the students have enrolled in three subsequent and similar courses to continue their work, and still have drafts in Draft or User space.  All need to be checked for MEDRS compliance, and dubious or unattributed medical opinions, but there are other cleanup needs. Some are named wrong and need to be moved, some have lots of uncited text, some have not established notability, some breach guidelines for writing synopses, some go off-topic, talk pages are not tagged with WProjects, some use primary sources incorrectly, most fail to base the articles on reviews of the subject and independent sources, opinions need attribution, etc. Almost all need Manual of Style cleanup.

I have asked  and  to join us here. I thought a central location for discussions would be more effective. WhatamIdoing (talk) 23:22, 15 June 2020 (UTC)
 Hello - I'm poking around from the books wikiproject. I'll see if I can improve some of these. I won't cross them off as &quot;done&quot; though, since I can't check for the medical side of things -- I'll just try to make them less work for when one of you takes a look.
The things I notice that are important from a books standpoint are mostly to do with the &quot;reviews&quot; section, which should really be &quot;reception&quot;. The basic 'rescue' work can be done by deleting promotional puffery. Material about reviews and accolades should never be sourced to the author's own website, always to the reviewing magazines. Most &quot;best book&quot; awards are not notable; it's prizes (with money!) that are actually competitive. The only non-prize I personally bother mentioning is if it was a NYT bestseller. (It can be annoying to find NYT bestseller placement-- search &quot;site:nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/&quot; &quot;book title&quot; and pick any week's listing to verify the basic fact of appearing on the list.) For reviews, I'll specify that a Kirkus review was a starred review if applicable, and mostly just say &quot;It was reviewed by X, Y, and Z&quot; with refs for each venue. That covers bookcrit and gives people a way to learn more, and I prefer &quot;underselling&quot; a book to &quot;overselling&quot; it. To write a slightly better reception section, quotes from reviews can be incorporated into a paragraph to highlight key positive and negative traits that the reviewers mention. ~ oulfis 🌸(talk) 02:36, 16 June 2020 (UTC)
* Hi! I was the Wiki Ed person for this course - some of the work that was moved live was not meant to be moved live, as it looked incomplete and I assumed that the student was not going to move it.

Followup
This course has been taught now for three years, and it does not appear that the professor is fully versed on Wikipedia editing or aware of the number of issues that others have been correcting.  The course will again be offered in the fall, at .  From the list above, it can be seen that there are numerous issues in this course's work, the most significant being:
* The students do not seem to understand that they need to first establish notability of the topic via independent, reliable sources-- that is, unrelated to the topic.
* Failing to do that, they then chunk in an excessively long plot summary, and then ...
* Add unrelated sources to that plot summary, such that the articles appear to meet notability when they do not.
* Often the sources added are to lend (false) support to medical statements, using primary sources that don't meet .
There are numerous other issues, and from looking at the course lists, it is apparent that a lot of their work must be deleted. Generally, there is puffery, incorrect use of , overly long plot summaries, lack of awareness of MEDRS, and lack of awareness of notability.  I just spent almost an hour doing some cleanup on a very short bio started by the professor,  at Laurence Zitvogel. The most successful student editing courses occur when the professor is engaged and understands basic guidelines and policy. , this course does not seem to be producing work that should be moved into Wikipedia mainspace.  Could you give us some assurance of some changes that will be made in the Fall 2020 course?  Would it be possible to make sure their work stays in Draft space? Many editors have spent much time cleaning up several years' work from this course, and it would seem that by now the same mistakes would not be occurring.  SandyGeorgia (Talk)  01:34, 26 June 2020 (UTC)
  I talked with  this afternoon, and for the Fall 2020 term, his students will keep their work in sandboxes and will be moved by Wiki Education staff where appropriate. Hopefully, this way we can address any of the above concerns before the work goes live. Thanks. Helaine (Wiki Ed) (talk) 22:11, 26 June 2020 (UTC)

H-GAPS User Group

There is a new Wikimedia  called the .  The name stands for &quot;Helping Give Away Psychological Science&quot;.  Many of our psych-related articles need improvement, so please welcome these editors if you encounter them.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 03:05, 18 June 2020 (UTC)
 I took a look at a few articles under their umbrella, and despair.  Just as we have finished cleaning up the film and book articles, there is enough in the articles from this group to occupy a month of work.  It would be nice to focus on cleaning up some dated and very high pageview articles.  WAID, there are primary studies sourcing treatment options which are refuted by secondary reviews, as an example. Of much lesser significiance, it would be good for them to know about  and the correct use of  (the DSM is a book and should be italicized, while many other things should not, and Dr. so-and-so is everywhere). But much more significant is the primary study issue ... might you be the person to best communicate with them? SandyGeorgia (Talk)  18:28, 18 June 2020 (UTC)
 There is also quite a problem at Eric Youngstrom, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eric_Youngstrom&amp;oldid=952519516 this version] with three COI contributors, unsupported text, puffery, and inappropriate use of sources (most of the sources are to his own bio, submitted to other websites, very little independent mention).  SandyGeorgia (Talk)  18:44, 18 June 2020 (UTC)
 And Mitch Prinstein.  Students creating bios for their professors seems fraught.  There is more. SandyGeorgia (Talk)  19:15, 18 June 2020 (UTC)
 With paid editing at Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology.   could you help me understand where the red-linked course description [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Education_noticeboard/Incidents/Archive_4#Course_needing_attention here went?]  I raised significant problems with this course for years, yet WMF has decided to make the participants an &quot;affiliate&quot;, even with COI and paid editing on board.  SandyGeorgia (Talk)  21:10, 18 June 2020 (UTC)

* Adding COI and unnecessary links to org where prof serves [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=UCLA_PTSD_Index&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=845629274]
There is much more: these are samples only.  I have been concerned for a number of years about the COIs with his course, and raised this years ago on the ENB.  There is a lot of citing their professors, writing about their professors, and promoting their professor and affiliated orgs. Why are the articles they edit not listed on their course pages so they can be checked?  could you elaborate what sort of screening process goes in to the “affiliate” application and approval process? Did WMF review their work?  The concern I have is that, while they were working as student editing projects, it was WikiEd staff responsibility to keep an eye on their work (I am unclear if that was done as articles are not listed on their course pages).  That supervision will presumably end now ... ??? ... yet I see indications of extensive COI editing. I do not think we have resources to track down all the problems, much less fix them. SandyGeorgia (Talk)  01:25, 19 June 2020 (UTC)

I think  handles that, so Rosiestep could probably answer any questions.  I think that for user groups (the most informal style of group), the process is fairly lightweight.  I assume that it would be possible for students to join the user group without taking the class, and the other way around. WhatamIdoing (talk) 04:18, 19 June 2020 (UTC)
 I do not understand why Wiki Ed deletes old course pages instead of redirecting them, nor why this group is no longer listing the articles they edit (the new group and the student editors are pretty much the same), nor whether Wiki Ed is still keeping an eye on them, but there are definitely still problems, and I am not sure what is next. I did find this [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine&amp;oldid=632435306#slew_of_student_postings very old post] here on Wt:med, and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:SandyGeorgia/arch101#Child_Bipolar,_and_evidence_based_medicine_editing this on my talk], but after that, articles edited are not listed.  It appears that the affiliations group does not require much at all, but one would hope COI editing would be a disqualifier. Perhaps this matter should go to COIN ???  Not sure what is next ... SandyGeorgia (Talk)  05:38, 19 June 2020 (UTC)
 Hello. Here are links regarding  and regarding the  itself. --Rosiestep (talk) 05:53, 19 June 2020 (UTC)
 In other words, not much in the way of requirements.  Do you consider COI? That page says, “Please be aware that if you do not meet the three criteria outlined above ... “, but lists two requirements.  So, , would you recommend the Conflict of Interest Noticeboard next, or is this something within your remit? SandyGeorgia (Talk)  06:14, 19 June 2020 (UTC)
 , yes, it is within the remit of AffCom to deal with potential issues of COI of a User Group. If you suspect potential COI, you may contact AffCom via email: affcom(_AT_)lists.wikimedia.org . Note, I have not read any of the comments on this talkpage other than where I've been pinged, so I have not formed any opinions on this matter. --Rosiestep (talk) 06:37, 19 June 2020 (UTC)
  I am not in the habit of using maillists for Wikipedia business, transparency is best, and samples of the COI concerns are listed above.  This is basically a group of student editors and their professor, whose past work has shown COI issues.  Discussing how to handle this openly is preferred, and how things are optimally  done on Wikipedia. SandyGeorgia (Talk)  07:02, 19 June 2020 (UTC)
  I am checking on whether this is within AffCom's remit and will circle back once I have an answer. --Rosiestep (talk) 15:52, 19 June 2020 (UTC)
 Thanks ever so much, Rosiestep, as I have been unsure what the next step is, considering the involvement of both Wiki Ed and WMF, along with incomplete use of the Wiki Ed course pages.  I will work up a hopefully clearer and more comprehensive list of the concerns to post here, and ping involved editors to the discussion once I've finished that (in a few hours).

Youngstrom (talk) 02:01, 25 June 2020 (UTC)
 Thanks, all who came to the meeting last night! We had more than 20 people attend, and have developed a plan to address the concerns on the Wikipedia pages. We have made a start on them, and will continue to work on them until resolved. I will add some thoughts and points of clarification here, too, over coming days. Because much of the growth of HGAPS has been outside of Wikipedia, I am realizing that better documentation within Wikipedia would be very helpful. We have been active over on Wikiversity for several years now, with that pivot being largely a result of taking feedback from Sandy&gt;Georgia (Talk circa 2015/2016 to heart. Specifically, the more technical content about measures got moved over to Wikiversity, any didactic information about how to use or do research with them is over there, and we have not been bringing cadres of new student editors to work on Wikipedia pages until we grew more skills. An unintendend consequence of that is that our early efforts have languished on Wikipedia. SandyGeorgia was right to call our attention to this, and HGAPS is sending some of the more experienced editors to work on them. Before conversations around this, I had not realized that editing activity on Wikiversity would not be salient to the Wikipedia editor community. I would welcome guidance about appropriate ways to document the activity better. Also, it may be helpful to note that HGAPS is a 501c3, recognized by the IRS in 2018, listed on Charity Navigator, and has affiliated chapters at several universities with a variety of projects. This, too, is an outgrowth of SandyGeorgia's earlier feedback about working on topics not directly related to faculty members' primary areas of research. I will add information about the timeline of development of HGAPS to the Wikiversity page. There is a freestanding site for the organization, too, [https://hgaps.org HGAPS.org].

Multiple issues are found in all of this courses's editing-- the most significant of which is COI. Some of the older issues have not been corrected and continue to occur.  The [https://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=H-GAPS_User_Group&amp;oldid=20170506#List_of_members list of members] populating the new User Group affiliate appear to all be students of professor Youngstom.  Because the Wiki Ed course pages do not list the articles edited, one must check the contribs of every single editor to discover the extent of articles edited.Listed below are samples of the kinds of problems occurring.  (Some of them are minor MOS issues, but nonetheless, after six years of course editing, it can be expected that this group will be aware of and correct these issues, to make for less cleanup needs from other editors.) Overall, I am concerned about whether this affiliate will be focused on improving the encyclopedia, or if their main focus will follow their course editing, which appears to be directed at including mention of their professor and his work.  Perhaps the next best step is to nofify the community of these issues via the COI noticeboard, so that others can become more involved in edits, both from the new affiliate, and from the courses.

 Thanks for taking the time to craft the detailed list of suggestions, Sandy! We'll take it up with Wiki Ed, and work on these recommendations in time. Everything we do is intended to be maximally transparent. On a related note, I (finally) graduated and moved on to a postdoctoral position! I changed my bio to reflect that. Any further consultation and input appreciated! Ongmianli (talk) 23:08, 19 June 2020 (UTC)
I took a look at  and . The Youngstrom article didn't look too bad, though rather resume-like. The awards and positions may need trimming if references cannot be found or they are not of enough importance to justify mention. The Society article needs a complete rewrite from better references, assuming it's notable enough to avoid deletion. I think it would help if these students would follow COI closely. --Hipal/Ronz (talk) 23:42, 19 June 2020 (UTC)
 I had mostly already cleaned up Eric Youngstrom.  Is anyone able to attend the zoom next Thursday (I cannot)?  Alternately,  do you have questions about any of the issues raised?  Besides the basics of COI and minor manual of style things, typically if something is worth mentioning, it will have been covered in a secondary review, and we generally avoid primary studies per . The Psych WikiProject is not very active, so feel free to pop in here with questions, or if you want an independent editor to view proposed text where there may be a COI. SandyGeorgia (Talk)  00:15, 20 June 2020 (UTC)
 Thanks for rounding back on this, SG. The COI, manual of style and secondary review comments make great sense. I had a question about recency versus quality of study with citing secondary articles. The most recent one can often (rather regularly, unfortunately) not be the best-quality/most exhaustive one. Given this, I am inclined to cite the one of better quality, instead of the most recent one, but also understand that recency is valued. Would be glad to hear your thoughts, and any others! Thanks again in advance! Ongmianli (talk) 14:36, 22 June 2020 (UTC)

  In general terms, I suspect that most of us would agree that most recent and highest quality are not always the same. Editor discretion, examination, discussion and consensus always come in to play in evaluating sources. But in this case (that is, considering there is considerable COI in most of the topics that have so far been edited by this group), you all would be best advised to seek wider consensus on &quot;best&quot; sources.  (In one case, I found recent secondary reviews being replaced by primary sources written by Youngstom. You could seek independent review of sources by posting to this talk page, for example.)  For example, in every assessment article, I have found source texted to Youngstrom's website! I have removed some, but there is still a lot that needs to be removed. Besides being a COI and MEDRS issue, this text could also raise copyright issues that are beyond my remit.  Directly copying text from a website probably involves some sort of need for a release-- not an area I understand well, and not something we need to explore anyway, since Youngstom's website should not be used to source these articles.  SandyGeorgia (Talk)  14:44, 22 June 2020 (UTC)
We often say that you should consider the last five years for heavily researched subjects, and maybe about 10 years for areas with little research.  This is what the article should be ; it does not mean that you must never use an older source or a primary source.
The underlying rule is that you want at least two &quot;review cycles&quot;.  To determine that directly, you need to know how long it takes for a paper get published, but you can think of it this way:  I publish a review article, and then you read my review article and write your own.  That's how long one &quot;cycle&quot; is.  The second cycle happens when a third person reads your review article and publishes their own.  The idea is that I put out my idea, you publish a paper correcting or expanding upon my idea, and the third writer can look at both of ours, and either agree or disagree.  Wikipedia editors want to consider all three of those reviews (and any other secondary sources published during that timeframe) so they can figure out the overall view in the field, rather than relying too much on a single paper.

Notes about Wiki Education course data
 A few notes about keeping track of courses and articles edited.
* The older courses from 2013-14 were part of the now-removed &quot;Education Program&quot; MediaWiki extension, but when we switched to using dashboard.wikiedu.org in 2015, we imported all the earlier Wiki Education courses. For example, [https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/courses/University_of_North_Carolina,_Chapel_Hill/PSYC500_-_Developmental_Psychopathology_(Fall_2014) the Fall 2014 Development Psychology course].
* You can see the full list of any instructor's courses on their dashboard.wikiedu.org user profile page, including the imported versions of any 2013-2014 course pages that were removed when the EP extension was disabled. For example, https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/users/Eyoungstrom
* The on-wiki mirror pages we have used for new courses since 2015 includes a table of &quot;assigned&quot; articles, which most courses use to document which articles each editor plans to work on. The dashboard.wikiedu.org course pages also keep track of all the articles edited during the course (whether or not they are assigned), and you can use that to find a full list of edited articles for any particular course. For example, [https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/courses/University_of_North_Carolina_at_Chapel_Hill/Helping_Giving_Away_Psychological_Science_(Spring_2017)/articles/edited articles edited by the Spring 2017 H-GAPS class].

 Thank you,  — just what the Dr ordered! SandyGeorgia (Talk)  18:17, 19 June 2020 (UTC)

 Hi, all, Thanks for looping me in. As many of you are aware, I have been trying to advocate for more engagement with Wikipedia and Wikiversity in various professional societies, and through founding HGAPS. The work has received a lot of attention in professional societies, and we have gotten a lot of underrepresented groups to start engaging with Wikipedia and Wikiversity at multiple universities. I would love an opportunity to talk through things together. A challenge with this is that I am still more skilled with email and Zoom than Wiki editing (though my skills are improving), and I know that some users will not use other media besides wikimedia to interact. I may be slower (and clumsier) responding in this format. Preparing the user group application was instructive, as it got me thinking about how much of the activity we are doing to increase engagement is not visible within Wiki, and I would welcome coaching and guidance about improving our efforts at that. Everything we are doing is intended to be transparent, and anything that isn't, please assume good faith and help us learn how to document better. With warmest regards in the meantime, Eric Youngstrom, PhD Prof. Eric A. Youngstrom (talk) 18:18, 19 June 2020 (UTC)
 Prof Youngstrom, most of my concerns are laid out above.  Hopefully this list will provide all you need.  Please feel free to ask questions here.  SandyGeorgia (Talk)  18:22, 19 June 2020 (UTC)
 Yes, thanks for the detail. The next HGAPS meeting is Thursday 6-8 pm EDT. You and others are welcome to attend. We could use that as a &quot;train the trainers&quot; session; that would get the recommendations implemented most quickly. We also are working on written checklists and protocols to help new members learn best practices, so this is an excellent time to get consultation and input. My email is eay@unc.edu; I am happy to correspond with you or anyone interested to help get things elevated to the next level. Please let me know what else would be helpful, and best regards to all! -Eric Prof. Eric A. Youngstrom (talk) 19:04, 19 June 2020 (UTC)
  is that a virtual or real meeting?  If virtual, perhaps one of the Wiki Ed or WMF staff can join to review the list above with you all?  That would probably go a long ways towards resolving any issues. SandyGeorgia (Talk)  19:11, 19 June 2020 (UTC)
Virtual. We are using Zoom to connect people, breakout rooms for specific projects and teams. It lets us screenshare as well. We have been using email and Googledocs for agenda, too. Could try using an Etherpad for the meeting. Happy to send whatever details are helpful. Let me know! Prof. Eric A. Youngstrom (talk) 20:58, 19 June 2020 (UTC)
*In my experience, projects do not go well when at least one of the people involved does not have extensive experience with both wikipedia conventions, both in writing articles, and in discussing them. Besides the evidence of COI collected above, the overall quality of the articles varies widely--some are the merest introductions, that do not even discuss the validation of the test, or stateclearly what is being meausred . It's the expected convention that discussion regarding any WP article be conducted on enwiki. It's the required convention that a new article be started by a new user in draft space, not main space.   I think this group needs to justify its presence here by bringing at least some of the existing articles up to GA-class standards. This is not a field where we need low quality articles. 
And as for COI, it is reckless and inappropriate for a class to write articles about faculty at its own university. Way back we once had a member of a department in another field  having a class  writing articles about the professors in the same department.  
I'm also concerned about the interface between psychology and medicine. The article we are discussing would clearly fall within medicine--not all topics would. 
For the articles on media mentioned in a previous section, I also want to remind prospective editors about the existence of . Medicine properly has its own high standards about presenting information about living  or recently deceased people, and so do we--they both have to be followed.

This is not an area I am well enough versed in, so I have pinged in Diannaa.  See example at Screen for child anxiety related disorders and this discussion at .  There are multiple (dozens?) articles that contain tables cited to &quot;Table from Youngstrom et al., unpublished, extending Hunsley &amp; Mash, 2008&quot;. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Screen_for_child_anxiety_related_disorders&amp;oldid=963465287#Reliability Sample]). I have reverted this content in only some of those articles, for two reasons:
# We don't cite unpublished research on Wikipedia, and
# There may be copyright concerns; that is, is it your intent to release the rights to this work?  If so, I believe some sort of paperwork may be needed, but Diannaa can address that.
Now, Emmagch has reverted that work back into the SCARED article linked above, with the statement that the work is from Husley and Mash.  Am I understanding correctly that it is the format only that is from Hunsley and Mash? And that students are adding the parameters, citing them to other sources?  If I am understandgint that correctly, are we not getting into  here?  We should be basing encyclopedic content on secondary reviews, not building original research.  SandyGeorgia (Talk)  15:05, 26 June 2020 (UTC)
Trying to be helpful -- the rubric is from the book (and they list the criteria for excellent, good, adequate). Chapter authors in the published book used the same table structure to organize the information for their respective reviews. What we were trying to accomplish is (a) not violating copyright, (b) providing structure to organize the information, (c) that is organized in the same way that the current generation of handbooks in the field are using. This makes the editing easier for new editors (providing scaffolding, and making it easier to integrate the information from high quality secondary sources), and also easier for the reader, having a lot of information distilled into a table. The Hunsley &amp; Mash is one of the most respected texts in the area. In full disclosure, Hunsley, Mash, and Youngstrom (me) are aware of each other's work and harmonizing our approaches. The older version of the table that was cited to me was a clumsy effort to avoid CopyVio on Hunsley &amp; Mash, while building scaffolding to have the edits harmonize with their book as well as with other projects that are in progress. Any pro tips about how to accomplish the goal of similar structure and organization, and source appropriately, are very welcome. Getting this right will establish the template that we can use to fix the other pages. Thank you! Prof. Eric A. Youngstrom (talk) 15:43, 26 June 2020 (UTC)
 All right, , let’s hope more people will weigh in here.  If you could supply your best updated example from one article, that would give us a basis for discussion, to make sure all is in order before you proceed with a templated format to multiple articles.  It sounds like you have understood and attempted to address some of my concerns, but I am not yet clear on SYNTH or COPYVIO or unpublished research wrt the tables, so a concrete example would help. We should be reporting what existing secondary reviews say, rather than building that data here.  I am unsure if Wikiversity is more lax ... and for other researchers to be aware is not the same as granting copyright release. SandyGeorgia (Talk)  17:51, 26 June 2020 (UTC)

  I think that it would be helpful we can understand where the content of the tables come from specifically. Looking at the &quot;Reliability&quot; table, I assume that the headings and the content of the first column ('norms', etc.) come from Hunsley &amp; Mash (2018). What I'm not sure of where the contents of the second column ('Good', etc.) come from. My apologies that I'm not able to visit libraries at present to check for myself. If the contents of the second column come from the students' own assessments, then it's  and you'll need to think again. If they come from Hunsley &amp; Mash, then I think the issue shifts to the amount of content we can quote verbatim from a copyrighted work without exceeding a &quot;fair use&quot; allowance. In my opinion, we're probably within that allowance even if the second column comes from Hunsley &amp; Mash because it's not a , but I would defer to 's opinion on that.
 I would apply exactly the same considerations to the &quot;Validity&quot; table. I've cleaned them up a bit, principally to make them easier for screen readers. --RexxS (talk) 18:15, 26 June 2020 (UTC)
Hi RexxS. It's impossible for me to assess the copyright concern without having access to the source documents so that I can see what-all is identical. : There are eight articles that use the citation &quot;Table from Youngstrom et al., extending Hunsley &amp; Mash, 2008&quot; and they are as follows: , , , , , , , and . — Diannaa (talk) 20:00, 26 June 2020 (UTC)
 Thanks, Diannaa (there were others I already removed).  SandyGeorgia (Talk)  20:29, 26 June 2020 (UTC)
 Follow up:  this discussion has [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Screen_for_child_anxiety_related_disorders&amp;oldid=964871642#Discussion continued here,] and could use additional feedback.  , typing from a real keyboard now, my concern was that you might explain in the event we need some sort of copyright release from Eyoungstom, but I believe (unsure?) we have moved beyond that point now in the discussion.
