Suggestion

To whoever designed and now maintains the bots that create standard forms of citations in the biomedical and associated articles (and so can alter them):

You should consider a change to the bot that adds a space after the pipes for each field. Absent a change of that sort, multi-author papers present those and subsequent fields as a run-on mass. This makes the markup appear unnecessarily extended by lines of white space, with breaks that only appear where spaces advantitiously appear in the markup or fields. It can look repeatedly like this:
 
 journal|last1=Smith|first1=AB|last2=Jones|first2=CD|last3=Brown|first3=EF...
This is not a matter of annoyance with the tech. The extending of the citation parts of the text (with long blocks of white space) means, when editing articles that have lots of sources, each with lots of authors, the text being edited that appears in the viewing field is reduced, so that more scrolling is required to move through the text being edited. (This is like a minor variation on what we have to deal with in articles that use vertical rather than horizontal cite... templates.)

Adding a space after each pipe would allow them to wrap more consistently on the screen (ensure that there are no breaks in the citations as they appear in markup), and so allow more text to be visible on screen while editing. 

Thank you in advance, for anyone that can make this small change to the programming of the bots that generate these otherwise very nice citations.  () 20:44, 26 January 2022 (UTC)

Thank you for these links. The last of them, , makes my case as well, more succinctly, and in better WP-speak. (And it extends it to cover another issue, one I share, that of presenting cite template fields in orders that are non-intuitive, which makes filling and checking them for completeness all the harder.) And I understand the  statement regarding controversy, and would make two points. First, a change to the bot doing the citations now would improve all future citations appearing as a result of its work, and this should not be controversial. Second, creation of a cosmetic bot that adds the space to old bot-generated citations, while potentially controversial, would (assuming proper, thorough testing), be something that could be run a page at a time until it was clear it would not be disruptive (or give unexpected issues). After that, running it broadly would improve the &quot;edit-ability&quot; of all articles with bot-generated citations, for the reasons clearly expressed by . Challenges acknowledged, I think that would be a valuable contribution, and hope it happens despite the potential for the controversy  describes. [And I can appreciate that it might be hard to write another bot to improve appearances from the past work of citation bots—that there are various challenges in trying to script a thorough, once-through replacement of all cite-only pipes with a pipe-and-space (only when the pipe is followed by a non-space character), from prior scripting and scrum management experience.] I hope someone can take on both challenges—changing the current bot, and doing something to improve already existing citations. All the best.  () 21:25, 26 January 2022 (UTC)
Single spaces are not that difficult to code for.  In fact, the code exists.  Just change the settings in  and the visual editor will &quot;fix&quot; the spacing whenever new citations are added plus whenever any existing ref gets &quot;touched&quot; during an edit (but it won't mass-change all of them on the page, just the ones you engage with). 
The problem is primarily on the social side.  People complain when the diffs are harder to read.  
TemplateData is a one-size-fits-all system.  This change would require a community-wide consensus.  () 23:21, 26 January 2022 (UTC)

Medical-related Biography of Living Person

I am one of only a few editors actively working on the BLP of Martin Kulldorff, one of the authors of the Great Barrington Declaration.
Because Kulldorff is a controversial figure, involved with a controversial topic, in a politicized pandemic, it is difficult to wade through all of the wiki rules involved (BLP, MEDRS, etc...) and maintain a neutral article that is fair to the subject (Kulldorff) and the mainstream views of some of his ideas.

Sourcing is one of the key areas of contention between the current group of editors. Most recently  a statement placed in the lead of the biography: 

&quot;In 2020, Kulldorff was a co-author of the Great Barrington Declaration, which advocated lifting COVID-19 restrictions on lower-risk groups with the impossible aim of keeping vulnerable people safe from the virus.&quot;

I contend that the clause &quot;impossible aim of keeping vulnerable people safe from the virus&quot; is  because the statement is;

&quot;...information that relates to (or could reasonably be perceived as relating to) human health&quot; and specifically, it qualifies as &quot;Population data and epidemiology.&quot;

Is that a correct interpretation of BMI in this context?

This is also my first BLP to edit and the first time I've waded into articles pertaining to medicine—so thank you in advance for your comments and patience!

 () 23:18, 8 February 2022 (UTC)
The &quot;Great Barrington Declaration&quot; (GBD) Is a  eugenics-adjacent political text which has been roundly condemned by scientists. Of course it relates to human health so by a  of BMI (which is not a  but intended to help) none of the concepts in the GBD could even be mentioned in Wikipedia without a MEDRS source. There is a desire to mention the GBD at the Martin Kulldorff article and in particular its  goal of &quot;protecting the vulnerable&quot; while letting COVID-19 rip through the rest of the population. As Robert Lechler wrote, this very idea is &quot;unethical and simply not possible&quot;.[https://acmedsci.ac.uk/more/news/navigating-covid-19-through-the-volume-of-competing-voices]
To present the GBD as some kind of valid respectable scientific alternative would be to fall afoul of  and  (both parts of NPOV, which is core policy). Therefore, if its precepts are mentioned they must be called out, and for this purpose a source of  may be used, since  the GBD is obviously not MEDRS itself. It doesn't really matter which source is used for calling-out purposes, but yes Science-Based Medicine is a viable choice. Another option is not to mention the idea behind the GBD at all in Kulldorff's article, because then they wouldn't need to be qualified.
The situation is analogous to many other types of fringe medicine where there is a nonsense concept (drinking diluted bleach to cure cancer) not commented on in MEDRS sources. In such cases  of sourcing allows Wikipedia to find some knowledge to reflect.  () 02:33, 9 February 2022 (UTC)
I did not post here to rehash or revisit the  on the appropriate talk page and I don't think it is constructive to do so (we need to keep that discussion centralized). 
Rather, I am seeking an answer to the question above, which is simply; Is the statement BMI or not. I believe hope this is an appropriate forum to discuss that.
 () 02:59, 9 February 2022 (UTC); edited 03:11, 9 February 2022 (UTC)
@, that's a complex sentence.  The first clause, &quot;In 2020, Kulldorff was a co-author of the Great Barrington Declaration&quot;, is definitely not biomedical information.  The second (that the document advocated for something) is probably not biomedical information.  If it were, then you couldn't write sentences like &quot;He believed the cancer was caused by a lack of sleep&quot; without first proving that there was scientific evidence that his belief was correct.
I assume you think that this description is unfair, i.e., that it would somehow be possible to remove public health restrictions from low-risk people without any of those low-risk people spreading the virus to the high-risk people in their households, at their workplaces, in the store, etc.  Since we haven't been able to do this even with various restrictions (such as banning infected people from attending events, going to the store, etc.), I'm not sure why any rational person would think that it would be possible with no restrictions.  () 03:25, 10 February 2022 (UTC)
, thank you for the reply. 
I agree that the first clause is not BMI. I am not, however, claiming unfairness of the second statement, nor am I arguing anything related to my personal opinion of how to control the virus. 
My contention is with Gorski's statement that is used to support the clause in question:

I contend that Gorski's statement—and by extension the clause inserted in the BLP—is BMI regardless of my feelings for it, for the GB Declaration, or Kulldorff himself. It is a statement regarding  and that qualifies it as . As BMI, it must comply with , which requires &quot;third-party published secondary sources&quot; such as &quot;academic and professional books written by experts in the relevant fields.&quot; Gorski does not cite any sources for the statement and he is not an expert in the relevant field of epidemiology.
[https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/editorial-staff/david-h-gorski-md-phd-managing-editor/ David Gorski] is an oncologist specializing in breast cancer surgery. He is not an expert in epidemiology. Therefore his statement should not be used as supporting evidence for this clause in the wiki article. 
I contend that if there is a -compliant source to support the clause &quot;...with the impossible aim of keeping vulnerable people safe from the virus&quot; then it should be used instead of the SBM article or the clause should be removed immediately as contentious material per : &quot;Contentious material about living persons (or, in some cases, recently deceased) that is unsourced or poorly sourced—whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable—should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion.&quot;
To illustrate that I am not editing with a specific POV, I'll tell you that I recently proposed this statement in the  as a way to avoid the use of BMI:
&quot;In 2020, Kulldorff was a co-author of the Great Barrington Declaration, which advocated lifting COVID-19 restrictions on lower-risk groups while adopting measures to protect the most vulnerable. The Great Barrington Declaration has been characterized as &quot;fringe epidemiology&quot; and not mainstream science.&quot;
And again, my goal here is simply to determine if there is consensus that the clause is BMI. It should not matter what my opinion is on its fairness nor should it matter what others believe my motives to be. Gorski's statement can be evaluated on its own, in the context of the applicable wiki policies. 
 () 04:08, 10 February 2022 (UTC)
By your  reading of BMI you'd need a MEDRS source to invoke the concept of &quot;measures to protect the most vulnerable&quot; - and this is the nub of it, since this concept is like the famed &quot;no-pee lane in a swimming pool&quot;. It's logical nonsense, multiple scientists have said so, and Wikipedia needs to reflect that. If however you can find a stronger source that Gorski or Lechler that would be fine too. What we cannot do is air bogus ideas in article space as though they were legitimate because of , which is core policy and non-negotiable.  () 04:50, 10 February 2022 (UTC)
 I'd be careful with the assertion that it is logical nonsense rather than empirically nonsense, particularly as we move from a pandemic phase to an endemic phase. If you look at the long-standing policy for chicken pox in the UK, for example, this is precisely one of allowing spread amongst the young - with the intention of building immunity - while shielding the vulnerable (with vaccinations for them and their family). Chicken pox is not COVID: it is endemic, immunity is potentially more &quot;sterilizing&quot;, and we have the opportunity to have people acquire immunity in their childhood, but argument of the logical impossibility of immunity would have to distinguish this policy or assert that the decision making for a good 30 years in the UK was not just wrong but logically absurd. Endemicity and sterlizing immunity and the existence of a vaccine, seem like good distinctions, but COVID appears to be reaching endemicity and vaccines now exist. Similar arguments apply to how flu vaccines are used, though I am less convinced that the policy of herd immunity through infection is as deliberate in this case. We should not allow accurate biases from the beginning of the pandemic to prevent us from accurately following the literature towards its end.  () 13:14, 11 February 2022 (UTC)
About 20 kids in the UK die every year from chickenpox, and hundreds end up in the hospital, some with lifelong disability as a result.  Widespread vaccination would prevent about 90% of those deaths, plus about 90% of the hospitalizations for complications.  Maintaining a policy that results in ~18 unnecessary pediatric deaths every year is not what I would call &quot;shielding the vulnerable&quot;.
There are complexities:  chickenpox vaccines probably do result in a small-to-medium-size increase in shingles risk among older adults.  Flu vaccines in kids prevent primarily their grandparents' deaths rather than their own.  Those preventable deaths might turn out to be the right choice (although I tend to doubt it).  What I object to is adopting a policy that is known to result in more severe illness and more deaths among vulnerable people while pretending that the policy is protecting them.  If the correct tradeoff is an extra 18 little graves each year, then the policy maker needs to own those costs.  () 17:28, 11 February 2022 (UTC)
, I think your figures are a little high. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1122524/ This paper] (which isn't very recent) shows around 20 deaths but only a few of those were children. The risk of increased shingles cases can be offset somewhat by a shingles vaccination program (UK already offers this age 70+ but that could be extended) and will only last for as long as there are people alive who caught chickenpox. There is another risk, though, which is to shift the age at which one gets chickenpox from infancy to adulthood. Then it is a much more serious disease and potential hazard for a baby if the mother catches it while pregnant. [https://www.dovepress.com/varicella-zoster-virus-vaccines-an-update-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-ITT This paper] seems to offer an up-to-date review. It says &quot;if vaccination coverage is maintained between 30% and 70% for a long time, the shift in the age of infection can lead to an increase in morbidity and mortality in high-income countries&quot; and later &quot;in countries where varicella represents a major public health problem, WHO recommends taking into consideration the introduction in pediatric immunization programs, provided that at least an 80% coverage rate is achieved.&quot; So the challenge then is to get it combined with other vaccines and accepted as part of the routine program with very high take-up. If one only got a 60% take-up, say, then that's a lot of people catching chickenpox as adults, and that's no fun at all. -- ° 20:16, 11 February 2022 (UTC)
I took that number from a news source, which says [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/may/02/the-chickenpox-party-is-over-as-scientists-call-for-uk-vaccine-rollout &quot;hundreds of children are badly affected every year in the UK, with around 20 deaths&quot;].  This matches other recent lay sources, e.g., [https://patient.info/news-and-features/should-your-child-have-the-chickenpox-vaccine &quot;We know that up to 20 - often previously healthy - children every year die from chickenpox in the UK,&quot; explains Professor Judy Breuer, professor of virology and head of Division of Infection and Immunity at UCL. &quot;In addition, a significant number will get really severe secondary skin infections like streptococcus which, in rare cases, can cause the flesh-eating necrotising fasciitis.&quot;]  However, it does not match [https://www.ons.gov.uk/aboutus/transparencyandgovernance/freedomofinformationfoi/childdeathsandhospitalisationsinvolvingcovid19andchickenpox this recent source], which is limited to England and Wales (so missing ~11% of the UK's population, I think?).  () 21:21, 11 February 2022 (UTC)
That first quote could be read ambiguously: are the 20 deaths in children? I wonder if there's been an assumption that chickenpox is a childhood disease, and the overall death figure has been assumed to be for children. But then, your other quote is from a professor of virology and I'm just a random person on the internet, so a bit rude of me to suggest they are wrong. The ONS figures go by the ICD code on death certificate. Possibly this is missing cases where chickenpox is a complicating factor in a death? It would be more comforting if the vaccine wasn't a live virus with a very small risk of reactivating as shingles. While that does seem to be mainly a problem for children with leukaemia, it is yet another factor that could discourage vaccination. I wonder if the &quot;I prefer to get my immunity naturally&quot; meme that has taken hold during Covid is a problem for any chickenpox vaccination programme? -- ° 15:20, 12 February 2022 (UTC)
When the chickenpox vaccine was new in the US, I heard third-hand about mothers (it always seemed to be mothers, not fathers) wondering whether natural immunity was better.  I have not heard that for maybe 20 years now.  I think it might take a couple of years for people to adjust their expectations.  Pre-vaccine, I think parents expected to spend a week or two dealing with a miserable, scabby, itchy, feverish child (and then for the other kids in the house to fall sick just about the time the first one is recovering).  It was just inevitable.  After the vaccine became normal (it's been mandated here, for any child over the age of 1, in childcare or school for so long that the first toddlers vaccinated under the mandate are old enough to have their own children now), I think parents expect to not experience chickenpox.  There were just a couple of years in between, during the transition, when I heard people talking about it.  The uptake is very high now.  In California, about 98% of five year olds met the vaccination requirements for chickenpox (that figure is pre-pandemic and includes medically documented evidence of immunity), which was the highest rate of any vaccine.  () 19:25, 12 February 2022 (UTC)
Is it MMRV? Combined with MMR? If so, that's impressive figures for all those diseases. Our MMR stats are [https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/nhs-immunisation-statistics/england---2020-21 just below the 95% target]. We don't generally do vaccine mandates in the UK (the Covid one for NHS staff looks like it is about to be repealed, but too late for the care workers who already lost their jobs). -- ° 20:44, 12 February 2022 (UTC)
MMRV seems to be a popular choice, but I believe it's possible to get each thing separately.  The measles vaccination rate is almost as high.
The mandate seems to work:  either your child is vaccinated, or your child doesn't go to school (or daycare).  If you have a sufficiently good reason (e.g., leukemia), then your child can go to school, but you have to get a doctor to sign off on that reason.  Merely requiring the parents to schedule a doctor's appointment and get a signed form seems to have substantially reduced the number of claimed exemptions.  () 17:41, 13 February 2022 (UTC)
&quot;It's impossible to stop the virus&quot; is probably biomedical information.  &quot;This declaration said it would do the impossible&quot; is primarily a statement about the document's contents, not about whether this is actually impossible.  But if you are that concerned about it, then there is a simple solution.  The same source quotes an epidemiologist who calls it &quot;ridiculous&quot; instead.  Maybe slightly re-write it?  &quot;They advocated lifting COVID-19 restrictions on lower-risk groups, with the ridiculous belief that it would then be possible to keep vulnerable people safe from the virus.&quot;
The bottom line is that there is no way to make this sound sensible while accurately describing it.  They proposed an approach that was guaranteed to result in the preventable deaths of vulnerable people.  It's one thing to say &quot;My individual right to spread germs is more important than anything else, and anyway, I'm not my brother's keeper, so I don't care who dies as long as nobody's bossing me around&quot;.  Or they could have pointed out that there are formulas for comparing different types of harms, and that they guessed that the balance was in the wrong direction, so someone should do the research and figure out if it was time to worry more about things like the mental health of teenagers and young adults than about the ability of their elders to stay alive.  But that's not what they did.  Instead, they tried to pretend that people could spread even more germs than they already were, and that some unspecified program or power would somehow keep the virus from killing vulnerable people.  This is ridiculous, and impossible, and stupid.  Or perhaps it's absolutely brilliant, if you're assessing it purely in PR terms instead of looking at whether it's a rational and self-consistent proposal.  Tell people what they want to hear, and don't worry about whether it's true.  () 06:27, 10 February 2022 (UTC)

I think we are getting closer to a consensus here that the statement is probably BMI and given that it's for a BLP we should be extra cautious and get it right. 

It would be extremely helpful to get additional comments on this question, especially from more editors with strong experience in medical BLPs as well as editors with expertise in medical matters, especially COVID-19, as I am new to editing BLPs and medicine-related pages and the politics of the issue are making things difficult.

I see four editors (including you) in that discussion.  One of them is Alex, who doesn't think it's BMI.  Another is , who writes under a subsection heading
Not BMI
that it &quot;doesn't require WP:MEDRS&quot;.  The third is @, who wants to make the sentence clearer &quot;without changing the content/balance significantly&quot;.  The only person in the discussion who is openly advocating for treating the description of the document as biomedical information is you.  In fact, it looks to me like pretty united opposition to your proposal.  Which comment in the discussion makes you think anyone else is agreeing with you on that point?    () 20:24, 10 February 2022 (UTC)
I'm not referring to the description of the document. 
The discussion at the talk page lost the plot and that's why I came here; in hopes that this group could disconnect the politics of &quot;but muh rights&quot; vs &quot;the pandemic of the sullied&quot; and we could evaluate the statement made on SBM. That was the original post here and that was the original post at . In no way did I conceal, obscure, or misrepresent the full context of the discussion being had there. 
In both discussions (the talk page and here), people have retreated to their camps, signaled to their teams and have taken an ideological stance by assuming editors' intent before evaluating the quality of a source, as if to say 'before I decide if this is BMI, how are you going to use that decision?'
The heading &quot;Not BMI&quot; was placed there by me to organize the discussion. Below that heading you can see that I was seeking to understand why  thinks it is not BMI. They have since clarified their position and said the clause likely needs to conform to  or should be clearly attributed to Gorski using &quot;alleged.&quot; I have no problem with either of those solutions.
I said &quot;I think we are getting closer to a consensus here that the statement is probably BMI...&quot; The word &quot;here&quot; meant in , in which you have said:

If the opinion &quot; ...it’s impossible to protect the vulnerable from a virus that’s rapidly spreading among the entire population...&quot; is shared by  many scientists, as  asserts, it should be easy to get a solid, third-party published secondary source that quotes an expert in the relevant field making the claim. Doing that will solve this problem. 
And to restate the problem; an Oncologist who specializes in breast cancer is not an expert in the relevant field of epidemiology and therefore to conform with  the source should not be used as it currently is. 
 () 23:37, 10 February 2022 (UTC)
Well Gorski specializes in quackery, grift and pseudomedicine so is perfect to comment on the GBD. Your mistake is to think this is some kind of legitimate epidemiology which requires a weighty rebuttal. No. This is the whole point of  for fringe material.  () 06:46, 11 February 2022 (UTC)
I think there's also a problem with assuming that &quot;the document proposes something impossible&quot; is the same as writing &quot;it's impossible&quot;.  What's in the article is an accurate description of the document's contents, rather than a description of COVID.  () 17:09, 11 February 2022 (UTC)
There are two important points we should be focusing on to determine the right course of action:
1. Writing with neutrality and an impartial tone mean wiki contributors don't make judgements on what is accurate. Rather, we describe a dispute. 
2. Gorski is clearly writing &quot;it's impossible.&quot; That is a direct quote, which is a statement about epidemiology that he is attributing to unnamed &quot;epidemiologists and public health scientists.&quot; 
I am disputing the &quot;source-ability&quot; of Gorski's statement, not the accuracy of his statement. Because he made a statement that likely amounts to BMI, it carries different sourcing requirements by Wiki policy. One way to avoid that is to state the fact that Gorski said it. To paraphrase an example; 'Kulldorff co-authored the GBD and Gorski says its goals are impossible.' That form is neutral and impartial and not something I would dispute. 

I sound like a broken record at this point but I am not disputing that the GBD represents a fringe and controversial position. I am also not disputing that if contributors mention the GBD they should not give it undue weight, as it is a fringe and controversial position. 
I am not an epidemiologist. Therefore I can not judge the accuracy of a claim about epidemiology. I can judge the accuracy of whether Gorski made the claim or not. That subtle difference is what writing with neutrality is all about.

Unrelated to potential BMI

A key problem here is that your arguments are based on the idea that there is a &quot;dispute&quot; about the GBD. The principal aim of the GBD (as with climate denial) was to create the fake narrative that there is such a dispute, that there are &quot;two camps&quot; of scientists when in reality there are not.[https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2021/09/13/covid-19-and-the-new-merchants-of-doubt/] As with climate denial this then gives those with certain interests a talking point for their campaigns.

We  but as it happens (and you keep ignoring this point) Science-Based Medicine is an excellent source for fringe medicine, grift and pseudoscience of which the GBD is a quintessential example.

 In the interest of staying focused on this specific discussion (regarding ), I think it would be better if you move your comment above (dated 03:28, 12 February 2022 (UTC)) to the Kulldorff talk page, as it does not address the question of BMI at all. That way we can remain focused on the topic here and not further devolve into even greater confusion as to what is the question we're trying to answer. 

Once you do so, I'll clean up (remove) this new section. 

 () 05:26, 12 February 2022 (UTC)
No, because it is relevant. A problem is that you don't see that. The GBD's &quot;goals&quot; are not biomedical information so their rebuttal isn't either, it's just an application of Hitchen's razor to nonsense. This whole discussion about BMI is a canard, especially when we have core policy that cannot be wikilawyered away.  () 06:52, 12 February 2022 (UTC)
For clarity, I will re-state what I understand you to be saying. 
You are asserting that because the GBD is fringe, contributors need not abide by the core policy of neutrality when describing fringe antithesis or the mainstream thesis. And anything used to counter fringe is also not governed by any wiki policies because...fringe. 
Is that a fair assessment of your position? 
And to make sure you are aware,  will remain open unless you explicitly decline. 
 () 08:00, 12 February 2022 (UTC)
I don't think I needed to &quot;assert&quot; the GBD is , because that is surely a given which nobody will dispute (unless you do?). It's not an &quot;antithesis/thesis&quot; situation because that would be a classic violation of . Scientifically, the GBD presents no &quot;thesis&quot;: it is just political nonsense which has been dismissed/condemned by all sane scientific sources (there's a reason why it was done as a PR stunt and not published in the scientific literature). It precisely because of this that we must apply NPOV and make sure it is prominently described as the BS it is.  () 08:09, 12 February 2022 (UTC)
About &quot;&quot;:  No.  Whenever a subject (GBD in this case, but anything) is fringe-y, contributors must abide by the core policy of neutrality, which requires articles to describe nonsense as being nonsense.
One of the common misunderstandings of NPOV is thinking that &quot;neutral&quot; means the Wikipedia article shouldn't take sides.  That is, people think that the Wikipedia article must sound like it has no opinion.  .  Instead, the NPOV policy defines a neutral article as one that accurately represents the views of reliable sources.  If reliable sources are using words like &quot;impossible&quot; and &quot;ridiculous&quot; to describe something, then a neutral Wikipedia article also uses words like &quot;impossible&quot; and &quot;ridiculous&quot; to describe it.  This is true regardless of subject matter.  We write about &quot;ridiculous&quot; children's stories and &quot;impossible&quot; optical illusions, just as much as we write about  &quot;ridiculous and impossible&quot; assertions.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=ridiculous+impossible&amp;title=Special:Search&amp;profile=advanced&amp;fulltext=1&amp;ns0=1 It looks like 1300 existing Wikipedia articles use both of those words].  () 19:49, 12 February 2022 (UTC)
The  requires due weight and for editors to describe the dispute, not engage in the dispute. Specifically:
&quot;An explanation of how scientists have reacted to pseudoscientific theories should be prominently included.&quot; [emphasis added]
The example provided in Wikipedia's established  is Stanley Meyer's water fuel cell

The key statement that makes the above neutral is &quot;Meyer's claims about his &quot;Water Fuel Cell&quot; and the car that it powered were found to be fraudulent by an Ohio court in 1996.&quot;
A biased version would be similar to this:
&quot;The water fuel cell is a technical design of a &quot;perpetual motion machine&quot; created by American Stanley Allen Meyer (August 24, 1940 – March 20, 1998). Meyer claimed that an automobile retrofitted with the device could use water as fuel instead of gasoline. Anyone selling a water fuel cell is a fraud.&quot;
The change in the last sentence is what makes the second version biased and the first version neutral. 
 () 22:59, 13 February 2022 (UTC)
There is no scientific dispute on this point.  Therefore, there is no dispute to describe.
There is a scientific and a philosophical dispute about whether to value the lives of vulnerable people more than the non-fatal harms of other people.  There is no actual scientific dispute about whether highly contagious diseases will spread from the &quot;healthy&quot; people to their &quot;vulnerable&quot; household members.  () 18:09, 14 February 2022 (UTC)
To write neutrally on Wiki, contributors describe the dispute rather than to engage in it. For me, understanding that point clicked when I read part of the ; the section titled , specifically this:

When one writes with NPOV, they don't have to defend either position. But defending positions is what is going on largely in these debates we're having in the talk pages; one side thinks the GBD is so bunk that it requires very little to debunk and the other side thinks there is a serious debate worth having and it should happen on Wiki. 
When in fact neither side is absolutely correct. Both sides should be documenting the dispute that is happening outside of wiki. In the case of Kulldorff, editors should be describing the dispute between his  opinions and the mainstream opinions. Whether he is right or wrong is not for wiki editors to decide. 
When a wiki editor writes &quot;it is impossible to protect the vulnerable&quot; they are writing it as a statement of fact and are then forced to support it with citations that prove &quot;it is impossible to protect the vulnerable.&quot; That is much harder to do than to prove that &quot;Gorski said &quot;it is impossible to protect the vulnerable.&quot;&quot;

Reframing the discussion
I think  et al. miss certain features of the debate in the summaries above. What is called into question is whether it is possible in societies (either high or middle/low income, or democracies with legal certainty - or not/without) to implement strong enough measures that they are effective in hindering spread to such a degree that it will lead to fewer deaths in the longer term. The declaration writers assert that it is not, which as a statement can certainly be called into question. We should however remember that the declaration was published before the WHO or any country (apart from China and Russia) had authorized vaccines - and presented a question for which there was/is no answer.

We may assert that the declaration is viewed as marginal by the broader community, but that does not mean that all criticism goes - as some critics are also quite marginal, including for instance some that espouse zero Covid. It seems to me wholly inappropriate to reference self-published site Science-Based Medicine as prominently as is suggested above, not only as there is an issue with application of / - but also as per . There is far more reliable criticism, and GBD is not unequivocally considered fringe in all medical literature (even in literature that criticizes it, e.g. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8266426/ PMC8266426]), as some of the other phenomena that Gorski often criticizes are. This goes also for what  suggests, when he cites an opinion piece (well-published enough in the BMJ) from Gorski as absolute evidence that there &quot;is no dispute&quot;. It is still an opinion piece and does not account for a full refutation - and is nothing near as strong as those sources used to define or refute climate change denialism.

There are quite a few personal views and some off-topic discussion above, which probably doesn't belong - as the question at hand is how we should summarize the debate, not what we personally consider moral about deaths from chicken-pox or other infectious disease. 

What is important to remember is that while the declaration may be politically marginal, the sources necessary to refute scientific statements or assertions made in it are not the same as those which express political views of it. Semmelweis was considered fringe by his contemporaries - and a thought experiment would be to consider how we would have summarized the scientific literature upon his assertions. Would there &quot;be no dispute&quot;, or would we be better off by stating that the scientific consensus does not support his assertions? 

There is also the entire topic of the Swedish, Japanese, and Korean voluntary and no-general-lockdown responses, and the Ugandan total societal closure with curfews and closed schooled for 2 years, versus the Tanzanian &quot;Covid doesn't exist&quot;-approaches that place on either extreme of the scale. At least the former three should under no circumstances be considered &quot;solely fringe&quot; or &quot;non-debatable&quot;. A broader perspective may be useful if we are to target neutrality and not just a narrow summary of the situation in high-income anglocentric nations.  () 08:30, 12 February 2022 (UTC)

The above is more typical uncertainty narrative, something we call &quot;false balance&quot; on Wikipedia ().  The following includes more mainstream news that are not  but are generally reliable secondary sources that can be used per  to confirm that the declaration is not considered a serious proposal.  These were very easy to find, among first Google search results.  Its concept of herd immunity is considered unrealistic and was long recognized to only potentially be possible in some areas after massive vaccination.  Another issue is that while youth is generally less vulnerable to severe disease, they easily transmit it back home to parents.  To not transmit it to the elderly would mean keeping them in isolation, including from the family.  Lastly, some measures are required when the health system is overloaded and in general practice, these are relaxed as soon as possible.

Gregg Gonsalves, an assistant professor at the Yale School of Public Health, described the declaration as 'wrong in so many ways' in a tweet thread, arguing that it would essentially kick the elderly, the immunocompromised and those living with disabilities out of society.&quot;, &quot;'There are countries who are managing the pandemic relatively well, including South Korea and New Zealand, and their strategies do not include simply letting the virus run wild whilst hoping that the asthmatic community and the elderly can find somewhere to hide for 12 months,' he said.

 - That is anti-scientific drivel. To dismiss discussion as an &quot;uncertainty narrative&quot; is to dismiss even discussion as fringe of the policies of multiple high-income democratic nations (Japan, Korea, Sweden, now also Denmark and Norway, and the UK). With your mock-schooling on false equivalencies you return to what is not at debate, (no one is calling into question that the declaration was and remains politically marginal). 
The science of how effective severe restrictions (especially lockdowns) are - is extremely uncertain, and that is not a narrative - and is not refuted by mainstream-media googled sources or Gorski's opinion pieces.
That said, I'm not suggesting we refer to the horrible Krieger School/Johns Hopkins pseudo-metaanalysis (which has also been all over the mainstream media). 
What I'm saying is that for the sake of neutrality - we need to keep track of what the scientific questions are, and be clear about where uncertainties lie. To dismiss uncertainty as false equivalence is a typical prosecutor's fallacy.  () 16:15, 12 February 2022 (UTC)
There's no need to ping me.  You're mistaken, epidemiologists have more and more statistics and have improved their models since the beginning of the pandemic, nothing recent has indicated that this discredited idea would suddenly become a legitimate public health strategy.  Waves have come back, measures have demonstrated their effect on them, world statistics have shown the difference between cities in the world in relation to their approach, etc.  Science is not an opinion poll...  As for  it's just Wikipedia policy of not claiming there's an equivalence when it's not the case, like: &quot;some scientists say [...], others say [...] the idea received mixed reactions [...]&quot;.  —[[User:PaleoNeonate|Paleo]][[User talk:PaleoNeonate|Neonate]] – 16:54, 12 February 2022 (UTC)
I want to be very clear PaleoNeonate, who I am responding to, as I am hoping it is possible to drop attempts at derailing the discussion. 
I am afraid that you are the one who is mistaken. Without reference to any authority on my side, what you state about accumulating more statistics and improved modelling in support of strict restrictions - is false. 
The reason the [https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/iae/files/2022/01/A-Literature-Review-and-Meta-Analysis-of-the-Effects-of-Lockdowns-on-COVID-19-Mortality.pdf Krieger/JH paper] was picked up by so many news-outlets was not that the paper was especially good - but that those scientific articles you refer to in support of strict restrictions - don't even exist. Why would otherwise such as poor quality study even be mentioned? (It doesn't however unfortunatly fullfill MEDRS-criteria).
The fact is that very little in the form of scientific literature gives support for severe restrictions. It's quite telling, for all your reference to &quot;accumulated data&quot; - you aren't actually referring to any specific scientific articles or reports.
To name just some modelling that entirely opposes what you state - there is the [https://covid19.ssi.dk/-/media/arkiv/subsites/covid19/risikovurderinger/2022/risikovurdering-for-udviklingen-i-epidemien-med-covid19-22012022.pdf?la=da  Danish Authority's 28/1 '22 modelling and risk assessment], and the [https://www.fhi.no/contentassets/c9e459cd7cc24991810a0d28d7803bd0/vedlegg/risikovurdering-2022-02-09.pdf Norwegian 09/02 '22 risk assessment], both of which specifically refer to the strategy of targeted interventions for high risk or vulnerable groups - in line with the declaration's recommendations.
This is not about false equivalences - this is about how to express a known uncertainty about the underlying science and epidemiology in a neutral manner. The political division on the matter is muddying the waters, but doesn't mean that we can totally discredit Martin Kulldorff, who was an authority in the field prior to the pandemic.
Frankly the published [https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/covid-lockdown-and-the-retreat-of-scientific-debate defence by Kulldorff against Gorski] is just as suitable a reference, or possibly more so than Gorski's BMJ opinion piece. Both, in turn, are lesser to the comments from the WHO or scientific articles on the topic. However, I do suggest you read Kulldorff's defence: it could be quite illuminating.
Also, to clarify what I meant about the prosecutor's fallacy - it is that the mere existence of false equivalencies - does not imply that any mention of a scientific dispute here is a false equivalence. There is no consensus of the efficacy of severe restrictions, and I will repeat once again: the fact that multiple democratic nations with rule of law and due process, including in informing decision makers on pros and cons of severe restrictions - have chosen not to implement them - is indicative that there is a debate. To assert that &quot;there is no debate&quot; is anglocentric anti-scientific codswallop.  () 19:52, 12 February 2022 (UTC)
 P.S. With regards to what you, PaleoNeonate reference from the popular press - it isn't even relevant. (I felt at first that this didn't bear mentioning, but I now feel it needs to be touched upon, as it might be what is confusing you.)
No one has suggested that individuals should be entirely without restrictions, or that they should live without any behavioral changes - but rather that some types of restrictions are both damaging and ineffective, especially in the long term - and should be avoided.
So not only is the science being misconstrued here - but so it the policy interpretation and political base for the declaration's arguments. The declaration is still marginal, but the interpretation that it suggests no adaptations at all (when it specifically has a list of measures) is possibly even more marginal.  () 20:11, 12 February 2022 (UTC)
Distrait, the assertion that there is a real debate about whether laissez-faire viral spread among the less-vulnerable can be combined with protecting the more-vulnerable is, itself, a false story.  There is no credible group of scientists advocating for this.  The only people pushing this are politicians and people who can't bring themselves to face the ugly facts.  There is no credible evidence that this idea works.  There is credible evidence, especially as seen in Sweden, that it does not work.  
The BLP in question is Swedish, and you mention Sweden.  In addition to having one of the best and highest-capacity healthcare systems in the world and a social services sector that was willing and able to provide remarkably high support services, Sweden also had a remarkably high death rate among vulnerable people before the vaccines became available.  They also did not have anything like the young &quot;living normally&quot;; the main difference was that most people closed their businesses and stayed home voluntarily, rather than most people closing their businesses and staying home because the government required them to do so.  This distinction between voluntary choice and government orders will certainly matter to anyone with oppositional defiant disorder, but that distinction has no effect on whether the preventive measures resulted in less viral spread.  () 20:04, 12 February 2022 (UTC)
Please, when you reference &quot;credible evidence&quot; from Sweden, do point out your sources. The official Swedish position is that death rates during the first wave were unremarkable in relation to initial seeding through travel during the sports vacation during week 9 2020.

With regards to the voluntary behavioral adaptation, that is certainly true, but also slightly beside the point.
Where the scientific debate lies, is not of whether any behavioral adaptation is effective - but whether the strict restrictions are always more effective than e.g. voluntary or targeted interventions.   () 20:32, 12 February 2022 (UTC)
It's not about &quot;always&quot;; it's about &quot;COVID specifically&quot;.  There is simply no scientific debate about the impossibility of letting teenagers get infected with COVID (&quot;living their normal lives&quot; and &quot;promoting natural herd immunity&quot;) while simultaneously keeping his high-risk family family members safe from COVID infection.  It can't be done.  () 17:44, 13 February 2022 (UTC)
There is plenty of scientific debate about it and that is what  has demonstrated. Gorski's blog post has neither definitively determined nor adequately demonstrated that &quot;it’s impossible to protect the vulnerable from a virus that’s rapidly spreading among the entire population.&quot;
On the face of it, if Gorski's statement was true, why bother with vaccinations? 
Vaccinations help protect the vulnerable. Therefore it is not &quot;impossible to protect the vulnerable.&quot; Therefore the statement is factually false because it lacks nuance. It is poorly written, un-sourced  and Gorski is not an expert in the relevant field. Therefore, using Gorski's statement as supporting evidence for the 'impossibility' statement does not conform to . Because the Kulldorff article is a , poorly-sourced, contentious material violates core policy and should be immediately removed, without discussion. 
There are Discretionary Sanctions (DS) in effect for both BLP and COVID-19 content and Kulldorff's page falls under both. We've all likely had the DS banners placed on our talk pages. Both banners state the following:

No one here has argued that we shouldn't neutrally point out the mainstream view of the GBD when mentioning the GBD. However, we must strictly follow policy when doing so and the current statement does not. 
 () 22:35, 13 February 2022 (UTC)
&quot;Why bother with vaccination&quot; this is ridiculous.  Because it's the only way to attempt eventual herd immunity at lesser risk.  Because it helps prevent infection.  Because when infection still occurs, its severity is reduced.  Because vaccination is a usually harmless way to provide some degree of immunity, versus the danger of an inital infection without prior immunity.  It doesn't only protect a few people when it is massively given.  Because a vaccination campaign doesn't fill hospitals, too.  —[[User:PaleoNeonate|Paleo]][[User talk:PaleoNeonate|Neonate]] – 01:39, 14 February 2022 (UTC)
As you have just articulated, the vaccines protect the vulnerable, right? 
 () 01:59, 14 February 2022 (UTC)
Gorski's comment was (obviously) about the GBD, not vaccination. So that line of argument seems dishonest. You keep mentioning discretionary sanctions; if you think any editor has not observed them you need to make a request at . I note that so far the only editor in this discussion who's needed admin intervention is you.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Edit_warring&amp;diff=1065840688&amp;oldid=1065788279] I also note the Kulldorff article has now been to six noticeboards in recent weeks.  () 05:29, 14 February 2022 (UTC)
The point about vaccines was to illustrate one of the problems with Gorski's statement; it is factually incorrect on its face. Vaccines protect the vulnerable. As PaleoNeonate pointed out, when delivered en masse, they can even extend protection by easing pressure on medical facilities. Gorski even contradicted the 'impossible' statement himself, later in the same paragraph. 
The point about discretionary sanctions (mentioned only once here) is to illustrate that content in Kulldorff's biography must strictly follow policy and it currently does not. PaleoNeonate was kind enough to let me know about the sanctions by placing a banner on my talk page. I thought it was a good idea for others here to know as well. As the  recommends, its use here is as a 'neutral courtesy.'
&quot;[T]he Kulldorff article has now been to six noticeboards in recent weeks&quot;...sounds like somebody is doing the hard work to improve an article. 
Lastly, when one resorts ad hominem, it usually means they have nothing substantive to offer. 
 () 06:35, 14 February 2022 (UTC)
It's only &quot;incorrect&quot; by an illiterate reading, because the context of commentary is not about vaccines but specifically about &quot;focused protection&quot;. You're wrong about BLP. If it really were the case that editors were violating BLP that would be serious and worthy of reporting to . But it's not happening, so this is just a  tactic, of the kind we see all the time on pseudoscience articles.  () 06:41, 14 February 2022 (UTC)
What is illiterate is to interpret &quot;protect&quot; as synonymous with &quot;shield from all harm&quot;. The declaration never suggests that focused protection or targeted interventions will bring about 100% safety to those most vulnerable. But neither do lockdowns or and strict measures, unless they are severe enough to stop all disease spread as per zero Covid, which once spread got going was a pipe-dream. It certainly did not work in the UK, the US, or anywhere in Europe, only working in those countries that had strict border closures for years, with even New Zealand dropping it as of recently.
The debate, which is certainly not pseudoscientific, but underlies the totality of all pre-Covid research and policy on [https://www.who.int/influenza/preparedness/pandemic/en/ pandemic preparedness], is most certainly alive and kicking.
It is a straw man to shoot down the analogy of vaccines as irrelevant - it is simply using an extreme example prove a point. There are many other reasonably effective interventions as well.
Real examples of focused protection that have been used include cohort care, financial support for risk groups to stay at home, as well as food deliveries to risk groups. That is just off the top of my head from what I've seen in my community.
 - you are being extremely disingenuous, as the declaration was followed, just a few weeks later in November 2020 by the following on focused protection:

Many arguments here are just going around in circles, and don't even attempt to discuss the issue at hand, which I find  encapsulated quite well with his analogy. 
It almost seems like no one has read the declaration, with most making up their minds based off of lay press summaries.  () 08:19, 14 February 2022 (UTC)
It doesn't matter if a random Wikipedia editor think the GBD somehow isn't pseudoscience; what matters is that relevant scientists think it is. Guess which view Wikipedia follows? This is all fairly basic stuff, we are here to summarize decent sources, not push POVs and attempt to .  () 08:24, 14 February 2022 (UTC)
This is exactly the crux of it. It seems random Wikipedia editors are labeling something as pseudoscience, that while certainly contentious, has not in the scientific literature been deemed pseudoscience - apart from in one single opinion piece by Gorski et al.
Each and every facet of the declaration is debated in the scientific literature, and none of it is pseudoscience, but rather basic pre-2020 pandemic preparedness as defined by the World Health Organization, and other prominent organizations such as the CDC, ECDC, etc. 
That doesn't mean it isn't wrong, or isn't politically marginal - but the words &quot;impossible&quot; and &quot;pseudoscience&quot; do not belong. That, and the science is certainly not settled as there &quot;very much is a debate&quot; and it's alive and kicking.  () 08:42, 14 February 2022 (UTC)
I don't believe Gorski has called it &quot;pseudoscience&quot;, but Michael Osterholm has. You obviously have your own beliefs, but they don't count here and yes that is indeed the crux of it. Wikipedia follows reputable mainstream sources and puts fringe stuff in its proper context according to those sources.  () 08:56, 14 February 2022 (UTC)
I equated calling it &quot;impossible&quot; with saying it was &quot;pseudoscience&quot; - but I see now that you refer to an additional poor quality source that has been added to the article on Martin Kulldorff, which is a quote in the lay press [https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/521320-great-barrington-mass-comes-out-against-great-barrington-declaration The Hill].
As for my beliefs, those are entirely irrelevant and not something I have expressed here - nor anywhere else. The fact that you reference such a obvious statement as that I have beliefs, is telling of a lack of . The goal is a neutral summary, not to have one's positions forwarded. I am not in favor of the declaration, but things in life are not so black and white as that I can state that it is pseudoscience, just because I do not agree with it.
The underlying science can't be disregarded with lay press sources and bite-sized quotes, especially when the scientific literature is far from as definitive. The arguments set against this are not in the spirit of Wikipedia and .  () 09:52, 14 February 2022 (UTC) 
There you are again about what you agree with, and what is or is not &quot;black and white&quot; in your personal world view. To repeat, this is irrelevant. The sources rebutting the GBD are fine. You're not going to find peer-reviewed science bothering to rebut the GBD because it's not peer-reviewed science, but a political document launched as a PR stunt by a political think-tank. That is why we have  of sourcing on such occasions; it's the same with most types of grift, quackery and pseudoscience. Luckily we have many appropriate sources and wise scientists saying that the GBD is nonsense, and reflect it accordingly.  () 11:56, 14 February 2022 (UTC)
  It doesn't matter if you are convinced.  We have to accept what the sources say.  The sources say that successful &quot;focused protection&quot; is impossible.  Even some GBD supporters agree that it's impossible.  (They just value improving things economically and socially for healthier people over minimizing total deaths.)  () 19:27, 14 February 2022 (UTC)

These are just personal attacks from  and . I stated that my view is irrelevant - whereupon I was met by a total disregard for this and a refusal to discuss the underlying science, or even papers or studies that did go into the science. 
What makes this especially egregious is that such accusations are in the face of their own personal views prominently at display in the prior section on childhood vaccination against chickenpox. I would hope that such blatant bigotry lead to at the very least an apology.
This isn't about convincing me at all, especially seeing as it is rather those who suggest that GBD is pseudoscience that seem convinced of this despite the fact remaining that the science is not being refuted in that manner anywhere apart from a few errant lay press quotes and an opinion piece, whereas it has frequently been considered in the professional press.
Nonetheless, this is not about saying that either the GBD or Kulldorff weren't wrong, or aren't controversial or that the proposal was not set aside after review of pros and cons.
What this is, is about not calling it pseudoscience, impossible, debunked, not seriously considered or whatever.. because those statements are not only false, but do not have the Wikipedia-sanctioned  or  to back them up.
The fact remains that it has been considered a serious proposal, discussed at length in the scientific literature. The underlying tenets are all scientific and hold for scrutiny - whereas the choice to forego it is often based off the determination that mortality would be too high or that implementation is to hard or costly (not impossible).
Just some examples of the scientific literature taking the proposal seriously (albeit some rejecting it after consideration):

I looked at the first three. If you think &quot;taking it seriously&quot; equates to invoking in the context of &quot;fallacy ad populum&quot;, not mentioning it at all, and pointing out that it never explains how &quot;focussed protection&quot; is meant to be achieved, then the mind boggles. Your argument here is exactly the same as those producing reams of journal articles about homeopathy and saying &quot;Look, they don't mention pseudoscience, so it isn't&quot;. This is why  exists - none of these journal articles have the depth of analysis and synthesis of a good skeptical debunk by an expert on pseudomedicine. Some of these sources may, however, be useful for further information about the GBD, for which, thanks!  () 06:59, 15 February 2022 (UTC)
I see &quot;Lockdown Groupthink&quot; and know that this source's argument is not about science.  The BMJ one seems better, but is not about the declaration.  Enough for me to see that this is not a very constructive use of my time to improve Wikipedia...  —[[User:PaleoNeonate|Paleo]][[User talk:PaleoNeonate|Neonate]] – 22:01, 15 February 2022 (UTC)
You're moving the goal-posts, as this was a response to you, , who suggested that the scientific literature was not bothering to address the declaration - as it was bunk from the get-go. 
The list serves to provide precisely scientific articles taking the time to address the declaration.
I am all for clearly stating that a large number of articles (even the majority) calls into question the feasibility of focused protection as suggested in the declaration. This is however not the same as calling it &quot;impossible&quot; or &quot;pseudoscience&quot;.
Many of the suggestions and principles detailed in [https://gbdeclaration.org/focused-protection/ Great Barrington Declaration - Focused Protection] are actively implemented, including vaccination (and vaccine-prioritization). 
It is entirely ridiculous to suggest that there is parity of sources between the declaration, which was written by three academics (professors) from respectable institutions, and who are considered leading in the field of infectious disease epidemiology - with an opinion piece from an expert on alternative medicine. There is precisely not  of sources here. This is especially evident when you take into account that the declaration was signed by hundreds, if not thousands of well-respected and published experts (professors and academics) in epidemiology, virology, and public health.
Gorski's opinion piece, and an errant quote from The Hill - are not examples of  of sources. 
You hit the nail on its head in identifying the relevant Wikipedia-policy, but make the wrong call as to what that means. 
 () 11:11, 15 February 2022 (UTC)
It's a political tract drafted under the aegis of a science-denying think tank. There are useful idiot scientists in most disciplines, but an argument from authority doesn't dignify any claims. Pretty much any sane source would do to debunk nonsense like this, as it would with an antivax, new earth creationist, homeopathy, chemtrail, etc. document. Basically your play is the same as we see with every defense of pseudoscience. Let the expert sources like SBM decide on fringe medicine, rather than trying to push your personal  beliefs. Wikipedia reflects such reliable, on-point sources.  () 11:21, 15 February 2022 (UTC)
It is certainly a political tract, but that does not de facto invalidate the underlying scientific principles, which is what is necessary in order for something to be pseudoscience. This is also not about whether Gorski called it that, but about whether we should place such a statement in the lead of a BLP, whether such a source has parity, and whether such a source has weight, when multiple scientific articles treat the declaration as a valid proposition (even if only to refute it).
I have not appealed to authority in anything apart from to suggest that the number and rank of the signatories matter per .
It is ironic therefor that you do appeal to the authority of the blog Science-Based-Medicine an expert resource in all of science, including epidemiology, and that it may therefore be relied upon as sole arbiter and definitive jury. That is not only wrong, but ignorant and anti-science. It also is most certainly in violation of .
I implore you to stop bringing my person into this. This is not about me or my views. I have made this point repeatedly, and the sole reason for bringing my views into anything was to repeatedly state that I do not endorse the Great Barrington Declaration. If you do not refrain from casting aspersions in this manner, there are venues to turn to, as you are not engaging in . I have not once made any statement that would suggest I am not going at this with anything other than the intent to clearly state that the declaration is marginal and that the literature is not in favor of it. That is however not the same as using a blog-post source to, in the lede of a BLP, state that the fundamentals of the declaration, including targeted protection, is pseudoscience.
 () 15:42, 15 February 2022 (UTC) 
You matter because your personal views evidently underpin your battle against reliable sources, in particular your belief in the &quot;underlying scientific principles&quot; of the GBD. Science-Based Medicine is not an authority on &quot;all medicine&quot;, but it is a go-to source for pseudomedicine, of which GBD is a example. As to the rank of the signatories, again it's your belief they somehow count (or are even genuine). I give you - Dr Johnny Bananas.[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/09/herd-immunity-letter-signed-fake-experts-dr-johnny-bananas-covid] Anyway, I've had enough of this. You are entitled to think the GBD is [https://wordhistories.net/2019/04/27/dogs-bollocks-origin/ TDB], but have not convinced anybody else. Please do not take my lack of further responses to indicate any agreement with your position.  () 15:53, 15 February 2022 (UTC)
I will say that I echo  concern that there is too much focus on editors in an ad hominem fashion and not enough  ().

That doesn't mean that problematic conduct can't be mentioned or discussed, but it should not be the entire focus and it should not be used as a form of attack, defamation, or ad hominem. 
As I've said previously, I think many in this group are making a lot of assumptions of what &quot;the other side&quot; intends. This is a politicized, polarized, contentious topic and it is very easy to get heated (and I'm talking to myself as much as anyone else). 
We should all work hard on collaborating to make a neutral article that neither side can read and then complain of bias. That means honoring due weight of fringe/alt () topics while respecting that fringe/alt does not ipso facto equate to either bunk or pseudoscience. Calling it &quot;bullshit, bunk, crazy, woo, etc&quot; is used intentionally (and transparently) to enflame the discussion and avoid engaging in a meaningful discussion about content.

I agree that the GBD is textbook  and by definition that means it is not pseudoscience in wiki parlance. The problem I see in this current disagreement is that Osterholm called it &quot;pseudoscience&quot; and the article can state as fact that he said that while giving attribution. That does comply with . Osterholm was not talking in wiki parlance but he is an expert in the relevant field. His comments were also dismissive, political theater meant to demean and denigrate the GBD. We could get into a discussion about the fact that simply including such inflammatory rhetoric in a wiki article engages in the dispute, but that is scope-creep from the original post and possibly not welcomed by other project members on this noticeboard (though I would willingly participate in such a discussion in an appropriate setting). Maybe that discussion is better had on  (or I could be wrong and this location is equally acceptable). 
 (/) 23:29, 15 February 2022 (UTC)
I agree for the most part. It is not inappropriate to mention that Osterholm called it pseudoscience, but to have that statement plastered in the lede of a BLP, especially as attributed to the diffuse collective &quot;Scientists have said&quot; is not neutral. 
I am less inclined however to state that this is textbook fringe, as the signatories and supporters of the declaration are far enough removed from the crowd that normally supports fringe theories. I have no issue calling it marginal or &quot;widely rejected&quot;. 
A potential reason to keep discussion here is that it related to multiple pages, not just Martin Kulldorff.  () 15:25, 16 February 2022 (UTC)

I agree that in the lede is becomes , especially for an article about Kulldorff, not the Declaration. 

When I call it &quot;fringe/alt,&quot; I am referring to the wiki classification, which includes this in the definition:

I feel that accurately describes the Declaration and coming to a mutual understanding of how to classify the GBD within wikipedia's  will help us, as a group, reach consensus about wider topics related to its lack of mainstream acceptance.

That is a good point with which I would also agree. 
 (/) 01:29, 18 February 2022 (UTC)
I think we are entirely in agreement as to this . I wonder if the best way to proceed is to summarize the places where there is inappropriate language or sourcing. There is first and foremost the lede of the BLP Martin Kulldorff, where low-quality and non-parity sources are used to suggest that the declaration is pseudoscience or that focused protection is impossible. The neutrality of even mentioning those statements from Gorski and Osterholm is questionable, and certainly  for the lede of a BLP.  () 17:03, 19 February 2022 (UTC)

I think that it is already time to stop editing all of the templates that are listed [[Special:PrefixIndex/Template:COVID-19 pandemic data/|here]]. Most of those templates are COVID-19 medical cases charts and they are already useless nowadays. Can they simply be marked as historical or do they need to undergo the usual deletion process?

I believe that @ knows about those.  The data is store on Commons, not here.  If you just think they shouldn't be in any articles, then you only need to remove the template from the article, rather than marking the template in any way.  () 22:53, 20 February 2022 (UTC)

No, the medical cases charts are still updated manually even if case numbers have already lost their significance.

Req for  at CFS

Before I inadvertently get embroiled in an edit war; can someone check [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chronic_fatigue_syndrome&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=1073404027&amp;oldid=1073399441 this] reverted undo over at the Chronic fatigue syndrome article? The changes don't seem to be supported by the referenced MEDRS. I initially undid the edits as they were made after a string of edits removed by ClueBOT NG. All were marked as  – some of them were not. To me the &quot;clarifications&quot; seem to fail verification – though I did not tag my reversion as such. (If edits are fine; then the malformed  wikilink will need changing to .)  () 15:49, 22 February 2022 (UTC)

@, that change is not okay.  By changing &quot;mechanisms&quot; to &quot;metabolic mechanisms&quot;, the new editor is saying that non-metabolic mechanisms either don't exist or that they actually are fully understood, and the only thing left for researchers to understand is the metabolic mechanisms.  This is probably unintentional, and it's factually wrong even if it is intentional.  (Also, I suspect that the new editor meant &quot;physiological&quot; or even &quot;non-psychological&quot;, rather than &quot;metabolic&quot;.)
In the case of the epi/genetics change, the new sentence inadvertently suggests that nobody has ever claimed that the DNA sequence could matter, which is false.  It might be worth adding epigenetics to the phrase (&quot;proposed mechanisms include biological, genetic, epigentic, infectious, and physical or psychological stress&quot;), but genetics should not be removed.

Ectodermal dysplasia


Hello, WikiProject Medicine,

This article was brought to my attention because in a biographical article, a subject of a recent  discussion is stated to suffer from this condition. It doesn't seem like the article is up to WikiProject Medicine standards, has very light sourcing and looking at the page history, it looks like much of the editing has been done by IP editors instead of editors that I recognize as regular content creators.

Poor Presentation and Bias on John A. McDougall
FYI, the Dr. John A. McDougall page on Wikipedia exhibits poor presentation, outdated information, and blatant bias. These issues have been discussed for at least the last six years on the Talk page, and none of them have really been fixed, thanks to a group of editors that control that page. Wikipedia should be ashamed of the poor editorial quality of the entry. I have done a step-by-step analysis of the overall presentation of this entry and I will be posting it to YouTube shortly---the link will pretty be provided here as well. The Wikipedia page goes right up to the borderline but doesn't quite cross it of calling this accomplished clinician and researcher a &quot;quack&quot;, and then provides questionable or outdated sources to back up the criticism, with no other viewpoint provided in any significance. His work is built on decades of clinical evidence from researchers from institutions such as Duke University, Cornell University, Oregon Health Sciences Center, even Harvard U [e.g., archeology research] and others published in peer-reviewed studies. Don't you think that the reader should decide whether or not his work is questionable? Just stick to the facts, Wikipedia. Thank you, - Jack Byrom  () 16:22, 15 February 2022 (UTC)
His diet seems to attract fans from time to time. It's true there has been some research published in the last couple of years that could usefully be included (even if it seems inconclusive). Trying to raise a posse via Youtube is likely to result in the article being locked and your account being blocked which is not a good outcome for anyone. The only way to get an article changed on Wikipedia is through editor consensus, and this is best achieved via Talk pages.  () 16:58, 15 February 2022 (UTC)
Jack Byrom some users have canvassed off-site before and posted about McDougall's article on Reddit (I am not sure if you were involved with that). It's up to you what you want to do in your spare time but the canvassing thing never works, just leads to more problems. Do you have any reliable sources for McDougall's biography that specifically mention him? I am talking about reliable secondary sources that are independent (not primary sources written by McDougall). You have been asked multiple times but never give any. I know you mean well and want to improve the article but as Alexbrn says use the talk-page and if you know of any reliable sources put them over there. That is how you improve an article.

 You guys mangle this page and spend hours practicing theoretical medicine on Wikipedia instead of writing a good article. You malign a living person and physician, and then when somebody makes a real critique of the page with a fresh eye, you threaten them with a self-referential Wikipedia threat. How entirely predictable, yet sad, as if WP was the authority on high. I would just be horrified if I or another professional science editor got banned from Wikipedia because of a review of this article on YouTube. By the way, the worse the Wikipedia article, the more the editors responsible cry out that &quot;there are no reliable secondary sources&quot; [to support an actual comprehensive encyclopedia entry]. There's plenty of reliable secondary sources, and you know it. If you were really trying to be a professional writer or editor here, you would go find them. But that's not really your intent...This is actually an encyclopedia, not a medical journal. I wonder if you know the difference.  () 04:41, 23 February 2022 (UTC)
 RE: &quot;Jack Byrom some users have canvassed off-site before and posted about McDougall's article on Reddit (I am not sure if you were involved with that)...&quot; -- Huh? I don't ever use that website, but it sounds like you are not real happy about anybody reviewing or giving a fair opinion of your work, which itself tarnishes the reputation of a dedicated professional. If your work here is fair and balanced, you would think that you would be happy for the attention.  () 04:51, 23 February 2022 (UTC)
The article's not bad. The recent attention has uncovered some new sources and tightened things up, but basically this guy's diet product seems like just another nonsense diet with some highly dubious claims used to promote it, and Wikipedia isn't going to be coy about that reality.  () 05:21, 23 February 2022 (UTC)
There's probably room to improve it, though.  For example, he promotes a low-fat vegan diet.  This is not the &quot;standard balanced diet&quot;, but was it ever popular enough to qualify as a fad diet?  A fad diet is one that has a brief flare of popularity, regardless of whether it's scientifically sound.
Some critical content was removed recently, and that is being discussed on the talk page.  () 17:19, 23 February 2022 (UTC)
 , Yes, it is improved over what I saw when I first looked at it about two weeks ago. But it's still got quite a ways to go before it's up to basic encyclopedia editorial standards. I guess every little bit helps. Thanks,  () 20:01, 23 February 2022 (UTC)

Wikimedian in residence at the NIHR - introduction


Dear All,

Though I've already been mentioned on this page, I finally caught up with my self to post a proper introduction. So I will be the Wikimedian in residence at the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) until June. This is a [https://wikimedia.org.uk/2021/12/national-institute-for-health-research-launches-wikimedian-in-residence-in-collaboration-with-wikimedia-uk/ joint project] between the NIHR and Wikimedia UK. Our goal is to see how we can incorporate Wikipedia editing into the different aspects of research (dissemination, public and patient involvement, training, funding requirements, etc.). We will also work on including NIHR research evidence (the secondary sources) in Wikipedia articles and plan to organise an edit-a-thon focusing on researchers from underrepresented backgrounds. We also set up a  where I will share updates about the project.

My first question to you is what do you think about using articles from the [https://evidence.nihr.ac.uk/ NIHR Evidence] website as sources? These are not traditional secondary sources but all of the studies are chosen by a professional committee based on their importance, impact and relevance.

And of course feel free to contact me with any questions or ideas here or via adam.harangozo@nihr.ac.uk

Best wishes,

* Interesting stuff. It definitely feels worthwhile interfacing with people who might be motivated to edit wikipedia. One concern I have would be the tendency of health bodies to view everything not aimed at other health professionals as a tool for &quot;public health&quot; with all that comes along with it (misleading simplications to encourage compliance and provide 'motivation', summaries designed to protect professional interest, claiming certainty where there is no such thing). 
* A nice property of wikipedia for me is that it is not advice written by science communication professionals: it has an , every claim is well sourced, it tends to be possible to trace a citation chain all the way down to primary sources if you want to, and there are crowds of people there to remove bias and provide context - which I guess could be summarized as &quot;wikipedia is an encyclopedia that anyone can edit&quot;. Looking through a few of the evidence pieces, like [https://evidence.nihr.ac.uk/collection/care-decision-making-pregnancy-research-reveals-support-women-need/] there's a bit of a &quot;public health&quot; vibe to the pieces and they aren't really citing their conclusions well. I would very much prefer a systematic review to these sources. Although there is going to be some trade off in terms of up-to-date sources.
* I wonder if it would be possible to plug wikipedia in slightly &quot;higher up&quot; in the chain of articles being written before all the &quot;science communication&quot; starts seeping in. By analogy, NICE often have guidelines together with evidence for the guideline. The later evidence documents are long and detailed and can be very good sources (see for example: https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg178/evidence)
* As an aside I think the standards for what counts as a secondary source are relatively low. In  they talk about the hierarchy of sources. I think sources like this could be quite useful when there is not a systematic review to hand. It might be worth looking into some of the things that happened while people were writing about covid and how these less standard secondary sources were used. I wasn't that involved in this - but others may know more.
* If you look at the archives of this page, there is some discussion about trying to support medics in editing, which might be worth looking at. Again, it's not something I personally have much experience in - but summarizing my limited experience and what other people say: getting medics to appreciate the reasons behind not citing primary sources can be difficult, there can be conflict surrounding &quot;professional status&quot; (I remember some of the guidelines saying things along the lines of &quot;you can your professional knowledge to find good sources&quot;), at times I've interacted with medics with a certain tendency towards censorship and deletionism on the grounds of safety (often with an unfortunate argument that criticism puts patients at risk by decreasing truts in a specialty). There are also the standard thing about being a new editor on wikipedia being difficult - things to learn, admin's having a habit of placing banners on your page, brusque and at times combative communcation style - but I imagine you know about this. It might be worth talking to some people who have joined wikipedia recently, &quot;survived&quot; and are making contributions.  seems like someone who might be interesting to talk to on this topic (I hope they don't mind me mentioning them).

** I'm happy to talk about my experiences with this - it's not great news, I'm afraid. Basically, I think one of the riskiest things to do at the start is edit anything you're an expert in or otherwise particularly invested in. You want to care just enough to keep editing. Because the Wikipedia &quot;rules of engagement&quot; are really counter-intuitive, people need to be editing in a space where they won't get their hackles up if they get told off, because that will happen. The only times I really got into trouble towards the start was editing where I know a lot about the topic. It's been a bit over a year, and I know of at least a couple people who still don't trust me (and fair enough, I did some incredibly ill-advised editing). If you start out where you won't get defensive about being corrected, then it's easier to actually absorb the reasoning for why someone's just put a banner with a strangely friendly-yet-hostile tone on your talk page or deleted your edit using a bunch of arcane acronyms in their edit summary., on another note, by &quot;underrepresented backgrounds&quot;, do you mean underrepresented fields or are you referring to our systemic bias? -- () 12:06, 25 February 2022 (UTC) (please ping if you respond)
To counter some of Talpedia's points, I would say there can be a problem where articles are written by editors with no experience of the topic (even if medically qualified in some way) who assume literature reviews actually reflect medical practice, vs sometimes the opinion and hopes of the review author. I agree the NICE guidelines are good, partly because they are forced to come to a decision even if the evidence is weak. Cochrane's systematic reviews can sometimes be a bit &quot;so what?&quot; and I think their frequent &quot;low evidence&quot; conclusions need expert consideration to determine what to make of that. For example, in some fields there are clear and obviously effective drugs and you'd need strong evidence to change those from being first choice. In other fields, you might not have any effective treatments, and so a &quot;low evidence&quot; drug might end up being the only recommended choice. Some of the NIHR pages have commentary by experts, which could be useful supplementary information on top of the study or systematic review being discussed. Not all the articles are health information for the public. [https://evidence.nihr.ac.uk/alert/levetiracetam-is-a-useful-alternative-to-phenytoin-in-stopping-prolonged-epileptic-seizures-in-children/ this alert] is about drug choices made by emergency doctors, not in the community or by a GP.
I think that Talpedia's concerns about bias could be a problem for some topics, but for most of them it is likely that anyone reading the article could be more likely to come away with a good idea of the state of research knowledge than they might just by doing a PubMed search and picking a review of similar vintage. They also have the advantage of being freely accessible. -- ° 14:19, 18 February 2022 (UTC)
 I definitely think more perspective's are good, as are practitioners perspectives on what actually happens in hospitals, particularly complementing more academic sources (as you say). I think having experts be able to say &quot;this isn't at all true - look at this source&quot; to deal with &quot;unknown unknowns&quot; could be very valuable.
 My concern is more around the framing things &quot;advice for patients written by experts&quot; versus &quot;accurate summary of all quality research citing literature&quot;. Personally when I look at advice written for patients versus that written for doctors or nurses the difference can be striking. Both can be quite easy to understand, summarized and practical - but the advice written for patients if far more likely to lie to me or gloss over very important details.

My feeling at the moment (I've looked at a little bit, but not a lot) is that this could be useful in some cases.  It helps to poke around the website a bit.  There are three types:
* Themed reviews
* Collections, and
* Alerts.
I thought initially that the reviews and collections would be most useful (because they sound like secondary sources), but then I picked one (a [https://evidence.nihr.ac.uk/collection/care-decision-making-pregnancy-research-reveals-support-women-need/ &quot;collection&quot; about recent pregnancy research]) and thought about how I would use it, and it didn't seem useful in practice.  It was mostly vague platitudes (&quot;Pregnant women should always be at the centre of their care&quot;).  I also found myself frustrated that it would say things about the conclusions of a particular piece of research, like &quot;Parents and doctors take different approaches to difficult decisions&quot;, but not say what those different approaches were.  [https://evidence.nihr.ac.uk/alert/informed-decision-making-birth-defects/ The linked alert] for that bit, on the other hand, provided a list of the four different approaches this primary source found (analytical, absolute, assess/reassess, and delay/avoidance).  The Collection might be considered a secondary source, but this information is still based on a single research study.  The next such study might decide that there were three approaches, or five.
The &quot;What's next?&quot; sections in the &quot;Alerts&quot; could be useful for a
Research directions
section (about what research is underway or recommended for the future).
[https://evidence.nihr.ac.uk/alert/parents-to-be-need-to-be-prepared-for-receiving-uncertain-results-from-genetic-tests/ This alert] is basically a lay-friendly summary of  (a review article).  I don't think I would want to cite the NIHR alert instead of the original review.  I could imagine someone providing that link in addition to the review, but not instead of the review.  I could also imagine someone using the NIHR contents to make sure that they have correctly understood the original source, to find relevant original research sources, and to see whether they are correctly  (part of NPOV) of the article.
Finally:  a citation to NIHR is probably better than nothing.  It may not be the &quot;MEDRS ideal&quot;, but it may be a &quot;good enough&quot; source for simpler and less controversial content.  () 00:42, 19 February 2022 (UTC)

Hi  , , ,

Thanks so much for the feedback. Giving health advice might be less of a problem with the NIHR as they come from the research end but it’s going to be my job to teach them how to edit Wikipedia and I’ll emphasise this aspect. 

I think the NIHR Evidence site is useful not only because of the research but the plain language they are using. I really want to focus on using accessible language during my residency because many medical articles on Wikipedia are not easy to read (there are also studies about this). 

I would also cite the original article but somehow include the matching piece from Evidence as a plain English summary. Another good NIHR source I’m planning to use is the [https://www.journalslibrary.nihr.ac.uk/hta/ Health Technology Assessment] from the NIHR Journals Library, there are many systematic reviews here.
