 alk:Clitoromegaly#The term &quot;clitoromegaly&quot; can refer to any abnormal enlargement of the clitoris 

Comments are needed from this project regarding the above [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Clitoromegaly&amp;diff=556693773&amp;oldid=556668659#The_term_.22clitoromegaly.22_can_refer_to_any_abnormal_enlargement_of_the_clitoris linked matter] in the heading. If any of you are willing to help improve either or both those two articles -- litoromegaly and litoris enlargement -- through editing, that would also be appreciated. ser:Flyer22|Flyer22 (ser talk:Flyer22|talk) 01:11, 25 May 2013 (UTC)
Hey again, everyone. Will at least one of you weigh in on the above matter? ser:Flyer22|Flyer22 (ser talk:Flyer22|talk) 16:29, 26 May 2013 (UTC)

 Psychiatric drugs and IP user 

There is an IP user (ser|2602:306:c518:6c40:f02a:330c:11cc:acdb) edit warring and doing disruptive edits at some psychiatric drugs articles (aloperidol, urasidone, isperidone, and luorobenzene). More eyes would be probably welcomed.--ser:Garrondo|Garrondo (ser talk:Garrondo|talk) 19:53, 22 May 2013 (UTC).
Moreover; it seems that his ip editor and ser:ChemNerd (who should be said that is probably trying to control the damage) have both broken the 3RR. Maybe a temporal protection of these articles would be wise. Additionally it might not be the case, but edits, tone and topic have some resemblance to those of Mandragua/Booklaunch, --ser:Garrondo|Garrondo (ser talk:Garrondo|talk) 20:43, 22 May 2013 (UTC)
Yeah that guy looks like Booklaunch.  Interesting in [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Lurasidone&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=555931415 this] edit he seems to indicate he has personal experience with antipsychotic drugs, but wasn't happy with the result.  Is there an admin around?  We might benefit from blocking the IP, but given the history he'll probably just come back as another IP in a matter of minutes.  We might consider semi-protection on the small number of affected articles for a little while to discourage him.  ser:Zad68|Zadser_Talk:Zad68|68 20:52, 22 May 2013 (UTC)
My apologies for the edit warring.  I should have known better.  :/  This editor is clearly unfamiliar with Wikipedia policy (or doesn't care about it), not knowledgeable in the science of pharmacology, and not knowledgeable in chemistry, in addition to all the behavior problems, and all his (non-trivial) edits have been reverted.   ser:ChemNerd|ChemNerd (ser talk:ChemNerd|talk) 21:20, 22 May 2013 (UTC)
This is almost certainly not Booklaunch or Mandragua.  A look at the history of alk:Risperidone shows that the same person has been editing using similar IPv6 addresses since July 2012.  The topic of psychosis has such a strong propensity to draw disruptive editors that we could easily get more than one editing on related themes. ser:Looie496|Looie496 (ser talk:Looie496|talk) 22:17, 22 May 2013 (UTC)

Now is: 2602:306:C518:6C40:505A:5C79:DCDB:627E, for the moment only working at talk pages.--ser:Garrondo|Garrondo (ser talk:Garrondo|talk) 20:13, 26 May 2013 (UTC)
And is blocked. ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 21:56, 26 May 2013 (UTC)

Now is: 2602:306:c518:6c40:436:4cd8:3535:ce51, again for the moment only working at talk pages. (See [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Haloperidol&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=557055628 this].--ser:Garrondo|Garrondo (ser talk:Garrondo|talk) 20:07, 27 May 2013 (UTC)

 Recent changes pages 

User:Kumioko has tagged a raft of pages for deletion: ikipedia:WikiProject Medicine/Recent changes and its subpages from ikipedia:WikiProject Medicine/Recent changes/0 to ikipedia:WikiProject Medicine/Recent changes/21.  I asked him to explain what he was doing, and he responded Certainly, ser:Femto Bot|Femto bot was operated by Rich Farmbrough. Rich has been banned from operating bots and his bots shut down. These pages haven't been updated since before May 2012 (some in 2011). Additionally multiple requests have been made to other bot operators to maintain the functionality and all have refused. One did make a Toolserver app that is fairly close. So there is no need to keep these pages, which all say recent (which is confusing) that haven't been updated in more than a year and won't be updated. I hope this helps. ser:KumiokoCleanStart|Kumioko (ser talk:KumiokoCleanStart#top|talk) 20:24, 25 May 2013 (UTC)  Does this project want them, or should they be deleted?  ser:Nyttend|Nyttend (ser talk:Nyttend|talk) 20:31, 25 May 2013 (UTC)
 It looks like those pages have been deleted already. Only admins are able to view the deleted material. ser:Axl|Axl ¤ ser talk:Axl|[Talk] 00:20, 26 May 2013 (UTC)
If memory serves, the pages were mostly lists of articles that are tagged with l|WPMED.  ser|INeverCry deleted them.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 02:09, 26 May 2013 (UTC)

I think it would be great to include an audio clip of what the whooping cough sounds like on the ertussis article. It has a very distinct sound and is easily identifiable because of that.

 Proposal to create/maintain disease infoboxes 

I run an academic research group, and one of our current projects is to develop the ortal:Gene Wiki|Gene Wiki project.  Basically, we helped to create/maintain a emplate:GNF_Protein_box|template for key information on human genes.  In cases where a gene page already existed, we just added/updated the template.  When they didn’t exist before, we auto-created stubs.  Now, we maintain a ser:ProteinBoxBot|bot that keeps these infoboxes up to date with the source databases.

After the success of the gene pages, the idea of expanding to other biomedical topics has been suggested several times by other scientists I’ve talked to.  The set of human diseases is one natural area.  Clearly, emplate:Infobox_disease is already doing a great job organizing many links to related resources.  Relative to what already exists, I can see a few possible ways we might contribute:

* Systematically determining, adding, and maintaining the mappings (e.g., to OMIM, MeSH, GeneReviews, etc.)
* Adding new data sources (e.g. NCI Thesaurus, Disease Ontology)
* Identifying a “comprehensive” list of notable human diseases for stub creation
* Providing wikilinks to related genes and drugs/compounds (with references) 

We would appreciate any feedback, thoughts, and suggestions on whether this community thinks our involvement would be useful and productive.  (Note, we’ve also started a very similar discussion with ikipedia:WikiProject_Pharmacology [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Pharmacology#Proposal_to_create.2Fmaintain_drug_infoboxes] on the idea of expanding drug topics as well.)  Cheers, ser:Andrew Su|Andrew Su (ser talk:Andrew Su|talk) 22:01, 13 May 2013 (UTC)
I like this idea. This would mesh well with the efforts we are working on with the WHO ICD division. ICD 11 is coming out soon and the ideas we are mulling around is not only partly basing the ICD 11 on Wikipedia but looking at updating the infoboxes to ICD 11. This will require bots to do so and if you have a similar bot already developed that could definately be a starting point. ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 01:10, 14 May 2013 (UTC)
We by the way have a fairly exhaustive list of diseases here [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_diseases_(0%E2%80%939)] The difficulty is many diseases are known by a number of names and some of these should simply be redirects. Could we come up with a bot that would search disease name synonyms and see if Wikipedia has an article for one while adding redirects for the others? That would be a first step. Than we could have a bot that adds the disease infobox to the rest as well as adding the disease infobox to articles that do not have it already and maybe filling in the disease infobox where there is data but it is not included :-) ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 01:21, 14 May 2013 (UTC)
 Great, glad to hear there's some enthusiasm of this idea.  Absolutely, no human should have to deal with any ICD codes, so systematically dealing with ICD 9 and ICD 10 while still prepping for the arrival of ICD 11 seems to be perfect for a bot.  The list of diseases looks remarkable!  We should definitely figure out how to incorporate this effort.  We have been working with the [http://disease-ontology.org/ Disease Ontology] folks.  The plus-side of DO is that they track many of the synonyms, so setting up redirects should be straightforward.  However, by quick spot check, I see many diseases listed here that aren't in DO.  Anyway, I think figuring out the overlap there could involve a very productive collaboration in both directions.  Cheers, ser:Andrew Su|Andrew Su (ser talk:Andrew Su|talk) 06:23, 14 May 2013 (UTC)

Overall, I think this is a great idea. I'm a little uncertain about the &quot;links to related genes and drugs/compounds&quot;, but I'm willing to see how it works out.
May I request an addition?  One of the things we've talked about, but never managed to accomplish, is a ara|specialty parameter, to answer the very basic question of &quot;What kind of a doctor usually deals with this?&quot;  It wouldn't be necessary on many articles, but it would be very handy for some of them (e.g., most autoimmune diseases are handled by rheumatologists), and I hope that it would be mostly simple to figure out whenever it is relevant.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 05:56, 14 May 2013 (UTC)
 Regarding the &quot;links to related genes and drugs/compounds&quot;, another one of our collaborators has systematically curated links between diseases and genes and diseases and drugs.  There is a mix of database imports and human manual curation, and they've tracked each link with the strength of the evidence.  Clearly we'd restrict ourselves to the highest-confidence links.  I was thinking about displaying this info in an infobox (either a new one, or expanding emplate:Infobox_disease), but we're certainly open to how others think this information should be displayed.
 Regarding the specialty parameter, sounds like a reasonable idea to me.  I'd love to prepopulate that field with data from a database with our bot runs.  Are you aware of any source of that information?  Perhaps we could use the Disease Ontology hierarchy to infer that information.  The fallback of course is simply to let editors fill that in one-by-one.  Cheers, ser:Andrew Su|Andrew Su (ser talk:Andrew Su|talk) 06:23, 14 May 2013 (UTC)
I'm not aware of a good source, and each specialty tends to have an expansive idea of its scope, so that a dermatologist would include several heart conditions as being derm issues, or a neurologist would include cancers, etc.  I'm hoping to get the primary specialty listed, not just any specialist who might encounter it.  I think that pre-populating with an inferred specialty would be fine, and then we can manually correct it or expand it as necessary.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 14:49, 14 May 2013 (UTC)
Agree that you'll need a very reliable source, because this will be contentious for the reasons you've touched upon. Nothing starts fights like turf does. -- ser:Scray|Scray (ser talk:Scray|talk) 17:34, 16 May 2013 (UTC)

The good news is that we're not required to limit it to one answer.  kin cancer could easily list both oncology and dermatology, for example.  I think that I'd avoid citing this (should be obvious 90% of the time, right?) unless and until someone actually challenges it in a specific article. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 19:34, 16 May 2013 (UTC)
 And of course, this is exactly the sort of data that ought to be present in the Wikidata entry, http://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q192102. It's also worth noting that if we're really going to be ahead of the game, once we supply more than one item of information in a field, we really ought to be marking it up as a proper list like this: list | oncology | dermatology for example. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 22:54, 16 May 2013 (UTC)
 The issue of Wikidata and accessible lists in infoboxes is also being discussed at emplate_talk:Infobox person#Parameters that can optionally be called from Wikidata. ser:Pigsonthewing|Andy Mabbett (Pigsonthewing); ser talk:Pigsonthewing|Talk to Andy; pecial:Contributions/Pigsonthewing|Andy's edits 23:45, 16 May 2013 (UTC)
Thanks all for the additional thoughts.  First on the subject of classifying disease, just a couple of thoughts.  We are actively coordinating with the Disease Ontology [http://disease-ontology.org/] folks, and classification/organization of disease terms into higher-level concepts is definitely something they've thought a lot about.  We are hoping to include some elements of that structure into the disease infobox.  However, it's not quite the same as linking a disease to the primary specialty.  Perhaps we should also follow the model of l|Breast_cancer_types and |l|Systemic connective tissue disorders?  Again, this is not purely a bot issue since it will take human input to do the classifications...  
Second, on the issue of wikidata, 100% in agreement.  I apparently neglected to mention this, but we definitely will plan to put all the infobox data that we add/maintain into wikidata.  And that includes all the old stuff we've done with l|GNF Protein box.  Having said that, I think we're going to leave the discussion at emplate_talk:Infobox person to others.  Just know we'll be on board once all the options for querying and inclusion are worked out...  Cheers, ser:Andrew Su|Andrew Su (ser talk:Andrew Su|talk) 00:47, 17 May 2013 (UTC)
re Classifying disease, I note in one the examples given at User:ProteinBoxBot/Phase 3 &quot;inherited metabolic disorder&quot; used. Now this is disease classification rather than the specialism that addresses the disorder; could have both I suppose. The risk is this gets idiosyncratic between articles with endless variations confusing medics as well as the non-specialist. Would we wish to restrict this to sub-parameters to enact a urgical sieve ? Hence have 3 variables of &quot;Acquired-Congetial&quot;; &quot;Cause&quot; (or 'Mechanism') eg inflammatory, infectious, cancer; and &quot;Target_system&quot; (eg Cardiac, Renal, or Systemic) ? ser:Davidruben|David Ruben  ser talk:Davidruben|Talk  23:59, 2 June 2013 (UTC)

Hi! I just caught on to this discussion and I'm glad I'm not totally late. The past 2 months I have been busy discussing and creating properties over at Wikidata. I should have actually informed this project earlier that already four properties have been created from the diseases infobox (MeSH, OMIM, ICD9, ICD10; d:Wikidata:List of properties/Terms#Medicine) which can now be assigned to every disease (e.g. d:Q2840). I would like to suggest that we create a task force page on Wikidata and centralize the discussion, the data gathering and the centralized infobox design there. By the way I really like the way the new infoboxes look. If you need any help with Wikidata I will watch this page and respond in a timely manner.

The DSM 5 has taken some hard hits. The head of the NIMH has stated &quot;Patients with mental disorders deserve better&quot; [http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/index.shtml]. A commentary in annals states &quot;The DSM-5, the recently published fifth edition of the diagnostic manual, ignored this risk and introduced several high-prevalence diagnoses at the fuzzy boundary with normality&quot; [http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/804378] DSM specifically asked us not to use their criteria a while ago. I think we should keep our article more directed towards the ICD criteria. I need to email the WHO and ask if this will have any effect on the ICD11. Supposedly they were supposed to be exactly the same for the next edition of the ICD. So to summarize I do not think we should be in a great hurry to update.

That is only half true, since (info from our article) In May 2013, Insel, on behalf of NIMH, issued a joint statement with Jeffrey A. Lieberman, MD, president of the American Psychiatric Association,[57] that emphasized that DSM-5, &quot;...represents the best information currently available for clinical diagnosis of mental disorders. Patients, families, and insurers can be confident that effective treatments are available and that the DSM is the key resource for delivering the best available care. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has not changed its position on DSM-5.&quot; Insel and Lieberman say that DSM-5 and RDoC &quot;represent complementary, not competing, frameworks&quot; for characterizing diseases and disorders.--ser:Garrondo|Garrondo (ser talk:Garrondo|talk) 07:09, 28 May 2013 (UTC)

 Renaming skin diseases 

Dear members of Project Medicine,

Today I renamed a couple of articles, based on the fact that those articles beared a Latin name with a Latin grammatical construction but were most of the time not Latin with respect to orthography.

1. Nevus sebaceous.
In Latin nevus is spelled naevus and sebaceous is actually not Latin or Latin with an Americanized orthography, but an English adjective, as can be determined by the ending -ous. I think it is quite uncommon to put the adjective in English behind the noun. So it is neither Latin nor English.

2. Nevus flammeus.
Also a Latin expression. So I changed it to naevus.

3. Erythema multiforme major.
Also a Latin expression. But erythema and multiforme are of neuter gender, while major is of masculine of feminine gender. Majus however is of neuter gender. A lot of people talk about the labium major, instead of the labium majus (to mention a similar mistake).

4. Nevus anemicus
Also a Latin expression. But spelling is Americanized. Naevus anaemicus is according to Latin orthography.

However I did not ask the Wikipedia community first whether they would agree with the renaming. I should have done that first. My apologies. 

Moderator ser:Kafziel|Kafziel ser talk:Kafziel|Complaint Department: Please take a number reverted the moves back, but not all changes I have made in the articles itself are reverted properly. However I want to ask, whether you think it is a good idea, to rename those articles to their proper name with correct Latin spelling? Thank you very much for your response. With kind regards, ser:Wimpus|Wimpus (ser talk:Wimpus|talk) 16:53, 4 June 2013 (UTC)
Tend to use the most commonly used spelling/term in recent high quality medical publications. This might not correspond to the etymologically correct spelling. In this context, it could be argued that these are medical terms with specific definitions rather than latin words. To illustrate this point, I take the example of nevus:
* The latin word Naevus - &quot;Mole&quot; or &quot;Birthmark&quot;
* the medical term has a more specific definition (as described by the wikipedia article) than the above.
* on pubmed &quot;naevus&quot; yields 1889 hits [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=%22naevus%22]
* whereas &quot;nevus&quot; yields 15439 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=%22nevus%22] 
I know your argument is about latin spellings rather than about British English spellings, but in the cases you raised here, the British English spelling follows the latin too. I would add that American English spellings of medical words are not only (usually) in much more common use than British English spellings, is easier to read and write in my opinion. And think of those few less letters you have to write/type each time you use the word =D time saving too. I read somewhere that the prevalence of dyslexics among native English speakers is artificially high compared to many other languages, possibly due to more complex spelling and grammar &quot;rules&quot; in the language. So, I think simplified spellings in American English are a good thing all round. ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 17:12, 4 June 2013 (UTC)

Dear Lesion, or Laesion,
Thank you for your quick response. This is actually not about the spelling of single words, but of words within a sentence that is not English. In case you want to quote a French sentence, you can not Americanize the spelling as the sentence is written with French word and make use of French grammar. In case you would use single French words, than it is possible to simplify orthography. In binary nomenclature, spelling is also not different for Americans or people from the United Kingdom. Or is the racaena marginata spelled Dracaena marginata in the UK and Dracena marginata in the US? The expression is Latin and is therefore in the case of racaena marginata not subjected to national spelling rules. I think the Latin expressions used to name certain skin diseases are analogous cases. With kind regards, ser:Wimpus|Wimpus (ser talk:Wimpus|talk) 17:22, 4 June 2013 (UTC)

Laesion love it =D ... I sympathize with your argument. It must be frustrating to see errors that are glaringly obvious to you. I would personally tend to favor naming an article (whether a single word or phrase) based on the most common use in sources -- even if this is wrong, for whatever reason ... spelling, or masculine/feminine not matching up (not sure what the correct word is for that). If a source can be found explaining how it is wrong, then this would be great to include in the article too, along with the technically correct spelling. The physicians of old who coined these phrases probably needed to work on their Latin and Greek, hence the errors you point out with masculine/feminine combinations, but then they may not have had as much time to discover the diseases etc to name in the first place. My personal dislike is terms which are derived from both Greek and Latin, sometimes in the same word. These can be in very common use, e.g. yperthermia [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=hyperthermia] is made from both Greek and Latin. How hard could it have been to be consistent and use either or? I suppose Latin and Greek are no longer spoken as actual languages by most medical/scientific figures after a point in history. Instead, a selection of the words are used as building blocks to construct the terminology of science.  They are no longer using their native tongue, and errors of all kinds become common I would imagine. And then there is the whole British English-American English split. ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 17:45, 4 June 2013 (UTC)
As an off topic, this reminds me of a page I was working on a while ago: eukoedema, spelled the same in both British and American English. The British English for dema is oedema, but pronounced the same. Leukoedema is pronounced as &quot;leuko-edema&quot; in the US (I think, don't often hear it spoken). I wonder if when using British English, it is pronounced &quot;Leuk-edema&quot;? Interesting. ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 18:02, 4 June 2013 (UTC)

Even more off topic. Hyperthermia is however not a hybrid. Hyper is from Greek ὑπέρ hupér=above, over, exceeding, across, and thermia from Greek θερμός thermós=hot, heat, hot water or θέρμη/θέρμα thérme/thérma=heat, with its plural θέρμαι thérmai=hot springs, hot bads.  However, the Romans used this word as loaneword as thermae (Latin transcription of θέρμαι thérmai) for their warm springs and warm baths. So this actually not a mixture of Greek and Latin, altough the latter part can also be found (as loanword) in Latin. About Leukoedema, what is actually a nice example. When you construct such a word, it can be done like leuko+oedema, leuko+edema, leuk+oedema and leuk-edema. The connecting vowel in Greek for making compounds in most of the time (with a lot of exceptions) an o, but when the other word starts with a vowel, the initial connecting vowel is elided (=pushed out). Therefore is Notalgia paraesthetica and not Notalgia paraaesthetica. The a of para- is in that case elided. So it seems that the Americans did not elide the connecting vowel and the Britisch did according to the grammar rules of Greek. 

Back on topic, a few examples I changed were according to Dorland's Medical Dictionary, while others were according other dictionaries. Sometimes Dorland's take care of the difficulties of the complicated nomenclature with its Latin and Greek and sometimes they forget basic rules. Therefore checking multiple reference works is recommended as multiple sources can supplement eachother. With kind regards, ser:Wimpus|Wimpus (ser talk:Wimpus|talk) 18:56, 4 June 2013 (UTC)
Overall, I think it is a bad idea to make an &quot;English&quot; article use &quot;Latin&quot; spelling.  What matters is whether the article is using proper English spelling.  It does not matter (at all) if that English spelling differs from the Latin (or Spanish, or French, or German, or Chinese, or anything else) spelling.
If there is a difference between versions of English that gives several correct English spellings, then whatever was used originally is the one that we stick with.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 20:05, 4 June 2013 (UTC)
Maybe it is not clear to everyone, but I am not talking about single words in Latin with Latin spelling, but I am talking about full Latin expressions with Latin spelling. Those Latin expressions are not English. They are constructed with Latin grammar in mind. They have a noun with a certain gender and a corresponding adjective with the same gender. It would be rhe same as you would quote a French sentence and adapt the spelling and remove diacritical marks, all words with -our, by -or et cetera. With kind regards, ser:Wimpus|Wimpus (ser talk:Wimpus|talk) 20:24, 4 June 2013 (UTC).
No, you aren't talking about Latin phrases.  [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nevus_of_Ota&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=558301347 Nevus fuscoceruleus ophthalmomaxillaris] is a name used in some modern sources, not a phrase used in Latin sources.  Here at the English Wikipedia, we do not &quot;correct&quot; the spelling to match what it ought to be in a non-English foreign language, just like we would not correct the spelling of your own personal name to match what it would be in some other language.

Agreed with all above: the pubmed test should yield a rough indication on when it migth be convenient to change the name. It does not really matter if a word is used alone or in combination with others (minor point: I would never say that two words with no verb make a sentence): if majority of sources misspell or misconjugate or misdecline or whatever we should follow what you see as an error and others simply see as natural language evolution. You might also benefit from reading P:TRUTH.

Wimpus, thank you for that insight, I found it very interesting. I usually try to include some content about etymology on a page, and linking to Wiktionary is good too. This is a good standard to follow, and I think inclusion along with the etymology on any errors in the commonly used term should be included too, with a source to support this. However, regarding the naming of the article itself, ikipedia:MEDMOS#Naming_conventions is pretty clear on the subject

&quot;The article title should be the scientific or recognised medical name that is most commonly used in recent, high-quality, English-language medical sources, rather than a lay term (unscientific or slang name)[1] or a historical eponym that has been superseded.&quot;

Hence, we have evus and not aevus, even though it could be argued that &quot;nevus&quot; is incorrect. ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 21:22, 4 June 2013 (UTC)
Note: that is not to say that the currently, the name of every medical page is already titled in the most appropriate way. One would need to investigate this on a case by case basis. All Wikipedia is a work in progress. ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 21:26, 4 June 2013 (UTC)

I do not think nevus is incorrect when it used within an English construction. So sebaceous nevus is fine, but the Latin form has to be naevus sebaceus.  To give an example from my own language: we write allergische rinitis. We are not allowed to write rh- in words derived from Greek, but when we use the Latin form and in Medical Dutch that is perfectly possible, than we can write rhinitis allergica . In such an expression, the general grammar rules for DUTCH doesn't apply for those special cases of Latin nomenclature, but only if they are used within an expression with Latin grammar. With kind regards, ser:Wimpus|Wimpus (ser talk:Wimpus|talk) 21:52, 4 June 2013 (UTC)
I think Garrondo's comment about language evolution above is important. Can these disputed phrases still be considered another language, or are they adopted, specialized terms now altered and used in a particular, accepted way? If the latter, then arguably the grammar, syntax etc of the original language does not apply... ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 22:11, 4 June 2013 (UTC)

I agree with the bit of MEDMOS quoted above by Lesion, though on the point of &quot;most commonly used&quot;, that argument doesn't setting disputes between US and UK spelling. If it did, US spelling would be the only one on Wikipedia. In a situation where two regional spellings have widespread usage, we live with the regional spelling used already by the article. I disagree that a term composed of two (or even three) words becomes a &quot;sentence&quot;. A term is an atomic thing no matter how many words it has. The spelling and punctuation in that term go with educated usage, even if some wish that usage was more educated :-). ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 07:21, 5 June 2013 (UTC)
Lower down the same page states &quot;Where there are lexical differences between the varieties of English, an international standard should be sought.&quot; listing the ICD-10 and such as examples of international standards. Continuing the above example, the ICD uses the British English spelling, so ... maybe the article title could be changed on those grounds, but I feel the overwhelming used of &quot;nevus&quot; in publications listed on pubmed is compelling. ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 09:18, 5 June 2013 (UTC)

Forced circumcisions have tended to be a part of circumcision in  history often by conqueror of the conquered,  but also on an ongoing basis today  in Australia and several locations in Africa,  and recently in Former Yugoslavia.

We have 3 articles related to emporomandibular joint disorder that are being used with no heed to MEDRS. I assume bad faith COI from the NPOV and the willingness of IPs and other editors to delete MEDRS material that they don't agree with. Repeated additions of primary sources, and non MEDRS sources. Unsourced material, copyvios... Essentially, I believe the main purpose of these articles is advertising, piggybacking on Wikipedia's high profile on Google results. Appreciate if these pages were on a few more watchlists until the people involved get the message.

If no delete occurs, the page will require a lot of attention. The page is essentially about TMD, but not from a mainstream view, and which we have an article for already.

 The file doesn't seem to be at P:FFD, nor is it tagged for speedy deletion. I am unsure in what sense it is &quot;nominated for deletion&quot;. The image was clearly made by the company and has an appropriate license for Wikimedia Commons. If the image is to be kept, it should be uploaded there. 
 Regarding the list of names, they look plausible as real patients' names, although dummy names are also possible. If they are real names, it is possible that the company has permission from those patients to use them in this way. Typically, such information is legally protected from dissemination (HIPAA in the US; the Data Protection Act in the UK).
 I tried to find guidance in Wikipedia about using patient-identifiable information, but I didn't find any. I'm not sure if there is guidance in Wikimedia Commons.
 If these names are from real patients who have not consented, I agree that the image should not be permitted in Wikipedia. If no guidance is currently present in Wikipedia, this should be added.

 Medical students to do one month Wikipedia elective 

Starting in Dec of 2013 we hope to have a few students from CSF joining us in a Wikipedia project. They will each take on one article. Further details are here ikipedia:WikiProject Medicine/UCSF Elective 2013. Feedback appreciated both in developing exactly how things will work before and after the course. If it is a success hopefully this can continue long term. ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 23:41, 7 June 2013 (UTC)
 Since they only have a month, they have no time to waste really. Would it be helpful if we collaborated on a list of short pages that need work, for which there are good quality, up-to-date systematic reviews? Maybe some of them might pick one....

For marking purposes it is easier to have a student work extensively on one article rather than many. Unsure which approach is best though (extensive improvement to one article or small improvements to many) ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 02:49, 8 June 2013 (UTC)
For medical students I think it's best if they pick one article on a substantial topic (a significant disorder, body part, or physiological mechanism, say) and develop it thoroughly.  If they make small contribs to many articles, they won't really develop a sense of ownership for their work.  The trick will be to get them to write in English (rather than medicalese) and to use secondary sources (rather than reference-bombing). ser:Looie496|Looie496 (ser talk:Looie496|talk) 02:58, 8 June 2013 (UTC)
 Yes, I saw they were each taking on one article - but they still have to choose, either out of all the ones on Wikipedia, or perhaps also out of a selected list. I only meant when I said maybe one of them might pick one, that maybe there would be at least one of them who would like to work on one from the list. If they've only got a month, there might be some who know quickly what they want - but they might pick on one that's diabolically hard without realizing it. And others might spend a lot of time trying to decide what they're going to do - and that's time they could have spent on the article. Agree about the medicalese and wanting to include masses of detail &amp; references. ser:Hildabast|Hildabast (ser talk:Hildabast|talk) 03:04, 8 June 2013 (UTC)
Well, the assessment system provides a sort of ready-made list:  say, High or Mid importance articles that are rated Start or Stub.  Some things are blatantly misclassified, but they should be able to figure that out.  The main thing they might have to be warned about is that articles on broad topics are the hardest to write -- yndrome, for example, would be a bastard for most students to deal with. ser:Looie496|Looie496 (ser talk:Looie496|talk) 03:29, 8 June 2013 (UTC)

I think that if they chose from the popular pages list it would be even better. There are several stubs and start class articles in that list. Alternatively if they were interested in improving already developed  articles of high importance (but non-controversial) they could center themselves in a single section (eg: epidemiology of...).--ser:Garrondo|Garrondo (ser talk:Garrondo|talk) 08:03, 9 June 2013 (UTC)

As a CrowdMed Medical Detective (MD), you can use your personal experience, intuition, and online research skills to help solve the world's most difficult medical cases. sounds funny, gives patient-written case reports which have to be solved by the community. The resource trains parsing patients expressions, and shows where the peers medical thinking reached its limits. I thought such a resource should be included into a more-or-less big collection of educational medical website which is apparently lacking; a List-of-educational-medical-resources has the cited items need own wiki article restriction, and it were a collection article with some prosaics on sites which are not as system-relevant as to have own wiki articles, some1 could decide to start it. Last, the collection article would be discarded because wikipedia is not a webdirectory. Think its worth a new thread to discuss this topic, might be wikipedia feels free to be a directory of educational resources ?

 easonal affective disorder

 enoten revisited 

This article was recently created through the AfC process (there is a section above about it), after a review that I think was probably inadequate.  The &quot;drug&quot; comes out of Russia and is actually a homeopathic formulation, although neither the article nor the advertisements one can find come out and say that.  Even if it weren't homeopathic, it couldn't possibly work.  I revised the article to give the actual facts, but the editor who created it has reverted back to the original very misleading form.  The question is what to do about it.  Probably the correct thing is to delete it on the basis of lacking reliable sources, but I'm not at all sure an AfD would succeed, since there are in fact plenty of academic sources, even if none of them happen to be MEDRS-compatible.  Nearly all the sources are from obscure Russian medical journals, and they almost all look very suspicious to me. ser:Looie496|Looie496 (ser talk:Looie496|talk) 19:58, 11 June 2013 (UTC)

It's good we've got a source to identify the product as &quot;homeopathic&quot; but we still don't have an independent secondary source to help establish notability in the first place, can we dig that up, even if in Russian?  ser:Zad68|Zadser_Talk:Zad68|68 17:18, 12 June 2013 (UTC)
At first glance, although a PubMed search returns only primary study results, there's [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=tenoten enough in Google Scholar] to make an attempt at AFD go down in flames if any supporter of the product shows up at the AFD.  Probably the best that can be done is to watchlist and ensure any sourcing used is high-quality. ser:Zad68|Zadser_Talk:Zad68|68 14:17, 12 June 2013 (UTC)
But that's really the problem.  There are no high quality sources, in the sense of sources that meet MEDRS.  (In the meantime Scray reverted back to my version, and then the creator of the article reverted again back to his version.) ser:Looie496|Looie496 (ser talk:Looie496|talk) 14:38, 12 June 2013 (UTC)
Hmmm unfortunately although what Scray put into the article is undoubtedly true it was unsourced and cannot survive the challenge of being reverted.  As much as I hate tags this may be the time to use |Unreliable medical source, |Medref and |Primary sources.  ser:Zad68|Zadser_Talk:Zad68|68 14:45, 12 June 2013 (UTC)
It was me who wrote that material, Scray simply reverted back to it.  I could give sources for all the statements, but the application of them to this &quot;drug&quot; would still be OR because of the lack of reliable sources.  Tags are not enough.  We can't allow medical bullshit in our articles even if it is tagged. ser:Looie496|Looie496 (ser talk:Looie496|talk) 14:52, 12 June 2013 (UTC)
Take it to AFD, make the best case possible, be sure to point out that the sources cited do not meet the P:GNG requirement for significant coverage in independent reliable secondary sources.  I'll comment, publicize the AFD here and hopefully we'll get others too...  I see the creator of that article has gone on to create several more like it at AFC, not trending well.  ser:Zad68|Zadser_Talk:Zad68|68 14:56, 12 June 2013 (UTC)
Agreed. I would say that notability comes for med articles from secondary sources (but not necessarily MEDRS-compliant). Only primary (even if peer-reviewed) sources should not be enough for something to be notable. On the other hand, secondary sources even if not peer-reviewed should be enough for something to be notable. Maybe this issue should be discussed and included somewhere. --ser:Garrondo|Garrondo (ser talk:Garrondo|talk) 15:11, 12 June 2013 (UTC)

 Request for help 

Dear Wikifolks,

Articles have been written regarding hiamine (B1) deficiency which are what I believe to be significantly factually incorrect but the damage is too extensive for a single person to correct. Multiple uncited or poorly cited and poorly written statements are made about these diseases, terminology and pathophysiology which I do not believe are reflected in current scientific consensus. But whenever I look at the articles the amount of work required makes me want to curl up in a little ball. Please help revise these articles, even a little will help!!

Affected Thiamine-deficiency-related articles include:
* eriberi
* orsakoff's psychosis
* ernicke's encephalopathy
* ernicke-Korsakoff syndrome

  I'll keep my eye out if I come across a good source on one of these to go and check. Just in case it helps, I've recently started on a huge page that is catastrophically bad and I was curled in that ball (breathing deeply into a brown paper bag!) at first too. But now I just ignore the fact that it's a tangled mess (perhaps inevitable on a controversial topic where everyone has put their two cents' worth and no one more neutral is doing heavy lifting) - plus, I try to resist the urge to start tinkering on pages that are already pretty good, so that I really can ultimately get the big one in shape. The other thing that I find encourages me is to take something worthwhile about the condition that isn't there yet at all, and I can write it from scratch. Eventually, the islands of good bits will join up into a decent article, is my strategy anyway. SO glad you're tackling these - you're right, those conditions really do matter. Hang in there and drag in friends offline if they're not Wikipedians.

I've got a question about this: we had just decided to prioritize stubs in the most popular articles to improve.

According to my judgement none of those articles met the criterium for &quot;stub&quot; (A very basic description of the topic.Provides very little meaningful content; may be little more than a dictionary definition.) They were all IMO incorrectly labeled as stubs, since they all had several sections and quite a lot of references. The ones I left as stubs were those with the poorest quality. It is true that most probably a similar thing would happen with many of the start-class articles since few people update the articles quality categorizations and many of them might already be C-class. Thing is that those 1500 articles are the ones that receive more visits and hence also are the most probably updated, so quality is overall much higher than over the other 20k articles in medicine, so at this point we have very few stubs among the most popular pages (even the ones I left could hardly be considered stubs). --ser:Garrondo|Garrondo (ser talk:Garrondo|talk) 10:50, 16 June 2013 (UTC)
We have an astonishing amount of what might be called &quot;legacy tagging&quot; in all projects - articles are stub-tagged and later expanded incrementally without removing the tag, or the talkpage rating is set but never updated. This can persist for years even in well-read articles covered by active wikiprojects. I strongly suspect that well over a quarter - perhaps as many as half - of Wikipedia's nominal stubs really aren't. 11:20, 16 June 2013 (UTC)

 The Wikipedia Library now offering accounts from Cochrane Collaboration (sign up!) 

P:TWL/Header

ochrane Collaboration is an independent medical nonprofit organization consisting of over 28,000 volunteers in more than 100 countries. The collaboration was formed to organize medical scholarship in a systematic way in the interests of evidence-based research.

 50 images from the Science Museum collection 

Hi

The Science Museum in London have agreed to release 50 of it's images (at a medium resolution) under a Wikimedia compatible license. Do you have anything in particular you need that they have? Feel free to give me a list if you like. The 2 websites that the images would be available from are:

* http://collectionsonline.nmsi.ac.uk/
* http://www.scienceandsociety.co.uk/ (has to say copyright Science Museum)

I'm hoping this is the start of something larger but could just be a one off so am trying to come up with a most wanted list.

 Deletion discussion 

* euromuscular dentistry
This article has been AfD'd for a while now with minimal interest from this project. Whilst I understand the title may put members here off, it is tagged with WPMED and the neurology task force, and also WPDENT is essentially inactive. This article, far from being about &quot;dentistry&quot;, refers to a (non mainstream) treatment approach to emporomandibular joint dysfunction (or what ever you want to call it) including (i) TENS and (ii) occlusal adjustment. TENS is rarely used for TMD, and the sources that do discuss TENS do not use the term &quot;neuromuscular dentistry&quot;. The vast majority of sources also agree that occlusal adjustment should not be carried out for TMD. Also, this page is not entirely focused on an explanation of what &quot;neuromuscluar dentistry&quot; is. The article goes into depth about TMD itself, in a very weird, non mainstream and unsourced way. 

There are 3 sources. 2 are linking to private physician/dentists websites with links to book an appointment. The other does not meet WPMEDDATE, and importantly does not even use the term &quot;neuromuscular dentistry&quot;. PubMed yields only 3 results for this term, and none are marked as review, but I can't access the text to assess whether they are suitable sources.

Please note that the TMD page discusses already TENS and occlusal adjustment with more appropriate weight, and with MEDRS sources too I might add. I am still working on that page, so I would be happy with a merge, but realistically, there's nothing we can keep imo.

Summary: non neutral POV, promotional article about a minor &quot;gimmick&quot; term used by some dentists/physicians to advertise a non mainstream treatment approach for TMD. ikipedia:Articles for deletion/Neuromuscular dentistry|Comments appreciated here please, thanks. ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 18:18, 17 June 2013 (UTC)

 Anthocyanin 

Our article on nthocyanin seems to rather contradict itself - it states in nthocyanin#Potential food value that &quot;Although anthocyanins are powerful antioxidants in vitro, this antioxidant property is unlikely to be conserved after the plant is consumed. As interpreted by the Linus Pauling Institute and European Food Safety Authority, dietary anthocyanins and other flavonoids have little or no direct antioxidant food value following digestion&quot;. However, it goes on to discuss 'research on health benefits' in another section, which cites several (primary?) sources discussing ongoing laboratory research into anthocyanins, which seem to indicate benefits. This is way outside my subject area, and I'm no way qualified to comment on the reliability of sourcing - perhaps someone from this project could take a look? ser:AndyTheGrump|AndyTheGrump (ser talk:AndyTheGrump|talk) 16:14, 25 June 2013 (UTC)
Unfortunately the literature in that area is a mess, and a straightforward application of MEDRS would allow statements that totally contradict one another.  It looks like the most authoritative source is [http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/scdocs/doc/1489.pdf this review from the European Food Safety Authority], which concludes that there is no good evidence for a meaningful benefit to human health. (That source is already cited in our article.)

 New open access journal:  National Institute of Health Research Journal Library 

;NIHR Journals Library
&quot;The new NIHR Journals Library was officially launched at an event in central London on 20 June, by Lord Howe the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Quality, Department of Health.  The NIHR Journals Library will provide full publication and open access to an extensive body of health research. It comprises a suite of five programme-specific journal series, published online, which are fully searchable and provide a comprehensive record of work funded by these NIHR programmes. Building on the success of the existing Health Technology Assessment journal, the library will give accessible full publication of  findings of the research commissioned by these programmes and will provide an important permanent and comprehensive record of the work which has been funded. 

The NIHR is the world’s first health research funder to publish comprehensive accounts of its commissioned research within its own peer-reviewed collection of journals, which provides more detailed information about the research projects, including protocols, study design, methodologies, interview transcripts and questionnaires, which is not normally included in other journals.&quot;

 Ref styles 

As most are aware I am collaborating with ranslators Without Borders|TWB to improve and translate key medical articles into as many other languages as possible. Right now we are working on about 50 lanaguages per here [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Medicine/Translation_task_force/RTT]. One issue is reference styles. I consistently use what the cite template gives use and which is used across most/all languages versions of Wikipedia. This user in this edit [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dengue_fever&amp;diff=561873271&amp;oldid=561868612] change the style to emplate:cite|ite pmid|22494122|noedit. This style is not supported by Panjabi Wikipedia for example [http://pa.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E0%A8%B5%E0%A8%B0%E0%A8%A4%E0%A9%8C%E0%A8%82%E0%A8%95%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%B0_%E0%A8%97%E0%A9%B1%E0%A8%B2-%E0%A8%AC%E0%A8%BE%E0%A8%A4:Jmh649]. What are peoples thoughts? Is there support for using the cite ref formatting style as created by the ref toolbar for medical article ( or at least for the 80 I am working on )? ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 21:22, 27 June 2013 (UTC)
I think I've long made known the reasons for my distrust for cite pmid, cite doi, etc. They bury crucial information (needed for p:V) in obscure template-space subpages of en watched by no human editor, just some bots. In this example, the template did not exist on .pa, but of course all the subpages are also missing. They could, I suppose have templates which access the .en subpages, but that's even more perverse. There is however some prospect of the problem being impacted by porting the data from those subpages to wikidata. While it will be just as obscure, it should at least be usable in all wikis. This isn't going to happen overnight, but it is certainly being discussed. In the meantime, it might be safer to simply use PMID 1234567 and leave it at that. A determined reader can still click through to the .en article to find further detail on that source. ser:LeadSongDog|LeadSongDog ser talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl! 21:55, 27 June 2013 (UTC)
An additional personal preference is that I very much like seeing all the details in the article text. I find that it makes editing much easier for me as I can see the year and title without have to click a bunch. Hopefully if we move to Wikidata we can set it so these details are still visible to those who want to see them. Or maybe it could be a preference setting so that everyone can get what they want. This could allow setting the refs over many lines or over a single line as each desires. ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 22:02, 27 June 2013 (UTC)
I also prefer the basic cite templates, although as the lesser of eighteen evils -- I often run into trouble editing because all the clutter makes it impossible to parse a paragraph without previewing constantly, but after trying a bunch of things I haven't found any better alternative.  Still, I don't think we should be dictatorial about citation methods.  We can express a preference, but I don't think we can forbid people to use other methods, as long as enough information is present to enable the source to be located.  (Note that regardless of what method you use you're going to have a lot of -type references, where you have to look elsewhere anyhow.) ser:Looie496|Looie496 (ser talk:Looie496|talk) 23:21, 27 June 2013 (UTC)

Per P:CITEVAR, any change to the style at an article requires a separate discussion at that article.  
Personally, I'm not fond of {cite pmid} and the like.  I do like P:List-defined references, especially for articles built around a handful of good sources, and have used the script that II recommends.  
Given that P:VisualEditor just introduced refs, and its limited, although growing, capabilities are going to have a significant effect on what happens for the next couple of months, I'm not sure that it's worth trying to find a solution right now.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 06:20, 28 June 2013 (UTC)

 VisualEditor 

Just a reminder that you are going to have two options for editing pages in about eight hours:  the new P:VisualEditor under &quot;[Edit]&quot; and the old (2002) wikicode system under &quot;[Edit source]&quot;.  The new system will only work in articles and userspace (no talk pages or project pages.)

A lot of you have tried it out, but both will be available for all registered accounts before long.  (Unregistered users/IPs will still be using the old system for at least another week.)

There are a few thing that the new system can't do yet, such as editing templates that are nested within other templates or adding rows to tables, but most of the basic work, such as:
* adding, removing, or changing text, 
* adding inline citations using  tags, and
* adding images

should all be working at a basic level.  Some templates also work.  There is information at ikipedia:VisualEditor/TemplateData about how to tell VisualEditor about our templates, and I think it would be good to have someone do that for l|Infobox disease and the like.  (I haven't figured it out myself yet, though.) 

I think most of you will like the new system, and I think that in the long run we'll see good edits from professionals who are too busy to learn wikicode just to provide updates, but you are not required to use it.  You can easily click [Edit source] to get to the old one.  For those who can't stand to even see that the new system exists, there is a plan for an 'opt-out' switch, but last I heard, there were unexpected technical problems with it (something about the opt-out script loading before VisualEditor loads, and thus being unable to affect VisualEditor), so it may be delayed, but it's on its way.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 12:03, 1 July 2013 (UTC)

 Although I have have used the visual editor for the past few weeks and find it a great improvement for editing in many ways, I am a bit troubled by it going live without proper referencing support, especially with regard to medical articles.

You can use citation templates, but they are not currently auto-filling, and l|cite journal, at least, doesn't seem to be reading the TemplateData yet, so you have to add each parameter, one at a time.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 20:30, 1 July 2013 (UTC)

In my opinion the TemplateData system is not yet usable.  If you make the slightest mistake in setting it up, you will be unable to save your edit, and all you get is a message saying &quot;JSON syntax error&quot;.  I have created TemplateData for Infobox Disease, but I had to save it inside comment tags in emplate:Infobox disease/doc because there's an error in it somewhere that I am unable to spot.

Unless you have something set up differently from me, you now have two &quot;edit&quot; buttons for articles, one that uses VE and an &quot;edit source&quot; button that allows you to edit in exactly the same way that you have always done.

I reworked it a bit. I could probably use some more eyes... also, it needs some references. ser:Nephron|Nephron ser_talk:Nephron| T|pecial:Contributions/Nephron|C 03:02, 2 July 2013 (UTC)

The entire Criticism of the term section needs to be removed.  The criticism sentence is sourced to a blog post of a non-notable individual and it inappropriately generalizes that one individual's criticism of the use of the term.  The other paragraph is unsourced. ser:Zad68|Zadser_Talk:Zad68|68 03:12, 2 July 2013 (UTC)

 Article needing attention from someone familiar with the subject

The article was greatly expanded back in March as part of a class project by a high school student.

The link described it as a research paper sharing group.  That rings copyright violation bells.  Is that description not accurate?  If it's just a discussion group I still would oppose listing as EL, no value over PubMed and the site itself isn't the cite-able resource, only the underlying papers are.  We're supposed to be selecting the sources.  Don't see the value in linking to a bucket of them with no editorial control. ser:Zad68|Zadser_Talk:Zad68|68 02:33, 3 July 2013 (UTC)

From iteUlike FAQ: CiteULike is a free service to help you to store, organise and share the scholarly papers you are reading. When you see a paper on the web that interests you, you can click one button and have it added to your personal library. CiteULike automatically extracts the citation details, so there's no need to type them in yourself, so it is not a link to a search result, but to a list of articles that an individual or group created on a topic. In this case the group on &quot;Autism&quot; is the work of a single individual who is also a Wikipedian (ser:Dolfrog). In this case hence, I do not think it merits inclussion. — Preceding ikipedia:Signatures|unsigned comment added by ser:Garrondo|Garrondo (ser talk:Garrondo|talk • pecial:Contributions/Garrondo|contribs)

Dolfrog, the issue is that the document collection is essentially a Wiki, where any individual with or without credentials can add and comment on individual sources.  This looks like a great resource for individuals with a keen interest in various medical topics but it's not an appropriate resource to link from articles.  The selection of articles is not being done by recognized experts, and the comments are not being fact-checked.

Sorry to come to this late, but I edited in this area a while back, and I share Doc James's concerns. I have long-standing doubts about the research paper citations Dolfrog is adding to articles - both in collections and individually. They appear to be chosen on entirely subjective grounds, leaving sourcing for some articles an obfuscated mess with no clear basis in consensus for inclusion, nor in solid secondary sources. Without that, we have no way of knowing if these sources are being selected neutrally. ser:Gordonofcartoon|Gordonofcartoon (ser talk:Gordonofcartoon|talk) 14:33, 4 July 2013 (UTC)
There are some who confuse consensus with meeting their own private agendas, and the agendas of their own group of lobbyists, and the information they prefer others to read, as opposed to waht is happening in international research to help enlighten and improve the global understanding of of complex issues. From my experiences GordonofCartoon has his own agenda and prefers to block a glabal perspective of research and understanding. ser:Dolfrog|dolfrog (ser talk:Dolfrog|talk) 14:49, 4 July 2013 (UTC)

The only additions of Research paper collections I have added to articles have been CiteULike research paper sharing libraries that have multiple contributors, and which any one can join and add research papers that they believe will improve the understanding of a specific topic. I have over the years compiled various PubMed research paper collections to help both me and others learn more detail regarding various medical issues, and sometimes this has been done to help editors who have been editing a specific Wikipedia article, or help resolve a wiki dispute. All issues are somehow inter-related as part of the bigger picture of life and human evolution, unfortunately some prefer to only focus on a single aspect on an issue. ser:Dolfrog|dolfrog (ser talk:Dolfrog|talk) 15:27, 4 July 2013 (UTC)
Let's look at an example, then. Here's the CiteULike library in the uditory processing disorder article: [http://www.citeulike.org/group/12655/library Audiology and Auditory Processing Disorder]. As far as I can see, all of the 744 papers in it are listed as &quot;posted by Dolfrog&quot;. That anyone else could add papers is irrelevant; since they haven't, it's a one-person compilation. As others have said, the consensus is not to link to research collections anyway; and it's even more beyond the pale when it's an editor's personally-selected linkfarm.. ser:Gordonofcartoon|Gordonofcartoon (ser talk:Gordonofcartoon|talk) 05:42, 5 July 2013 (UTC)

I didn't mean that collections could be used as references; that wouldn't make sense.  I meant that they might sometimes be usable in an external links section, if they are particularly useful resources for a reader who wants to know more about the topic.  Apologies if I misunderstood the topic here. ser:Looie496|Looie496 (ser talk:Looie496|talk) 16:38, 4 July 2013 (UTC)
Looie I tend to agree, but you have to be sceptical of recognmisd bodies who tend to have their own agendas usually of  some financial nature, and individuals, like me, tend to be somewhere on a learning curve. There needs to be some form of mix to discover where research from all sources has discovered, and continues to follow all related developments to help improve the various Wikipedia articles as research improves our understanding of various issues. ser:Dolfrog|dolfrog (ser talk:Dolfrog|talk) 15:39, 4 July 2013 (UTC)
cAn exception is a ystematic review, which will routinely have a companion list of publications included - linking to that would have encyclopedic value (these are accompanied by a Methods section that explains the criteria for inclusion and exclusion). This exception contrasts with a CiteULike collection, the latter being appropriate, perhaps, for a Talk page discussion. -- ser:Scray|Scray (ser talk:Scray|talk) 15:42, 4 July 2013 (UTC)
 you have to be sceptical of recognmisd bodies ... There needs to be some form of mix to discover where research from all sources has discovered, and continues to follow all related developments
It's not our job to do that. Wikipedia is by definition an encyclopedia based on reliable secondary sources, and that roots medical articles firmly in sources considered well-established. If there's a review article summarising where research is going, that's fine - but it's not the job of individual editors to trawl primary research papers and make that analysis (whether overtly, or via choice for inclusion as sources). For instance, what's the consensus or secondary validation for including this obscure primary paper [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Language_processing_in_the_brain&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=562768478] as further reading? ser:Gordonofcartoon|Gordonofcartoon (ser talk:Gordonofcartoon|talk) 16:24, 4 July 2013 (UTC)

 Re-naming abitual abortion 

I've left a note like this on the talk page there, too. The language of abortion is not regarded as patient-centered, is [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16274558 advised against] and slowly going out of use - see also the discussion of the use of the word abortion in relation to miscarriage on the iscarriage page. This should be named recurrent miscarriage, with habitual abortion &amp; early pregnancy loss re-directing to it. You can see in [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=recurrent+miscarriage a search in PubMed] that the accepted nomenclature is now recurrent miscarriage. ser:Hildabast|Hildabast (ser talk:Hildabast|talk) 03:25, 3 July 2013 (UTC)

 Great - thanks for not letting my slip-up lead you astray! I'm going to tackle that bit about the language today - although it's totally right and important that this is the language convention now, what's written about it doesn't reflect the range of women's views on this, and the discussion about this issue, which is nuanced and important. I'll write the general one on the miscarriage page first.ser:Hildabast|Hildabast (ser talk:Hildabast|talk) 15:54, 4 July 2013 (UTC)

I've made major changes to this section, and left a note on the talk page. There's a thread going through the termination of pregnancy language at each stage of pregnancy loss/induced termination that's problematic. I don't want to start on any other sections until I see how this one goes. There's a table in there that is problematic and contradicted what was in the text (and does even more now that the text is more detailed and sourced to formal definitions - it was rather unsourced before). But a lot of work and discussion seemed to go into it, so I was reluctant to delete. It's also totally unsourced. I had to figure out on the talk page where it came from - it's original WP work, but to the reader it would give the impression of coming from an official source I think. I think it would really be better for this original work not to be included.ser:Hildabast|Hildabast (ser talk:Hildabast|talk) 20:58, 4 July 2013 (UTC)
 To be more specific - for example, the table states a survival rate for 24-25 weeks' gestation - that's what I mean by things in there that aren't sourced - not in the table and not in the text. Can't throw around stats like that without source, especially not in something this sensitive. ser:Hildabast|Hildabast (ser talk:Hildabast|talk) 21:13, 4 July 2013 (UTC)

 enstrual cycle and enstrual synchrony articles 

The former is more of a medical article; the latter is more of a theory-based article, but also deals with reporting information about current medical thoughts with regard to the menstrual cycle. I pointed out [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Menstrual_cycle&amp;diff=562880738&amp;oldid=562880442 here] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Menstrual_cycle&amp;diff=562880809&amp;oldid=562880738 here] to ser|Altg20April2nd why he or she should not be adding medical information based on such old sources. The editor is using sources as old as 1937, when pubertal timing (including enarche), for example, generally isn't even the same as it was that long ago. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Altg20April2nd&amp;diff=562884320&amp;oldid=562884178#Follow_WP:MEDRS_at_the_Menstrual_cycle.E2.80.8E_article_and_at_other_articles_dealing_with_medical_topics On his or her talk page], I stated, &quot;You should read P:MEDRS and follow it. Using such old sources for historical information and theories, such as what is included at some parts of the Menstrual synchrony article, is fine. But not when it comes to asserting what the average menstrual length is in human females these days. Because you have not listened to, or rather have not heeded, my concerns about this, I am about to ask members of P:MED to review your edits to the Menstrual cycle‎ article and to review any problematic additions to the Menstrual synchrony article.&quot;

P:MEDDATE is a good rule of thumb, especially for rapidly developing areas of science, but studies on menstrual cycle length isn't one of them.

And even if both groups of sources were reporting the same number of days, or are when comparing some other relatively new sources to the ones Altg20April2nd was adding, WP:MEDRS is clear that we should use the more recent sources. ser:Flyer22|Flyer22 (ser talk:Flyer22|talk) 22:02, 4 July 2013 (UTC)

One of the references inserted by Atlg20April2nd was a study by Chiazze et al. (1968). I just downloaded and looked through (briefly) this article. I won't go into too much detail except to say that the quantitative results from this study needs to be presented and interpreted with caution as it is very context specific. On. p. 379 for example, the authors state &quot;When only those cycles between 15 and 45 days are considered.... the average length drops to 28.1 days....&quot;  In any event, this would too long and unnecessarily complex for the lead (P:lead). Plus, WP  recommends the use of secondary sources P:V as the use of primary sources often results in original research P:OR. So I am reverting it to 28 days unless there is a broad consensus to change it to 29.1 days. ser:Danielkueh|danielkueh (ser talk:Danielkueh|talk) 22:13, 4 July 2013 (UTC)
The problem is that 28-day cycles is not the average length, so you are citing a source that does not support what is in the article.  So, there is no source for it, so I suggest the article should say the length of the cycle is unknown or simply state what is in the scientific literature.  Actually, the way to do it is to cite the three main studies in this area, which were added, and report the range of results.--ser:I am One of Many|I am One of Many (ser talk:I am One of Many|talk) 22:36, 4 July 2013 (UTC)
I will respond on the article main page. And no, we don't rely on the primary sources. We rely on secondary sources so as to avoid original research. Please read P:V, P:OR, and P:V carefully. Thanks. ser:Danielkueh|danielkueh (ser talk:Danielkueh|talk) 22:40, 4 July 2013 (UTC)
Apparently, Atlg20April2nd has been adding the 29.5 days information [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Menstrual_cycle&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=404479975 since 2010]; obviously, it was removed before recently as well. ser:Flyer22|Flyer22 (ser talk:Flyer22|talk) 23:06, 4 July 2013 (UTC)

 New article on reverse T3 

Dear Colleagues; 
I have written an encyclopedic article on reverse T3 that can be used to replace the stub that currently exists, if Wiki wishes.  It has been reviewed by an editor and called &quot;impressive.&quot;  His concerns have been addressed and some sections accordingly re-written.  
His advice was to now post the new article on this site and ask for comments as a prelude to its use.  
My article can be found at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Njmcdaniel/sandbox#Summary.  Would any interested editor with time give it a look?  I believe this will be a useful addition to Wiki.  
Thanks, and please - let me know the next action step to move this project ahead.  Thanks! ser:Njmcdaniel|Njmcdaniel (ser talk:Njmcdaniel|talk) 00:38, 8 July 2013 (UTC) (Alan).

 reatment of Tourette syndrome

 Thanks, Looie ... both of those IPs resolve to Brisbane, Australia, so a note about 3RR applying to an individual, not an account, might be in order.  I was thinking a COI note might also be needed, but http://www.drbarbarablume.com is in Ventura, California, not Australia.  Best, ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 15:32, 5 July 2013 (UTC)
The IP has reinstated drbarbarablume.com sourced text after a note on its talk and 3RR notice ... perhaps semi-protection will help.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 11:53, 6 July 2013 (UTC)

A physician's personal website is still used to source a statement in the article that is contradicted by secondary journal-published reviews.  Would an independent editor please view the discussion on talk?  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 23:28, 8 July 2013 (UTC)

I reverted the offending material again.  I don't quite understand why you left it in place. ser:Looie496|Looie496 (ser talk:Looie496|talk) 23:57, 8 July 2013 (UTC)
 3RR ... regardless if the text was obviously poorly cited and should have been shot on site, there are admins who will block me for even something like that.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 00:23, 9 July 2013 (UTC)
My view is that &quot;tag teaming&quot; is the only reasonable way to deal with unresponsive tendentious editors, so feel free to call on me in case of need.  I would have reverted this earlier if your edit hadn't covered it up in my watchlist.  Anyway, don't let one absurd block shake your confidence.  Regards, ser:Looie496|Looie496 (ser talk:Looie496|talk) 01:07, 9 July 2013 (UTC)
 My confidence is every bit as intact as my sense of reality :)  Or better stated, just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they aren't out to get you :) :)  Anyway, I do have recent reviews, have no reason to believe that text is accurate or can be sourced to a secondary review, but thought others who have journal access might unearth something  ... so left it just in case.

 Linking common terms 

What are peoples thoughts on linking common terms such as &quot;symptoms&quot; in this edit? [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Schizophrenia&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=563372996] Is this something we should routinely do or avoid? ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 13:41, 8 July 2013 (UTC)
I generally favor such links, although not if there are more important words to be linking in that sentence.  Too many bluelinks in a sentence is not desirable.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 14:41, 8 July 2013 (UTC)
Unless it is particularly obnoxious this falls into my personal category of &quot;things to be ignored&quot;, along with changes from British to American spelling or vice versa. ser:Looie496|Looie496 (ser talk:Looie496|talk) 15:45, 8 July 2013 (UTC)
See P:OVERLINK.—ser:Wavelength|Wavelength (ser talk:Wavelength|talk) 15:55, 8 July 2013 (UTC)
I'd go with leaving the hyperlink as it is. Though personally I think &quot;symptoms&quot; comes well under &quot;everyday words understood by most readers in context&quot;, a quick skim of medical articles - see internal search for &quot;symptoms&quot; [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=symptoms&amp;title=Special%3ASearch&amp;fulltext=1] - suggests that hyperlinking the word is usual here. ser:Gordonofcartoon|Gordonofcartoon (ser talk:Gordonofcartoon|talk) 16:08, 8 July 2013 (UTC)
Would wikilink &quot;symptoms&quot; if I wanted to make a distinction with &quot;signs&quot; close by. Another example of where I would wikilink this is &quot; ... is a symptom not a diagnosis&quot; where latter is also wikilinked. Questionable need to wikilink the word otherwise imo, but like Looie suggests, this is mostly harmless. ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 16:23, 8 July 2013 (UTC)
I think links are generally useful for words that are being used with a technical meaning. For instance, some readers may not be familiar with the ymptom#Symptom_versus_sign|distinction/overlap between &quot;symptoms&quot; and  &quot;signs&quot;. So, yes, I do think it's potentially useful, especially since we're trying to write for a wide range of users consulting Wikipedia for a variety of reasons. pecial:Contributions/86.161.251.139|86.161.251.139 (ser talk:86.161.251.139|talk) 18:03, 8 July 2013 (UTC)

Positive/negative symptoms?
*On a related point, is there perhaps a P:WEIGHT|weight issue in ymptom#Positive_and_negative_symptoms, given that this relatively large chunk of the page dedicated to symptoms as a general concept seems primarily to pertain to schizophrenia (chizophrenia#Positive_and_negative_symptoms) [http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=%22positive+symptoms%22+%22negative+symptoms%22]? pecial:Contributions/86.161.251.139|86.161.251.139 (ser talk:86.161.251.139|talk) 18:32, 8 July 2013 (UTC)
That section is pretty minimal. I don't think positive/negative symptoms could be mentioned in any less space without actually deleting the content completely. Maybe the rest of the article is just a bit underdeveloped at this stage? Deleting that content would also take away most of the references ... which in truth is a poor reason to argue against deleting content ... but basically I think the article as a whole would benefit more from an expansion of the other sections rather than removing this part. ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 18:45, 8 July 2013 (UTC)
Yes, I agree this sort of imbalance tends to be part and parcel of relatively brief pages.  pecial:Contributions/86.161.251.139|86.161.251.139 (ser talk:86.161.251.139|talk) 19:00, 8 July 2013 (UTC)

I have contacted the editor in Spanish and explained to him in our language the importance of secondary sources and better English. I have to say that after a quick search I have also seen a similar pattern of editing by this user in the Spanish article. --ser:Garrondo|Garrondo (ser talk:Garrondo|talk) 20:27, 9 July 2013 (UTC)

 ehydration therapy and ral rehydration therapy 

I've stuck a WPMED template on the previously blank talk page of anagement of dehydration. This page is the redirect for the key search term, &quot;Rehydration therapy&quot;. I've also linked to Management of dehydration in the ral rehydration therapy lead (as well as to luid_replacement#Intravenous). I'm wondering whether anything else might readily be done to co-ordinate the content of these two pages regarding a simple, life-saving intervention. pecial:Contributions/86.161.251.139|86.161.251.139 (ser talk:86.161.251.139|talk) 08:31, 9 July 2013 (UTC)
Looks good as a nested article from ehydration#Treatment. As I understand it this is the structure that the MEDMOS recommends. Could be argued to merge the content of the later pages you mention into this new page. Or make it into a parent article for both... ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 10:36, 9 July 2013 (UTC)
A P:SUMMARY|summary style approach feels right to me too, and preferable to merging. Dehydration#Treatment already links to Management of dehydration as the &quot;main article&quot;. I wonder whether turning ral rehydration solution (renamed as such?) into a subpage of ehydration therapy (also renamed?) might help sharpen the focus of those two pages. pecial:Contributions/86.161.251.139|86.161.251.139 (ser talk:86.161.251.139|talk) 12:31, 9 July 2013 (UTC)
