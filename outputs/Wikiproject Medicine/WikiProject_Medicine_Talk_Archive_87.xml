Redirect
There is a proposal to delete this redirect. Wondering others thoughts? [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Clear_liquids#Contested_deletion] ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk · pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 09:14, 28 August 2016 (UTC)

It's already been deleted.  Again, because the excuse given is a RFD discussion from June, in which nobody participating seems to know much about medicine.
&quot;Clear liquids&quot; (in the plural) is a typical phrase for referring to a clear iquid diet, and I don't expect it to be used often in the sense of merely a transparent liquid (a significant concern at the prior RFD).  A [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&amp;profile=default&amp;fulltext=Search&amp;search=%22clear+liquids%22&amp;searchToken=864xzrufy3wg33u8cei6y26rn search on the quoted phrase] turns up 13 hits, at least 11 of which are references to a clear liquid diet.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 21:06, 28 August 2016 (UTC)

Recreate
Should we recreate the redirect from lear_liquids to iquid diet#Clear

*The correct place to have this discussion should be P:DRV. You're thinking from a medical perspective, but for me, clear liquids are literally any liquid that is clear. It doesn't necessarily refer to a liquid diet. Honestly, I'd be fine with the redirect if someone could explain the usage of the term at iquid diet. Right now, it's not even mentioned, making confusing for our non-medical readers like myself.  --ser:Tavix| Tavix (ser talk:Tavix|talk) 01:42, 29 August 2016 (UTC)
ser: Tavix did you ever have a flu and were told to &quot;drink clear liquids&quot;?

*Note from admin deleting the recreated redirect: there was a deletion discussion with clear consensus to delete, and the article was recreated quickly after.  As per the deletion discussion, the current situation is confusing - the term is 'general', and could mean anything (at the moment I am staring at two bottles of clear liquid at my desk, I will not discuss my further dietary issues, if any, on Wikipedia), and where it redirects to is not clearly stating that the term is really so commonly used for that specific use.
As Tavix here is saying, the correct pathway would have been a P:DRV.  --ser:Beetstra|Dirk Beetstra ser_Talk:Beetstra|T pecial:Contributions/Beetstra|C 04:56, 29 August 2016 (UTC)

*Beetstra is correct here; a local consensus can not overturn a community wide decision. That decision happened ikipedia:Redirects_for_discussion/Log/2016_June_11#Clear_liquids|here. While I am confident this project is well meaning, it can not overturn that decision. As noted, P:DRV is the way forward. --ser:Hammersoft|Hammersoft (ser talk:Hammersoft|talk) 15:28, 29 August 2016 (UTC)
*: Beestra is a long way from correct here. There is no way forward via P:DRV and I'd be amazed if you both of you didn't know it. DRV is only useful in practice when the closer made a mistake in assessing consensus (which was 7-0 in favour of deletion on 18 June 2016), or when something new has arisen since the debate. Since neither of those are true, why are you suggesting wasting folks' time with a pointless DRV? The only way that a recreated redirect stands any chance of being kept is if the article iquid diet is expanded to clearly explain that 'clear liquids' has a significant use as a phrase relevant to a liquid diet - preferably with good sourcing. Once that has happened, the arguments presented at ikipedia:Redirects_for_discussion/Log/2016_June_11#Clear_liquids are superseded to some extent and it would be worth recreating the redirect once more, IMHO. Only then would DRV be useful, should the redirect be deleted again. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 16:47, 29 August 2016 (UTC)
To further |RexxS's argument see the multiple discussions at ser talk:Beetstra. ser:CFCF|Carl Fredrikser talk:CFCF| 💌 pecial:EmailUser/CFCF|📧 16:54, 29 August 2016 (UTC)
cI think it's clear (no pun intended) that new information has come to light since the closure of the RFD, so a DRV could prove fruitful. At the RFD, there was no discussion about how it's used as a common synonym, just a bunch of editors agreeing with me that &quot;clear liquids&quot; is a vague phrase that doesn't necessarily refer to a &quot;clear liquid diet.&quot; I do agree that the term should be discussed and sourced there though. --ser:Tavix| Tavix (ser talk:Tavix|talk) 16:59, 29 August 2016 (UTC)
* RexxS, I'm quite aware of other paths. However, given the reality that ambiguity isn't going away, DRV is the only way forward if it is to be a redirect to the diet. I didn't mean to imply that it had a high chance of success. In fact, it has an extremely low chance of success. The deletion discussion ran its proper course, had enough people contributing to it, was properly closed by an uninvolved administrator, and was properly acted on. DRV would likely snow oppose a DRV over it. As to ambiguity; did you know that &quot;clear liquid&quot; can refer to cocaine in liquid form? Did you know that &quot;clear liquid&quot; emanating from the breast can be an indicator of rolactinoma? Did you know that &quot;clear liquid&quot; may refer to mucus and stomach acid emanating from the body in the form of vomit after all food has been expelled? Did you know that grain alcohol is a clear liquid? And on and on and on. Having &quot;clear liquid&quot; default to a form of diet is dramatically inappropriate. At best, I could see a disambiguation page. --ser:Hammersoft|Hammersoft (ser talk:Hammersoft|talk) 17:58, 29 August 2016 (UTC)
* For &quot;an extremely low chance of success&quot;, I think you mean &quot;zero chance of success&quot;? And I am indeed aware of other uses of &quot;clear liquids&quot; (note the plural). Nevertheless, there's no point in proposing an entry on Wikipedia unless there's decent sourcing for it. If there's sufficient to establish separate notability, then let's have an article. If there's just enough to make reasonable entry in another article, then let's have a redirect to it. Of course, if there are sufficiently well sourced examples of multiple meanings, then by all means let's have a dab page. However, inappropriate as it may be, if there's only one sourced target for a redirect, you can't have a dab page with only article to navigate to, sorry. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 18:32, 29 August 2016 (UTC)
* Then create a dab. I found those mentions after just a cursory review of potential sources. Recreating it as a redirect to a diet would be inappropriate. --ser:Hammersoft|Hammersoft (ser talk:Hammersoft|talk) 18:38, 29 August 2016 (UTC)
* You can create the dab if you think your sources are good enough to fill out the articles you want to point to. If there is only one properly sourced target, then a dab page would not be viable, but a redirect would be perfectly appropriate. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 20:38, 29 August 2016 (UTC)
* No, it isn't, and per the ikipedia:Redirects_for_discussion/Log/2016_June_11#Clear_liquids|prior deletion discussion it would be speedy deleted, as has already happened three times. It is highly inadvisable to recreate it, yet again, without seeking a new consensus to override the existing one. --ser:Hammersoft|Hammersoft (ser talk:Hammersoft|talk) 22:37, 29 August 2016 (UTC)
** DRV handles cases in which &quot;significant new information has come to light since a deletion that would justify recreating the deleted page&quot;.  &quot;Come to light&quot; probably covers cases in which none of the participants knew the information, even though it's easily available (just put &quot;clear liquids&quot; (don't forget the plural) into your favorite search engine, and see how long it takes to get past webpages about colonoscopy prep and surgery).  So technically it is possible for DRV to handle this.  It's probably worth jumping through the hoop.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 22:56, 29 August 2016 (UTC)

Currently teaching a team of 3rd-year medical students on the wards, I asked them during our first session (a few days ago) about the sources they use. They reported that it depends on topic; generally, they start with UpToDate but have been admonished by other faculty that it's only a starting point, like Wikipedia (they were clearly reluctant to mention WP but relieved when I did not snort). I enjoyed that, and as we discussed further they were able to describe how they seek sources that we would consider MEDRS, as time permits.

Well, I figured it needed trimming somewhat, maybe some of the awards and details about his projects; that's why I posted a request here.  I did expect, however, that editors here would use medical or academic sources to which I have no access to provide references for some of the information, not just delete it all, including standard stuff such as his education, academic history, books, selected highly cited papers, and even the section headings. It's unlikely that a researcher could accrue [https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=t_jZzN4AAAAJ&amp;hl=en 30,000 citations] without at least a few of them verifying information about him. It's obvious that no one even looked; the mass removal of content began 12 minutes after I posted here.  As to why I moved it to mainspace, |Jytdog, AfC instructions say to do that with any draft that has at least a 50% chance of surviving an AfD.

The piPen is the treatment for anaphylaxis which can be fatal; kids with allergies carry them around in their backpacks.

As a result it's hard for the uninsured to afford, putting lives at risk.  There's been a burst of media coverage over the last few days, reminiscent of araprim and artin Shkreli.

** It's not a question of whether the subjects are similar, or anything like that.  It's a question of whether there are editors there.  To quote the definition from P:WikiProject, A WikiProject is a ocial group|group of contributors who want to work together as a eam to improve Wikipedia..  No people, no WikiProject.  Conversely, it's okay to have multiple groups working on the same subject.

**:Actually I'd disagree with that. They are very different and require different kinds of expertise. If editors want to work on one or the other that's fine  but perhaps the project itself should have its own integrity. and be led by those with more experience and expertise in the area. I also agree that a takeover of the vet med project is probably not a good idea. (Desclaimer: I have worked a little in animal related articles  because I love animals but have never signed up for the vet med project) Wikipedia actually changes quite quickly so if the project is there perhaps vets and other interested editors may come.

**:: I don't see much practical point in disagreeing with the formal guidelines myself.  A WikiProject is people.  It's not &quot;pages&quot;.  It's not &quot;an area&quot;.  I quoted the actual definition on the English Wikipedia:  A WikiProject is a ocial group.  I agree that if a group of editors is active on that talk pages, that it might prove attractive to someone else, but it is not true that if neglected pages exist (which they still would, because task forces get separate pages, including talk pages, and all existing URLs would redirect there), then those inactive pages will prove attractive to newcomers.  BTW, I have been watching WikiProjects for six or eight years now.  In my experience, &quot;build it (or leave it) and they will come&quot; almost never works.  In fact, it seems to work less well now than it used to, and it never worked well.  We've had remarkably few successful (i.e., still active just one year later) WikiProjects created in the last couple of years.  I can think of exactly two offhand.  Nearly all of the new ones are started by one or two people with limited experience, in the hope that if the pages are there, then it will attract other editors.  But that simply doesn't work.   ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 21:25, 1 September 2016 (UTC)
**::: I concede  to your greater experience, but  its not accurate or fair to say I am disagreeing with a formal guideline. I'm not. Projects have Wikipedia &quot;space&quot; and of course the projects are made up of editors what else could they be on this kind of collaborative system. Further, Vet med isn't a new project put together by some new inexperienced editor. There have been vets on Wikipedia and may be again and there are editors with experience both with animals and animal articles; I don't believe for one second they will go to human medicine to look for a vet med project. A more direct route for inclusion in a project is to have a project  in place. Editors come and go all the time. We don't cancel something because an editor leaves; we wait for someone else to show up which often times they do. I didn't believe the projects should be merged, but having seen the cmt below by a vet its up to the more experienced people in this field to decide; I've stated my position and will bow out.

You're saying &quot;let's have people in place when there are no people in place&quot;.  That's not logical.

*Support Having veterinary experience and being a member there for about 2 years now, I think it would overall be beneficial to move vet med over to a task force. Veterinary medicine and human medicine are overall pretty similar in all the core concepts. Often times we're dealing with similar diseases and treatment methods. The only main difference is that vet med tackles multiple species (the reality ongoing joke is that med school is easier than vet school because of this). The closest fit otherwise would be in Wikiproject Agriculture, but not all vet med is in agriculture either. Vet Med was marked as inactive sometime ago, so it has reached the point where ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing's comments are very valid with respect to scope not being the issue so much as activity. A taskforce under WikiProject Medicine would hopefully draw in more medical minded folks potentially interested in the topic. It's generally difficult to draw in agricultural editors from any specific area, so this proposal seems like the most beneficial option all-around. As a member, I'm really not seeing any significant justification amongst the opposes that would illustrate a consensus not to go ahead with the change. ser:Kingofaces43|Kingofaces43 (ser talk:Kingofaces43|talk) 18:12, 1 September 2016 (UTC)

*Oppose Yes, WikiProjects are groups of people interested in collaboratively editing articles. I'd imagine that the group of editors interested in human medicine are not interested in veterinary medicine, and vice versa - which is why the two separate projects exist in the first place...because these are different groups of people who work on different types of articles. Trying to revive an inactive project with disinterested editors just for the purpose of watching for discussions doesn't seem like a good reason. If some WP:MED editors are interested in article alerts for veterinary medicine, they can do that at WP:VETMED. If a group of people want to revive WP:VETMED, then they can go ahead and do so. --ser:Scottalter|Scott Alter (ser talk:Scottalter|talk) 00:46, 2 September 2016 (UTC) 
** There's actually significant overlap.  Veterinarians do a lot of public health work, because they know a lot about zoonotic diseases.  They are involved in medical research.  Even in a simple small-animal pet clinic, they also use many of the same treatments that are used in human healthcare.   But none of that matters.

***If there is no one left, then there is no one able to object. Not having objections at VETMED would be the first step. However, there would be no benefit to WPMED and no reason to merge...it'd still be the same people with the same interests working on the same project. If the merged projects would have the same group of editors, then you'd need to ask WPMED if they are interested in expanding the scope of the project to include veterinary medicine. This is the second step. It seems like people from the the VETMED/animal projects are opposed to a merger, and it seems like people from WPMED are mixed on taking on veterinary medicine. I don't see any consensus here, and its leaning much more towards oppose. --ser:Scottalter|Scott Alter (ser talk:Scottalter|talk) 15:09, 2 September 2016 (UTC)
On the contrary, there doesn't seem to be much P:CONSENSUS (i.e., we don't just count votes) leaning towards an oppose amongst us vet members. We're mostly seeing P:JUSTDONTLIKEIT arguments and votes rather than solid justification for not going ahead with the change in terms of the guidance we have on dealing with inactive projects. Regardless of how many other members simply display opposition, we'd need some strong arguments based on our Wikiproject guidelines to say members are opposed in terms of consensus.

 Information about merging WikiProjects 

WikiProjects are people, not subject areas.  The first thing that matters in these discussions is whether any people exist.  We have some good data on the (in)activity for this WikiProject, so let's look at a few facts:

* The last time anyone replied to any comment at that project's talk page (not counting the comments from the last few days, of course) was in 2014.  Getting zero replies to all questions that were asked over the space of the last two years(!) is a pretty reliable sign of a dead project.  If there were any editors who are actually trying to work together to improve articles (=the definition of a WikiProject), then you'd have expected someone to reply to at least some of those questions, or to talk to the other editors in the group, wouldn't you?  But nobody did.  So that's one indication that the group is dead.
* There are allegations of &quot;active editing&quot; in the articles.  However, if you look at the history of ser:WP 1.0 bot/Tables/Project/Veterinary medicine|the stats we keep on article quality, there's been almost no change during the last couple of years.  Relevant calculations such as ser:WP 1.0 bot/WikiWork/om show almost no change (actually, some of them have shown an average worsening of the situation, but no more than you'd expect from a few more stubs getting tagged [by other editors] for the WikiProject). 
* As SMcCandlish noted, these decisions are made by the participants of the (two) affected projects – not random editors.  In particular, participants in VETMED basically have veto rights.  Who's a participant?  A participant is someone who is trying to work with others on the articles of interest to the group.  
**A reasonable expectation is that any such participants will be actively editing that area.  We have a complete, bot-generated list of all people (including IPs) who are actively editing in that area ikipedia:WikiProject Directory/Description/WikiProject Veterinary medicine|right here.  (The list includes people who just happen to have made a few edits but aren't interested in working with others, so it is participants plus non-participants.)  It's a short list, and at a quick glance, the only people who have joined this discussion and whose names are in that list are Doc James and SMcCandlish, and I don't believe that either of them claim to be VETMED participants.  (Of course, please tell me if I missed your name.)  That metric indicates that nobody here can claim to be an active participant in VETMED, and therefore that nobody's vote counts on behalf of VETMED (nor, of course, would mine).
** You can also find participants by looking at membership lists, although they're notoriously incomplete and always out of date.  Using that metric, ser:Montanabw is at least a former participant in the project.  If she's opposed, no matter why she's opposed, then it's probably worth respecting her opposition.  She may want to P:REVIVE it as an active group, which is just fine.  If she changes her mind and decides that having someone else manage template hassles or other boring maintenance issues would free her up to do other things, then that's okay, too.

Now I've got no particular interest in this merge; I don't have strong opinions about it either way.  The group is functionally dead at the moment, so the result just doesn't matter.  From where I stand, WPMED won't get any benefit (e.g., new participants with new perspectives) and a merge probably wouldn't harm anyone (because VETMED's pages would get MOVEd into WPMED's &quot;space&quot;, but probably still be just as dead as it's been for two years).  So IMO WPMED can let it keep itrot|rotting on its own, or it can play caretaker for any administrative hassles (like removing the link to the list of recent changes from the top of its page, which hasn't worked since 2013) unless and until someone is interested in the subject in the future, so the outcome of this proposal just doesn't matter to me.  

But the procedure matters a great deal to me.  WikiProjects are social groups.  It's no good trying to force someone to play with you.  It doesn't work in the middle school lunchroom, and it doesn't work on Wikipedia.  So let's let the actual participants in VETMED, if any current ones can be found, decide for themselves, without a bunch of non-participants trying to decide what they &quot;ought&quot; to want.  My fellow WPMED folks who wish to express a POV are welcome to say whether you'd accept them, if they chose to join us.  But let's please confine our (WPMEDders') comments to our own affairs.  If anyone's active in VETMED (and perhaps just on vacation this week), then they don't need us to tell them what to do.   ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 22:08, 30 August 2016 (UTC)

I have posted messages at the various animal wikiprojects.  The bottom line is that I and all the other editors can go join the wikiproject if it matters that much to you (and by the way, I'm a she, not a he, though it's not that big of a deal), but most of the articles tagged for vetmed are being worked on by the animal project editors, and we don't always go in and upgrade the assessments at talk where we maybe added some sources but still think the thing is C-class.  There was a time (like 10 years ago when I started here) when there were several real vets on the project and a bit of implication that only real vets should join because -- someone worried about not giving out medical advice or who knows? But the point is, we don't delete or merge inactive members, and I would hate to see this project &quot;downgraded&quot; either -- a task force is a &quot;child&quot; project of a &quot;parent,,&quot; not a question of active or inactive.  This was an itch that no one needed to scratch and the wiki servers won't crash if it remains a stand-alone project.  Someone will come along and revive it, eventually.  ser:Montanabw|Montanabwser talk:Montanabw|(talk) 23:46, 30 August 2016 (UTC)
Maybe this was a wake-up call?  I'm ok with putting my name on the list if that's what we need to do but now I'm wondering...I just created an article and mentioned blister beetle poisoning as the cause of death for a notable horse, so for those instances, should I start adding a WPVET banner on the TP, or would it only apply to articles about vet meds or....? ser:Atsme|Atsmeser talk:Atsme |📞pecial:EmailUser/Atsme|📧 00:14, 31 August 2016 (UTC)
I think we do need to start adding ikiProject Veterinary medicine assessments for health-related articles (such as lister beetles, but not individual horses that died from ingesting them).  If its horse health, and you might call a vet, then yes.  ser:Montanabw|Montanabwser talk:Montanabw|(talk) 01:04, 31 August 2016 (UTC)
ser:Atsme, the scope of a project is whatever the group decides.  Most groups choose a scope that makes sense to other people, but that's not actually required.  The scope is something that should be discussed at T:VETMED, by whomever wants to work as part of that group.  The &quot;work together to improve articles&quot; bit is far more important than the &quot;put your name on a list&quot; bit. 
And, again, if there are members of VETMED (Montanabw certainly seems to be one), and those members oppose a merge, then this proposal's dead.  &quot;Hostile takeovers&quot; are not permitted.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 11:43, 31 August 2016 (UTC)

&quot;Mind's eye&quot; is just another (often informal) way of referring to mental imagery, and mental imagery has been the subject of research for a long time with a credible journal dedicated to it, [http://www.journalofmentalimagery.com/ The Journal of Mental Imagery], founded in 1977, and another credible journal, [https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/imagination-cognition-and-personality/journal202395 Imagination, Cognition and Personality], founded in 1981 has an emphasis on mental imagery.
The following sources demonstrate how &quot;mind's eye&quot; is used in the literature:
* [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0015217 Closing the Mind's Eye: Incoming Luminance Signals Disrupt Visual Imagery (2010)]: &quot;It has been proposed that mental imagery is akin to perception in the absence of external stimulation, a product of sensory information retrieved from memory [1]. It is often referred to as seeing with the mind's eye, hearing with the mind's ear, or feeling with the mind's skin [2].&quot;
* [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22058106 Evaluating the mind's eye: the metacognition of visual imagery. (2011)]: only uses &quot;mind's eye&quot; once, and in a way consistent with the above description: &quot;In the study reported here, we demonstrated that the vividness of mental imagery can predict the perceptual consequences of that imagery. When an image in the mind’s eye was judged as more clear  and  vivid,  it  had  a  reliably  greater impact  on  subsequent perception.&quot;
* [http://f1000.com/prime/reports/b/2/34 Seeing with the mind's eye: top-down, bottom-up, and conscious awareness. (2010)]. Only uses &quot;mind's eye&quot; once, and in a way consistent with the above description: &quot;Moreover, visual imagery of faces and objects evoked activity in parietal and frontal cortex, suggesting that content-related activation during imagery is mediated by the retrieval of face and object representations from long-term memory and their maintenance in the ‘mind’s eye’&quot;.
* [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2823980/ Reading the Mind's Eye: Decoding Category Information During Mental Imagery (2010)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20969839 Visual mental imagery: what the head's eye tells the mind's eye (2011)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18584868 Visualizing numbers in the mind's eye: the role of visuo-spatial processes in numerical abilities (2008)]. None of these use the term &quot;mind's eye&quot; in article text, but usage in title supports as referring to mental imagery.
The term &quot;aphantasia&quot; was proposed in [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945215001781 Lives without imagery – Congenital aphantasia (2015)] with the following text: &quot;We  propose  the  use  of  the  term  ‘ aphantasia’  to  refer  to  a  condition  of  reduced  or  absent  voluntary  imagery.

 Out-of-process categories 

It looks like ser:Mario Castelán Castro has been manually trying to move around some of the psychoactive drug categories outside the P:CFD process. It's not my area at all, I came across it whilst doing some non-topic-related category work but could someone take a look at his pecial:Contributions/Mario_Castelán_Castro|recent edits? I've no idea whether he's being helpful or not, but looking at his Talk page history it looks like he's not the greatest consensus-builder. TIA (also posted to WP Pharmacology) ser:Le Deluge|Le Deluge (ser talk:Le Deluge|talk) 18:23, 2 September 2016 (UTC)

 I have reorganized some categories. Diffs for categories do not show the relevant differences. Therefore, you can't easily see the difference that I have made. However, you can see the end result. The content is now more logically organized. No coverage in topics was lost due to these edits. For example, now psychoactive drugs can be browsed by Category:Drugs by psychological effects‎|effects and Category:Psychoactive drugs by mechanism of action|mechanism of action (those are just 2 examples of several categories I have created which have been populated the same day because they were highly needed to organize otherwise scattered categories).
 If you are going to write your opinion on an editor's contribution history, please take the care to look properly instead of just taking a quick glance at the first page of &quot;Special:Contribution&quot;. Your criticism to be highly biased against me. I have performed several contributions far overshadowing the pre-existing content in those articles in length and importance. The most recent one is when I pecial:Diff/733455707|added 50,000+ characters with tens of sources from scientific journals about the molecular biology of kin whitening.

In practice, P:CFD is pretty much expected for any large-scale messing about with categories. P:BOLD works well for the quieter corners of Wikipedia but where there's a reasonable number of people interested, as in the category hierarchy, then P:CONSENSUS is expected. There's also the practical issue that going through the CFD process is a lot less effort, as the &quot;prize&quot; for getting consensus is that bots do all the hard work! In my experience, when an individual starts doing lots of manual category changes like that, then 4 times out of 5 they are doing so against consensus. Experience also suggests that people who blank their User Talk page usually do so because they have something to hide about their interactions with other Wikipedians, it didn't inspire confidence when looking at the history one of the most recent deletions was [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mario_Castel%C3%A1n_Castro&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=737306197 this complaint]. So that was why I was a little bit wary - nothing more - and was just asking for someone with more experience to take a look at the edits. I wasn't demanding they got reverted or anything, just asking for a second opinion as experience suggested they could be against consensus.ser:Le Deluge|Le Deluge (ser talk:Le Deluge|talk) 23:19, 2 September 2016 (UTC)
To ser:Le Deluge|Le Deluge: All of the text you have added here since you created this section amounts to merely:
* A pretentious complaint based around the premise that I should have followed your preferred way of doing things. I am not going to abide by your opinion and preferences as if they were policy. If my way of editing does not conform to your taste, do not complain to me.
* A lot of unfounded assumptions about my behavior from which you make incorrect inferences of wrongdoing on my part.
 Replying to “In practice, P:CFD is pretty much expected for any large-scale messing about with categories.”: This a dishonest phrasing. You expect this, but it is not the policy. Therefore, this is yet another case of you pretending that I have to abide by your opinion as if it was policy, which I am not going to do.
 It is nosense to suggest that blanking one's talk page is because one has “something to hide”. The history is available. Also, I have practiced blanking my user talk page since I began editing Wikipedia. Your personal comments and insinuations against me are out of place on Wikiproject talk pages. If this continues, this may be interpreted as a breach of P:AGF and P:NPA.
 ser:Mario Castelán Castro|Mario Castelán Castro (ser talk:Mario Castelán Castro|talk) 23:52, 2 September 2016 (UTC).
Sigh. P:CFD is not &quot;my opinion and preferences&quot;, it is the mechanism by which P:CONSENSUS is reached in relation to major changes to categories, per the P:Categorization guideline. If you have a problem with the need for consensus, then maybe Wikipedia is not for you. Again I repeat - I was not trying to get your work deleted, I was just drawing attention to it for a second opinion, a way to gain consensus for your changes after the fact since you hadn't gone through the normal mechanism for reaching consensus. That's all. There's no need to make a big deal of it. ser:Le Deluge|Le Deluge (ser talk:Le Deluge|talk) 01:04, 3 September 2016 (UTC)
 P:CFD isn't even an appropriate place for routine P:SUBCAT work, let alone being required by policy. CFD is for &quot;renaming, merging or deletion of categories&quot;, none of which this user has done. A general discussion of how to choose subcategories would be better had at a relevant wikiproject, but it definitely isn't so controversial as to necessitate discussion. Nobody thinks you are trying to get someone's work deleted, but you shouldn't go around posting to multiple message boards stating that someone doesn't look like &quot;the greatest consensus-builder&quot; without even provocation. ser:M. A. Bruhn|M. A. Bruhn (ser talk:M. A. Bruhn|talk) 01:50, 3 September 2016 (UTC)
 This user has renamed categories that affect a large number of drug articles.  The relevant Wiki project to discuss these changes would have been at T:PHARMA which this user has not done.  This user also has a history of making controversial changes without obtaining prior consensus (see for example ist of designer drugs). Obtaining consensus before making potentially controversial changes is the preferred way of doing things, especially if it affects a large number of articles which it has in this case. ser:Boghog|Boghog (ser talk:Boghog|talk) 06:41, 3 September 2016 (UTC)
WP:CAT recommends a listing at CFD for &quot;complicated re-categorization of existing categories&quot;.  (CFD is not recommended when you are re-catting hundreds of articles in a simple way.)

It's a novel feature, but inserting into the See Also section violates OS:SEEALSO which specifies these sections should only contain a bulleted list of internal wikilinks to other articles. There's no precedent that I can see for it's usage in articles; it's an implementation of the &quot;Category tree&quot; template which [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Category_tree&amp;limit=500 appears commonly in Wikiproject, portal, category, and talk spaces] but is only used [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AWhatLinksHere&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Template%3ACategory+tree&amp;namespace=0 once in article space]. If it's to be included in articles then it would definitely be most appropriate to include alongside the navigation templates. Addition of a novel navigation template like this to many pages is likely to be controversial. A discussion should be started at T:PHARMA (since they are most relevant since these are drug articles) to seek consensus. ser:M. A. Bruhn|M. A. Bruhn (ser talk:M. A. Bruhn|talk) 06:15, 5 September 2016 (UTC)
It's just the category tree.  It gives you exactly the same list that you would get if you went to the same category.  (Compare the contents of Category:Antipsychotics vs what you find under the first item in this list.)  If memory serves, categories aren't visible on mobile devices.  This might help mobile readers (about half of readers) find the categories.  However, it doesn't work the same way on the mobile website.  In particular, utline of stagecraft precedes the collapsed list with the instruction to &quot;Click the &quot;►&quot; below to see all subcategories:&quot;.  The &quot;►&quot; arrow is not visible on the mobile website and clicking the name of the category takes you to the category page rather than displaying the list. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 06:58, 5 September 2016 (UTC)
The template itself provides 4 category trees, the first category tree is the drug (in this case Antipsychotics), and then it provides the following 3 category trees  ► Drug classes defined by psychological effects ► Drugs by psychological effects ► Psychoactive drugs. The categories not appearing on mobile makes it seem as though the community doesn't want categories to appear on mobile (I wouldn't know why, but then again I always use the desktop version on my phone). I would like it if somehow the category bar itself allowed navigating the category trees. ser:M. A. Bruhn|M. A. Bruhn (ser talk:M. A. Bruhn|talk) 07:42, 5 September 2016 (UTC)
Neither desktop nor mobile is fully controlled by volunteers, and volunteers did not make that decision.  (This is probably a good thing, because very few of us have the necessary skills.)  The mobile has been designed to make it easier, faster, and cheaper to use on smartphones.  It omits a number of elements such as navboxes and categories.  And even though they've done a lot of work on that, Google has decided it's still too heavy, and stripped it down even further for users in developing countries.  Compare these three views:
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen (desktop)
* https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen (mobile)
* https://icl.googleusercontent.com/?lite_url=http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen (Google's bandwidth-sparing version)
Most editors at the English Wikipedia really don't know or even care about how the site looks or works on mobile.  If we cared, then we'd have gotten rid of several column templates, designed navboxes (which are tables) so that they don't take up multiple screenfuls on small boxes, written better leads, etc.  Among non-editing readers, the existence of the mobile site occasionally gets sent word-of-mouth through social networks as &quot;the secret&quot; way to make Wikipedia easier to read, even among users who use desktop machines.

***soupvector that is a good point.  I don't know what the right answer is for mobile.

 Concerning article about cosmetic procedure 

Came across this:

* um depigmentation

&quot;The normal color of the gum tissue (gingiva) is pink, but excess deposits of melanin (melanin gingival hyperpigmentation) can create what seem to be black spots or patches on the gums, creating an aesthetic or cosmetic problem.&quot;

Actually, melanin pigmentation in the gums is entirely normal, the degree of which is strongly influenced by race. There is no periodontal pathology depicted in the individual in the photo.

 New Cochrane project, and also documenting Cochrane projects 

ochrane (organisation) is a health organization. Their publications are popular here on Wikipedia.

Cochrane has collaborated with the Wikipedia community on various projects since about 2013. I am trying to document what has happened to make it easier to do more together. At meta:Cochrane Collaboration-Wikipedia Initiative there is some documentation of what Cochrane and Wikipedia have done together. I was wanting more of a list, and also Cochrane does most of its activities on English Wikipedia, so I started a new project page at P:Cochrane. I thought that I could share this as a model of how WikiProject Medicine might document organizational partnerships. I think that everything that Cochrane has done has been discussed among participants in meta:Wiki Project Med, which is an organization including people who have off-wiki discussions with organizations like Cochrane about Wikipedia's medical content.

I started organizing this because Cochrane is starting a pilot program to train health students and experts to contribute health content to Wikipedia. On Wikipedia, I documented this program as an instance of the ikipedia:Visiting Scholars program. The project page is at
*ikipedia:Visiting Scholars/Participating institutions/Cochrane 2016

As this is a program targeting people who do not already edit Wikipedia, this is not to target WikiProject Medicine participants directly. However, if anyone knows anyone who might be interested in applying, or if anyone here wishes to support the participants after they are chosen, then feel free.

Yeah, I did some cleanup on that article a while back, but was never really satisfied with it. If there's ever anything substantive published about the product, it would likely be in Russian or Ukrainian. This is a specific case of a general question: How much discussion of an individual homeopathic remedy should be accorded, given that they are all clinically indistinguishable from placebo? Perhaps a standard template should be used for all homeopathic remedies, with a soft redirect to omeopathy or to omeopathic Materia Medica.

I think we need to stop thinking in terms of physical efficacy, and start thinking of them like osmetics.[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/07/110721095846.htm]  Do you feel better if you use them?  Do the more expensive ones make you feel better about yourself than the cheap ones?  Then they &quot;worked&quot; (no better than placebo).  
That means, in other words, that they're notable if sources write about them (i.e., what the P:GNG says), regardless of whether they are scientifically proven to make people feel better through the particular method that proponents claim.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 14:37, 17 September 2016 (UTC)

One thing that I can share is this [https://tools.wmflabs.org/massviews/ Massviews Analysis] tool. The tool does several things, but for example, if anyone gives it a single Wikipedia page with a list of Wikipedia article links in it, then it will report the total pageviews of all articles in the list for any range of dates. So for example, a person can make a list of articles on their userpage, then get a report of how many times those articles have been viewed. James is counting ~20,000 articles, but also, we could be setting up specialized lists that could motivate particular health sectors to develop articles.

 icotine dependence 

A new article was created with mass original research and off-topic information not explicitly about nicotine dependence. I think it should be moved to a draft or redirected to icotine#Reinforcement disorders. There may not be enough content for a separate page once all the OR and off-topic content is removed. The main section at icotine#Reinforcement disorders was not expanded to warrant a new article. The first source I checked to verify the claim [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nicotine_dependence&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=737552047&amp;oldid=737409105 failed verification].

See icotine dependence#Assessment and Diagnosis. &quot;These measures provide insight into what might be termed “psychological” dependence...&quot; The quote brackets around psychological appears to be a cut and paste, but there is no source at the end of the sentence. It appears other text was cut and pasted. See P:COPYVIO. ser:QuackGuru|QuackGuru (ser talk:QuackGuru|talk) 03:40, 4 September 2016 (UTC)
Those are care quotes, which do not imply copyright violations (which can't be done on a single word anyway).

|LeadSongDog In ~1000 classes reviewed by the WMF and Wiki Education Foundation, retention rate in the short term was negligible and too small to measure. If there is a retention rate to be studied, then possibly people could return many years after their first edits, but Wikipedia has not been around long enough to test that.
Currently, all education programs focus on soliciting good editing contributions in a short time from editors who will not be on Wikipedia for more than a few weeks. I do not know they numbers, but something like 40 edits over 6 weeks on 1-3 articles per person is common, with an average of 2 comments in on-wiki discussions. If you want to see class outcomes in this model case then visit ikipedia:UCSF School of Medicine or ask me and I could tell you anything. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 19:16, 20 September 2016 (UTC)
That was my impression too, but it seems like a terrible waste. Even a tiny amount of continued engagement could help. How about something like a once-per-year email? Something like: &quot;Hi there, thank you for your contributions to Wikipedia Project Medicine. We've missed you, please drop by from time to time to see what's new.&quot; If even a few re-engaged later in their careers, it would be a big win for the project.ser:LeadSongDog|LeadSongDog ser talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl! 20:54, 20 September 2016 (UTC)
We're already doing better than average:  Most people who create accounts don't make even one edit; most people who make their first edit don't ever edit again – with that account, which is another problem for these stats.  Someone might want to create an account that isn't associated with student editing, especially when that class account can be traced back to the owners' real-world names.  And many people just edit while logged out, even when they have accounts and remember the passwords.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 14:59, 21 September 2016 (UTC)
|LeadSongDog Your idea is completely reasonable. I know that if asked, you could probably list other reasonable interventions to test. It is difficult for me or anyone else to say what should be done, but I can talk about some of what is being done. The matter is currently being decided by finance. While the Wikipedia community could be organizing experiments like the one you described, in practice, it does not happen. The common term for what you describe is &quot;necromancy&quot;, or summoning dead users. See meta:Research:Necromancy for a WMF 2012 study on this, but the issue is raised often. Right now, data suggests that the cost of recruiting new users is lower than the cost of funding necromancy programs, and that new user programs give better results. Problems with this approach include poor data, rapidly and continually changing software and policy circumstances, and social pressures like irrationality due to risk of community backlash. A lot of Wikipedia editors want the education program to include retention programs but the situation has become complicated and without significant input of resources - either money, community support, software changes, or some other form of stability - I do not see a near future in which anyone in Wikipedia education addresses retention in any way. A massive amount of data is being produced and it is challenging to make sense of what is happening. If you find someone with time and interest then I could give them a tour of some contemporary challenges by Skype or Hangouts.
I agree with what WIAD - education programs already are producing some good outcomes, and they are introducing some unusual challenges which do not appear elsewhere. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 15:11, 21 September 2016 (UTC)
Maybe I'm missing something, but it appears that meta:Research:Necromancy is so caught up in the minutia (of how often, with what wording, by what tool, etc.) that it loses out on the basic goal: just contact the absent users, at least once, to engage an ongoing interest after the course.  This needn't be a costly thing, a database dump can feed an email list for next to no effort. It should be a matter of just a few minutes work for someone with the correct tools and access rights. Let us not allow the quest for perfection to delay real progress. ser:LeadSongDog|LeadSongDog ser talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl! 16:16, 21 September 2016 (UTC)
|LeadSongDog Yes, there is missing information, but instead of saying that you are missing something it might be more accurate to say that the information necessary to understand the situation is absent. I am not aware of any Wikimedia community group which has become organized enough to try the intervention you propose, so that raises the question of why that is. I confirm that the idea is good, and it seems like it would be easy to do this, but in practice - it is not being managed.
At meta:2015 Community Wishlist Survey there is a collection of wishes from last year, and surprisingly to me, the WMF has fulfilled almost all of them. In November there will be a call for more wishes with 10 being selected. Perhaps you would be interested in supporting or proposing some wishes.
One wish might be better management of mailing lists. Right now, there is no way to easily manage group mailing lists associated with Wikipedia user accounts. There is meta:MassMessage for sending notices on wiki, but no wiki-system for sending out emails, and no integration to choose to get either on-wiki or email notices except if someone receives an on-wiki notice and has opted into to email notices for every on-wiki notice. Overall, the communication process could be reformed. One reform could be a way for someone to do mass-message by email.
If there were reason to believe that a group of individuals were interested in medicine (or any topic), and they had shared their email address and agreed to get notices by email if messaged, and there was an easy way to send emails to a group, then someone could do experiments like &quot;just contact the absent users, at least once, to engage an ongoing interest after the course&quot;. Right now, there is a cultural barrier against this and the technical barrier of requiring this to happen one user at a time is a reflection of the cultural barrier.
I am not sure if the problem is mostly technical, mostly cultural, or because of lack of organizational management, but I can confirm that when people seem very interested but then drop off I am not aware of any attempt by any group to invite people back in a systematic way. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 21:28, 22 September 2016 (UTC)

I have a personal fondness for well-done outlines, but understand other's criticisms, too. This particular outline could use better referencing to justify the hierarchy and inclusion criteria. --ser:Mark viking|Mark viking (ser talk:Mark viking|talk) 17:58, 16 September 2016 (UTC)
Maybe they can be linked from the navboxes? Not a big fan of see also sections being created to put them in. ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk · pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 18:12, 16 September 2016 (UTC)
It is hard enough to keep regular articles up to date and free of garbage.  The idea of maintaining a whole parallel set of &quot;outlines&quot; is horrifying, and the idea that WP should provide &quot;cliff notes&quot; is way, way off mission.  Outlines =/= accepted knowledge, but some kind of learning tool.  Move them to Wikiversity, nuke them, or wall them off.  What a misguided mess. ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 18:17, 16 September 2016 (UTC)
Yes the idea of moving them to Wikiversity is a good one. These are sort of massive &quot;see also&quot; lists / navboxes that work on mobile which navboxes do not. ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk · pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 18:30, 16 September 2016 (UTC)
I think moving them to Wikiversity may be a good idea as well. Would Wikiversity accept them? I assume they have different policies and content standards. ser:Sizeofint|Sizeofint (ser talk:Sizeofint|talk) 21:48, 16 September 2016 (UTC)
I doubt it.  Wikiversity mostly seems to do teaching aids (e.g., worksheets for students) these days. 
Jytdog's criticism (&quot;not accepted knowledge&quot;) applies equally to navboxes.  Essentially, they're one big navbox (only visible on mobile, and not colored blue). ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 14:53, 17 September 2016 (UTC)
Hmm, I see. Probably not viable then. ser:Sizeofint|Sizeofint (ser talk:Sizeofint|talk) 15:09, 17 September 2016 (UTC)
|Mark viking — I won't dispute that they are potentially useful, but they are unmanageable. In certain fields they have been worked out to cover enough of the topic to be actually useful, but in medicine or anatomy (which each encompass 20.000+ articles) they just end up being an added layer of things that need to be kept up to date.
To respond to the other idea voiced here — I don't think they serve any true purpose on Wikiversity. Their main use is for editors, and if I were to suggest anything it would be to move them to project-space, where fewer readers will mistakenly come across them. ser:CFCF|Carl Fredrikser talk:CFCF| 💌 pecial:EmailUser/CFCF|📧 10:54, 17 September 2016 (UTC)
 I can see your point of view, especially in the context of WP:MED. In this case, the parent article iabetes is already a solid, fairly comprehensive article on the topic, so it is not clear that the outline adds much value for the reader. Also WP:MED folk, more so than other projects, feel a responsibility to keep medical articles sufficiently accurate and up to date. Which is laudable, indeed. But it follows that articles like this are seen by some as an added maintenance burden, rather than as an alternative for which they are happy to let other editors slowly improve over time. --ser:Mark viking|Mark viking (ser talk:Mark viking|talk) 18:41, 17 September 2016 (UTC)
I remain supportive of combining them into navboxes. May be we could make a portion of the navboxes visible on mobile and when clicked would bring people to these type of pages? ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk · pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 21:38, 18 September 2016 (UTC)
Articles of the imeline of cholera are more history of X articles. Which I have no issue with. ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk · pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 22:11, 18 September 2016 (UTC)
could be placed w/ navboxes--ser:Ozzie10aaaa|Ozzie10aaaa (ser talk:Ozzie10aaaa|talk) 10:21, 27 September 2016 (UTC)</segment>
