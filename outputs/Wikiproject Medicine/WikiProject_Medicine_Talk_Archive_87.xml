There is a proposal to delete this redirect. Wondering others thoughts? [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Clear_liquids#Contested_deletion] Doc James (talk ·  · ) 09:14, 28 August 2016 (UTC)
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Clear_liquids#Contested_deletion]--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 09:41, 28 August 2016 (UTC)
It's already been deleted.  Again, because the excuse given is a RFD discussion from June, in which nobody participating seems to know much about medicine.
&quot;Clear liquids&quot; (in the plural) is a typical phrase for referring to a clear liquid diet, and I don't expect it to be used often in the sense of merely a transparent liquid (a significant concern at the prior RFD).  A [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&amp;profile=default&amp;fulltext=Search&amp;search=%22clear+liquids%22&amp;searchToken=864xzrufy3wg33u8cei6y26rn search on the quoted phrase] turns up 13 hits, at least 11 of which are references to a clear liquid diet.

Recreate
Should we recreate the redirect from Clear_liquids to Liquid diet#Clear

*Support recreation of link as the first is a very common name of the second. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 00:57, 29 August 2016 (UTC)
*The correct place to have this discussion should be . You're thinking from a medical perspective, but for me, clear liquids are literally any liquid that is clear. It doesn't necessarily refer to a liquid diet. Honestly, I'd be fine with the redirect if someone could explain the usage of the term at liquid diet. Right now, it's not even mentioned, making confusing for our non-medical readers like myself.  -- Tavix (talk) 01:42, 29 August 2016 (UTC)
 did you ever have a flu and were told to &quot;drink clear liquids&quot;?  This is incredibly common in the US, at least when I was growing up (and apparently today; I don't hang out with people with kids or who are otherwise vulnerable to flu) Jytdog (talk) 06:09, 30 August 2016 (UTC)
*Note from admin deleting the recreated redirect: there was a deletion discussion with clear consensus to delete, and the article was recreated quickly after.  As per the deletion discussion, the current situation is confusing - the term is 'general', and could mean anything (at the moment I am staring at two bottles of clear liquid at my desk, I will not discuss my further dietary issues, if any, on Wikipedia), and where it redirects to is not clearly stating that the term is really so commonly used for that specific use.
As Tavix here is saying, the correct pathway would have been a .  --Dirk Beetstra T  04:56, 29 August 2016 (UTC)
Thanks. Will start the discussion at  Doc James (talk ·  · ) 07:32, 29 August 2016 (UTC)
, please tell me once you've done so. The deletion is frankly ridiculous and this is a clear example of  gone awry. Carl Fredrik 💌  13:43, 29 August 2016 (UTC)
 if you could begin the process that would be great. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 13:51, 29 August 2016 (UTC)
*Beetstra is correct here; a local consensus can not overturn a community wide decision. That decision happened . While I am confident this project is well meaning, it can not overturn that decision. As noted,  is the way forward. --Hammersoft (talk) 15:28, 29 August 2016 (UTC)
*: Beestra is a long way from correct here. There is no way forward via  and I'd be amazed if you both of you didn't know it. DRV is only useful in practice when the closer made a mistake in assessing consensus (which was 7-0 in favour of deletion on 18 June 2016), or when something new has arisen since the debate. Since neither of those are true, why are you suggesting wasting folks' time with a pointless DRV? The only way that a recreated redirect stands any chance of being kept is if the article Liquid diet is expanded to clearly explain that 'clear liquids' has a significant use as a phrase relevant to a liquid diet - preferably with good sourcing. Once that has happened, the arguments presented at  are superseded to some extent and it would be worth recreating the redirect once more, IMHO. Only then would DRV be useful, should the redirect be deleted again. --RexxS (talk) 16:47, 29 August 2016 (UTC)
To further 's argument see the multiple discussions at . Carl Fredrik 💌  16:54, 29 August 2016 (UTC)
I think it's clear (no pun intended) that new information has come to light since the closure of the RFD, so a DRV could prove fruitful. At the RFD, there was no discussion about how it's used as a common synonym, just a bunch of editors agreeing with me that &quot;clear liquids&quot; is a vague phrase that doesn't necessarily refer to a &quot;clear liquid diet.&quot; I do agree that the term should be discussed and sourced there though. -- Tavix (talk) 16:59, 29 August 2016 (UTC)
* RexxS, I'm quite aware of other paths. However, given the reality that ambiguity isn't going away, DRV is the only way forward if it is to be a redirect to the diet. I didn't mean to imply that it had a high chance of success. In fact, it has an extremely low chance of success. The deletion discussion ran its proper course, had enough people contributing to it, was properly closed by an uninvolved administrator, and was properly acted on. DRV would likely snow oppose a DRV over it. As to ambiguity; did you know that &quot;clear liquid&quot; can refer to cocaine in liquid form? Did you know that &quot;clear liquid&quot; emanating from the breast can be an indicator of prolactinoma? Did you know that &quot;clear liquid&quot; may refer to mucus and stomach acid emanating from the body in the form of vomit after all food has been expelled? Did you know that grain alcohol is a clear liquid? And on and on and on. Having &quot;clear liquid&quot; default to a form of diet is dramatically inappropriate. At best, I could see a disambiguation page. --Hammersoft (talk) 17:58, 29 August 2016 (UTC)
* For &quot;an extremely low chance of success&quot;, I think you mean &quot;zero chance of success&quot;? And I am indeed aware of other uses of &quot;clear liquids&quot; (note the plural). Nevertheless, there's no point in proposing an entry on Wikipedia unless there's decent sourcing for it. If there's sufficient to establish separate notability, then let's have an article. If there's just enough to make reasonable entry in another article, then let's have a redirect to it. Of course, if there are sufficiently well sourced examples of multiple meanings, then by all means let's have a dab page. However, inappropriate as it may be, if there's only one sourced target for a redirect, you can't have a dab page with only article to navigate to, sorry. --RexxS (talk) 18:32, 29 August 2016 (UTC)
* Then create a dab. I found those mentions after just a cursory review of potential sources. Recreating it as a redirect to a diet would be inappropriate. --Hammersoft (talk) 18:38, 29 August 2016 (UTC)
* You can create the dab if you think your sources are good enough to fill out the articles you want to point to. If there is only one properly sourced target, then a dab page would not be viable, but a redirect would be perfectly appropriate. --RexxS (talk) 20:38, 29 August 2016 (UTC)
* No, it isn't, and per the  it would be speedy deleted, as has already happened three times. It is highly inadvisable to recreate it, yet again, without seeking a new consensus to override the existing one. --Hammersoft (talk) 22:37, 29 August 2016 (UTC)
** DRV handles cases in which &quot;significant new information has come to light since a deletion that would justify recreating the deleted page&quot;.  &quot;Come to light&quot; probably covers cases in which none of the participants knew the information, even though it's easily available (just put &quot;clear liquids&quot; (don't forget the plural) into your favorite search engine, and see how long it takes to get past webpages about colonoscopy prep and surgery).  So technically it is possible for DRV to handle this.  It's probably worth jumping through the hoop.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 22:56, 29 August 2016 (UTC)

  If someone is demonstrably unaware of a meaning, then I can't see how calling them &quot;entirely ignorant&quot; of it is a personal attack.

Not really seeing how these are different apart from in name. The first article could pretty much be whittled down to a single sentence and merged with the article on suicide attempt. Do you agree? Carl Fredrik 💌  15:08, 31 August 2016 (UTC)

We appear to have dozens if not hundreds of phobia articles. Rather than doing each one separately. Maybe we can just develop consensus here to merge them all to List of phobias? Doc James (talk ·  · ) 21:06, 27 August 2016 (UTC)
*Support merging or redirecting to List of phobias. I don't think anyone should spend time merging more than a one sentence translation/description. I bet most of these terms are already on that list and can be deleted and redirected without anyone worrying about merging the content, IMO. —PermStrump(talk) 01:25, 28 August 2016 (UTC)
Pinging  who might be interested in this discussion since Mangoe has initiated AFDs for a ton of these phobias recently. Side note, I PRODed Cleithrophobia yesterday and I'm mentioning it here because I'll probably forget about it by tomorrow and if consensus is to merge/redirect these to List of phobias, maybe someone else will notice this comment and make sure that page is pointing to the right place too. :)  —PermStrump(talk) 01:32, 28 August 2016 (UTC)

Currently teaching a team of 3rd-year medical students on the wards, I asked them during our first session (a few days ago) about the sources they use. They reported that it depends on topic; generally, they start with UpToDate but have been admonished by other faculty that it's only a starting point, like Wikipedia (they were clearly reluctant to mention WP but relieved when I did not snort). I enjoyed that, and as we discussed further they were able to describe how they seek sources that we would consider MEDRS, as time permits. Though a very small sample, their responses line up with other medical students I've taught (we do have an informatics curriculum). — soupvector (talk) 04:00, 1 September 2016 (UTC)

Well, I figured it needed trimming somewhat, maybe some of the awards and details about his projects; that's why I posted a request here.  I did expect, however, that editors here would use medical or academic sources to which I have no access to provide references for some of the information, not just delete it all, including standard stuff such as his education, academic history, books, selected highly cited papers, and even the section headings. It's unlikely that a researcher could accrue [https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=t_jZzN4AAAAJ&amp;hl=en 30,000 citations] without at least a few of them verifying information about him. It's obvious that no one even looked; the mass removal of content began 12 minutes after I posted here.

EpiPen pricing controversy

The EpiPen is the treatment for anaphylaxis which can be fatal; kids with allergies carry them around in their backpacks. Mylan, which is the only company who makes it, has raised the price from &lt;$100 to &gt;$600 since 2007 for no reason other than profit.  As a result it's hard for the uninsured to afford, putting lives at risk.  There's been a burst of media coverage over the last few days, reminiscent of Daraprim and Martin Shkreli.  Currently there's nothing about this in the article on Mylan.  There is some material at EpiPen but perhaps not enough.  I've already found some good sources; see .

Merge WP:VET to WP:MED as a taskforce/workgroup?

 seems to be almost completely moribund as a wikiproject, though work on articles continues.  I think it would be beneficial to merge that project to  as a taskforce (workgroup), since there are more centralized, active resources here (article peer review, etc.). Given that this is largely up to participants at WP:VET whether they want to fold in, I've posted the main discussion at its talk page  (for an article merge, we would usually discuss at the target not source page). Given that discussion ended up starting here not there, I reversed the pointers, so this is the main thread now.  — SMcCandlish ☺ ☏  ≽ʌⱷ҅ᴥⱷʌ≼  07:40, 26 August 2016 (UTC)

*Strong Oppose - moribund is not a sufficient reason to put this into place - potential confusion between medicine and veterinary medicine beggars belief what might be misconstrued in the long run.  The benefits of becoming part of this project is insufficiently explained or reasoned, and the independence of the veterinary project should be maintained despite a quiet stage.  If in the eventuality of related but not the same subject area appropriations like this occur, it will make a complete mockery of the project system in wikipedia.

** It's not a question of whether the subjects are similar, or anything like that.  It's a question of whether there are editors there.  To quote the definition from , A WikiProject is a group of contributors who want to work together as a team to improve Wikipedia..  No people, no WikiProject.  Conversely, it's okay to have multiple groups working on the same subject.  Three separate teams = three separate WikiProjects, even if all three happen to claim &quot;horses&quot; as their area of interest.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 11:52, 31 August 2016 (UTC)
**:Actually I'd disagree with that. They are very different and require different kinds of expertise. If editors want to work on one or the other that's fine  but perhaps the project itself should have its own integrity. and be led by those with more experience and expertise in the area. I also agree that a takeover of the vet med project is probably not a good idea. (Desclaimer: I have worked a little in animal related articles  because I love animals but have never signed up for the vet med project) Wikipedia actually changes quite quickly so if the project is there perhaps vets and other interested editors may come. (Leave it and they will come.) We are less likely to attract animal specialists to the human medicine project.(Littleolive oil (talk) 19:26, 31 August 2016 (UTC))
**:: I don't see much practical point in disagreeing with the formal guidelines myself.  A WikiProject is people.  It's not &quot;pages&quot;.  It's not &quot;an area&quot;.  I quoted the actual definition on the English Wikipedia:  A WikiProject is a social group.  I agree that if a group of editors is active on that talk pages, that it might prove attractive to someone else, but it is not true that if neglected pages exist (which they still would, because task forces get separate pages, including talk pages, and all existing URLs would redirect there), then those inactive pages will prove attractive to newcomers.  BTW, I have been watching WikiProjects for six or eight years now.  In my experience, &quot;build it (or leave it) and they will come&quot; almost never works.  In fact, it seems to work less well now than it used to, and it never worked well.  We've had remarkably few successful (i.e., still active just one year later) WikiProjects created in the last couple of years.  I can think of exactly two offhand.  Nearly all of the new ones are started by one or two people with limited experience, in the hope that if the pages are there, then it will attract other editors.  But that simply doesn't work.   WhatamIdoing (talk) 21:25, 1 September 2016 (UTC)
**::: I concede  to your greater experience, but  its not accurate or fair to say I am disagreeing with a formal guideline. I'm not. Projects have Wikipedia &quot;space&quot; and of course the projects are made up of editors what else could they be on this kind of collaborative system. Further, Vet med isn't a new project put together by some new inexperienced editor. There have been vets on Wikipedia and may be again and there are editors with experience both with animals and animal articles; I don't believe for one second they will go to human medicine to look for a vet med project. A more direct route for inclusion in a project is to have a project  in place. Editors come and go all the time. We don't cancel something because an editor leaves; we wait for someone else to show up which often times they do. I didn't believe the projects should be merged, but having seen the cmt below by a vet its up to the more experienced people in this field to decide; I've stated my position and will bow out. (Littleolive oil (talk) 23:00, 1 September 2016 (UTC)) 
**::::I don't think you've thought this through completely.  A WikiProject is people.  People
WikiProject.  No people
no WikiProject.   We cannot &quot;have a project in place&quot; when the WikiProject (remember, that word means &quot;people&quot;) is not there.  You're saying &quot;let's have people in place when there are no people in place&quot;.  That's not logical.  And on the second point, nobody would need to &quot;go to human medicine to look for a vet med project&quot;.  Users would search for WikiProject Veterinary medicine (the current page title), just like they [don't] now, and it would redirect elsewhere.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 07:24, 2 September 2016 (UTC)
**::::: You may be taking your thesis a little too far, . My view would be more like &quot;a Wikiproject is a container for a group of editors&quot;. From that point of view, an empty container would still have the value of being capable of being refilled, without have to recreate the container. From what I've read in this thread, there's little point in trying to incorporate WPVET into WPMED, even temporarily, give the likelihood that editors interested in veterinary topics may wish to revive the project at some point. --RexxS (talk) 16:38, 2 September 2016 (UTC)
*Oppose Not the same fields nor the same expertise.(Littleolive oil (talk) 01:43, 31 August 2016 (UTC))
*Support Having veterinary experience and being a member there for about 2 years now, I think it would overall be beneficial to move vet med over to a task force. Veterinary medicine and human medicine are overall pretty similar in all the core concepts. Often times we're dealing with similar diseases and treatment methods. The only main difference is that vet med tackles multiple species (the reality ongoing joke is that med school is easier than vet school because of this). The closest fit otherwise would be in Wikiproject Agriculture, but not all vet med is in agriculture either. Vet Med was marked as inactive sometime ago, so it has reached the point where WhatamIdoing's comments are very valid with respect to scope not being the issue so much as activity. A taskforce under WikiProject Medicine would hopefully draw in more medical minded folks potentially interested in the topic. It's generally difficult to draw in agricultural editors from any specific area, so this proposal seems like the most beneficial option all-around. As a member, I'm really not seeing any significant justification amongst the opposes that would illustrate a consensus not to go ahead with the change. Kingofaces43 (talk) 18:12, 1 September 2016 (UTC)
** The main benefit would probably be having active editors (from WPMED) watching for relevant deletion discussions, etc., via Article Alerts.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 21:25, 1 September 2016 (UTC)
*Oppose Yes, WikiProjects are groups of people interested in collaboratively editing articles. I'd imagine that the group of editors interested in human medicine are not interested in veterinary medicine, and vice versa - which is why the two separate projects exist in the first place...because these are different groups of people who work on different types of articles. Trying to revive an inactive project with disinterested editors just for the purpose of watching for discussions doesn't seem like a good reason. If some WP:MED editors are interested in article alerts for veterinary medicine, they can do that at WP:VETMED. If a group of people want to revive WP:VETMED, then they can go ahead and do so. --Scott Alter (talk) 00:46, 2 September 2016 (UTC) 
** There's actually significant overlap.  Veterinarians do a lot of public health work, because they know a lot about zoonotic diseases.  They are involved in medical research.  Even in a simple small-animal pet clinic, they also use many of the same treatments that are used in human healthcare.   But none of that matters.  What matters is &quot;are there any people there right now, and do any of them object?&quot;  WhatamIdoing (talk) 07:24, 2 September 2016 (UTC)
***If there is no one left, then there is no one able to object. Not having objections at VETMED would be the first step. However, there would be no benefit to WPMED and no reason to merge...it'd still be the same people with the same interests working on the same project. If the merged projects would have the same group of editors, then you'd need to ask WPMED if they are interested in expanding the scope of the project to include veterinary medicine. This is the second step. It seems like people from the the VETMED/animal projects are opposed to a merger, and it seems like people from WPMED are mixed on taking on veterinary medicine. I don't see any consensus here, and its leaning much more towards oppose. --Scott Alter (talk) 15:09, 2 September 2016 (UTC)
On the contrary, there doesn't seem to be much  (i.e., we don't just count votes) leaning towards an oppose amongst us vet members. We're mostly seeing  arguments and votes rather than solid justification for not going ahead with the change in terms of the guidance we have on dealing with inactive projects. Regardless of how many other members simply display opposition, we'd need some strong arguments based on our Wikiproject guidelines to say members are opposed in terms of consensus. I'm just not seeing that yet.Kingofaces43 (talk) 16:32, 2 September 2016 (UTC)

Information about merging WikiProjects

WikiProjects are people, not subject areas.  The first thing that matters in these discussions is whether any people exist.  We have some good data on the (in)activity for this WikiProject, so let's look at a few facts:

* The last time anyone replied to any comment at that project's talk page (not counting the comments from the last few days, of course) was in 2014.  Getting zero replies to all questions that were asked over the space of the last two years(!) is a pretty reliable sign of a dead project.  If there were any editors who are actually trying to work together to improve articles (=the definition of a WikiProject), then you'd have expected someone to reply to at least some of those questions, or to talk to the other editors in the group, wouldn't you?  But nobody did.  So that's one indication that the group is dead.
* There are allegations of &quot;active editing&quot; in the articles.  However, if you look at the history of the stats we keep on article quality, there's been almost no change during the last couple of years.  Relevant calculations such as  show almost no change (actually, some of them have shown an average worsening of the situation, but no more than you'd expect from a few more stubs getting tagged [by other editors] for the WikiProject). 
* As SMcCandlish noted, these decisions are made by the participants of the (two) affected projects – not random editors.  In particular, participants in VETMED basically have veto rights.  Who's a participant?  A participant is someone who is trying to work with others on the articles of interest to the group.  
**A reasonable expectation is that any such participants will be actively editing that area.  We have a complete, bot-generated list of all people (including IPs) who are actively editing in that area .  (The list includes people who just happen to have made a few edits but aren't interested in working with others, so it is participants plus non-participants.)  It's a short list, and at a quick glance, the only people who have joined this discussion and whose names are in that list are Doc James and SMcCandlish, and I don't believe that either of them claim to be VETMED participants.  (Of course, please tell me if I missed your name.)  That metric indicates that nobody here can claim to be an active participant in VETMED, and therefore that nobody's vote counts on behalf of VETMED (nor, of course, would mine).
** You can also find participants by looking at membership lists, although they're notoriously incomplete and always out of date.  Using that metric,  is at least a former participant in the project.  If she's opposed, no matter why she's opposed, then it's probably worth respecting her opposition.  She may want to  it as an active group, which is just fine.  If she changes her mind and decides that having someone else manage template hassles or other boring maintenance issues would free her up to do other things, then that's okay, too.

Now I've got no particular interest in this merge; I don't have strong opinions about it either way.  The group is functionally dead at the moment, so the result just doesn't matter.  From where I stand, WPMED won't get any benefit (e.g., new participants with new perspectives) and a merge probably wouldn't harm anyone (because VETMED's pages would get MOVEd into WPMED's &quot;space&quot;, but probably still be just as dead as it's been for two years).  So IMO WPMED can let it keep rotting on its own, or it can play caretaker for any administrative hassles (like removing the link to the list of recent changes from the top of its page, which hasn't worked since 2013) unless and until someone is interested in the subject in the future, so the outcome of this proposal just doesn't matter to me.  

But the procedure matters a great deal to me.  WikiProjects are social groups.  It's no good trying to force someone to play with you.  It doesn't work in the middle school lunchroom, and it doesn't work on Wikipedia.  So let's let the actual participants in VETMED, if any current ones can be found, decide for themselves, without a bunch of non-participants trying to decide what they &quot;ought&quot; to want.  My fellow WPMED folks who wish to express a POV are welcome to say whether you'd accept them, if they chose to join us.  But let's please confine our (WPMEDders') comments to our own affairs.  If anyone's active in VETMED (and perhaps just on vacation this week), then they don't need us to tell them what to do.   WhatamIdoing (talk) 22:08, 30 August 2016 (UTC)

I have posted messages at the various animal wikiprojects.  The bottom line is that I and all the other editors can go join the wikiproject if it matters that much to you (and by the way, I'm a she, not a he, though it's not that big of a deal), but most of the articles tagged for vetmed are being worked on by the animal project editors, and we don't always go in and upgrade the assessments at talk where we maybe added some sources but still think the thing is C-class.  There was a time (like 10 years ago when I started here) when there were several real vets on the project and a bit of implication that only real vets should join because -- someone worried about not giving out medical advice or who knows? But the point is, we don't delete or merge inactive members, and I would hate to see this project &quot;downgraded&quot; either -- a task force is a &quot;child&quot; project of a &quot;parent,,&quot; not a question of active or inactive.  This was an itch that no one needed to scratch and the wiki servers won't crash if it remains a stand-alone project.  Someone will come along and revive it, eventually.  Montanabw(talk) 23:46, 30 August 2016 (UTC)
Maybe this was a wake-up call?  I'm ok with putting my name on the list if that's what we need to do but now I'm wondering...I just created an article and mentioned blister beetle poisoning as the cause of death for a notable horse, so for those instances, should I start adding a WPVET banner on the TP, or would it only apply to articles about vet meds or....? Atsme📞 00:14, 31 August 2016 (UTC)
I think we do need to start adding  assessments for health-related articles (such as blister beetles, but not individual horses that died from ingesting them).  If its horse health, and you might call a vet, then yes.  Montanabw(talk) 01:04, 31 August 2016 (UTC)
, the scope of a project is whatever the group decides.  Most groups choose a scope that makes sense to other people, but that's not actually required.  The scope is something that should be discussed at , by whomever wants to work as part of that group.  The &quot;work together to improve articles&quot; bit is far more important than the &quot;put your name on a list&quot; bit. 
And, again, if there are members of VETMED (Montanabw certainly seems to be one), and those members oppose a merge, then this proposal's dead.  &quot;Hostile takeovers&quot; are not permitted.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 11:43, 31 August 2016 (UTC)


Category:Phobias

As seen [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ephebiphobia&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=734229341 here] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lesbophobia&amp;curid=12650282&amp;diff=734228729&amp;oldid=729978267 here], and with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Mangoe other recent contributions] by Mangoe, Mangoe has removed  from a number of articles, stating, &quot;not a clinical phobia.&quot; But I don't see that the category is limited to clinical phobias; there is yet no note about at the top of the category page about how to use this category. Thoughts?

I'll also contact  about weighing in. Flyer22 Reborn (talk) 00:02, 14 August 2016 (UTC)

Those I've de-categorized are not phobias at all. Mostly they're social antipathies which are modelled on &quot;homophobia&quot;; a few of them are medical reactions. Mangoe (talk) 05:25, 14 August 2016 (UTC)
The category could do with a note, and link to the main article. How about a List of bullshit &quot;phobias&quot;? Johnbod (talk) 11:47, 14 August 2016 (UTC)
It doesn't really matter if they're &quot;true&quot; phobias.  What matters is whether a reader who goes to Cat:Phobias will be interested in this article.  This is because categories are for navigation (finding articles) rather than definitions (deciding exactly which thing truly &quot;counts&quot; as a phobia). WhatamIdoing (talk) 12:54, 15 August 2016 (UTC)

Mangoe, what do you think of WhatamIdoing's argument? I'm not overly concerned about this matter, but I would rather that the category not be arbitrarily added or removed. Flyer22 Reborn (talk) 00:27, 16 August 2016 (UTC)

No, these social &quot;phobias&quot; aren't really phobias at all; they are prejudices. the origin of them all, homophobia, was coined to imply that prejudice is a result of fear, but that has nothing to do with real phobias. Mangoe (talk) 17:48, 16 August 2016 (UTC)

 I agree that a prejudice is different from a phobia and we do the reader a disservice by confounding them. Is there any reason why the social &quot;phobias&quot; are not simply in ; that would surely be a good starting point for anyone wishing to navigate among them? --RexxS (talk) 21:42, 16 August 2016 (UTC)
OTOH, Chemophobia isn't a social prejudice.  I'm not sure how to categorize it, beyond saying that Cat:Chemistry is really not sufficient for interested readers to find this article.  It's not entirely unreasonable to compare it to things like arachnophobia, since both are typically irrational and typically improved by factual education.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 07:47, 24 August 2016 (UTC)



If others are fine with Mangoe's edits in this regard, I am as well. I noted that this isn't a big issue for me; I am looking for consistency and not arbitrary additions or removals. The category page should be clear about how it is to be used. Once this discussion is archived, I'll note it on the category talk page. Flyer22 Reborn (talk) 21:42, 2 September 2016 (UTC)

The Aphantasia article begins, &quot;Aphantasia is a hypothesized neurological condition...&quot;  There has been some discussion about the word &quot;hypothesized.&quot;  Some of us believe that there is adequate evidence--the article is supported by references from the BBC, Mind (from 1880), ScienceDirect (which cites still more articles), the New York Times, and New Scientist.  Another editor claims that  does not allow us to yet call this established science.  I don't see that, but following the guidance on that policy page, am posting here to see what the experts have to say. Mathups 02:13, 3 September 2016 (UTC)
yeah none of those sources you mention are very promising from a MEDRS perspective.  hmmm Jytdog (talk) 06:20, 3 September 2016 (UTC)
The concept of a mind's eye has been largely abandoned by recent research — so any disease suggesting its absence can't really be taken very seriously. Stick to the quality sources — this is a hypothetical disease. Carl Fredrik 💌  11:01, 3 September 2016 (UTC)
&quot;Mind's eye&quot; is just another (often informal) way of referring to mental imagery, and mental imagery has been the subject of research for a long time with a credible journal dedicated to it, [http://www.journalofmentalimagery.com/ The Journal of Mental Imagery], founded in 1977, and another credible journal, [https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/imagination-cognition-and-personality/journal202395 Imagination, Cognition and Personality], founded in 1981 has an emphasis on mental imagery.
The following sources demonstrate how &quot;mind's eye&quot; is used in the literature:
* [http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0015217 Closing the Mind's Eye: Incoming Luminance Signals Disrupt Visual Imagery (2010)]: &quot;It has been proposed that mental imagery is akin to perception in the absence of external stimulation, a product of sensory information retrieved from memory [1]. It is often referred to as seeing with the mind's eye, hearing with the mind's ear, or feeling with the mind's skin [2].&quot;
* [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22058106 Evaluating the mind's eye: the metacognition of visual imagery. (2011)]: only uses &quot;mind's eye&quot; once, and in a way consistent with the above description: &quot;In the study reported here, we demonstrated that the vividness of mental imagery can predict the perceptual consequences of that imagery. When an image in the mind’s eye was judged as more clear  and  vivid,  it  had  a  reliably  greater impact  on  subsequent perception.&quot;
* [http://f1000.com/prime/reports/b/2/34 Seeing with the mind's eye: top-down, bottom-up, and conscious awareness. (2010)]. Only uses &quot;mind's eye&quot; once, and in a way consistent with the above description: &quot;Moreover, visual imagery of faces and objects evoked activity in parietal and frontal cortex, suggesting that content-related activation during imagery is mediated by the retrieval of face and object representations from long-term memory and their maintenance in the ‘mind’s eye’&quot;.
* [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2823980/ Reading the Mind's Eye: Decoding Category Information During Mental Imagery (2010)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20969839 Visual mental imagery: what the head's eye tells the mind's eye (2011)], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18584868 Visualizing numbers in the mind's eye: the role of visuo-spatial processes in numerical abilities (2008)]. None of these use the term &quot;mind's eye&quot; in article text, but usage in title supports as referring to mental imagery.
The term &quot;aphantasia&quot; was proposed in [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945215001781 Lives without imagery – Congenital aphantasia (2015)] with the following text: &quot;We  propose  the  use  of  the  term  ‘ aphantasia’  to  refer  to  a  condition  of  reduced  or  absent  voluntary  imagery.  Terms  used  previously  in  related  contexts  include  ‘defective  revisualisation’  (Botez,  Olivier,  Vezina ,  Botez,  &amp;  Kaufman,  1985)  and  ‘visual  irreminiscence’ (Nielsen, 1946).&quot;
That paper uses &quot;mind's eye&quot; elsewhere, but in a manner consistent with the literature as a general colloquial term to refer to visual mental imagery.M. A. Bruhn (talk) 21:38, 3 September 2016 (UTC)

There is already significant discussion on the article's talk page.  May I suggest that it be continued there, rather than divided in two.

Out-of-process categories

It's not my area at all, I came across it whilst doing some non-topic-related category work but could someone take a look at his ? I've no idea whether he's being helpful or not, but looking at his Talk page history it looks like he's not the greatest consensus-builder. TIA (also posted to WP Pharmacology) Le Deluge (talk) 18:23, 2 September 2016 (UTC)

 I have reorganized some categories. Diffs for categories do not show the relevant differences. Therefore, you can't easily see the difference that I have made. However, you can see the end result. The content is now more logically organized. No coverage in topics was lost due to these edits. For example, now psychoactive drugs can be browsed by  and  (those are just 2 examples of several categories I have created which have been populated the same day because they were highly needed to organize otherwise scattered categories).
 If you are going to write your opinion on an editor's contribution history, please take the care to look properly instead of just taking a quick glance at the first page of &quot;Special:Contribution&quot;. Your criticism to be highly biased against me. I have performed several contributions far overshadowing the pre-existing content in those articles in length and importance.

 Mario Castelán Castro (talk) 19:11, 2 September 2016 (UTC).

 If you want others to look into someone's edits then you should explain why looking into them is warranted with more than a statement that they are not following a voluntary process and a statement critical of the user. A brief glance at their contributions makes it appear that they are not &quot;[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMario_Castel%C3%A1n_Castro&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=737426607&amp;oldid=737389438 trying to &quot;delete&quot; categories by removing them from all the articles]&quot; but rather that they are creating sub-categories and moving articles into those subcategories. M. A. Bruhn (talk) 19:41, 2 September 2016 (UTC)
In practice,  is pretty much expected for any large-scale messing about with categories.  works well for the quieter corners of Wikipedia but where there's a reasonable number of people interested, as in the category hierarchy, then  is expected. There's also the practical issue that going through the CFD process is a lot less effort, as the &quot;prize&quot; for getting consensus is that bots do all the hard work! In my experience, when an individual starts doing lots of manual category changes like that, then 4 times out of 5 they are doing so against consensus. Experience also suggests that people who blank their User Talk page usually do so because they have something to hide about their interactions with other Wikipedians, it didn't inspire confidence when looking at the history one of the most recent deletions was [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mario_Castel%C3%A1n_Castro&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=737306197 this complaint]. So that was why I was a little bit wary - nothing more - and was just asking for someone with more experience to take a look at the edits. I wasn't demanding they got reverted or anything, just asking for a second opinion as experience suggested they could be against consensus.Le Deluge (talk) 23:19, 2 September 2016 (UTC)
To Le Deluge: All of the text you have added here since you created this section amounts to merely:
* A pretentious complaint based around the premise that I should have followed your preferred way of doing things. I am not going to abide by your opinion and preferences as if they were policy. If my way of editing does not conform to your taste, do not complain to me.
* A lot of unfounded assumptions about my behavior from which you make incorrect inferences of wrongdoing on my part.
 Replying to “In practice,  is pretty much expected for any large-scale messing about with categories.”: This a dishonest phrasing. You expect this, but it is not the policy. Therefore, this is yet another case of you pretending that I have to abide by your opinion as if it was policy, which I am not going to do.
 It is nosense to suggest that blanking one's talk page is because one has “something to hide”. The history is available. Also, I have practiced blanking my user talk page since I began editing Wikipedia. Your personal comments and insinuations against me are out of place on Wikiproject talk pages. If this continues, this may be interpreted as a breach of  and .
 Mario Castelán Castro (talk) 23:52, 2 September 2016 (UTC).
Sigh.  is not &quot;my opinion and preferences&quot;, it is the mechanism by which  is reached in relation to major changes to categories, per the  guideline. If you have a problem with the need for consensus, then maybe Wikipedia is not for you. Again I repeat - I was not trying to get your work deleted, I was just drawing attention to it for a second opinion, a way to gain consensus for your changes after the fact since you hadn't gone through the normal mechanism for reaching consensus. That's all. There's no need to make a big deal of it. Le Deluge (talk) 01:04, 3 September 2016 (UTC)
  isn't even an appropriate place for routine  work, let alone being required by policy. CFD is for &quot;renaming, merging or deletion of categories&quot;, none of which this user has done. A general discussion of how to choose subcategories would be better had at a relevant wikiproject, but it definitely isn't so controversial as to necessitate discussion. Nobody thinks you are trying to get someone's work deleted, but you shouldn't go around posting to multiple message boards stating that someone doesn't look like &quot;the greatest consensus-builder&quot; without even provocation. M. A. Bruhn (talk) 01:50, 3 September 2016 (UTC)
 This user has renamed categories that affect a large number of drug articles.  The relevant Wiki project to discuss these changes would have been at  which this user has not done.  This user also has a history of making controversial changes without obtaining prior consensus (see for example List of designer drugs). Obtaining consensus before making potentially controversial changes is the preferred way of doing things, especially if it affects a large number of articles which it has in this case. Boghog (talk) 06:41, 3 September 2016 (UTC)
WP:CAT recommends a listing at CFD for &quot;complicated re-categorization of existing categories&quot;.  (CFD is not recommended when you are re-catting hundreds of articles in a simple way.)  I think that reasonable people could disagree about whether this is &quot;complicated&quot;.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 07:16, 3 September 2016 (UTC)
Strongly agree that CFD should be used, and relevant projects notified (unfortunately not part of the the guidelines). No views (yet) on this case, but with the Cat-a-Lot tool, there are far too many people rearranging large category schemes on an often very ill-informed whim. Johnbod (talk) 02:49, 4 September 2016 (UTC)

It appears to me that they are 1) going to drug categories which have lot of drug articles and subcategories in them, 2) creating new sub-categories, 3) moving the drug articles and categories into those subcategories. They also apparently  about including eponymous articles. If I am wrong in my understanding in their edits, please let me know.

Discussion at BLPN

Hello.  After a content dispute, I recently took an issue to BLPN.  The thread is , and it is about how to frame the debate about a controversial Canadian physician.  I don't really understand the issues involved so well, and I would really like for more clueful editors to both chime into the BLPN discussion and to watchlist the article.  Thank you.  I'm also going to post this to WikiProject Canada. NinjaRobotPirate (talk) 03:45, 4 September 2016 (UTC)

New format of linking articles
 has been adding the following &quot;see also&quot; section to a number of articles
[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Deliriant&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=737778808], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antipsychotic&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=737777406]
&quot;
;See also

&quot;
IMO this is already handled by infoboxes and categories. Wondering others thoughts? Doc James (talk ·  · ) 04:46, 5 September 2016 (UTC)


It's a novel feature, but inserting into the See Also section violates  which specifies these sections should only contain a bulleted list of internal wikilinks to other articles. There's no precedent that I can see for it's usage in articles; it's an implementation of the &quot;Category tree&quot; template which [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Category_tree&amp;limit=500 appears commonly in Wikiproject, portal, category, and talk spaces] but is only used [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AWhatLinksHere&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Template%3ACategory+tree&amp;namespace=0 once in article space]. If it's to be included in articles then it would definitely be most appropriate to include alongside the navigation templates. Addition of a novel navigation template like this to many pages is likely to be controversial. A discussion should be started at  (since they are most relevant since these are drug articles) to seek consensus. M. A. Bruhn (talk) 06:15, 5 September 2016 (UTC)
It's just the category tree.  It gives you exactly the same list that you would get if you went to the same category.  (Compare the contents of  vs what you find under the first item in this list.)  If memory serves, categories aren't visible on mobile devices.  This might help mobile readers (about half of readers) find the categories.  However, it doesn't work the same way on the mobile website.  In particular, Outline of stagecraft precedes the collapsed list with the instruction to &quot;Click the &quot;►&quot; below to see all subcategories:&quot;.  The &quot;►&quot; arrow is not visible on the mobile website and clicking the name of the category takes you to the category page rather than displaying the list. WhatamIdoing (talk) 06:58, 5 September 2016 (UTC)
The template itself provides 4 category trees, the first category tree is the drug (in this case Antipsychotics), and then it provides the following 3 category trees  ► Drug classes defined by psychological effects ► Drugs by psychological effects ► Psychoactive drugs. The categories not appearing on mobile makes it seem as though the community doesn't want categories to appear on mobile (I wouldn't know why, but then again I always use the desktop version on my phone). I would like it if somehow the category bar itself allowed navigating the category trees. M. A. Bruhn (talk) 07:42, 5 September 2016 (UTC)
Neither desktop nor mobile is fully controlled by volunteers, and volunteers did not make that decision.  (This is probably a good thing, because very few of us have the necessary skills.)  The mobile has been designed to make it easier, faster, and cheaper to use on smartphones.  It omits a number of elements such as navboxes and categories.  And even though they've done a lot of work on that, Google has decided it's still too heavy, and stripped it down even further for users in developing countries.  Compare these three views:
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen (desktop)
* https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen (mobile)
* https://icl.googleusercontent.com/?lite_url=http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen (Google's bandwidth-sparing version)
Most editors at the English Wikipedia really don't know or even care about how the site looks or works on mobile.  If we cared, then we'd have gotten rid of several column templates, designed navboxes (which are tables) so that they don't take up multiple screenfuls on small boxes, written better leads, etc.  Among non-editing readers, the existence of the mobile site occasionally gets sent word-of-mouth through social networks as &quot;the secret&quot; way to make Wikipedia easier to read, even among users who use desktop machines.  (Can you spell presbyopia?  Apparently none of the designers for the Monobook skin could.)  WhatamIdoing (talk) 11:45, 5 September 2016 (UTC)

* we already have navboxes for all this.  Cats go at the bottom of the page.  This is just clutter. Jytdog (talk) 22:38, 5 September 2016 (UTC)
**and what of WAID's point about mobile (omission of navboxes and cats)? It's not just clutter - but this may not be the forum for solving that problem. — soupvector (talk) 03:47, 6 September 2016 (UTC)
***soupvector that is a good point.  I don't know what the right answer is for mobile.   We generally have people linking relevant articles in three ways 1) categories done the normal way 2) navboxes, and 3) just piling up a list of wikilinks to  compounds they see as &quot;related&quot; (who knows how) in See also, like this: Clomifene#See_also. And now we have 4) categories done this new way.   We do need a better solution that we can apply consistently, and I do see the need to address mobile.  Jytdog (talk) 15:19, 6 September 2016 (UTC)

**Whichever it is, it is beyond the scope to solve it here, so I'm with Jytdog on this one.  Toss, but if the editor is unhappy, maybe point them to the Village Pump technical or something, as it's a way bigger issue than this project.  Montanabw(talk) 03:52, 6 September 2016 (UTC)

*WAID, what is the source for the statistic that about half our page views are not mobile?  The most recent stats I could find were for 2013 and it was ~15% then.  ([https://blog.wikimedia.org/2013/02/01/wikipedia-mobile-hits-3-billion-monthly-page-views/ source]).  I was going to open a thread an Village Pump Technical to keep this moving and wanted to lead with that, but wanted to source it. Jytdog (talk) 21:20, 6 September 2016 (UTC)
** Have a look at .  I left the link there a while ago, so that the numbers could be updated whenever someone wants.  However, Analytics has been re-jiggering a bunch of stats reports, so if it's not working any longer, then we'll have to go find the new one.

Basically, it (as well as all other portals) are only linked by templates ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AWhatLinksHere&amp;target=Portal%3AMedicine&amp;namespace=10]). I've several times raised the idea of getting rid of portals, seeing as they are neither used nor maintained, but they're so entrenched with parts of the community that I don't see that happening.
The least we could do is remove the pointless links from the bottom of our nav-templates. Carl Fredrik 💌  22:38, 7 September 2016 (UTC)
I removed the &quot;news&quot; section.  There's very little medicine-related news.  There have been only five stories posted during the last 12 months, and they aren't even necessarily what we'd consider medical news:  a hospital bombing, a white person had Ebola, an apology for saying something rude about a disabled public figure, a murder–suicide, and a cloudy-looking swimming pool at the Olympics site.  Because there are so few articles, each news item stays on the portal for an average of 10 months.  It doesn't seem likely to be a good fit.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 10:22, 8 September 2016 (UTC)
Thanks for the improvements. I am sort of neutral about their existence. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 12:25, 8 September 2016 (UTC)

The medicine portal needs an update to end all updates. In other words, design it in such a way that it doesn't need regular updating. It can then fossilise in the usual fashion. JFW | T@lk 12:41, 8 September 2016 (UTC)

Of course this doesn't include views to subcategories and categories also provide technical functionalities. Still though, the portals get small but regular usage, so apparently some people find them relevant. Agree with rewriting in a way that it won't need updates. M. A. Bruhn (talk) 18:18, 8 September 2016 (UTC)
I'm not entirely sure we can equate views with usage in this case. Links to the portal are littered all over the place — but the portal itself is essentially useless. Carl Fredrik 💌  11:23, 9 September 2016 (UTC)

Concerning article about cosmetic procedure

Came across this:

* Gum depigmentation

&quot;The normal color of the gum tissue (gingiva) is pink, but excess deposits of melanin (melanin gingival hyperpigmentation) can create what seem to be black spots or patches on the gums, creating an aesthetic or cosmetic problem.&quot;

Actually, melanin pigmentation in the gums is entirely normal, the degree of which is strongly influenced by race. There is no periodontal pathology depicted in the individual in the photo.

Currently I feel this article is misleading people into thinking there is something wrong with their bodies and encourages them to seek this cosmetic procedure. The procedure is also not discussed in terms of potential complications. Matthew Ferguson (talk) 04:40, 11 September 2016 (UTC)

New Cochrane project, and also documenting Cochrane projects

Cochrane (organisation) is a health organization. Their publications are popular here on Wikipedia.

Cochrane has collaborated with the Wikipedia community on various projects since about 2013. I am trying to document what has happened to make it easier to do more together. At  there is some documentation of what Cochrane and Wikipedia have done together. I was wanting more of a list, and also Cochrane does most of its activities on English Wikipedia, so I started a new project page at . I thought that I could share this as a model of how WikiProject Medicine might document organizational partnerships. I think that everything that Cochrane has done has been discussed among participants in , which is an organization including people who have off-wiki discussions with organizations like Cochrane about Wikipedia's medical content.

I started organizing this because Cochrane is starting a pilot program to train health students and experts to contribute health content to Wikipedia. On Wikipedia, I documented this program as an instance of the  program. The project page is at

Aside from inadequate sourcing and dubious information it is a good looking article. The layout and look of the illustrations is clever and unlike anything I have seen elsewhere.

*:Thanks Bluerasberry - I'll wait a bit to see if anybody objects... Jytdog (talk) 21:53, 13 September 2016 (UTC)
*:IMO pages should only be moved to draftspace if there is a reasonable chance that the article would be deleted if taken to AFD (since &quot;likely to survive an AfD nomination&quot; is the official criterion for moving pages out of draftspace at AFC).  Deletion is an unlikely outcome for at least some of these, so I think I would leave those.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 11:28, 15 September 2016 (UTC)
I moved the most of them - not all - to draft space.  There are significant COPYVIO concerns in a bunch of these too. Jytdog (talk) 02:02, 18 September 2016 (UTC)

BodyPump
BodyPump: seems rather promotional in tone; makes medical claims, most of which appear reasonably well sourced to primary studies in the literature, but not to any secondary sources. Would appreciate input from others. Thanks. Bondegezou (talk) 15:08, 16 September 2016 (UTC)

Non free images marked as free
We have the predatory site OMICS International supposedly offering images under a CC BY 4.0 license. But some of them are watermarked.[http://www.omicsonline.org/norway/hidradenitis-suppurativa-peer-reviewed-pdf-ppt-articles/] I assume all their stuff is simply plagarized. Unfortunately Google is not smart enough to know the difference. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 01:10, 13 September 2016 (UTC)
 I think that as a working assumption anything sourced to OMICS should be removed. That company is an ethics-free zone and we should have nothing to do with them on principle. In this specific case, we have credible claims that they have published fraudulent work, and plausible evidence of claiming rights over things that are not their intellectual property. The value of any image from an OMICS journal is, IMO, lower than the potential risks. Guy (Help!) 23:55, 13 September 2016 (UTC)
I only found one article that might have an inappropriate source to this group (Magnetic refrigeration), and I have tagged that source with .  There are multiple pages in the File: namespace that link to it (e.g., as the source of a logo for a school).  WhatamIdoing (talk) 12:22, 15 September 2016 (UTC)
Concur with Guy. However, Google image search was able to find similar images based on the url for the suspect jpg. Choosing &quot;all sizes&quot; came up with several (with various cropping), including the dermnet image they hijacked.LeadSongDog come howl! 18:55, 20 September 2016 (UTC)

Weather pains

Should this article have an infobox? More particularly, should it have an ICD-9-CM code? There's related discussion at  that might benefit from someone medical looking in on it, though I'm more concerned about weather pains. Thanks. — Gorthian (talk) 00:16, 17 September 2016 (UTC)
That ICD-9 code should not be in that infobox - it's a completely nonspecific code. My sense, absent such a code, is that there's no need for the infobox. — soupvector (talk) 22:15, 21 September 2016 (UTC)

Silly fluff dressed up as a serious topic. So, under a heading &quot;The experience&quot; we get:

(presumably these experiences are for women only?). I'd nominate it for deletion except it'd be a waste of time because Wikipedia embraces this kind of guff. Alexbrn (talk) 10:41, 10 September 2016 (UTC)

Serious problems with Tenoten article

This is a homeopathic preparation of dubious notability, and the article relies on primary sources (very small-scale human studies, or animal studies). &quot;Tenoten is described as acting as an antibody of the brain-specific protein S-100B. Other antibodies of S-100 that are approved for clinical use in Russia include Proproten (or Proproten-100) (Russian: Пропротен-100), Brizantin (Russian: Бризантин) and Divaza (Russian: Диваза). They all similarly have been reported to possess anxiolytic and antidepressant properties.&quot; - This is nonsense. What do you think - prune heavily to remove poorly-sourced and scientifically implausible claims, or delete due to general lack of notability? WildCation (talk) 14:30, 15 September 2016 (UTC)
[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=(+%22Tenoten%22+)+AND+Review%5Bptyp%5D]Pubmed doesn't seem to offer reviews(I'm inclined to your latter suggestion)--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 15:41, 15 September 2016 (UTC)
* Half the article was talking about reality-based products, so I removed that. All the supportive sources are in the same journal, Bulletin of Experimental Biology and Medicine. This is a Springer journal, why are they publishing this crap? Or did the authors fail to disclose that the product had no active ingredient? Guy (Help!) 16:02, 15 September 2016 (UTC)
** The journal is a translation of two Russian journals, neither of which is run by Springer, so they aren't at all involved in the peer review. Thank you for removing the bits about actual reality-based products - antibodies for this target might plausibly have some biological effect, but comparing them to a homeopathic preparation that supposedly acts as an antibody despite being a sugar pill...
