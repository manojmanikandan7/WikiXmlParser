 edical cannabis 

I've begun cleaning up primary sources, but the task there is larger than one editor can complete.  Any help?  I know there are reviews on some uses ... ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 01:52, 30 November 2013 (UTC)
 This is a good example of the problems I mention above ... there is no way I can get to everything in this article myself, it is citing primary sources galore, and because it looked well cited, people might take medical advice from it.  Help!!!  Or add a disclaimer.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 02:04, 30 November 2013 (UTC)
I can imagine this will be tricky (not having looked at it yet), and a good example of why elevating at least some of MEDRS to policy would be useful. P:DISCLAIM would be cited against disclaimers. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn ser talk:Alexbrn|talk|pecial:Contributions/Alexbrn|contribs|ser:Alexbrn#Conflict_of_interest_declaration|COI 02:21, 30 November 2013 (UTC)
 We allow l|current and l|recent death; would ya think medical misinfo is at least as important?  Anyway, on Medical cannabis, I can strip the primary sources, but since I don't have full journal access, it's harder for me to re-add reviews.  I Would Love Some Help in there-- it's massive.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 02:39, 30 November 2013 (UTC)
 Oh sure, personally I think the quality of medical content on WP is a big (maybe one of its biggest) problems; I'm just anticipating the arguments you'll run into in what is likely to be a controversial editing area ... ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn ser talk:Alexbrn|talk|pecial:Contributions/Alexbrn|contribs|ser:Alexbrn#Conflict_of_interest_declaration|COI 02:52, 30 November 2013 (UTC)

So, as |SandyGeorgia has posted on my Talk page, further digging shows we have:
* annabis
* edical cannabis
* ffects of cannabis
* ong-term effects of cannabis.
These, in their health information, constitute a gigantic festival of POV, built on poor medical sources and selective, spurious interpretations. Anybody getting their information from WP on this would think cannabis is not only harmless, but a wonder cure for many things from bipolar disorder to cancer. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn ser talk:Alexbrn|talk|pecial:Contributions/Alexbrn|contribs|ser:Alexbrn#Conflict_of_interest_declaration|COI 09:45, 30 November 2013 (UTC)
Yes there are occasionally attempts to add this sort of content to other articles. And I try my best to keep it well sourced. Agree that there appears to be a number of editors very favorable to its use. ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 10:04, 30 November 2013 (UTC)

Charming. I do not see a neutral point of view towards the article subject matter in some of the comments here, and that is unfortunate. At this point, 52% of Americans support medical cannabis, so to find editors who appear to also is hardly noteworthy. I  question Alexbrn's ability to be neutral and, lacking NPOV, to use PUBMED appropriately. Sandy helped me to understand MEDRS and the use of PUBMED only last night. Yet with only one day of experience, I was able to find a wealth of information that [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Medical_cannabis&amp;diff=584010745&amp;oldid=584007264 conflicted] with [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Medical_cannabis&amp;diff=583878963&amp;oldid=583877636 Alexbrn's take]. I see from comments above what appears to be a lack of understanding or education about the topic, and a clear POV. This isn't going to help. I hope someone will review Alexbrn's edits to the cannabis articles, as well as research to see what was missed, or twisted. It took a good 45 minutes just to deal with this one (MS) section. I want help reviewing these edits, or please stop changing the articles and instead just tag them so as to not make things worse. ser:Petrarchan47|petrarchan47ser talk:Petrarchan47|tpecial:Contributions/Petrarchan47|c 04:34, 1 December 2013 (UTC)
I'm glad you know what my clear POV is on this topic, because I certainly don't! If you can improve the article over what I've done that is great (and you seem to have found better sources for the MS stuff than I did, which is likewise great) - but that doesn't somehow validate prior poor sourcing or misrepresentation, of which there is a lot in this suite of articles. I'm not sure why you seem to bear some kind of grudge here; in the face of the serious and extensive problems these articles present it isn't helpful: editing resources need to be going into improving the content, not bickering. If you find something specifically wrong raise it in Talk or fix it, but please don't try and make this a venue for a continuation of an argument about Monsanto from several months ago. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn ser talk:Alexbrn|talk|pecial:Contributions/Alexbrn|contribs|ser:Alexbrn#Conflict_of_interest_declaration|COI 05:35, 1 December 2013 (UTC)
(Add:) Actually, though initially blithely accepting |Petrarchan47's replacement content as better than mine, on closer inspection I'm not quite sure that the sourcing is the best:
* [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3442177/ this] has a principal author who is chairman of the German Association for Cannabinoid Medicines, and a co-author who serves on a working group of the International Association of Cannabinoid Medicine; follow-up correspondence has [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3607088/ raised an eyebrow].
* [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3628147/ this] seems to be a rather polemical opinion piece by three gentlemen who are not best-credentialed (two Jesuits and a lawyer, it seems). And - is this not a pay-to-publish journal?
* [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23011861 this] I can't say anything about since I cannot locate a full-text online and it seems it's in Spanish (which I don't speak). I am assuming Petrarchan47 has reviewed the full text.
So yes, further thoughts on this sourcing would be useful. It seems (in general, at least) Europe and US may have slightly diverging views. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn ser talk:Alexbrn|talk|pecial:Contributions/Alexbrn|contribs|ser:Alexbrn#Conflict_of_interest_declaration|COI 09:53, 1 December 2013 (UTC)
 Petra, are you saying that a scientific, evidence-based approach to editing medical articles is &quot;POV&quot;?  If so, perhaps you would take that discussion to the talk page of P:MEDRS.  I've responded to similar personalization of this issue [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SandyGeorgia&amp;oldid=584060952#Help_with_sourcing on my talk page;] I hope we will see no more of this.  We can discuss which are the highest quality, and most recent reviews, without resorting to personalization.  There are problems in Muller-Vahl's work, and a built-in bias.  We all want accurate medical information presented to our readers: like Alexbrn, if you detect a POV in my editing, I'd like to know what it is, other than the POV that says we follow MEDRS. Also, I do speak fluent Spanish, and I have subscribed to that Revista, and no, Petra did not fully represent that source, so I'm not sure whether s/he speaks Spanish or accessed the full text.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 16:22, 1 December 2013 (UTC)

To the above list we can add:
* annabis in pregnancy

 This is akin to the POV walled garden of articles found in the utism suite back in 2007; it took Eubulides about a year to clean it up.  We've got duplicate, poorly sourced text all over the place, and it is of the worst kind-- that is, the kind that people might mistakenly use for (bad) medical advice, because it looks well sourced.  We could use some attention on this entire suite of articles.  Too much for one or two editors to deal with.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 15:00, 30 November 2013 (UTC)

* Re: annabis in pregnancy, once all primary sources are removed, is there enough left to warrant a stand alone article rather than  a short section of the main cannabis article? ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 15:31, 30 November 2013 (UTC)
No. I've come across some usable secondary material on this, but there won't be enough for a standalone article IMO. Looking at the cannabis &quot;suite&quot; as a whole, I'm beginning to think there is enough for two articles, &quot;Cannabis&quot; (history, botany, sociology, cultural, etc.) and &quot;Cannabis and health&quot; (or somesuch) about medical uses and consequences. But how to get from here to there? My first impulse is to remove some of the worst primary-based material across all the articles, and see what that leaves ... ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn ser talk:Alexbrn|talk|pecial:Contributions/Alexbrn|contribs|ser:Alexbrn#Conflict_of_interest_declaration|COI 15:37, 30 November 2013 (UTC)
 Bingo (Lesion).  Dealing with the POV walled garden will be more expedient if the text is rationalized, duplication minimized. It's the same primary-sourced crap repeated across multiple articles.  I will be busy for a few days, Alexbrn is hard at work on it, hope someone can help.  There are secondary reviews available, but I don't have full journal access (only Cochrane). ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 15:39, 30 November 2013 (UTC)
I have now nuked the annabis in pregnancy article, leaving two sentences. There were two reasonable sources, one of which was being misrepresented (now fixed). The remaining stub should probably be merged somewhere in the long run and expanded with material based on good sources (for those interested, I have preserved the removed article content on the article's Talk page). ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn ser talk:Alexbrn|talk|pecial:Contributions/Alexbrn|contribs|ser:Alexbrn#Conflict_of_interest_declaration|COI 11:10, 1 December 2013 (UTC)

* See a sample at ser:Eubulides/sandbox/autism.  The autism walled garden was a much huger mess than we see in the cannabis articles, so I set up that sandbox which Eubulides eventually took over and moved to his space so we could prioritize our work.  With a POV walled garden, a systematic approach is helpful.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 15:41, 1 December 2013 (UTC)
In response to Alexbrn, one thing that I think a lot of wikiprojects and subjects would greatly benefit from would be some sort of &quot;prospectus&quot; of topics which are demonstrably significant enough for inclusion here, and sources which could be used to gather preliminary material. Basically, I'm thinking of pages like those in Category:WikiProject lists of encyclopedic articles, and some others which I am still developing along those lines. At least one such list, from the Eliade/Jones Encyclopedia of Religion, I'm still a day or two of active review of the sources themselves to adding here, because of the markedly different content and outline structures of the two editions. But if someone wanted to review reference works on cannibis or any other medical topic to see what gets more and less attention, or none at all, in them, that would probably help in developing the comprehensive nature of the content here on those topics a lot. ser:John Carter|John Carter (ser talk:John Carter|talk) 20:51, 1 December 2013 (UTC)

 harlotte's Web (cannabis) 

A strain developed for medical use, full of medical claims related to epilepsy.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 18:34, 12 January 2014 (UTC)

 As the creator of that article I can assure you that this has always been on my mind. I'm fully aware of P:MEDRS and seek to follow it. If you will look at the alk:Charlotte's Web (cannabis)|talk page, you'll see this: &quot;To comply with P:MEDRS, no direct medical claims are made, only documentation that such claims are made.&quot; If I have inadvertently crossed the line somewhere, please point it out and I'll more than gladly fix it!

 There is one piece of research on this strain, and it is definitely not MEDRS compliant. I was very reluctant to include it at all, and have only done it with a reference, and a hidden editorial note about its status. I included the ref strictly as documentation of terminology, NOT to back up any claims. I believe that is a justifiable way to use it. It is currently harlotte's_Web_(cannabis)#cite_ref-Gedde_Maa_9-0|ref 9. Here is the actual text visible to editors:

* itation |last=Gedde |first=Margaret |year=6 Dec. 2013 |title=Whole Cannabis Extract of High Concentration Cannabidiol May Calm Seizures in Highly Refractory Pediatric Epilepsies: CW Oil Retrospective Survey Abstract - American Epileptic Society 67th Annual Meeting, Dec. 6-10, 2013 |publisher= |publication-place= |page= |url=https://docs.com/YJM3 |accessdate=2014-01-01 

 I have also included the doubts and reservations of physicians, making it clear that more research is needed, and that not all agree.

 As you can see, I've tried to be very careful. Any guidance would be welcomed. -- ser:BullRangifer|Brangifer (ser talk:BullRangifer|talk) 18:55, 12 January 2014 (UTC)

 Back again. I wasn't aware of that ENI thing, and didn't know this subject had ever been mentioned anywhere at Wikipedia. In fact I was rather surprised no one had written an article yet. Well, let's continue at the article's talk page. Sandy, I look forward to working with you again. We worked on the ndrew Wakefield article and you really put a lot of good work into it. I welcome your input and suggestions. I'm going to hat this so we don't end up with two different discussions.

As much as I respect the work we did together at ndrew Wakefield on the MR vaccine controversy, no, I'm not comfortable hatting this serious issue-- actually, the most serious yet that I've encountered in the cannabis suite.  Yes, there are significant medical statements in this article, which reads almost as an advert or coatrack, promoting cannabis as an epilepsy cure based on a TV show, in the guise of being about one strain, while neglecting all secondary medical reviews on the topic.  I recognize you set out to write an individual interest story, but a) that gives undue attention to one case about which we have no reliable medical sources, and b) the scope of the article is determined by Wikipedia policies and guidelines rather than a personal interest story one editor might want to write.  Since this article is about a cannabis strain, yet goes into a lengthy description of one case documented on television of a child whose family claims her epilepsy was cured by cannabis, what we have here-- sadly, for me to say-- is something as bad as the media role in the MR vaccine controversy, and borderline coatracky.  Let's get it fixed.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 19:05, 13 January 2014 (UTC)

 l|BullRangifer, I'm off for the day, but hope you're able to be comfortable with the kinds of adjustments I made, particularly more attribution of claims, and less quoting of people of dubious knowledge ... all yours now for fixing my fixing.  By the way, some of the cannabis editors have a tendency to go off the charts when folks refer to &quot;marijuana&quot; rather than &quot;cannabis&quot;, so you might be prepared for that, and consider which word you want to use.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 01:08, 14 January 2014 (UTC)

 I like the attribution. &quot;When in doubt, attribute&quot;, is a motto I've had here for a long time. I know there's a discussion about moving articles (retitling them), and there have been some very strong feelings, many times not based on any policy. For some reason it really gets people worked up. I have my own ideas about that, but I haven't really thought about that in the preparation of this article.

 I can think of one term right now: &quot;edical marijuana&quot;, which unfortunately redirects to &quot;edical cannabis&quot;...., is the most common term, including on the official edical marijuana cards (correct term) people get, and in the law. There might be some exceptions, but they are the xception that proves the rule. Our article on edical cannabis in the United States contains massive OR by using &quot;cannabis&quot; when it should use &quot;marijuana&quot; much of the time. (annabis is the enus name for the arijuana plant, so they are synonyms. One is the scientific name, and the other the most commonly used name for the plant (and the drug, when in the form of dried plant parts).) If you can think of other terminology issues, please mention them. If we can change any to avoid controversy, without violating any policies, we should probably do it. -- ser:BullRangifer|Brangifer (ser talk:BullRangifer|talk) 04:14, 14 January 2014 (UTC)

 Discussion about cannabis v. marijuana was had, and is being reviewed [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Move_review&amp;oldid=590725177#Cannabis_.28drug.29 here;] for now, it looks like cannabis has consensus, and I don't see your voice in that discussion.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 16:21, 16 January 2014 (UTC)

 I just don't have time to spread myself that thin, even though I do have opinions on the matter. I'd prefer to see annabis (with marijuana redirecting to it, because it's a synonym) as the basic article about the plant itself. It would have two fork articles, one for drug use and one for non-drug use.

 1. arijuana (drug) as a fork of the cannabis article, it being the main &quot;drug use&quot; of the cannabis plant, because &quot;marijuana&quot; is the most commonly used name for the drug (when used as dried plant parts), with various preparations having their own subarticles (hash, hash oil, etc.). 

 2. emp as another fork  of the cannabis article, because it is a &quot;non-drug use&quot; of the cannabis plant, with various hemp products having their own subarticles (within reason).

 So basically we'd have a tree with two main branches, and they would each have a few smaller branches.

 The articles I see the greatest problems with are the ones related to medical marijuana, as I mention above. -- ser:BullRangifer|Brangifer (ser talk:BullRangifer|talk) 06:06, 17 January 2014 (UTC)

 CNN and NPR 
The issue of harlotte's Web (cannabis) was the topic on National Public Radio this morning, and there was a CNN report yesterday on a three-year-old child whose mother was investigated for refusing chemotherapy for her child's cancer after moving to Colorado to use the marijuana extract.  I've removed a number of lesser quality sources from this article, and some claims that were dubiously sourced, and added this new information.  I would appreciate more eyes to review the article agaiin, and to check this work, and to watch the article because of the recent high profile publicity.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 15:10, 16 January 2014 (UTC)

Overall the medical claims in the article are carefully qualified, but I can't help but feel uneasy about the testimonial power of one or two phrases such as &quot;Her parents and physicians said the results of her first dose were astounding&quot; (my italics) - my general preference is not to include such &quot;testimonial&quot; statements in medical articles unless there is some secondary RS commentary on them specifically, because they are so heavy with implication (which is why many altmed promotions are purely based on testimonials). ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn ser talk:Alexbrn|talk|pecial:Contributions/Alexbrn|contribs|ser:Alexbrn#Conflict_of_interest_declaration|COI 15:35, 16 January 2014 (UTC)
 I removed the &quot;astounding&quot; wording (sensationalist); each time I look at the article, I find something.  Which is why more eyes would help.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 15:56, 16 January 2014 (UTC)

 &quot;When in doubt, attribute&quot; is a motto I have followed here for many years. We always have to tread a fine line, and for quackbusters and opposers of so-Called &quot;Alternative&quot; Medicine (sCAM) (like all three of us here), it's an uncomfortable one, but our job as wikipedians requires that we document the sum total of human knowledge, as revealed in RS. That means that NPOV requires that opposing POV must be included in articles, and even nonsense is stated plainly.

 We must keep in mind the difference between documenting that claims have been made (even if false), and actually making the claims in Wikipedia's voice. All our alternative medicine and fringe articles must do this. It's called NPOV.

 An article about this subject, or any other notable topic which includes possibly dubious POV and behavior, must document what that POV is, and what that behavior is. That's where we have to (sometimes are required to, and policy specifically allows it) use primary sources from the perpetrators. We then need to frame, qualify, and attribute it appropriately, without violating OR, SYNTH, and NPOV, but going so far as to fail to paint the picture found in RS by not including it at all is censorship and violates NPOV, and that's very unwikipedian. So, while I share your concerns, we need to be careful not to go too far and allow our &quot;quackbuster hat&quot; to dominate over our &quot;wikipedian hat&quot;. -- ser:BullRangifer|Brangifer (ser talk:BullRangifer|talk) 16:10, 16 January 2014 (UTC)

 If (not sure) you are arguing that we have to retain words like &quot;astounding&quot; from biased observers, I'm arguing that &quot;astounding&quot; can be left out as sensationalist, tabloidish, and unencyclopedic.   Particularly as related to unreviewed medical claims. I hope we're moving closer to a move neutral and objective piece than the first version which said in Wikipedia's voice that Charlotte Figi [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Charlotte%27s_Web_(cannabis)&amp;oldid=590532198 &quot;experienced an immediate and remarkable reduction of her epileptic seizures after her first dose of medical marijuana&quot;,] and included numerous claims about the marijuana extract that came from the manufacturers only.  Wikipedia is not a publicity agent, and again, when medical claims are made (they were and are), they should be based on quality secondary sources.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 16:27, 16 January 2014 (UTC)

 No, words like &quot;astounding&quot; wouldn't necessarily have to be kept, but that something out of the ordinary has been claimed by many, and confirmed by physicians, that's what the RS say, and that meaning should be conveyed, IOW that &quot;they said it&quot;. Yes, the sources do make medical claims, and therefore attribution should be used, and proper framing also, to make sure readers are clear that these are medically unconfirmed claims. For example, we do this in articles about homeopathy (many claims are made), chiropractic (also many claims), Hulda Clark (she claimed to cure &quot;all diseases&quot;). We document that those claims have been made, but we also document the reactions of the medical and scientific community to those claims, per NPOV and MEDRS. Per FRINGE we make sure that the mainstream rebuttals have the most weight. Is that any clearer? -- ser:BullRangifer|Brangifer (ser talk:BullRangifer|talk) 07:02, 17 January 2014 (UTC)

 TBH, this is an editing area where I feel uncertain - and I have certainly been guilty in the past of writing &quot;skeptical&quot; articles which are full of criticism, yet neglect to spell out what the-thing-being-criticized is. It's tricky - and at the moment I'm inclined to quite a hard-line approach. So if some person makes an amateur statement about something biomedical (&quot;I took the pills and my tumours shrank&quot;) my general reaction is &quot;so what?&quot;. If that biomedical claim (for that is what it is) has not been subjected to expert review then why should Wikipedia include it. Even if the claim becomes popular news it is still, in essence, a biomedical claim being carried by sources which are not RS for the knowledge it purports to convey. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn ser talk:Alexbrn|talk|pecial:Contributions/Alexbrn|contribs|ser:Alexbrn#Conflict_of_interest_declaration|COI 16:39, 16 January 2014 (UTC)

 That's where you are coming into conflict with our notability criteria. Lots of notable lies, nonsense, dubious ideas, weird theories, and conspiracy theories MUST be included here. We are obligated by the mission of Wikipedia to do that. If the claim is so small and remote as to never be mentioned in any mainstream scientific source, and yet it has attained a degree of notability in fringe sources, then we are allowed to go to skeptical sources (which come from the mainstream medical POV) and use them to rebut the claims. IIRC, if even they never touch the subject, then the subject hasn't risen to the degree of notability for inclusion at all.

 I don't recall if ulda Clark's claims were ever discussed in any mainstream medical sources, but they were certainly notable, and we also had plenty of skeptical sources which criticized her claims, and we used them. In these cases, Wikipedia serves a great purpose as a warning to the public about nonsense. We don't censor it. We actually have articles about it, and in those articles we present the best evidence against the nonsense. Scientific skeptics and quackbusters who oppose the inclusion of such subjects here are not doing their job as wikipedians, and also as skeptics, who should welcome the opportunity to debunk this nonsense.

 I share the attitude of one of our distinguished administrators, ser:DGG:

* &quot;[I have a] &quot;distaste for quack anything: medicine, science, psychology, social science ... I often vote to keep articles on these subjects, because the advocates of orthodoxy here sometimes seem to be even less reasonable than the quacks--and because I think the best way to expose quacks is to let them state their views plainly.&quot; [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:DGG#Biases Source]

 When dealing with subjects like medical marijuana, there is no doubt that some of the claims are highly exaggerated, irresponsible, quackery, and pseudoscientific. Yet there seem to be some areas which would fall into what tephen Barrett would likely classify as unproven/experimental. (He has a spectrum which runs all the way from deliberate fraud, to quackery, to unproven, to experimental, to nonsensical, to disproven, and to pseudoscientific. [http://www.quackwatch.com/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/quackdef.html See here.] Obviously some of these can be combined and overlap, but some can transition from one group to another if research and experience dictate.) I see some aspects of certain medical marijuana products tending in that direction, where scientists and the law are opening up for previously forbidden research. It's about time!

 We must maintain contact with reality by keeping in mind that before properly done RCTs conclusively prove that something really works, it is already working, and the proof does not make it &quot;work&quot; any more or less. It only documents what some have been claiming all along:

* &quot;Absence of proof is not the same as the absence of fact; it simply demonstrates the lack of adequate research.&quot; - Robert Sydenham. &quot;Lack of evidence in the literature is not evidence of lack of effectiveness.&quot;

* &quot;Evidence-based methods are effective, and effective methods should be evidence-based. If a method appears to be effective, then it should be possible to prove it. If the research has not been done yet, it should be.&quot; - BullRangifer )

 ser:BullRangifer|Brangifer (ser talk:BullRangifer|talk) 07:02, 17 January 2014 (UTC)
Yes, as I said I think it's a tricky area. We don't include details of the (well-documented) &quot;cures&quot; that have been claimed for the urzynski Clinic, and we don't include details of any of the huge number of testimonials for hristian Science healing. I don't think Charlotte's web is in the same category (it's more of a &quot;we don't know&quot; case). I am inclined to think that the &quot;information&quot; that Wikipedia conveys must be reliably sourced, and am wary of the tactic I see in some articles whereby adding a trivial level of indirection is claimed to launder that information, making it policy-safe: the POV-pusher will change &quot;Wongo juice cures cancer&quot; to &quot;Dr X says Wongo juice cure cancer, as reported in Smalltown News&quot; or &quot;Historically, tribal peoples used Wongo juice to cure cancer&quot;. As P:RS/MC|policy has it: &quot;It is vital that the biomedical information in all types of articles be based on reliable, third-party, published sources and accurately reflect current medical knowledge&quot; (my bolding). So I think this whole question actually revolves around quite subtle questions of meaning, reception, and the rhetoric of Wikipedia. People don't read like computers - if I write an article that makes a claim, even if it is carefully attributed as opinion, it can have the effect of conveying information. As I said above, this is why altmed is often promoted by testimonials: many readers will not read them and think &quot;that's just unevidenced claims&quot;, because many readers don't have the same framework of thinking about evidence-based medicine as us editors here. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn ser talk:Alexbrn|talk|pecial:Contributions/Alexbrn|contribs|ser:Alexbrn#Conflict_of_interest_declaration|COI 08:05, 17 January 2014 (UTC)
I also worry about the &quot;Dr X says Wongo juice cure cancer&quot; workaround.  I'd prefer (when sourceable) to say something far less encouraging:  &quot;Dr X is hopeful that Wongo juice may treat cancer, but no credible research has been completed, so its effectiveness is unknown&quot;.
 My normal approach is to check for the presence of true (analytical/transformative) secondary sources.  Most news stories are P:PRIMARYNEWS (although independent, so clearly better than a marketing department).  Extraordinary claims need extraordinary sources, and a quotation from one person in a primary source is not even close to extraordinary.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:30, 17 January 2014 (UTC)
 Based on Alexbrn's and WAID's feedback, I've taken another look at the article.  I don't believe we are currently in dangerous territory in terms of &quot;Dr X says Wongo juice cures cancer&quot; (I've replaced most of that with more balanced statements from reputable organizations), but we are in fact in a worse position. We are saying &quot;Politican Y, just before elections, repeats unsubstantiated biomedical claims from the manufacturer's website&quot;, and then it gets even worse.

My own practice on such articles is that unless there's another problem,  to accept them and mark them for merging. (The usual criterion for accepting articles at AfC is not that it be a good article, or even a &quot;necessary&quot; article, but that it has a reasonable chance of passing AfD.)

Alexbrn and Axl are correct in sharing what exists, but a watchlist could be more interactive and it could give additional data like pageview statistics if the tools were more developed. I have explored a bit at the P:WikiProject Council about options for making a watchlist for wikiprojects. Right now there are no good solutions for this, although some bots do manage certain features. In the future, I hope that wikiproject participants and developers work together to make public watchlist tools. If you want to talk more about what has been tried and what is in place then I could talk with you about this. In my opinion the lack of public watchlist infrastructure is a major barrier to getting more community participation. Something that I would really like is for anyone to be able to set up public watchlists with little effort, for example, classes in the education program or small nonprofit organizations which want to organize volunteers to improve 10-20 articles over a period of time. I presume that Wikidata structure will eventually address this problem. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 15:13, 21 January 2014 (UTC)
|Bluerasberry while we are on this topic, as I do not know how to go about navigating the Wiki-heirachy, something I feel would  be extremely useful for Wikipedia as a whole would be to have a standard set of tools provided by the WMF or a similar body made available to wikiprojects. That would include a popular pages count, cleanup count, and this watchlist. Having a supported set of tools would not only enhance the productivity of Wikipedians and decreased wasted time but mean that we are not all subject to having a us factor of one (which is something that we saw when the Mizabot went down).--ser:LT910001|LT910001 (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 04:00, 22 January 2014 (UTC)
|LT910001 There is no set plan for navigating the hierarchy, but you may know that Wikipedia has grown and become better funded in the past few years and perhaps if we developed a request and found someone to execute it then funding would be available to hire developer time and maybe even get WMF oversight to manage it.

I fail to understand how two outdated texts from a popular magazine writer in 2005 and an anthropology graduate student in 2008 are balanced texts based on original research. The only source which comes from a biologist (a PhD professor at the University of California, Irvine) is coincidentally the only favorable source included, which praises the focus of the journal. As I mentioned on the talk page for this journal, research explicitly investigating rejuvenation is not controversial, and is commonplace in the field of biology nowadays. It is not uncommon to see papers on life extension or rejuvenation published in the most prestigious journals (e.g., Cell, Science, and Nature), and many renowned professors openly discuss the prospects of rejuvenative therapies from their research. This is distinct from the culture of science in 2005 and 2008, where publications of this type were less common and not so much in the public eye. A big reason for the cultural shift between now and then is that we now know that rejuvenation of aged or damaged tissue is possible, as several landmark studies have been published demonstrating this in recent years. 

If this is not convincing, what would, in your opinion, justify the removal of the appreciations section for this journal? ser:Mostly Translucent|Mostly Translucent (ser talk:Mostly Translucent|talk) 16:16, 22 January 2014 (UTC)

 We need to talk about dose information 

I noticed ser:Jmh649|James reverting dose information this morning:

So I entered &quot;dose&quot; and &quot;the&quot; in the Wikipedia search box and started reading. The third relevant item was the section mentioned in the Equianalgesic#Morphine-centric chart|above thread, recently [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Equianalgesic&amp;diff=555906266&amp;oldid=532086797 merged from a stand-alone article] and significantly improved by ser:CMBJ. 

Our P:MEDMOS|medical manual of style says &quot;Do not include dose, titration or pricing information except when they are extensively discussed by secondary sources, or necessary for the discussion in the article.&quot; I don't think that's safe enough.

This is getting slightly ridiculous... I agree with not including doses unless supported by strong sources.

The problem with using nonspecific dosing terms is that it's difficult to describe &quot;how high&quot; and &quot;how much higher&quot; when talking about toxicity or therapeutic dose vs overdose, especially when &quot;high doses&quot; mean different things between sections. A while back, I came up with the solution of using ikt:suprapharmacological|suprapharmacological or ikt:supratherapeutic|supratherapeutic to address part of this, but that's medical jargon and lots of article reviewers don't like jargon. :P ser:Seppi333|Seppi333 (ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert 2¢) 05:32, 23 January 2014 (UTC)

 Oh, I didn't mean exact dose, I meant relatively - e.g., comparing effects at different orders of magnitude, like 10–100mg,100mg–1000mg,1g+, or comparably general ranges.

That's not ideal if the formulations change.  Compare Tylenol adult liquid vs Tylenol pills vs Tylenol children's liquid vs Tylenol infant drops—and that's all from the same manufacturer.  Pharmacy websites seem to indicate that the standard doses are something like &quot;six teaspoonfuls&quot;, &quot;two pills&quot;, &quot;one teaspoonful&quot;, and &quot;one dropper-ful&quot;, but the ratio by mass is approximately 20:13:2:1.

 &quot;upropion&quot; currently describes risk of convulsions with various doses. There are also brief dosage statements in other parts of the article.

I think equivalence can be encyclopedic and should be discussed if there are heaps of P:MEDRS (e.g. steroid equivalence when converting prednisolone to hydrocortisone or dexamethasone - this is well established).
Actual doses of prescription medicines are usually meaningless for the reader, and might actually be different in individual countries (e.g. aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis in The Netherlands is given at 81 or 100 mg, while in the UK it is 75 mg). I agree with Axl that we can simply say that higher/lower doses have a particular response and risk profile. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 20:34, 23 January 2014 (UTC)

 -Spot needs immediate attention 

Going through transcluded changes to the anatomy project at [https://toolserver.org/~dispenser/cgi-bin/transcluded_changes.py?page=Template:WikiProject_Anatomy] I struck upon a number of articles concerning female anatomy and function that were; to put it mildy, of questionable value. This article in particular is stated as a good article at P:Sexuality, but is severly lacking in medical sources, using CNN to make claims about studies, using primary sources all over, and advocating a process called G-Spot amplification, which I've never heard of before and doesn't seem generally accepted.
If the article only had claims about different sexual methods I would probably have tagged it with the anatomy tag and then left it alone, as editing these articles can be quite touchy. Seeing the medical claims I'm concerned that some of them may be potentially dangerous, and that this really needs immediate attention. ser:CFCF|CFCF (ser talk:CFCF|talk) 07:23, 24 January 2014 (UTC)

Nope, CFCF has blown this matter completely out of proportion, as like I [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:G-Spot&amp;diff=592146250&amp;oldid=592145510just stated], the G-Spot's existence has never been proven and it is a highly debated topic, with the vast majority of gynecologists, doctors and researchers doubting its existence, as shown [http://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378%2801%2915335-4/abstract here], [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/19/g-spot-does-not-exist_n_1215822.html here], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22240236 here] and [http://books.google.com/books?id=gU3SZSh-eXsC&amp;pg=PT135&amp;dq=&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KgVcUt-tD6i52wXIuIGoCQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false here], except for when acknowledging that it is likely an extension of the clitoris. In fact, most material on this topic concerns whether or not it exists. ... This topic is far more of a social topic than it is a medical or anatomy topic. Furthermore, with regard to the WP:MEDRS sourcing, note where it states the following at ikipedia:MEDRS#Use up-to-date evidence: &quot;These instructions are appropriate for actively researched areas with many primary sources and several reviews and may need to be relaxed in areas where little progress is being made or few reviews are being published.&quot; The &quot;need to be relaxed&quot; part of that text is exactly the case with the G-Spot topic. And the G-Spot article most certainly is not advocating for G-Spot amplification; it [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=G-Spot&amp;diff=592141295&amp;oldid=592139161#G-Spot_amplification quite clearly] has one paragraph stating that the procedure is sought by some women and how it is performed, and one paragraph making quite clear that the medical community is generally against the practice. Also take not that the G-Spot amplification material used to be an article, and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=G-Spot_amplification&amp;diff=521769719&amp;oldid=504988340 I merged that text] into the G-Spot article because &quot;there isn't enough material on this topic, especially medical material, for the article to significantly grow beyond what it was.

The topic is still (by far) mostly a social topic instead of a medical or anatomy topic; it is far from requiring strict WP:MEDRS sourcing (sourcing that allows news sources, by the way, especially for social material). Again, most of the information with regard the G-Spot topic is about whether or not it exists and its impact on society. ser:Flyer22|Flyer22 (ser talk:Flyer22|talk) 08:59, 24 January 2014 (UTC)
 Let's see. We've got (in Wikipedia's voice), &quot;Studies using ultrasound have also been used to identify physiological differences between women[8] and changes to the G-Spot region during sexual activity.[6]&quot; - sourced to a 2008 primary study of 20 women, and CNN. How is that (a) not biomedical or (b) okay ? ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn ser talk:Alexbrn|talk|pecial:Contributions/Alexbrn|contribs|ser:Alexbrn#Conflict_of_interest_declaration|COI 09:02, 24 January 2014 (UTC)

I didn't state that it's not biomedical or okay. As for using such a source... Again...the G-Spot's existence is highly debated, with most of the debate leaning toward &quot;It does not exist...unless it is a part of the clitoris,&quot; and I'm certain the majority of journals on this topic are primary sources. WP:MEDRS does not ban news sources for biomedical content, and the source is merely reporting a study with regard to an entity that has never been proven to exist to begin with. Treating this topic as a serious medical or anatomy topic, instead of the primary social/political topic that it is, is extremely dubious. It is hardly anything but a debate after debate. As for &quot;Wikipedia's voice,&quot; I don't understand what you mean on that in this case. ser:Flyer22|Flyer22 (ser talk:Flyer22|talk) 09:25, 24 January 2014 (UTC)
The majority of journal articles in any subject are always primary sources, as I stated to you at the talk page. Its in the very nature of what a primary source is. Apart from that there are a number of secondary sources, and a very recent one is here [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=anatomy+and+physiology+of+the+clitors]. Currently the article uses sources from 1982, which doesn't comply with MEDRS. ser:CFCF|CFCF (ser talk:CFCF|talk) 09:30, 24 January 2014 (UTC)
I still have not read all of your second commentary at that talk page; I'm too busy dealing with other comments and/or edits with regard to that article. And with regard to primary sources... Let me rephrase that: It is the proportion of journal primary sources compared to the proportion of journal non-primary sources that is one issue, which, like I stated above, &quot;Wikipedia:MEDRS#Use up-to-date evidence&quot; addresses can be an issue for certain topics. There are not an abundance of non-primary review articles on this topic. Go ahead and see how many ystematic reviews you find on it. You are treating this topic as though it should adhere to strict aspects of WP:MEDRS, when it generally should not. The most it can generally adhere to with regard WP:MEDRS sourcing are book sources such as [http://books.google.com/books?id=gU3SZSh-eXsC&amp;pg=PT135&amp;dq=&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KgVcUt-tD6i52wXIuIGoCQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  this one] (cited above). And being an anatomy editor, you know very well that we generally do not go by the standards of &quot;reviews published in the last five years or so, preferably in the last two or three years&quot; for anatomy articles, including for recent P:GA anatomy articles such as tapes, mostly because information on anatomy is generally consistently the same. ser:Flyer22|Flyer22 (ser talk:Flyer22|talk) 10:17, 24 January 2014 (UTC)
As I commented at the GA review page, the article goes deeply into anatomy, physiology, gynaecology and other areas of medical research. I do not understand why it should not adhere to WP:MEDRS and WP:MEDOS. Flyer22 argues that this is mostly a social article and not a medical one. Since  the G-Spot's existence has never been proven and it is a highly debated topic, with the vast majority of gynecologists, doctors and researchers doubting its existence as Flyer22 states above, this is the more reason why only high livel sources should be used. ser:Ochiwar|Ochiwar (ser talk:Ochiwar|talk) 09:46, 24 January 2014 (UTC)
And what do you think qualifies as a high-level source for this entity that has never been proven? Just how many of these sources do you think there are? ser:Flyer22|Flyer22 (ser talk:Flyer22|talk) 10:17, 24 January 2014 (UTC)
What qualifies as a high level source is defined in WP:MEDRS as you know. There are quite a few medical publications on this topic, even if most of them are not reviews, and quite a few are in the reference list of the article already. But some of the article references are quite inappropriate, see for example the first reference in the article, from the Times of 1982 used to support the opening sentence of the article which claims that &quot;the G-Spot is bean shaped&quot;. Can this be upheld in view of more recent publications, as the next paragraph states &quot;disagreement persists over its existence as a distinct structure, definition and location&quot;? Though I appreciate the Times as a tertiary source, I think I would prefer a current anatomy text book as a teriary source in this case. But if details to its shape cannot be found in current anatomy or medical publications, then maybe we should not write about its shape. ser:Ochiwar|Ochiwar (ser talk:Ochiwar|talk) 11:28, 24 January 2014 (UTC)

Ochiwar, then your approach is somewhat different than CFCF's on this matter...since CFCF seems to think that there are a lot of medical publications on this topic that are reviews, or an abundance of systematic reviews out there on it. What we generally have to work with regard to sourcing this topic are WP:Primary sources, book sources and news sources (which is what the article already does, like you partly noted), unless of course someone wants to apply the &quot;reviews published in the last five years or so, preferably in the last two or three years&quot; standard to this article. ser:Flyer22|Flyer22 (ser talk:Flyer22|talk) 11:46, 24 January 2014 (UTC)
See over at ikipedia:Good article reassessment/G-Spot/1, I've linked 6 relevant reviews and stated that there were a number of other articles.

As tickled as I am about the title of this section (hey now, |Lesion!), it'd be better not to stir up unnecessary alarm.  Yes the sourcing on -Spot could be improved but it's not an emergency.  Tagging up the article and jumping right to a review without first trying to work through a round of updates seems premature, I really wish those concerns were brought to the article Talk page first. ser:Zad68|Zadser_Talk:Zad68|68 13:56, 24 January 2014 (UTC)

|CFCF, thanks for understanding!  It's always best to start off with a note on the article Talk page about your concerns and suggestions for improvement.  If you get no productive response for while, that's when you might consider article-wide tags to draw attention to the article, but you can also do that by coming to T:MED (it's probably even MORE effective than the tags!).

I agree, Alexbrn, that the sourcing in that article (including some sourcing in that section) needs to be improved. I have addressed sourcing issues with regard to that article in the past on its talk page; for example, see [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Orgasm&amp;diff=592178986&amp;oldid=581908421#Male_multiple_orgasm this discussion] I had with an IP there. And months ago, I queried Zad68 to help out with that article (among other articles) when he gets good time to do so. We're both currently busy with other matters, however, including the G-Spot article. As noted in my discussion with that IP, I have been replacing sources in that article with better sources bit by bit. But as for sources such as ebMD and o Ask Alice! (and your [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Orgasm&amp;curid=22546&amp;diff=592175578&amp;oldid=592022725 tagging Go Ask Alice!]), while they are not the best sources, they are allowed per WP:MEDRS. In fact, WP:MEDRS [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources_%28medicine%29&amp;diff=591803106&amp;oldid=590174371#Other_sources explicitly allows WebMD.] WP:MEDRS also allows sourcing with regard to experts in their respective field. That is why I'd included [http://womenshealth.about.com/cs/sexuality/a/clitoraltruthin.htm this interview] as a source, though I included it at a time when my grasp on WP:MEDRS was not as improved as it is these days; I've been meaning to replace that source for a long time now. I assure you that I do not lack an understanding of WP:MEDRS. I often address non WP:MEDRS-compliant sources when I see them, such as recently in [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Herpes_genitalis&amp;diff=591794220&amp;oldid=591776848#Edits_15_January_2014 this case] at the erpes genitalis article. And again, anatomy aspects on Wikipedia generally are not subject to the same WP:MEDRS sourcing that say, for example, a disease article is subject to. Anatomy aspects on Wikipedia generally do not go by &quot;reviews published in the last five years or so, preferably in the last two or three years&quot; standard. There is a reason that ray's Anatomy holds up so well -- generally-speaking, the structures of body parts are the same now as they were many years ago. ser:Flyer22|Flyer22 (ser talk:Flyer22|talk) 15:14, 24 January 2014 (UTC)
Yes, unfortunately there is too much to do and too few of us editors to do it. Generally, I like using ebMD as a source - I'm not so sure about o Ask Alice! especially since, in the case I tagged, its description of the anatomy of the clitoris seems to be at odds with what our main litoris article describes. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn ser talk:Alexbrn|talk|pecial:Contributions/Alexbrn|contribs|ser:Alexbrn#Conflict_of_interest_declaration|COI 06:24, 25 January 2014 (UTC)

Yep, WhatamIdoing, I mentioned at ikipedia:Good article reassessment/G-Spot/1 (in my &quot;10:34, 24 January 2014 (UTC)&quot; post), &quot;back during a time when WP:GA standards, even for medical articles, was lower.&quot; 

Alexbrn, thanks for explaining your reason for having tagged that. Hmm, [http://goaskalice.columbia.edu/doin-butt-objects-anus that Go Ask Alice! source] certainly is not the most accurate when describing the rostate gland as lying &quot;just inside the anal opening.&quot; But with regard to female anatomy... Let's see, you tagged &quot;with 'legs' that extend along the vaginal lips back to the anus.&quot; That actually is not at odds with the Clitoris article. By &quot;legs&quot; and as you likely know, Go Ask Alice! is referring to the rus of clitoris|clitoral crura (clitoral legs). As for &quot;vaginal lips,&quot; that usually means abia minora...so I don't think that Go Ask Alice! was referring to the abia majora. Not to mention that it's nowhere close to accurate to refer to the labia majora as the &quot;vaginal lips,&quot; any more than it is accurate when people refer to the ulva as the agina. Anyway, notice that in the litoris#Glans and body section of the Clitoris article, I mention, &quot;Each crus (singular form of crura) is attached to the corresponding schium|ischial ramus – extensions of the copora beneath the descending pubic rami.&quot; In the &quot;General stimulation, practices, and arousal&quot; section of the article, I mention the fact that the udendal nerve gives off the nferior anal nerves and divides into two terminal branches: the erineal nerve and the orsal nerve of the clitoris. I also mention the &quot;vaginal lips&quot; aspect that the Go Ask Alice! source does, while using that source to support it. In other words, the crura and labia minora are connected in a way, and the anus and clitoris are also connected. Like Go Ask Alice! states in [http://goaskalice.columbia.edu/difference-between-clitoral-and-vaginal-orgasm this source], &quot;In reality, total separation between the vagina and clitoris is mostly artificial, and often based on a misunderstanding of what, where, and how big the clitoris really is. The clitoral organ system actually surrounds the vagina, urethra and anus.&quot; This factor is further discussed in the &quot;Clitoral and vaginal orgasmic factors&quot; section. Also, Rebecca Chalker [http://books.google.com/books?id=m3m3_Uq8qWkC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o-vjUsDZJdTDoATsvoGgCQ&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false states] (page 47), &quot;Knowing that muscles surrounding the clitoris and the anus are connected to one another helps us to understand why anal stimulation feels good, and that it is an integral part of sexual response.&quot; 

Still, I'll likely add a better source to replace the Go Ask Alice! source (or to go in conjunction with it), not only in the Orgasm article but in the Clitoris article as well. For example, [http://books.google.com/books?id=xeYJAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pN7jUumROs2HogSlnoDYDQ&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false this scholarly source] (page 74) states, &quot;As the shaft progresses deeper into the woman's body it splits into two forks, called crura, which extend along either side of the vaginal opening and attach to the pelvic bones.&quot; It might also be best that I reword the &quot;extends&quot; and &quot;extending&quot; material so that readers don't get an inaccurate picture of the crura's design. ser:Flyer22|Flyer22 (ser talk:Flyer22|talk) 17:35, 25 January 2014 (UTC)
Well, I'm no great clitoris expert, but it was the connection &quot;to the anus&quot; bit which got me thinking - that doesn't seem to be what the well-sourced anatomy content in the litoris article says (though there are a couple of mentions in this direction, again poorly sourced from lay sex guides). ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn ser talk:Alexbrn|talk|pecial:Contributions/Alexbrn|contribs|ser:Alexbrn#Conflict_of_interest_declaration|COI 17:54, 25 January 2014 (UTC)
Ah, I thought that might be more of what threw you off. This anus aspect partly goes back to the pudendal nerve factor I mentioned above. The &quot;connection to the anus&quot; aspect is worded better in the Clitoris article since it states &quot;or by the crura (&quot;legs&quot;) extending beneath and along the labia minora back to the anus.&quot; Again, I'll add a better source. I wouldn't necessarily call [http://books.google.com/books?id=Kkts3AX9QVAC&amp;pg=PA108#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false this source] a poor source, though; it's written by scholars such as everly Whipple and Barry Komisaruk, but I'll add better sourcing for the text in question. There's still more that I need to tweak or add with regard to the Clitoris article anyway. ser:Flyer22|Flyer22 (ser talk:Flyer22|talk) 18:20, 25 January 2014 (UTC)
The better-sourced stuff in the article has: &quot;Concealed behind the labia minora, the crura terminate with attachment to the pubic arch (according to some), or follow interior to the labia minora to meet at the fourchette (according to others).&quot; This description is then contradicted by the &quot;connected to the anus&quot; stuff sourced to poor sources discussing butt-plugs &amp;c. My fear is that this thing about the clitoris being connected to the anus is just a myth - it seems to contradict anatomical sources and is poorly sourced itself.

I think what the Go Ask Alice! source might mean by &quot;back to the anus&quot; is &quot;back toward the anus&quot; (or something similar)...as in &quot;pointing toward, verging on, but not quite reaching.&quot; The crura certainly are not attached to the anus; not in the strict sense. I've also read fairly reliable sources state that the crura surround the anus (or simply that the clitoris does), but, if you look at anatomy diagrams detailing the crura, the rest of the female genital anatomy and the anus (such as [http://books.google.com/books?id=V-M4CUkkZB0C&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dzTkUumwHszpoATAzoDYDQ&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false this one]), it does not look like the crura actually surround the anus. But then again, like the Clitoris article notes (litoris#Historical and modern perceptions), clitoral anatomy has been misrepresented for many years and even today &quot;volume of clitoral erectile tissue is ten times that which is shown in doctors' offices and in anatomy text books.&quot; The second Go Ask Alice! source I linked to above is a bit different since it states &quot;[t]he clitoral organ system actually surrounds the vagina, urethra and anus.&quot; As for the &quot;or follow interior to the labia minora to meet at the fourchette&quot; text, that is sourced to Rebecca Chalker, who also, as noted above, says &quot;that muscles surrounding the clitoris and the anus are connected to one another.&quot; Keep in mind that Chalker is well educated on clitoral anatomy and is one of the people [http://www.salon.com/2001/03/05/clitoris_3/ who revolutionized beliefs about the clitoris] by producing anatomically precise illustrations identifying 18 structures of the clitoris.   

Give me some time to look further into this, over all of the anatomy books I have at home and some more online (already looked at several) to better judge the accuracy of the &quot;crura are somehow connected to anus&quot; aspect. If I don't come across a satisfactory source, or maybe at least two or three satisfactory sources connecting the crura to the anus, I will remove that material from the articles it is mentioned in. All that stated, the clitoris does have a connection to the anus when you take, for example, the pudendal nerve into account; like the Pudendal article states, &quot;The pudendal nerve is a erve in the elvic region. It carries sensation from the xternal genitalia of both sexes and the skin around the nus and erineum, as well the motor supply to various pelvic muscles, including the phincters of the rinary bladder|bladder, xternal anal sphincter and the ectum.&quot; [http://books.google.com/books?id=IoB7hQhFkK0C&amp;pg=PA797&amp;dq=&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aEPkUvqzJ4rjoAS-kYLABQ&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false This scholarly anatomy source] supports that, and this is what the Whipple and Komisaruk source (a source that you consider poor) is essentially stating. And I already noted above that the &quot;pudendal nerve gives off the inferior anal nerves and divides into two terminal branches: the perineal nerve and the dorsal nerve of the clitoris.&quot; You mentioned the fourchette, which is the renulum of labia minora; this part of the female anatomy is near the anus. And the osterior commissure of labia majora unites the labia majora posteriorly in front of the anus, like [http://books.google.com/books?id=WwjTBvQY_vUC&amp;pg=RA2-PT128&amp;dq=&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KCTkUtrMB4_voASXjYGQAw&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false this anatomy book] states. There's also another interesting aspect noted in [http://books.google.com/books?id=flQ3bLUGkQcC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_ifkUurPNYvBoATKnoCoBA&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false this source], The Development of the Perineum in the Human; it states, &quot;[S]uperficial dorsal urogenital stroma gives rise to the dorsal frenulum of the labia minora ventrally. Dorsally, labia-deprived fibrovascular tissue from around the anal orifice extends ventralward and forms a more or less distinct broad elevation occupying most of the region.&quot;  

By the way, I included that Whipple and Komisaruk source because that section is about sexual stimulation, sexual practices, and sexual arousal...and I have not yet come across a better source for information with regard clitoral nerves and how the anus plays or can play an aspect in that when it comes to sexual activity. Not too many anatomists and/or sexologists give much of their time to anal stimulation as a part of sexual activity. Whipple, Komisaruk et al. give some good time to it in that piece. ser:Flyer22|Flyer22 (ser talk:Flyer22|talk) 00:30, 26 January 2014 (UTC)

 Template DorlandsDict 

The template has been broken for years. It was edited to point to the web archive. The template documentation was not edited to reflect that change. Many of the transclusions of the template now point to error pages on the webarchive site.

The template talk page should have PMED added. The template talk page has suggested using a free online medical dictionary (medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com) instead. Is there a template for that? The archives of this talk page have suggested pointing to the print version of Dorland's. Dorland's does not provide free online access to their dictionary. 

The fix should include editing the template and template documentation, and editing each page that uses the template, probably with a bot. I suggest replacing it with both a revised print version of the Dorland's template, and also a template for the free medical dictionary, which reliably hits the correct page when used as (http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/MEDICAL+TERM) I can edit/create the templates and contact a bot operator when it is time to go live. ser:Ordinary reader|Ordinary reader (ser talk:Ordinary reader|talk) 21:55, 26 January 2014 (UTC)

 leep apnea, bstructive sleep apnea and entral sleep apnea

 I agree. ser:Axl|Axl ¤ ser talk:Axl|[Talk] 16:01, 27 January 2014 (UTC)
It's been a while since I read that page, but at least the old advice was that the summary needed to be longer than the lead for the linked article.  If you're linking to a well-developed, long article, then having five or six paragraphs was recommended. 
On the more practical end, you need to provide a complete summary, so that people don't need to click through to the subarticle (most of them won't).  The existence of the subarticle doesn't excuse the main one from being a &quot;comprehensive&quot; description of the subject. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 19:25, 27 January 2014 (UTC)

My intuition would be to merge leep apnea into the larger parent article about leep and breathing as all forms of sleep-disordered breathing are discussed in context.

 'sex reassignment therapy' article, 'effectiveness' section 

I've been trying to get access to commonly accepted reference texts for psychiatry, but have only gotten access to one (Kaplan and Sadock's CTP), and medicine that might elucidate the effectiveness/efficacy of ex reassignment therapy in a way that the majority view may be clearly discernible.  Three reference texts were cited in a recent .S. Tax Court ruling Donnabhain v. Commissioner in which the court ruled that ormone replacement therapy and ex reassignment surgery could be deducted as medical expenses; the reference texts played a part in the ajority opinion granting those deductions.  The reference texts were named in footnote 19 on page 16 of the ruling, which is here:

http://www.lexisnexis.com/documents/pdf/20100204104451_large.pdf

The reference texts cited in the ruling are, namely, New Oxford Textbook of Psychiatry, Kaplan and Sadock's Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry, and Psychiatry (published by John Wiley &amp; Sons).  (The only one I've had any access to has been Kaplan and Sadock's.)

The court says that these &quot;widely used psychiatric reference texts&quot; support the medical necessity of some aspects of sex reassignment therapy; pursuant to Jimbo Wales's statements regarding the &quot;majority view&quot; and &quot;commonly accepted reference texts&quot; as quoted in P:UNDUE, this suggests that some aspects of ex reassignment therapy being effective/efficacious could be established as the majority view and so should be accorded much weight in Wikipedia.

Unfortunately, as stated above, lack of access to these reference texts, and also perhaps not being quite able to fully interpret the one I did read, makes it really difficult for me to make much use of them.  Previously, the &quot;effectiveness&quot; section seemed to something of a back and forth between primary sources that didn't seem to really establish weight; I've been trying to move away from repeated back and forth arguments and to establish the proper weight due to each medical view, pursuant to P:UNDUE.

I ask, Are there any editors here who are knowledgeable about the subject and have access to &quot;commonly accepted reference texts&quot; on the treatment of ender identity disorder who would be able to point the way?  Also, what would be the best way to structure the &quot;effectiveness&quot; section as we work to give proper weight to different points of view? --ser:Beneficii|Beneficii (ser talk:Beneficii|talk) 21:11, 26 January 2014 (UTC)

Your overall approach sounds very good.  I think it might be helpful to spend a while thinking about what effectiveness means in this context.  When you're talking about an antibiotic, you usually think in very simple terms:  &quot;37% of people taking this antibiotic stop having strep throat within 3 days&quot;.  But in this context, it's far more complex:  Is it effective at letting people pass socially for their preferred gender?  Preventing suicide?  Sexual function?  Making people happy?  Supporting romantic relationships?  The list could go on. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:45, 27 January 2014 (UTC)

Two points:
* That's not an essay.  There is no &quot;personal reflection or opinion&quot; in it.  That page has none of those qualities.  In fact, I'd be hard-pressed to find a single sentence that I thought really required a re-write for tone.  &quot;Encyclopedic&quot; does not mean &quot;most boring possible writing style&quot;—in fact, we prize ikipedia:Brilliant prose.  Here's the description of &quot;essay-like&quot; from the template docs: uotation|Use this tag to identify personal essays.  Personal essays describe the author's own eelings about a topic.  Although Wikipedia is supposed to compile human knowledge, it is ikipedia:What Wikipedia is not#PUBLISHER|not a vehicle to publish users' personal opinions.  This template should be used when the article contains the editor's own personal comments on the subject. Use it when the article does not necessarily representing a blatant opinion or opinion piece, but is still overly judgemental in tone.Do not use this template to tag fact-oriented pages that sound like they might have been written as research papers for school (called &quot;essays&quot; in some parts of the world).  Instead, if those pages need a different writing style or tone, use general templates like l|Tone or l|Copyedit 
* You all know that I'm a dyed-in-the-wool mergeist, but if you're going to spinout an article on a subtopic, you must provide enough background information that the resulting article can be read on its own, without reference to the main article.  Some duplication is required.  An article on how weather affects the transmission of Lyme disease really needs to say something about Lyme disease and several things about its transmission.  You can't effectively explain how weather affects the behavior of ticks if you don't mention the ticks in the first place.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:23, 27 January 2014 (UTC)

How confident are you both at this moment that the information presently in that chart reliably represents what the best P:MEDRS|reliable sources say?

 P:PHARMMOS states &quot;Do not include dose, titration or pricing information except when they are extensively discussed by secondary sources, or necessary for the discussion in the article.&quot; The table did not include dose or titration information. I find it highly implausible that a health care professional would use that chart (in Wikipedia) to convert a dose of one opioid to the equivalent dose of another opioid. 

 It is possible for any disease article that mentions a drug treatment to have the wrong drug listed. To use eductio ad absurdum, we should remove all mention of drug treatments from disease articles to prevent readers from using/prescribing the wrong drugs. ser:Axl|Axl ¤ ser talk:Axl|[Talk] 13:37, 23 January 2014 (UTC)

 The chart does contain dose information. The question is, is this information so sensitive that it should be excluded from this encyclopedia, due to this encyclopedia's vulnerability to idiots and psychopaths, and errors by intelligent, good-faith non-experts. As I've said, I'm unsure. One thing I am sure of, though, is it shouldn't be restored to the article until there is a strong reliable source backing every claim. --ser:Anthonyhcole|Anthonyhcole (ser talk:Anthonyhcole|talk · pecial:Contributions/Anthonyhcole|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Anthonyhcole|email)  22:42, 23 January 2014 (UTC)
No, it doesn't.  It does not say, &quot;You (or anybody else) should take 10 mg of morphine&quot;.  It says &quot;The equivalent of 10 mg morphine is 100 mg of codeine&quot;.  10 mg might be five times what the (adult) patient needs for a single dose (for pain) (assuming no particular previous tolerance), or it might be a third of what the patient should receive.  The only thing that chart does is tell people how to convert from one form to the other, which is not the same as telling them how much to take.   ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 03:25, 24 January 2014 (UTC)
 I agree with WhatAmIDoing. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Equianalgesic&amp;oldid=591343614 Link to the table]. While we could delete the &quot;Equivalent dose&quot; column and leave just the &quot;Strength&quot; column, that would hinder the table. It is much easier to understand with the &quot;Equivalent dose&quot; column, and indeed is less likely to be misinterpreted. For what it's worth, 10 mg of oral morphine is a modest dose (for an adult), as I am sure you are well aware.

 In any case, without any indication explicitly listed, I don't think that the table falls foul of P:PHARMMOS. ser:Axl|Axl ¤ ser talk:Axl|[Talk] 15:43, 25 January 2014 (UTC)

 It contains dose equivalence information. It does not contain dose volume information. I notice WAID has restored the entire table.

 Autism and the Somali population of Minneapolis 

Hi, folks. There is a talk page discussion about Autism and the Somali population of Minneapolis:  alk:History of the Somalis in Minneapolis–Saint Paul#Autism

There is an argument that it is out of balance to cover a study about it: see reasons in the talk page. Does anyone have access to the full text or to any specialist sources (medical journals reporting on this study)?
ser:WhisperToMe|WhisperToMe (ser talk:WhisperToMe|talk) 05:08, 21 January 2014 (UTC)
 I've been following that issue in the media; will check in there.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 14:08, 21 January 2014 (UTC)

Broader opinions would be helpful here.  I have been following this issue recently, but did not realize (until I just looked anew) that the news coverage of the autism occurring in the Somali population in Minnesota extends back to 2008.  In other words, we are beyond P:NOT (news) and P:RECENTISM, and although we don't have secondary reviews (only laypress and primary sources), there is a lot of interest in sorting out whatever it is that is going on there, and the anti-vaccinationists are involved.  I am wondering if we should put this topic somewhere, but I'm not sure where.  There is a possible Vitamin D connection, but no secondary review sources to support that, and some reasons not supporting it.  Perhaps ociological and cultural aspects of autism?  Could others please have a look at the sources listed at alk:History of the Somalis in Minneapolis–Saint Paul#Autism with an eye towards whether we might include this topic somewhere?  There are many more sources than those listed, and l|Middayexpress seems to also be up on the issues, including possible biases in the samples/reporting.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 21:08, 21 January 2014 (UTC)
 Hmmm, no feedback.  Well, after reading another very good article, I came up with the idea that the Somali/Minnesota autism issue might be mentioned at pidemiology of autism.  I'd still appreciate feedback, since we have only primary sources and laypress at this point, but the issue has been under investigation since 2008, has lots of coverage, and it seems we should be mentioning it somewhere.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 23:42, 28 January 2014 (UTC)

 tephen L. Hauser needs eyes

 I peeked at it last night, and just peeked at it again, and it's still quite dreadful.  But it gets worse.  First, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:SalCorr&amp;oldid=438317596 look at the page] of ser:SalCorr, the SPA who created it.[http://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahcorr]  Second, consider that it was vetted through AFC (which makes me appreciate the posts here from l|Anne Delong about med articles at AFC).  Third, click on just about anything in  Category:University of California, San Francisco faculty to see more of same (and most of the physician bios are not tagged WPMED on talk).  Fourth, highly notable or not, the article is not written in encyclopedic tone, and is not correctly sourced.  Let's start with the first line:
* Stephen L. Hauser is a physician-scientist whose work has advanced our understanding of the immune mechanisms, genetic basis, and therapy of multiple sclerosis (MS). 
 &quot;Our&quot;?  Then, a whole lot of the article is uncited, or cited to studies about his work that don't mention or discuss him at all.  For example, where is the source for &quot;A leading neuroimmunologist,&quot;?  Most of his awards are uncited.  This is a prototypical dreadful example of the ways Wikipedia is used as a webhost for incorrectly sourced bios.  If he's all the article says he is, it should not be difficult to find independent sources that make the claims made in the article, rather than citing studies on which he is one contributor, but saying nothing about the person.  And the most discouraging part is seeing that a) it got through AFC like that, b) there are scores more just like it in the UCSF faculty category, and c), next term's student editing debacle will hit soon, and I've been trying to get as much work done as I can in the between-term space, and know it is futile to spend my time on a bio like this, which needs to be entirely rewritten and correctly sourced.l|Jinkinson thanks for bringing it to attention-- I'm sorry I can't do more to help.  If anyone wants an example of how medical bios can be written and sourced, I offer my onald J. Cohen.  Hauser may be the bee's knees, but that isn't how we source bios. ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 17:49, 22 January 2014 (UTC)

 When I spend hours creating and correctly citing bios of ultra famous physicians like Donald J. Cohen, it just sets me off to see publicist-created bios on Wikipedia,[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stephen_L._Hauser&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=438319640] no encyclopedic tone, no correct sourcing, and vetted at AFC no less.  It is just dismal to consider how much of this is out there.  Wikipedia is not a webhost for physicians to write their own CV based on no independent sources.  Besides, I'm glad Jinkinson is learning :) ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 17:49, 22 January 2014 (UTC)
 And by the way, l|Jinkinson, you asked on my talk that I clarify why I declared that I wouldn't work on ames Heilman per COI.  I would think it clear that just about any of us at WPMED, who work closely with Doc James, would have a hard time being objective about his BLP; YMMV, and perhaps my COI definition is overly strict, but no, I do not know Doc James in real life.  I just know it sets me off to see primary sources used to source bios, and I don't need to tangle with other med editors on that BLP, creating an issue here where we have to work together.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 17:54, 22 January 2014 (UTC)

 Actually, that's why I engaged (instructive purposes) ... it is a very instructive example of how often we see a bio that looks cited, but is cited to the studies that say nothing about the person, and this is something we need to get a grip on throughout the medical bios. Seeing how many just like this are in the UCSF category alone is ... frightful.  I'd love to go clean up all of them, but I've still got work to do before the next student term hits and turns me into a grouch.  Best regards, ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 18:03, 22 January 2014 (UTC)
This is actually more intelligent than many such articles, because it gives the specific accomplishments and papers, as well as vague generalities. That makes it fairly easy to judge and rewrite. I've seen a great deal worse accepted at AfC.  Further, UCSF is a place where many of the senior faculty will indeed be notable, which is not the case everywhere. 
The first course with such articles is simply to remove the adjectives and puffery. I think the awards , and the named chair at an exceptionally good research university.do show him a &quot;leading investigator&quot; but there is still no need to say so--the awards say it by themselves . If we want to get better articles, there are only two methods: one is to write them ourselves;  the other is to take what we get and fix them. Normally when I accept at AfC I rewrite at least somewhat. I note some omissions, characteristic of much PR work--the dates of his degrees, the name of his advisor. the title of his thesis, and an account of all his positions before UCSF. I sometimes add this sort of factual material when it is readily available, though it's not as critical as removing the puffery.  On the other hand, I think asking for citations beyond the CV for awards is a little absurd-- university CVs  can be trusted for such things. I've seen almost no false factual claims in an academic CV in many years here, and none at all from a major university. 
Has anyone thought of contacting the school public relations department? I've done it from time to time--it has been known to work, if I put in enough effort. ser:DGG| DGG (ser talk:DGG| talk ) 18:41, 22 January 2014 (UTC)  .

 Afc's defense, I would like to say that there are so many things to keep in mind, and such a wide variety of topics and problems, that it's inevitable that some things will be missed.  Also, Afc gets quite a few complaints that we are being too strict and that any article with potential should be passed out for improvement by the community at large.  This article was accepted in 2011; we've improved our reviewing instructions and tools quite a bit since then. By the way, right now any confirmed editor can review at Afc, although the regulars do talk to any inexperienced editors and ask them not to.  There's been a proposal, which has been closed positively, to require three months experience and 500 edits as a minimum.  Now there's an ikipedia:WikiProject Articles for creation/RfC for AfC reviewer permission implementation|implementation proposal which also includes having the reviewing tools not function for those not on Afc's reviewer list so that we'll have fewer drive-by reviews. —ser:Anne Delong|Anne Delong (ser talk:Anne Delong|talk) 20:12, 23 January 2014 (UTC)

This is from memory Sandy - but from what I recall Yahoo decided to restrict the number of searches you could run for free through their API, which is how corenbot had been able to pick up copyvios.  I know there were negotiations with Google at some point to use Google's API in a similar way, but I haven't heard an update on them in ages.  Without a search API that would let a bot run an unrestricted (or at least very high) number of queries, writing a bot to check for copyvio is nearly impossible.  Regarding AfC - bluntly, I've never really thought it was a particularly good process.  I certainly have respect for the people who regularly review there (I have reviewed off and on myself, and not found it exactly the most rewarding thing ever,) but with the number of submissions to AfC compared with the number of reviewers, it's inevitable that mistakes will be made - it's either that or have articles at AfC languish in limbo for eternity.  I think that when talking about AfC, it's also worth keeping in mind that the alternative is just having people dump articles directly in mainspace, or even worse, use the namespace moving bug to bypass patrol entirely.  I hope that some day soon we find a good article creation pathway for new users... but currently all of the ones that exist are pretty FUBAR.  Anyway, with regards to this particular article, the CoI issue has been resolved (at least in that it will not repeat,) and I've confirmed there aren't copyvio issues, and I'll be looking to improve the article to a solid state within the next week or two at most (normally I'd be faster, but I'm slammed with stuff this month.)

Hi l|SandyGeorgia - I ran across ser:MadmanBot the other day after it tagged a page, but for reasons I haven't had time to dig in to yet, it's nowhere near as effective as the previous bot was.

A systematic review is good at answering only a narrow range of questions:  Does this work?  Which is better, X or Y?  A narrative review is far better suited to other questions.  The one listed above is perfect for a Research directions section and could easily support claims that relatively little is known about the physiology of IHD in women or the specific list of research questions that remain unanswered.

 They didn't give this one a publication type - not sure how often that happens. Being open access doesn't make it more (or less) valuable as a source, although I'd agree that given two of equal (or close to equal) quality, that the open access one should be preferred. This is where you see what all those tags mean: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3827/#_pubmedhelp_Search_Field_Descrip_ PubMed help]. You'll see the type of grants down below on that record in PubMed - all of those specific grants the author has are NIH extramural - there are other grant sources it could have been (NIH itself is 2 types - NIH extramural as here, or intramural like me). Systematic reviews can answer many different types of questions, not only intervention effect questions. You would always prefer a well-conducted systematic review over a non-systematic review - but a lot of information you want might be background information. That may or may not be higher quality in any type of review - it depends how comprehensively and systematically they went about the background bits. In general, a more recent, more systematic review would be better. 2010 is pushing it in heart disease literature, because there tends to be a lot happening in that area. ser:Hildabast|Hildabast (ser talk:Hildabast|talk) 03:36, 29 January 2014 (UTC)

 Helium 

A bottle helium and a plastic bag seems to be a advertised method in some books and this &quot;advertisement leads to increases cases of suicides by this method. The featured article elium needs a little bit of help to get to the standard for references. I put some references for the increased number of cases on the talk page.

 I've done my best to tidy up the incoherent structure and grammar of the section. I must question, however, the encyclopedic value of a long catalogue of deaths caused by helium. Frankly I don't think that every incident needs to be mentioned because of P:WEIGHT and a simple summary would be far more appropriate in my opinion. I am also troubled by the fact that the first reference I checked (http://web.archive.org/web/20120109032345/http://www.ktla.com/news/landing/ktla-riverside-teen-helium,0,6589649.story) showed that the teenager died from asphyxiation, while the article mistakenly stated it as barotrauma. I've since corrected that but it leads me to suspect all the other references. I can't do more today, but I'd appreciate it if someone had time to cast an eye over that section, elium #Hazards, and give a third opinion on the suitability of the content for a featured article. The references need to be brought into line with the others in the FA, but I don't want to expend energy in that if others agree that the section has been unduly inflated and needs to be cut back. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 00:03, 29 January 2014 (UTC)
I agree that it needs to be cut back.  Also, most of the sources are either P:PRIMARYNEWS|primary newspaper sources (including at least two copies of the same AP article) or websites that sell the stuff (three copies of the same text).  I think that section should be cut back dramatically to communicate two points:  Breathing Helium displaces oxygen, so you can get hypoxia (and maybe die) and breathing Helium (or anything else) straight out of a pressurized tank is even more dangerous.  It should be possible to handle it in a single paragraph and with no more than two or three decent sources.  I'd maybe keep the BMJ piece and the Slate article (to provide a purely lay-person option, although I think the BMJ piece is easy enough to understand).  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 03:56, 29 January 2014 (UTC)

Yes, I saw another user had deleted the page shortly after you posted here, just making a lighthearted joke. No offense intended. I think your work is beneficial to the encyclopedia.
Regarding the article, it may have been notable as indicated by this pubmed search: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=convection+enhanced+delivery]. Other wiki articles do mention the term, including this:

 Assessments largely outdated 
After encountering the mess that was our B-rated article at pondylolisthesis (a poorly sourced essay tagged since December 2008-- five years-- including some advert material and almost all sourcing to outdated primary sources), I scanned some other articles with a B-class assessment on topics I'm familiar with.  A good number of them were wrong.  Articles with long uncited text (both tagged and untagged) and maintenance tags like POV, wrong text, and anecdote are listed as B-class.  Our quality scale is at ikipedia:WikiProject Medicine/Assessment#Quality scale; enough of those I checked were wrong that I suggest we need to initiate some sort of re-assessment sweep.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 23:34, 28 January 2014 (UTC)

We've updated our standards since most B-class articles were assessed, and C-class has been invented since then.  Back in the day, B-class meant &quot;not good enough for GA, but too much to be a mere 'Start'&quot;.
The presence of maintenance tags is really neither here nor there; many of them are outdated or wrongly applied.  As a quick rule of thumb, an article that is barely good enough to qualify will have most (not all) of the main sections that you expect; it should have at least one inline citation per section (not paragraph, not sentence), and no problems that actually make you cringe and/or scream.  Of course, most of the pages that ought to be tagged as B-class are better than this, but that's the minimum.  The minimum is noticeably lower than P:Good article criteria, which in turn is noticeably lower than P:Featured articles.  If you find something that meets this minimum, then you should tag it as B-class with a clear conscience; if it doesn't, then pick a lower rating.  If you just can't decide, then post it in the list at the bottom of P:MEDA.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 04:46, 29 January 2014 (UTC)

 Agree with all, so there are two problems with our assessments.  Articles deteriorate/improve over time, and with the invention of C-class and MEDRS, standards have changed.  Both leading to the conclusion that we need an assessment sweep, which would need all hands on board to complete, but shouldn't take more than a week if we all committed ...

&quot;Big Pharma is going to destroy Wikipedia&quot; is a common boogey man, but have any of you read the rules that pharmaceutical companies are required to follow?  If you look at the biggest fifty pharma companies, more than half have a policy of doing nothing at all on any form of social media because they don't want to get fined out of existence.  For the most part, they don't tweet to patients (they might send investor-related information), they don't have Facebook pages, they don't let consumers post comments, and they avoid replying in public about any health-related issue.  In many cases, they have to simultaneously comply with directly conflicting orders from drug regulatory agencies:  they must list this possible side effect in the US, and they may not list that same side effect in the EU.  
Look at this [http://www.taylorwessing.com/synapse/june13.html summary of UK requirements].  Does that sound like a legal green light for promoting drugs on Wikipedia to you?  The [http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM381352.pdf forthcoming FDA rules] are [http://www.forbes.com/sites/edsilverman/2014/01/21/tweet-this-pharma-still-fails-to-embrace-social-media/ not expected to be helpful] to companies that want to engage without violating US laws (i.e., all of them).  The general expectation is that companies primarily selling prescription drugs will continue to avoid or minimize their presence in all forms of social media, including Wikipedia (which is even more complex, if you're trying to comply with regulatory requirements, because the consumer can't see that it's you, and because your legally approved information can be changed by anyone).  Oh, and it looks like, under the upcoming rules, they explicitly require the companies to submit every social media action, such as links to tweets, including tweets posted by employees or third-parties from their private accounts if those communications were posted at the direction or under the influence of the company.  This means that a diff of every edit to Wikipedia would have to be submitted to the FDA for review as &quot;marketing&quot;.  
And now ask yourself:  How many drug company employees have you seen around here recently?  We've got lots of MDs, but how many PharmDs are in this group?  The fact that we can't find these people when we really need their expertise, e.g., about biochemistry and production techniques, should tell you something about how little editing this sector is doing.
If I were going to worry about corrupting influences, I'd worry more about independent salespeople involved in ultilevel marketing of dietary supplements.  Their legal liability is pretty close to zero, their internal corporate controls are non-existent, and their knowledge is usually limited to their sales brochures.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:51, 31 January 2014 (UTC)

Hi QuckGuru. Didn't have time to compare the 2 main diffs you posted, but regarding the individual diffs:
*&quot;MEDRS violations&quot; - agree with what you did there.
*&quot;Lopsided text&quot; - It is difficult to understand the meaning of your added text, let alone decide if it has corrected or indeed introduced &quot;lopsidedness&quot;.
*&quot;OR&quot; - seems like the figure 50 was previously used whereas in the source it is 5. Agree with what you did there.
*&quot;Redundancy&quot; - agree your wording is closer to conclusions of the source

 The problem you've encountered, QG, is that you did a massive number of edits in a short space of time on an article that we both know is controversial. If you are going to improve the article (and thank you for trying), you are going to have to take the other regular editors with you. The best way I know of doing that is to take one section at a time: either make an edit and justify on talk, or propose new wording with your choice of sources on talk before making the changes. You'll need to take it slowly and get some level of agreement section-by-section. Listen to the feedback and accept that an article like Chiropractic can't be completely revised in one day. I'm prepared to pitch in when time permits - and I can see that some of the regulars here have already done so. We all want the same end result, improvements to our articles, so make use of the goodwill available and try not to rush. Hope that helps. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 02:14, 2 February 2014 (UTC)

The publications concerned are from between 1923-1963 published in the United States. One way of looking up whether or not they have had their copyright renewed is this page [http://collections.stanford.edu/copyrightrenewals/bin/page?forward=home] by Stanford, although there are others.
A way to find books which have already been controlled is through the HathiTrust [hathitrust.org], which allows for the viewing of an enormous (millions) strong collection of books. Many are still under copyright and therefor unavailable, but you can search among free books as well. 
I've been considering whether they were interested in any cooperation with us, they have several books by Netter which weren't renewed, but they may be copyrighted as there was an issue with prior publication etc. I'm making inquiries on that matter, and will get back once I get any answers. ser:CFCF|CFCF (ser talk:CFCF|talk · pecial:Contributions/CFCF|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/CFCF|email) 21:48, 4 February 2014 (UTC)

The only part that may fall under P:MEDRS is possibly the section of Life and Death, where bruising is discussed.

If there is any direct statement or publication from those who did the autopsy that would be preferable to a newspapers statement.

 Images and Support from a Pathology Laboratory 

I work for as a systems administrator for a small Pathology laboratory and recently decided that I wanted to make use of my position here to help out Wikipedia.  I have spoken to my employer and they have offered steep discounts, and to possibly do free work, to help improve pathology related articles.  Any costs that they will not cover I will eat.  I am planning to look around the Pathology related articles and try to find articles in need of improvement (especially images, we have a nice imaging setup here), but if anyone has any suggestions or things that I could help with in general, I would absolutely love to hear them.  Possibly COI Disclosure: My employer is [http://alizeepathology.com/ Alizee Pathology] which is owned by [http://alizeepathology.com/index.php/component/content/article/7 Dr. Serge Rousselle].

Great to hear. What sort of work are you thinking of taking on? We would definitely love more high quality pathological images. Help with the pathophysiology sections of disease articles would also be great. 
When it comes to medical content the two most important guidelines are P:MEDRS and P:MEDMOS. ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 20:46, 4 February 2014 (UTC)
I'm not actually sure what sort of work I am thinking of taking on actually.  I know next to nothing about Pathology and am really heavily relying on the fact that I am surrounded by Pathology experts to help me along in this process.  A lab technician has agreed to help me edit articles, and my work has agreed to produce images for me.  I need to some help identifying articles that could use images and from there I can attempt to acquire the tissue/samples required to improve them.  I know that we have a very good setup for producing images of slides.  We often provide clients with images upwards to 10s of GB in size each.  If I am lent some help finding articles that need improvement, I also have access to Dr. Rousselle's library, and have a lab technician who is experienced in staining and speciality staining that can help me work through the books.  I could probably convince some others here (such as our imaging specialist, and a member of our Quality Assurance Unit) to help edit articles as well.
My actual area of expertise is IT, programming, information security, and networking.  So this is definitely out of my usual area of editing, though I am not new to editing on Wikipedia itself (~950 edits on en.wp and ~450 edits on commons according to global contribs). ser:Zellfaze|Zell Faze (ser talk:Zellfaze|talk) 21:19, 4 February 2014 (UTC)

New high-quality pathology images would be a god-send for Wikipedia. We can pretty much say that all articles could use additional images. I've learned that pathology can be very difficult because variations of the same disease can make it hard to correctly categorize it. The more we can show various forms and representations of a disease the better, and articles can definitely use several images. Apart from work with additional images there are a large number of slides on Wikipedia that aren't added properly to articles at ommons:Category:Pathology. I personally uploaded around 800 images from Flickr on gross pathology as well as slides and adding these and integrating them into articles would be tremendously useful for the project. There is a list of all articles that fall under pathology on Wikipedia somewhere, and there should also be a list of which are the most popular, I'll go looking. ser:CFCF|CFCF (ser talk:CFCF|talk · pecial:Contributions/CFCF|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/CFCF|email) 22:05, 4 February 2014 (UTC)
Let's start small, with a test case, so that we can work the bugs out of the procedure.  It's not as easy to upload an image, with copyright and license stuff sorted from the start, as it ought to be (and it's even harder if you're uploading it but aren't the person pushing the button on the camera).  
What do you think would be easy to get a picture of?  Is there some sort of tissue that they deal with all the time?  Odds are, whatever you can get a picture of would be helpful, but if you tell us four or five names, then we can figure out where the need is most dire.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 23:04, 4 February 2014 (UTC)
I'll see if I can elicit some help in trying to categorize some of those images.  I can't promise anything there, but I'll try to get someone.  I am willing to try and get a few images to upload as test cases.  I think I can handle the licensing aspects, I am reasonably well versed in copyright law as it pertains to Wikipedia (I'm a member of the FSF and Pirate Party) and I have previously used OTRS.  I'm not actually sure what I can acquire yet.  My employer has asked me what I needed, and you guys have asked me what I can get, and to be honest I'm not sure the answer to either question.  I'll ask some of the RAs and Lab Techs what is common and easy to acquire.  Our orphometrics|Morphometrist suggested that I try to get a blood smear as that would be easy to acquire and I could provide it myself even.  He also told me to make sure that I mention that we are not a diagnostic pathology laboratory, but a research one.  If someone came to us wanting a second opinion on what they think is a tumour biopsy, we couldn't help, but if they wanted to test a new medical device or needed toxicology work done, that is more up our alley.  I don't know if that gives you guys any sort of clues as to what I can get easily.  As far as scanning goes, we have an [http://www.olympusamerica.com/seg_section/product.asp?product=1066 Olympus VS120] which I have been led to believe produces pretty high quality images. ser:Zellfaze|Zell Faze (ser talk:Zellfaze|talk) 15:18, 5 February 2014 (UTC)

Probably should be &quot;Wisdom tooth impaction&quot;? ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 02:31, 7 February 2014 (UTC)
not sure what's best.  The most frequently searched term is &quot;wisdom teeth&quot;, then &quot;wisdom teeth removal&quot;.  Impacted doesn't seem to be a term people use in search terms very often.  Probably best to flip it around, then we change the &quot;wisdom tooth&quot; article to Wisdom tooth (anatomy) and Wisdom tooth impaction (surgery) or something like that with a diamb page for wisdom tooth? ser:Ian Furst|Ian Furst (ser talk:Ian Furst|talk) 02:39, 7 February 2014 (UTC)

Monetary awards
Wondering what people think about the possibility of WPMEDF offered monetary awards for bringing key medical articles to GA/FA? Would it be useful, harmful, or have no effect? Of course realize that it may be a little controversial as there is no paid advocacy but there are some within the Wikimedia movement who do this for a living thus their is paid work occurring. Would those here for example find the offer of a $200 award for bringing troke to GA encouraging or discouraging? ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 15:26, 4 February 2014 (UTC)
Would find it encouraging. One problem may be determining authorship. ser:LT910001|LT910001 (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 02:35, 5 February 2014 (UTC)
Yes a few criteria would be:
#Would need to be a heavily read and important article
#User would need to bring it through GA
#All sources in the article would need to be high quality recent secondary sources in line with P:MEDRS
#P:MEDMOS recommendations would need to be followed
#Language needs to be reasonably simple.
#User would be the top contributor (or very close to the top)

I don't think GA is appropriate for this, because of the erratic nature of the reviewing.  FA is even less appropriate, because of all the bullshit it involves.  If we are going to do something like this -- and I'm generally in favor -- we should set up an &quot;A class&quot; for WPMED, with appropriate mechanisms.  My thought is that we could handle it a lot like GA, except that we would have a list of reviewers, and people wanting to be added to the list would have to get consensus at this page or some page set up for the purpose. ser:Looie496|Looie496 (ser talk:Looie496|talk) 16:29, 6 February 2014 (UTC)
I agree with the idea of requiring specific reviewers. I think we can leave it at GA rather than A class though. The nice thing about GA is it gets the green plus in the right upper hand corner. If we go ahead this will likely only be open to these 80 articles ook:Health_care at least initially.ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 15:08, 6 February 2014 (UTC)
From a partial sample, it looks like over half of those are already GA or FA, and most of the remainder are close. ser:Looie496|Looie496 (ser talk:Looie496|talk) 16:49, 6 February 2014 (UTC)
Yes am working on bringing them all to GA. The ones that are not yet at GA still take a good 4 weeks / 500 edits for me to bring them there. Many of the not yet GA's have issues with reference quality. ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 17:13, 6 February 2014 (UTC)
utdentRe monetary rewards, this sounds like it could only help, so definitely worth a try. I would certainly find something like this encouraging. Assuming here that James is offering to sub this out of his own pocket, in which case kudos for being so dedicated.

I also find Looie's suggestion v interesting. Class A has not tended to be used as far as I know for medical articles... we could come up with a medicine-focused set of criteria. I have noticed that those editors who have reviewed more than a handful of articles for GA seem to have a sort of personal system, and it would be good to standardize the best aspects of these systems as a guideline for how to conduct a review. Here are some of my own ideas:
* A person with &quot;real-life&quot; expertise in the topic to review for accuracy ... if no wikipedian is available who meets that description then an external invitation, although I think invitation of academics to review articles should also be routine (although probably not mandatory since none may respond in a timely fashion)
* Inviting more than one wikipedian who professes not to have any specialist medical knowledge to review for a general audience
* Turning on the &quot;article feedback&quot; for a period to get opinions from the non-wikipedian general public. ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 23:26, 6 February 2014 (UTC)

With some fine-tuning, such a group-sourced review process would be far more thorough than a typical peer review in a journal. ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 23:34, 6 February 2014 (UTC)

I'm not sure we need anything quite that heavy.  What we mainly need is a way to guarantee a review that (a) pays attention to compliance with MEDRS, and (b) makes a serious effort ot assess the validity of the content. ser:Looie496|Looie496 (ser talk:Looie496|talk) 17:40, 7 February 2014 (UTC)
Okay will draft something. I like the idea of a GA reviewer with &quot;real-life expertise&quot;. Those of us here I think know more or less who those people are. Thus when a person brings an article to GA they will need to request one of those reviewers. ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 18:08, 7 February 2014 (UTC)

Translation from simplified English
Today I created a simplified / shortened version of all the articles involved in the P:TTF as can be seen in the simplified column here [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Medicine/Translation_task_force/RTT]. They are basically a simplified version of the leads of the articles in question.

Some of the issues we were facing was that in the smaller languages of Wikipedia 1) there is often a limited vocabulary 2) readership may not want the same level of detail 3) less availability of volunteer translators 4) communities in these languages have a lessor ability to maintain content.

It is also superior from a public health perspective to translate a large number of small articles giving a general overview of many conditions than a few in-depth articles. It is also easier / better for us to fix up the leads of many English article, than the entirety of a few. If people fix up a lead of a specific article of general medical importance and wish to nominate it for translation please leave me a note on my talk page. ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 00:09, 9 February 2014 (UTC)

 ikipedia talk:Articles for creation/Cardiac Research Institute at Masonic Medical Research Laboratory 

Dear medical experts:  The above old Afc draft was declined because the subject exists; however, there doesn't seem to be a lot of overlap between this and rand Lodge of New York#Community and charity.  Should this stale draft be kept or deleted?  —ser:Anne Delong|Anne Delong (ser talk:Anne Delong|talk) 00:13, 7 February 2014 (UTC)

ser:Blueboar is the expert on Masonic organizations.  My inclination is a merge to asonic Medical Research Laboratory (except it doesn't exist) or to the sponsoring org.  The sources are weak for independent notability (#2 through #12 are primary literature, not about the org itself).  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:12, 7 February 2014 (UTC)
The MMRL does deserve to have its own article... but WhatamIdoing is correct in noting that the draft, as it currently stands, needs more in the way of secondary sourcing to establish notability.  I'm fairly sure we can come up with such sourcing, but until we do...  
As a first step (with P:PRESERVE in mind)... I would suggest adding the material to the rand Lodge of New York article... (in a sub-section entitled &quot;Masonic Medical Research Laboratory&quot;). That may not be the best place for the information... but it is an acceptable temporary home for it.  Making it a sub-section within the GLNY article will save the information from being completely lost (which would happen if the draft was simply deleted), and once we do find the needed independent reliable sources, we can always split the sub-section out again, and turn it into a stand-alone article. ser:Blueboar|Blueboar (ser talk:Blueboar|talk) 15:07, 8 February 2014 (UTC)
I have postponed deletion for six months using fc postpone.  If some sources can be found in less time than that, the merge may not be necessary. Also, one good thing about these old drafts is that since they are deleted using db-g13, just for being stale, they can be routinely &quot;refunded&quot; by request of any editor who takes an interest in them.—ser:Anne Delong|Anne Delong (ser talk:Anne Delong|talk) 00:37, 9 February 2014 (UTC)

 Oral rehydration therapy Comment 

Hello. I short while ago, I made an extensive copy edit of ral rehydration therapy which it was tagged as needing. I understand that any contribution can be changed - that's fine - I'm not here to crush sour grapes. I'm just letting you know that there is a problem with the article in that the current editor is simply undoing most changes and is not able to collaborate. I'm sure the editor believes he is protecting his own work in good faith but has no expertise in the field and is making some misinterpretations of the literature. I can't make any headway I'm afraid. Myrtle.ser:Myrtlegroggins|Myrtlegroggins (ser talk:Myrtlegroggins|talk) 06:59, 8 February 2014 (UTC)

 Paolo Zamboni's unusual claims about MS 

aolo Zamboni needs a serious work over. -- ser:BullRangifer|Brangifer (ser talk:BullRangifer|talk) 01:42, 9 February 2014 (UTC)

I have added stuff from the ational Multiple Sclerosis Society's website, which I think is at least a somewhat reliable source. From what I can tell, it seems that the results have, so far, been inconsistent in verifying his results (e.g. see [http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/multiple_sclerosis/detail_multiple_sclerosis.htm here]), so he's not a total crank. If he were, every study would be contradicting his hypothesis, as was the case with, for example, ndrew Wakefield. Also, I can't help but think of [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/ba/Surfaceuse.jpg this] whenever I see his last name. ser:Jinkinson|Jinkinson ser talk:Jinkinson|talk to me 02:43, 9 February 2014 (UTC)
These MS societies are patient groups. They are grasping at straws. No one other than Zamboni has been able to get positive results.

The Zamboni article has not kept pace with the one on CSVI, and even that one still reflects outdated sources.  Reviews in the past year such as MID|23443168 MC |3652697 are pretty clear. Some updates are needed. ser:LeadSongDog|LeadSongDog ser talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl! 05:31, 9 February 2014 (UTC)

 nesthesia 

I was going to start some work on anaesthesia and was looking for a quick opinion from more experienced editors.  The article is almost all about who can give anaesthesia rather than what it's about.  We had the same issue on ental implant. Imo it makes the article unreadable to someone trying to learn about anesthesia.  I'd like to restructure the article to follow the ikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Medicine-related_articles#Surgeries_and_procedures|Surgeries and procedures MEDMOS and move the &quot;personnel&quot; discussion to the end (or depending on references out and merge info with anesthesiology, or something to do with the people instead of the procedure).  Thoughts on a rework of this article?  ser:Ian Furst|Ian Furst (ser talk:Ian Furst|talk) 15:09, 8 February 2014 (UTC)

checked out both already.  anesthetic is the drug and anesthesia (lack of sensation) is on a disamb page.  This seems to be the popular page that everyone hits when looking for info on anesthesia.
