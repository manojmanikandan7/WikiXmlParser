good info-- () 16:45, 21 June 2015 (UTC)
Interesting [http://communicationandhealth.ro/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/BEHDIN-NOWROUZI.pdf]. They found that Wikipedia is as complete as WebMD and Mayo Clinic. But more difficult to read.
WebMD and Mayo however are plastered with advertising and give the actual content so little room. They also like clip art. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 17:55, 21 June 2015 (UTC)
more difficult to read, because more thought has been put into the articles, though the lede is being made simpler (when an opportunity arises with each article)-- () 19:59, 21 June 2015 (UTC)

Dr Google

A pertinent read (imo) from the Guardian today, written by a thoughtful oncologist called Ranjana Srivastava  [http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/22/bronte-doyne-cancer-google]:

The modern cancer patient has typically Googled the diagnosis, the oncologist, prospective treatment and a whole lot more before setting foot in the office. This can mean that serious, life-changing issues compete with the frankly nonsensical.

Last week, between cajoling a patient to enter a hospice and treating a homeless man I heard a discourse on Mexican garlic, another on healing spinach juice and a patient demanded scans recommended by a popular blog.

I resent Dr Google being the silent spoiler in my life but only until I recognise how the internet has allowed patients to seek counsel that would have been unthinkable in another era, and access to often high-quality information written with the patient in mind. My last few patients have probably learned more about clinical trials from the internet than from me.

But look up “best treatment for cancer” and you have an astonishing 300 million offerings. Right there with rigorous, evidence-based sites there are those offering fermented foods and DIY cancer cure kits. ...worried patients need help to distinguish between sensible advice and fanciful claims.

the &quot;popular press&quot; (the Guardian)is not interested in facts ( worried patients need help to distinguish between sensible advice and fanciful claims )[http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/22/bronte-doyne-cancer-google]...though in this case I must admit the patients situation was difficult-- () 10:37, 22 June 2015 (UTC)

Medicine is definitely changing. Patients now have decent access to health care information even though much of it is poor in nature. I; however, think this is generally a good change. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 12:57, 22 June 2015 (UTC)

Camel urine/blood and MERS

Hello, we've had someone asking us (editors on the ) about cultural practices relating to the consumption of camel urine and/or blood in the Middle East.  It isn't really our focus, however, I have been talking to a virologist who says that this is considered to be a source of MERS. In briefly investigating wiki pages, I have not been able to find this mentioned on Urine therapy or the main Camel page.  I don't think it is really my place to get into Middle East respiratory syndrome or any of the (possibly relevant) medical pages, but I was wondering if anyone might consider whether this should (or quite possibly should not) be added to some of these pages?  There are a number of strong looking reviews talking about the link [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673615604548#cesec70 including this] one in The Lancet. Thanks!  () 09:43, 22 June 2015 (UTC)

 I thought it was a bit sneaky for Ozzie10aaaa to edit his/her comment to take out the claim that it was not a review. But anyway, as far as I can see (reading the whole paper) it is a secondary rather than a primary source.  () 12:18, 22 June 2015 (UTC)
it didn't look like one (theres nothing &quot;sneaky&quot; about it, for any article you need to show the reader what the reference is that supports the statement) because there is no full access you so indicated here [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine&amp;diff=668107278&amp;oldid=668107185]....MEDRS is very clear -- () 12:20, 22 June 2015 (UTC)

Wikipedia + Reddit

A bit ago Lane [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine/Archive_63#Reddit_Science_AMA_.2B_PLOS_.2B_Wikipedia posted an idea] to try to integrate Wikipedia with Reddit. Just today I have [https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:IdeaLab/Reddit_Science_AMA_%2B_PLOS_%2B_Wikimedia#Draft_Proposal formalized a draft proposal with the basic ideas] which I would like some input on from anyone. The basic idea is I think we should make content such as videos and other other interesting content for people to enjoy. the overall goal is to educate the public on how Wikipedia works behind the scenes to provide good content. We have seen many studies where a vast majority use Wikipedia in the healthcare sector but do not state they trust it. While this is meant to improve brand image, it also would serve as an editor recruitment tool. While most of the time we try to actively tell people to edit Wikipedia with little success, perhaps we should want them to do so organically? 

Look forward to hearing everyone input! [[User:Peter.C|Peter.C]] • [[User talk:Peter.C|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Peter.C|contribs]] 16:18, 22 June 2015 (UTC)
sounds like a great idea-- () 17:09, 22 June 2015 (UTC)

Financial toxicity/cancer merge

Hi all, I'm suggesting that the stub on Financial toxicity be merged with Cancer's section on economic effects. Cancer is protected so I've held back on moving forward. The page on financial toxicity has minimal sources, both articles by the same co-author, but I'm not super familiar with medicine, so I thought I'd bring it to your attention. Your help is appreciated!  () 22:57, 23 June 2015 (UTC)

Looks like a neologism of questionable merit to me. And the 'Economic effect' section in the cancer article needs globalising, if it is merited at all - our readers aren't all from the U.S.  () 23:07, 23 June 2015 (UTC)
I agree -- () 23:37, 23 June 2015 (UTC)
I think we need a good general article on the financial effects of illness.  Cancer isn't the only expensive disease out there (for example, dialysis due to kidney failure).   () 23:48, 23 June 2015 (UTC)

I was involved in some research on financial aspects of cancer once. While I've not heard term financial toxicity, there is a bit of literature on tjhis topic. Really should be dealt with in society and culture section of disease articles, but a dedicated article would also be valuable imo.  () 09:40, 24 June 2015 (UTC)

Re-writing an article?

Hey, I need some people to help with the article for Litten's sign (lung). It'd been tagged as a hoax but from what I can see this is a term that's used. That's about the extent of my knowledge of this as I don't really know what to put aside from that and this desperately needs to be edited by someone who is familiar with the term as it applies to lungs. I have no problem with this being merged into the main article for Litten's sign, which is currently only about the term as it applies to eyes. It looks like this term was applied to both, so maybe they can be merged? [[User talk:Tokyogirl79| (｡◕‿◕｡)]] 07:50, 24 June 2015 (UTC)
the Litten's sign (diaphragm phenomenon) article does have a good MEDRS #1 reference, however it is dated (old)... (the #4 is in Spanish, and 2 and 3 are non-MEDRS compliant)... In regards to merging [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litten%27s_sign]they are different anatomical ailments. thank you-- () 10:42, 24 June 2015 (UTC)

Nothing on Pubmed for Litten sign. I think it is too obscure for its own article.  |  12:00, 24 June 2015 (UTC)

hm there are a whole slew of these that i didn't know existed, and even a template for them: .  () 12:02, 24 June 2015 (UTC)

 Oy gevald my eyes. Most of those &quot;signs&quot; are diagnostic tests (e.g. Kveim test) or X-ray findings (Hampton/Westermark/Kerley). That template really needs renaming.  |  16:36, 24 June 2015 (UTC)
and most of them are stubby.  i wonder if we should merge/redirect each of them into the condition they are used to diagnose or something similar.  () 16:47, 24 June 2015 (UTC)

 I suppose that depends entirely on the nature of the sign. If a sign is &quot;pathognomonic&quot; for a certain condition there is little point in having a separate article and merging might be entirely appropriate.  |  21:54, 24 June 2015 (UTC)

Fundamentals of Robotic Surgery

Peoples thoughts? [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 21:57, 24 June 2015 (UTC)
seems interesting/important [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007339.htm]...however the article could use more prose and less numeration, also the references with the possible exception of #2, need attention...-- () 23:29, 24 June 2015 (UTC)
Not an encyclopaedic article, and not a topic I'd expect to see in an encyclopaedia. Robotic surgery is clearly a topic meriting coverage, and (given sufficient coverage in third-party sources) the teaching of robotic surgery might well be - but an article on a curriculum for the teaching of robotic surgery? Surely not. Wikipedia is not a web-hosting service...  () 23:37, 24 June 2015 (UTC)
I don't see why we don't apply  here. If the &quot;curriculum&quot; is notable it deserves an article. That said most of the sources are self-referential and could do with pruning. Also I would agree with Ozzie, it's far more important that we bring Robotic surgery to a decent standard, so if nothing could be salvaged here we can just redirect the page. -- [[User:CFCF|CFCF]]  () 05:44, 25 June 2015 (UTC)

Reference meets WP:MEDRS but...
Okay, I'm still learning the intricacies of proper sourcing. I have found a review article that is quite [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3932255/ fascinating]. I was searching for info on STIs and this article proposes alternative, successful treatments that I've never heard of.  And its not the only article that refers to these treatments.  Now aren't there about a billion people in China, and wouldn't they consider these therapies valid, especially since their efficacies are evaluated with these reviews?
   |  18:51, 25 June 2015 (UTC)
Impact factor is not very high. Thus not a very good source. We should generally stick with sources from reputable publishers with a significant track record of publishing high quality research. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 19:01, 25 June 2015 (UTC)
I agree except this review-level article is just the tip of the iceberg.  These Chinese therapies ARE showing up from reputable publishers.  And the impact?  Well, since a billion people might be using these therapies I would say the impact could be quite high.  If I find other review-level articles from reputable publishers (is there a list of these?) on the same topic with the same or conflicting conclusions, would citing these articles then be appropriate?
   |  19:14, 25 June 2015 (UTC)

Input wanted for a small blinded study of the quality of WP:Med articles

Hi.
I am planning on doing a small study of the quality of or cardiology articles with C- or B-status.
A random sample of the articles will be selected, anonymise by reducing them to a text-only version, and be reviewed by blinded (MDs incl. cardiologist) reviewers (the do not know the articles come from Wikipedia).
After each article they will be presented with a questionnaire with a couple of questions. The reviewers can chose an answer based on a 1 to 7 scale (3 increasing positives, 1 neutral and 3 increasing negative) e.g. Excellent, Very Good, Good, Neither good nor bad, Poor, Very poor or Terrible.

I am looking for input for the questions on the questionnaire. This is what I had in mind:

Please rate your overall opinion about the quality of this article
Compared to medical textbooks, such as Medicinsk kompendium (Danish golden-standard-textbook for internal medicine) or Harrison´s Principles of Internal Medicine, how would you rate the quality of this article
Compared to medical textbooks, such as Medicinsk kompendium or Harrison´s Principles of Internal Medicine, how would you rate the readability of and language used in this article
Are there important omissions or errors in the article?
Is the article adequate in its coverage of the subject?
Would you recommend this article to a source of patient information?
Would you recommend this article to a colleague?

Do any of you have suggestion to changes or comments to the questions? If so please let me know. By the way there will also be pre- and poststudy questionnaires.
I know it is not the best study design and I was planning on doing a study with control articles taken from textbooks or e.g. NHS or WebMD (if very interested there is a ) but it turned out to be too much comparing oranges and apples.
Kind regards  () 19:47, 21 June 2015 (UTC)
As part of the post study questions would be good to determine how well the blinding worked. (ie ask the question &quot;where do you think the content was from?&quot;) [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 19:54, 21 June 2015 (UTC)
Yup, good suggestion by . Effectively 'anonymizing' articles extracted from a publication with an editorial format/style as familiar as Wikipedia's could be a challenging task.  () 09:36, 22 June 2015 (UTC)
the questions seem to be objective as is the rating scale-- () 19:57, 21 June 2015 (UTC)
, did you consider trying to use a regular medical encyclopedia as the control?   Also, rather than (or in addition to) asking &quot;Are there important omissions or errors&quot;, it might be useful to ask &quot;What's missing or wrong?&quot;   () 03:21, 22 June 2015 (UTC)
Just a few quick thoughts about the *focus* of the questionnaire/survey. The questions seem to be aiming to assess doctors' expert opinions as an indicator of &quot;quality&quot; – an approach that has some intrinsic limitations as you're no doubt aware. The first question seems to be the most resonant one, but ultimately perhaps the most potentially misleading because of its extreme subjectivity (&quot;quality&quot; in what sense/context?). &quot;Textbooks&quot; like Harrison´s and &quot;patient information&quot; are normally two very different types of publication (and this sort of questionnaire will inevitably provide a &quot;doctor-skewed&quot; view). I wonder what your precise research question is.  () 09:24, 22 June 2015 (UTC)
* Please see  for what research has come before. My biggest objection to most Wikipedia health critiques is that Wikipedia articles are often compared to imaginary ideal sources rather than any existing comparable source. You say that you would compare Wikipedia to a medical textbook, and I think that is fine, but during the research I think you should dictate that to which Wikipedia is compared.
If possible, it would be nice if a given topic in Wikipedia could be compared 1:1 with a given source, but I recognize that to read Wikipedia content it is required to jump from article to article through links and perhaps in a textbook one would also need to check several chapters to cover a concept. If it were possible, I would prefer a solid comparison with a defined source. [[User:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ]][[User talk:Bluerasberry|(talk)]] 13:20, 22 June 2015 (UTC)
Agree with Blue. There is no perfect source / no gold standard. All sources contain errors / become out of date. The problem with using a rating scale is it needs to also run on a comparator. I do not think their is a way around this. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 14:41, 22 June 2015 (UTC)
Please, pleeaaase include at least one control source.  I've read several studies that assess Wikipedia's content in comparison to, well, nothing, and I've found every one utterly worthless.  They come up with some sort of number at the end, but there's no way of knowing whether that number is good or bad, and after a critical reading you feel like the whole thing was a waste of time.  If you want to know whether Wikipedia is a good source for patients, compare it to WebMD or Mayo Clinic.  If you want to know whether it's a good source for students, compare it to a textbook or some content from a MOOC.  Just asking for a subjective comparison to a textbook isn't worth much if the reviewer has not also done a blind critical reading of the textbook content; you'd be largely testing their faith in the textbook.  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22166182?dopt=Abstract This] is an outstanding example of how to conduct a study, though I recognise they had more resources available than most groups.  (•) 00:00, 23 June 2015 (UTC)
[fwiw]...fully concur with Adrian's observations; if there's no blinded comparison (textbook / website ?) the survey will inevitably regard doctors' *attitudes* to the content, and there'll be no way of disentangling the objective from the subjective.  () 15:42, 24 June 2015 (UTC) (=109.155.60.103 above)

Yes would be good to get concrete ideas of how to improve Wikipedia further. Would be good if those involved with the study were also improved with making the improvements. One could than finish the paper with, &quot;and these issues have now been fixed&quot; [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 14:57, 22 June 2015 (UTC)
I echo comments made by others. Important to test whether the blinding has worked. And what is the appropriate comparison? Is it a medical textbook, i.e. is Wikipedia trying to be a medical textbook? Or should it be compared with, say, a website aimed at the public?  () 17:11, 23 June 2015 (UTC)

First, thank you for your responses. It it much appreciated.
Blinding and improvements questions: I like the idea and will try to include a &quot;where do you think the content was from?&quot; and &quot;what can be improved about the article&quot;-type of question into the questionnaire. I think the first question should only be addressed in the post-study questionnaire while the latter should be part of the questionnaire immediately following the article/it review.
Yes, there should be a control group: I completely agree with you here. This was also my initial approach. But I have spend a couple of weeks looking for a control group (textbook, on-line source like WebMD and what have you) but I could not find any where it would make sense do a a 1:1 comparison even when if I have used a non-random sample (I tried looking up &quot;main&quot;-articles like acute coronary syndrome, angina pectoris and atrial flutter but still it was also to much oranges and apples to make any sense). That being said I will still try to make such a study but it is somewhere down the line.
For doctors or patients? ...and what the hell is quality anyway? As stated above quality should be measured against a control and being that Wikipedias is neither for doctors or patients in some sense this poses a problem. That is why I am trying to measure both parameters individually with the latter questions but also in a way combined with the first question.
To sum up: It is no where near the best methodology in the world. It is actually kind of shitty. It is however the best I can do at moment since I am only postgraduate student with very limited research experience who is doing this in my very limited spare time and have a tight deadline; for several reasons this study has to be done by fall. In my opinion it is still better than nothing and being that the research being conducted on the quality of Wikipedias medical content only amounts to a very limited number of pub-med indexed articles a year that mostly measures bias towards Wikipedia as a concept I still think it can provide some information of value.

, just wondering (again!) whether you might not be better off shifting your focus from &quot;quality&quot; to &quot;attitudes&quot;/&quot;observations&quot; of a certain relevant type of reader (eg some cardiologists). Personally, I feel it's always good to try to design a study capable of generating, after all limitations have been taken into account, some incremental/useful information, rather than just repeating... So I'm wondering whether it might be worth adjusting your aim (literally!). I'm sorry if I haven't expressed this very well. Best,  () 17:41, 24 June 2015 (UTC)
, how many articles and reviewers are you going to attempt?  Also, do you need to review whole articles, or could you give them only, say, the
Diagnosis
or
Treatment
sections?  (It'd save your participants some time.)  () 01:18, 25 June 2015 (UTC)
...(@) hum, I think it could be hard for a reader to gauge, say, adequacy of coverage from an isolated (decontextualized) section. Pertinent content may be spread across different sections (even in articles that have reached FA, eg here/here). Also, judgements can vary on what constitutes, say, &quot;Diagnosis&quot;: just relevant tests (and their predictive value) / or also clinical suspicion based on signs and symptoms etc.   () 09:19, 25 June 2015 (UTC)
I apologize if I am making a suggestion in the wrong thread, but I believe a question should be in the evaluation that asks the cardiologists for whom do they believe the article was written? answers could be, the public, a person who has just been diagnosed with a cardiac condition, nurses, nurse practitioners, PCPs, or cardiologists.  The audience matters!  We are not writing for medical practitioners and I don't think we should be evaluated to that standard.

Imo, 's suggestion regarding doctors' *perceptions* is a stimulating one... Imo, so much more interesting to go down that sort of *qualitative* research route than to attempt something that doesn't really seem feasible in the circumstances (ie reliable quantification of &quot;quality&quot;). Then you'd find yourself better placed to invest *creatively* in the relevance/originality of the research question/s. (Could I perhaps suggest also trying to contact , who I happen to know has himself supervised readability research?)  () 20:10, 25 June 2015 (UTC)

Hi, again. Thanks for all you input in have tried to incorporate what I can. You been a big help. To quick things:
It will be a review of whole articles not just sections. It will (hopefully) be done for teen articles (5 C-class and 5 B-class).
Dear . I am very interested in what you have to say about a more qualitative study. But the design here was sort of locked in place with the time I have available (I will soon be leaving the ward where I work and thereby contact to my review group). I would however love to hear your suggestions and thoughts in more depth at a later time for (if possible) another study down the line. Is it okay, if I contact you directly on your talkpage when I get that far (perhaps in the winter)? ...By the way; why not register for Wikipedia?

Hey, I've been meaning to ask:  How's  plan for the Haitian Wikipedia going?  I see that you've been working on a couple of articles.   () 22:41, 25 June 2015 (UTC)
I'm making progress, I think but not as quickly as I would like.  I have started the translation of two of Project Med's priority articles that have been identified as needing translation:  Female genital mutilation and Yellow Fever.  Female genital mutilation is a long, and heavily referenced article in English. Even the references have to be translated because they contain so many notes. It is a featured article in English and I have been in contact with the major editor who brought to featured status. As for building community, I thought I would wait until I had a significant number of edits and then start looking for those editors who are active.  The translatewiki.net 'people' first rejected my application.  Then I reapplied and submitted 20 edits to show that I could translate.  Then they 'accepted' me as a translator. THEN a few days ago I was informed that I was rejected (again) and unable to contribute.  Translatewiki.net has only translated one medical article to haitian.  I don't need to be a part of translatewiki.net (their loss, I suppose) to keep working on translating med articles.  So far, no other active editor on the ht:Wikipedia has reverted any of my edits, but then again I am not sure I am getting any page views, either.  Would you like me to keep you informed on my activities on the ht:Wikipedia with some kind of periodic report?  I could just leave an informative weekly or biweekly message on your talk page.  I could ping Doc James so he knows the progress that is being made on the translation of high priority med articles. Best Regards,

Do you want to get nominated to be an administrator? It looks like you have at least four editors who would support your nomination.  I personally think it is a 'dirty' process where everyone looks for your 'Achilles heel' and all your past mistakes.  I also think nomination is a spectator sport.  But I am sure you would be a good administrator, especially when settling disputes.

Yes. These are the issues that Kombucha exemplifies. Wikipedians trying to push extraordinary claims using questionable sources. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 13:42, 25 June 2015 (UTC)
For me, the issue that the Kombucha discussion exemplifies is a different one, namely the opacity of MEDRS to many editors coming from outside of wikiproject medicine. Some may intentionally boost a bad review to promote their POV, but for others, a significant part of the problem is that MEDRS doesn't put forth a clear framework for evaluating reviews that are on the borderline - impact around 1 to 2. These would be RS in other parts of the encyclopedia, but as long as project medicine is setting medical refs to a higher standard, it should make that standard transparent and as objective as possible. () 19:21, 25 June 2015 (UTC)
Sure so a step by step process for finding reliable sources? I will begin drafting one. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 19:36, 25 June 2015 (UTC)
Good luck, but, ack. This is the kind of subtlety you either already know or won't fully understand from a wiki FAQ. The best guideline would leave it at &quot;If you're not absolutely confident that both your source and your understanding of its conclusions are impeccable, you should discuss it on the talk page instead of editing the article.&quot;  () 21:30, 25 June 2015 (UTC)
The guide sounds like a step in the right direction. Opabinia regalis, your guideline is going in the opposite direction with something of the same goal. There will always be a few editors who think their understanding is impeccable, and setting some outer bounds on acceptability shouldn't limit editors - what I would ideally like to see is a hard position taken on specific quality indicators, ie. review sources with an impact rating less than 1 should not be used. The 5 year point called out in MEDDATE is a move in this direction, and if there were just a few more criteria agreed upon by a majority, it would make sourcing less of a grounds for endless argument. And Sword and Skeleton is a lot better than it was a few years ago. They ran an excellent piece recently on the role mummies played in Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact. () 22:11, 25 June 2015 (UTC)
 I suspect the people who don't know what they don't know also don't know the underlying reasons for journal quality metrics like impact factors. You'll just end up with someone arguing their source is fine because the journal IF is 1.5. I'm generally not in favor of trying to reduce pointless arguments with arbitrary numerical criteria. Make the rules simple to follow and simpletons will manage.
 Besides, I wasn't convinced by that mummies piece. They didn't do anything to address the evidence in favor of alien abductions.  () 06:40, 29 June 2015 (UTC)

An officially &quot;reasonable&quot; medical option?

The United States National Institutes of Health says &quot;acupuncture appears to be a reasonable option&quot;.[https://nccih.nih.gov/health/acupuncture/introduction#hed3] Here is some of the history[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_alternative_medicine#1990s_to_present]. Wikipedia has an article on reason.

Wikipedia has articles on many things. None of them are relevant to our article on acupuncture however, since we don't cite Wikipedia as a source.  () 16:27, 26 June 2015 (UTC)
very interesting...The effects of acupuncture on the brain and body and how best to measure them are only beginning to be understood. Current evidence suggests that many factors—like expectation and belief—that are unrelated to acupuncture needling may play important roles in the beneficial effects of acupuncture on pain.[https://nccih.nih.gov/health/acupuncture/introduction#hed3]-- () 16:30, 26 June 2015 (UTC)
@, what I am not understanding is that each of the &quot;systematic reviews&quot; showing some mysterious new &quot;energy&quot; source or proposed &quot;biomechanism&quot; for the &quot;effects&quot; (which TCM practitioners just happened to have come across by application of incorrect traditional Chinese anatomy, Chinese Astrology, and numerology, to start sticking needles in people to fight disease), notes that there was not a single truly double blinded study included in the systematic review, yet they went ahead and published the review as if there were such studies, and got the &quot;efficacy&quot; conclusion published in the abstract, without mention that the review included zero double blind studies, as if there were real double blinded studies being reviewed.  () 16:54, 26 June 2015 (UTC)
I understand and agree with you, however now NIH is stating the above quote. In other words though one might be of a different opinion, NIH is starting to take a position on this( and who knows what else)-- () 17:13, 26 June 2015 (UTC)
There appear to be two different voices speaking for NIH, one made by biomedical science spokespersons, the other made by alt med promoters and practitioners, per this history[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_alternative_medicine#1990s_to_present].  () 17:18, 26 June 2015 (UTC)
to be clear, the site linked above is the NCCIH which is not exactly the same as its sister institutions nor the NIH per se.  it is useful to attribute accurately.  that said, i do think they are expressing the medical consensus that one finds stated more and more frequently - acu is useful and safe enough as an adjunct to conventional med for some pain conditions and some side effects of chemo... situations that conventional med doesn't handle well and where placebo is powerful. it is not that big of a scandal. Some people are horrified by that and others want to take that and run way too far with it... but WP deals with the world as it is, not anybody's ideal world.  () 17:46, 26 June 2015 (UTC)
I am unclear how the NCCIH part of NIH, that is by law[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_alternative_medicine#1990s_to_present dominated by WP:NPOV violating alt med promoters and practitioners] and is &quot;independent&quot; of the biomedical part of NIH, can be accepted as MEDRS, when it admits that the &quot;reasonable&quot; systematic reviews it relies on, did not find a single correctly double blinded study to include in the review, yet analyzed the defective studies showing efficacy as part of a &quot;systematic review&quot; anyway. By definition, a systematic review can include only correctly double blinded studies. Then this NCCIH body made of political appointees picked to promote and practice alt med, makes a declaration under NIH's banner that this is &quot;reasonable&quot;. This makes no sense under WP:MEDRS standards.  () 18:35, 26 June 2015 (UTC)
well for starters NPOV doesn't apply to anybody but WP editors. :)  I know you are frustrated, I hear that. And if you [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Search?search=NCCAM&amp;prefix=Wikipedia+talk%3AWikiProject+Medicine&amp;fulltext=Search+archives&amp;fulltext=Search search the archives for &quot;NCCAM&quot;] you will see that the point you are raising .  There has always been some tension between whether our articles should emphasize evidence (the &quot;biomedical reviews&quot; part of the definition of &quot;secondary&quot; in MEDRS) or consensus (the &quot;statements by major medical and scientific bodies&quot; part of the definition of &quot;secondary&quot;).  Generally those two align, but in cases just like this, what I have seen quackfighters do is emphasize evidence when discussing sourcing.  () 19:03, 26 June 2015 (UTC)
hmm...with some CAM interventions such as acupuncture (unlike with, say, homeopathy) plausible biological mechanisms beyond placebo do exist[sorry, I don't have the RS to hand] other than the traditional/quack theories/explanations.  () 21:19, 26 June 2015 (UTC)
What is the plausible biological explanation as to how acupuncture treats various cancers, assorted bacterial infections,  viruses, and all the other diseases it claims to treat by sticking needles in specific locations? What biologically plausible explanation would lead anyone to ever first think of sticking an acupuncture needle in a specific point to treat a runny nose or ear infection, etc.?  () 22:47, 26 June 2015 (UTC)
@: sorry, poorly expressed... I meant &quot;intervention&quot; within a PICO context. What I meant was that *certain* claims for acupuncture may be biologically plausible, whereas for homeopathy no clinical claim is plausible beyond placebo (or talking, etc). I believe (correct me if I'm wrong) that's why WP rules about editing homeopathy content are so tight.  () 09:14, 27 June 2015 (UTC)
Yes agree. It is a significant effort to keep our alt med content well references and reflecting mainstream scientific opinion. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 23:03, 26 June 2015 (UTC)
 this is getting way too long.  acu-proponents wave their hands at neurotransmitters or neurohormones as possible mechanisms and some even murkier stuff.  there is no scientific explanation for meridians/qi etc.  the evidence for the indications the NCCIH mentions are from empirical studies with problematic placebos and results were barely significant over placebo.  but both placebo and acu were much better than standard of care.  and nobody serious talks about all those things you list (viruses etc) - that is what quacks push and they are pretty much strawmen/big waste of time in any serious discussion. but we constantly have to deal with people making those claims and with other people over-obsessing on them.  () 23:11, 26 June 2015 (UTC)
You know, a web search engine can find someone saying almost anything, so there probably is someone who thinks that acupuncture cures the common cold, but it's my impression that people mainly see acupuncturists for pain and fatigue.  Fatigue is probably helped quite a lot by lying still on a table for an hour, and pain is notoriously affected by expectations and theatrical elements like the mood of the provider.  It probably &quot;works&quot;, if by &quot;works&quot; you mean &quot;the patient feels better (for a little while) afterwards&quot;.  And the side effects of conventional treatments for serious pain are not to be overlooked:  Acupuncture isn't 100% harmless, but fentanyl kills people.
Also, it's worth remembering that systematic reviews don't have any standards at all, except for what's declared in the methodology section.  You could do a systematic review of the number of words in the abstracts of acupuncturists whose first names start with &quot;E&quot;, if you wanted to.  &quot;Systematic review&quot; is .   () 04:21, 27 June 2015 (UTC)
Among many epidemiologists at least, Bradford Hill's position remains, I think, a fairly widely respected scientific POV: It will be helpful if the causation we suspect is biologically plausible. But this is a feature I am convinced we cannot demand. What is biologically plausible depends upon the biological knowledge of the day. [http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/hill] The fact that a proposed mechanism is nebulous does not logically disqualify the possibility that one may exist. In such cases, failure to source/reflect the best available evidence – complete with limitations – would, imo, ultimately be a failure in NPOV.  () 12:51, 27 June 2015 (UTC)
 you know i was talking about people coming to WP and wanting to add those kinds of claims to our article.  the POV-pushing is all around on those articles.  () 13:49, 27 June 2015 (UTC)
I think we all agree that POV-pushing is one of the more annoying and potentially destructive aspects of Wikipedia editing... However, I would argue that it can be humanly challenging for some very gf editors to realize when they may actually be inadvertently pushing a latent pov themselves. I think could arguably be the case here. The  [https://nccih.nih.gov/health/acupuncture/introduction#hed3 NIH patient guidance under discussion] is based on available evidence of efficacy of the intervention in particular clinical contexts. The strength of that evidence is by no means conclusive, but the evidence is indeed based on a reasoned scientific approach, using established scientific (ie epidemiologic) methodology. From a strictly WP perspective, I feel the editorial challenge is to appropriately  the emphasis given to (evidence of effectiveness of) acupuncture within relevant MED pages. 2c,  () 11:25, 29 June 2015 (UTC)

My understanding is that intrusive thoughts are a symptom, officially recognized as a defining characteristic of OCD and some other conditions.  Scrupulosity is a pattern of behavior which is the defining characteristic of &quot;scrupulosity disorder&quot;, a subtype of OCD.  In short, I don't see any serious problem here.

Fwiw I've requested a medical citation for the claim that &quot;Scrupulosity is the modern-day medical *diagnosis*[medical citation needed] that corresponds to a traditional use of the term scruples in a religious context, e.g. by Roman Catholics, to mean obsessive concern with one's own sins and compulsive performance of religious devotion.[ref]&quot;. Also, to my layperson's brain, I'm puzzled by what the scientific basis could be for the claim at the end of the Intrusive thoughts lead that &quot;Intrusive thoughts, urges, and images... can be divided into three categories: &quot;inappropriate aggressive thoughts, inappropriate sexual thoughts, or blasphemous religious thoughts&quot;&quot;.[ref] (surely a highly selective/incomplete classification?).

medical advice on the refdesks

On the reference desk talk page there's a  of what constitutes medical advice and the kinds of medical advice that should not be allowed on the reference desks (or on Wikipedia).

It started with this thread (linking to old version of the page because someone has since removed the advice, but well after the OP responded in a way that clearly took it as medical advice): [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Science&amp;oldid=669057639#Possible_to_stop_eyes_from_watering.3F Possible to stop eyes from watering?]

The gist: a user posted a question explaining that he views himself as unemotional and wanted a method to avoid having his eyes water during emotional parts of films per expectations of masculinity. Clearly any direct answer is going to be fraught, but a refdesk regular quickly responded with simply &quot;SSRIs should work well&quot; and went on to defend that as not being in conflict with Wikipedia's medical disclaimer. 

Seeking additional eyes/thoughts, especially from those who may have more experience dealing with medical advice on Wikipedia. — [[User:Rhododendrites|Rhododendrites]]  \\ 19:02, 28 June 2015 (UTC)

Note, I just defended the statement in the context of the discussion there (i.e. that the OP should of course always stick to whatever his/her doctor prescribes). The issue is then simply mentioning that X can help with condition Y as a statement of fact instead of saying that &quot;you should use X as a cure for Y&quot;. The latter is clearly not allowed.  My problem with not allowing the former statement  is that this amounts to censorship. There may still be problems with the way I suggested that SSRIs could help with the condition, but the objection to my statement suggests that even mentioning something more clear cut like e.g. that antihistamines can help to deal with allergies wouldn't be allowed because only doctors are in the business of prescribing antihistamines. That sounds over the top to me, as we're not prescribing medicines, only doctors can do that.  () 19:19, 28 June 2015 (UTC)

You don't know that X is a good way to treat &quot;condition&quot; Y because condition Y is &quot;my eyes water during emotional parts of movies, and I'm a guy so I don't want that to happen&quot;. As far as I know, there is no medical literature on the use of SSRIs to enhance one's performance of masculinity by preventing eyes from watering.... 
So your statement of &quot;fact&quot; is bogus, first of all, but the distinction you're trying to make doesn't hold water either, because you're comparing &quot;statement of fact&quot; as though in a vacuum to a more explicit recommendation. Your &quot;statement of fact&quot; was presented as an answer to a particular person who asked for treatment advice for a particular problem. By saying &quot;SSRIs should work well&quot;, the &quot;...as a treatment for what you asked for help with&quot; is implicit. 
Cry censorship if you like, but it's still [lousy] medical advice and thus inappropriate. — [[User:Rhododendrites|Rhododendrites]]  \\ 20:45, 28 June 2015 (UTC)

Not only is it medical advice, it's terrible medical advice.  The idea of taking drugs with a whole range of negative side effects because your eyes water at emotional movies is completely absurd.  () 13:54, 29 June 2015 (UTC)
It's not medical advice, because I didn't advice him to start a medical treatment using these drugs (and saying that it still does, doesn't make it so, no matter how large the consensus is that says so). Thing is that in the very same thread there were other contributors who on the one hand argued that what I wrote amounted to giving medical advice, but then they had no qualms about writing what you wrote here, i.e. that a treatment of such a problem using SSRIs would be a bad treatment. That sounds a lot more like giving medical advice to me, because if someone was prescribed by his/her own doctor to use SSRIs for such a problem then that person could read here that this is not good.
What this demonstrates to me is that this whole brouhaha about &quot;Medical Advice Blaaargggh&quot; has nothing whatsoever to do with any real potential problems, that the people who make a big fuss about it have other motives, wanting to play the boss, wanting to censor information they disagree with or whatever. Thing is that I'm really not interested in anything that comes out of this nonsensical discussion here or elsewhere, I'll continue to violate any stupid nonsensical rules that have little to do with reality.

TheNNT

 added some content to hypertension- and cardiac arrest-related articles based solely on the summaries from the TheNNT website. While I support the principles behind the site, I didn't feel that the content was -proof.

I have now been contacted by David Newman (Meyershp's supervisor and the site's founder[http://www.wired.com/2014/10/number-needed-to-treat/]), to see if some form of collaboration can be explored. He informs us that the site has a peer review mechanism, and that this perhaps could make it -compatible.

Best to stick with the systematic reviews IMO. I guess that these could be used as a lay summary link. Cochrane has their own lay summaries aswell though.
Have reached out to David as well. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 18:09, 1 July 2015 (UTC)
As a general comment, we've done a pathetic job of communicating the number needed to treat and number needed to harm to readers, and those numbers matter.  We're so focused on &quot;my source proves that it works!&quot; part that we forget the &quot;for just 1 in 12 treated patients&quot; part. 
Given what a lousy job we're doing on this particular point, and given the site's reputation for fact-checking and accuracy (e.g., their peer-review process), I could see something like [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cardiac_arrest&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=669115657 this] being acceptable as an incremental improvement.  It should, of course, be replaced by better information from a stronger source, but I would not revert it on grounds that it wasn't perfect on the first try.  A combination might be particularly valuable:  A citation to one or more reviews that support this information from the POV of a formal scholarly source, plus a  link to TheNNT's website for the sake of actual humans.   () 19:10, 1 July 2015 (UTC)
Imo,  makes a strong point here. Like it or not, some Wikipedia readers will be gleaning information to help make personal decisions (&quot;patient choices&quot;). While evidence, or otherwise, of efficacy may sound helpful, by itself it doesn't say that much... NNT provides a measure that (unlike [http://www.cebm.net/number-needed-to-treat-nnt/ absolute risk reduction]) is reasonably intuitive to understand for the general public. However, like all measures, it needs to be cited/deployed [http://www.cmaj.ca/content/179/6/549.long with care]. If we have a good MERS available that is providing updated evidence-based information on this, that could be a considerable asset here, imo.  () 21:23, 1 July 2015 (UTC)

Sinclair Method

Hello there! I was doing my rounds yesterday, and stumbled upon a curious Third Opinion request. One thing led to another, and now we've nominated  for deletion, given a) it is a construction by Sinclair himself (we're all familiar with WP:NOT), for which b) there are currently no extensive independent nor reliable sources available, as I detail in the linked discussion. I am afraid the AfD needs some experienced medical eyes, as one of the keep votes is a possible sockpuppet involved with the editing of the article itself. The same thing happened the first time around, when only one actual vote led to a speedy keep.

Molecular Therapy and Auger therapy

A couple of months ago I came across two articles that I'm not sure what to do with, but which need cleaning up (and maybe more scrutiny applied, depending on what exactly is going on). The articles are Molecular Therapy and Auger therapy. Both were created by  in December 2013 and October 2012 respectively. Both are tagged (for merge to molecular medicine and for excessively intricate detail respectively). IMO, the current articles were created by a  pushing a new medical technology, but I'm checking here in case opinions differ. There are journals called 'Molecular Therapy' and 'Molecular and Cellular Therapies', but I don't think that is what these articles are about. They appear to be about a proposed form of radiation therapy and my concerns are that the references at the bottom of Molecular Therapy are to a patent filed in 2007 and 2008. If you switch over to the Auger therapy article, you see the same patents from CG Wang and Lawrence Helson. And some more patent applications from 2011 and 2012. I think the CG Wang that filed that patent is the same person as Chia-Gee Wang of Nanodynamics Inc. The same name crops up in the OTRS permission tag for one of the images (see [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Auger_Therapy42.jpg here]). The nanodynamics website is at http://nanodynamics-88.com/. The whole auger therapy article appears to be a direct copy from [http://nanodynamics-88.com/Auger%20Therapy.pdf here] (I doubt it was copied the other way). Even if they have released that text under the appropriate license, there may be COI and notability and  issues involved here. This may be all rather advanced cutting edge stuff (or maybe something else, depending on how cynical you are), so I am not entirely sure what to do here. I did read more about Nanodynamics [http://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/21/business/patentssome-scientists-are-cool-his-idea-but-inventor-aims-for-breakthrough.html here] (Wang's name also appears there), which made me highly sceptical, but YMMV. Any ideas on the best approach to take here?  () 05:20, 2 July 2015 (UTC)

With respect to auger therapy there is one review from 1996 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8912375]
It has been picked up by some textbooks [https://books.google.ca/books?id=TMJm41g6YZYC&amp;pg=PA177] [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 06:38, 2 July 2015 (UTC)

 From a page naming and search ontology perspective, the two page names/search terms &quot;molecular therapy&quot; and &quot;molecular medicine&quot; should not fail to land on the same article. As for which one redirects to which, it doesn't matter, as long as the redirect happens. Regarding title case, the only smart thing to do with the title case &quot;Molecular Therapy&quot; is redirect it to that same common target as well. If anyone ever wants to make an article about the journal, they should name it &quot;Molecular Therapy (journal)&quot;, not &quot;Molecular Therapy&quot;. I perceive the content currently residing on the page &quot;Molecular Therapy&quot; as a partial  of the molecular medicine and auger therapy articles (a molecular medicine specialist could prove me wrong, but barring that, I don't see it). Accordingly each chunk of it should be merged into the molecular medicine or auger therapy article, as appropriate.  () 21:42, 2 July 2015 (UTC)
While I tend to agree with Quercus' position above re journal titles,  has not usually been applied that way. We have many articles on publications that are distinguished from the similarly-named articles on subject matter only by capitalization, without the appended &quot;(journal)&quot;. The place to make a change stick would be . [[User talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl!]] 22:10, 2 July 2015 (UTC)

 Ah, I see. OK, then an article about a journal could give a hatnote to the common noun (sentence case) to escape the wrong landing. That's good enough. Not the best IMO, but I leave it to the consensus of WP:DIFFCAPS, and this instance wouldn't meet the Jesus threshold described there. The first sentence of my comment, though, I would haggle to preserve.  () 22:28, 2 July 2015 (UTC)

I hope we don't get too sidetracked by the page naming issues. My main concern here is that Wikipedia ends up with pages that explain, concisely and clearly, what the terms 'molecular medicine/therapy' and 'auger therapy' refer to. The current pages are not easy to understand and my fear is that they present the perspective of specific companies/inventors rather than an overview of this subfield of nuclear medicine and the context it has with other techniques. Is this an experimental technique, still under development? That is not made clear enough on the current pages.  () 23:35, 2 July 2015 (UTC)

placebo effect/nejm

 Agree. This is exactly why not all herbalism is valueless just because it involves placebo effect. Value in health care includes making people feel less shitty, both physically and emotionally, even if the latter is only &quot;in their head&quot;. I totally, totally get that we need to keep people from elevating pseudoscience and antiscience as if they were &quot;equally valuable as&quot; science. Wrong, wrong, wrong—they're not, they're 99% bullshit. But don't take someone's St John's wort, or its placebo effect, away from them if they really think it's helping them feel less shitty. It's helping them in some way and it's not harming the world, at least not enough to count. This is, of course, different from tiger body parts, bear bile, opium, heroin, and other bullshit that is not harmless—whether it's not harmless to the patient, the environment, the society, or any combination of those. No, those things should not be tolerated, because they harm the world more than they help it. The hardest part about talking about this topic sanely is keeping the loonies and bullshit separated from the valid aspects. Many people exhibit an attitude of &quot;well you can't (keep them separated), so the only answer is to be radically extremist in the other direction, declaring all placebo effect worthless trash.&quot;  () 22:06, 2 July 2015 (UTC)

drug names (especially for generics)

i've been making it a habit to clear away all/most trade names for generic drugs and just provide a link to drugs.com where the whole laundrylist of names can be found - when I remove the list i always include that link.  i do that b/c for generic drugs, names of drugs became spam-magnets.  if a drug is still on patent i think it makes sense to include the brand name, and i think it makes sense to keep the original brandname after it goes generic... but after that it seems to me we have no justification for barring any one if we allow some names ... that's my thinking anyway.   noticed when i did this on Acenocoumarol and expressed some concern, that folks should be able to easily see in the article if they are in the right place, by seeing the relevant brand names there.  i hear that.   the two of us just had a very nice discussion on my Talk page, and it seemed good to both of us to get wider input.  i should stop doing that if folks generally disapprove.  thoughts?

I think that the best answer depends upon the number of brand names.  If it's just a couple, then include it.  If it's a lot, then don't – unless (Tylenol!) a couple are particularly well-known, in which case include (only) those couple of well-known brand names.  Also, you need to consider the reader's context:  most people don't know what Trastuzumab is, but they might have heard of Herceptin in news stories (probably about how expensive it is).

I don't understand the charges of &quot;spam&quot;; there's nothing inherently spammy about noting that X is also known as Y with no further commentary or links. I don't think there's much value in writing this stuff out in prose, and boxes if used should be toward the bottom of the page to prevent obtrusiveness in mobile view.  () 19:26, 29 June 2015 (UTC)
you don't see [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chlortalidone&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=662138438&amp;oldid=656445689 this] as obvious spamming? hm.  () 22:37, 29 June 2015 (UTC)
*Okay, THAT was a big fat spam-fest if ever I saw one (in India)!  Yeesh!  I don't think anyone will disagree with that assessment.  What I think we're really talking about here, though, are single mentions of alternate names, not that kind of repeated advertising.  As per , I still feel it would be useful to include these, and agree that as long as there are only two or three reasonably well-known ones, it might make sense to include them in the lede because people are likely to search on these terms (often more so than on the generic name).  But I am with you, ,  in opposing laundry lists designed only to give free air time to pharmaceutical companies (oh, and yeah, per , this is really not the right forum for this discussion, is it...  I have never moved a section of a talk page before, and doubt that a cut-and-paste edit is the right way to do it; a little help to get us over to the pharmaceutical talk page mentioned above?)

Seeing plenty of those kinds of edits is what started me doing this.  I posted notice at  here: .  () 12:04, 30 June 2015 (UTC)
Jytdog, you posted three links and I referred to the first one. The first was not spam, the second was a list with an inappropriate link, and the third was spam. Yet you've listed all three as examples of removing spammy and unencylopedic content.  () 20:13, 30 June 2015 (UTC)
PHARMMOS specifies a &quot;Brand names&quot; section. Could we not just link to that section in the lede? For example &quot;Buproprion is an antidepressant and smoking-cessation aid marketed under many names.&quot;  () 13:50, 30 June 2015 (UTC)
I typically move the list of brandnames to the end of the article. And only leave one or two in the lead. 
We should typically not put stuff in hide / show boxes. If we feel their is too much detail to be in the main article than a subpage is best. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 20:00, 30 June 2015 (UTC)
A brand names section works, though I maintain there is no point in presenting this stuff in pseudo-prose. Collapsed boxes are much superior to using separate pages IMO; they maintain the redirects to a main article in which the brand name is mentioned and incorporate relevant search terms into the text.  () 20:13, 30 June 2015 (UTC)
I hear that people using screen readers do not like collapsed boxes. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 20:18, 30 June 2015 (UTC)
Two things that seem to have been missed in this discussion.  First, any redirect (with in reason) should be bolded within the lead. This includes trade names. Of course, this is not practical if there are a large number of brand names. Second,  also has a tradename name section that can be used to store and display lists of trade names.  () 21:36, 30 June 2015 (UTC)
I think we need a limit of 4 in the infobox drug though. We do not want dozens or hundreds added their. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 02:01, 1 July 2015 (UTC)
Since the brand names are the names the drug is known by, they're an important tool for users looking for information, so we need to leave as many as practical in the article. I completely agree that we need to relegate them to the lower sections of the article, maybe to a multi-column list or something? For very common drugs we may need List of brandnames of morphine or similar; a list article with a high-regimented structure will make keeping the spam out easier.  () 02:27, 1 July 2015 (UTC)

* i want to note that this relates to the decision we made here:  which led to us creating Paracetamol brand names.  () 12:08, 1 July 2015 (UTC)

Double check! and a little help. Fever of Unknown Origin
Normally I wouldn't ask to double check this, but I thought that I updated so crazy many causes of diseases that I would like to have more eyes on it, since it is a mid important wikipedia page.

page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever_of_unknown_origin#Causes

I need some help with redirecting to other Wikipedia pages of the named diseases, I got almost all of them, just a few that I need help with. 
Also I hope the lay-out is ok? And also the sections are ok? 

I updated the Fever of Unknown Origin because I thought it was just really sad to see so little diseases listed. After thinking about the best way to do it I have decided to pick a really good book for reference as a starting point (Harrison's). It seemed not really logical to choose articles, even good ones, because of the change to miss out on something.

I decided to put the reference behind each disease instead of on the top, so that one can truly see where it came from and also, to prevent future added diseases from other people to get lost in references that do not include those terms. It seems a little overkill, but I thought it would be the best way. If there is another way, please do change.
Thank you!

New page

The genetic aspects of acute myeloid leukemia needs eyes. Formatting the references needs work, and although some of the sources seem to meet MEDRS, not all do, AFAICT.   20:24, 3 July 2015 (UTC)
references #1,6,7,10 are non-MEDRS compliant...(  indicates it doesn't appear to be a copyvio, though its presentation is unusual)-- () 12:14, 4 July 2015 (UTC)
 I am...concerned by the off-the-cuff declaration that the sources are &quot;non-MEDRS compliant&quot;.  I have said this many, many, many times before, but it seems that I have to keep saying it—sources aren't intrinsically reliable or unreliable.  The (un)suitability of a published paper depends both on the publication itself (the type and date of study, along with all the other factors mentioned in MEDRS) along with the claims that it is being used to support.  MEDRS is not a magic checklist.
Since the references in this article are broken in such a way that the footnote numbers aren't actually shown in the body of the article, it's virtually impossible to determine which claims are attached to which sources (if any).  It is therefore entirely inappropriate to make a blanket declaration that particular sources are &quot;non-MEDRS compliant&quot;.  I would ask Ozzie10aaaa to explain his process for determining whether or not sources are correctly used, and to refrain from making any such judgements in the future until he demonstrates a firmer grasp of MEDRS (and WP:RS in general). () 18:09, 4 July 2015 (UTC)
it is best if you read MEDRS that way you can give a more objective interpretation of  following this link,[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources_(medicine)] Primary sources should generally not be used for medical content. Many such sources represent unreliable information that has not been vetted in review articles, or present preliminary information that may not bear out when tested in clinical trials  and Look for reviews published in the last five years or so, with newer being better if you take the time to look at the references in question some are dated  (old), some are not reviews ( one article had prior correction[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3910665/] ) thank you (should you have further questions ask Doc James)-- () 19:38, 4 July 2015 (UTC)
What you're saying, then, is that you are indeed (mis)reading MEDRS as a series of binary yes/no checkboxes, and basing your conclusion about reliability on that mechanical assessment.  Please don't do that—especially when you don't know which claims are being based on which sources, or even if a given source is being presented to support a medical claim at all.  (And incidentally, the fact that a published paper has an associated erratum – as opposed to a retraction or an expression of concern – does not necessarily reflect on its usability as a source for Wikipedia content.  I'm not sure why you would bring that up.) () 00:40, 5 July 2015 (UTC)
refer to prior answer (or ask DocJames) thank you-- () 09:49, 5 July 2015 (UTC)
 Does that mean that you understand my concern, and that you will change your approach going forward?  Or something else?
I'm not sure why you keep referring me to ; he's not my keeper, and I'm assuming he isn't yours either.  Neither is he the sole expert or arbiter of the application of MEDRS.  (I suspect, however – based on my own experience with that guideline and the constructive interactions I have had with him about its development, use, and interpretation – that he and I usually aren't far apart on how MEDRS works.)  () 14:38, 5 July 2015 (UTC)
My positions is that we should be generally using high quality secondary sources. The use of primary sources should be rare and should only include very high quality ones. Low quality primary sources should generally be removed and replaced with something better. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 14:49, 5 July 2015 (UTC)
The problem here is the word &quot;generally&quot;.  When someone says &quot;not MEDRS&quot; about a primary source, it's not clear whether that editor means &quot;this is a primary source, and primary sources are bad&quot; or &quot;this is a primary source, but those are sometimes acceptable.  However, in this particular case, and after carefully considering all of the facts and circumstances, I believe that this particular primary source is not acceptable for this particular statement&quot;.  The first is sloppy work, and will have a 10% error rate.  The second is important and valuable.   () 18:05, 5 July 2015 (UTC)
It's not clear why we need this oddly-titled fork of acute myeloid leukemia.  The currently-very-brief section acute myeloid leukemia#Genetics would seem to be a better place.  (Should the amount of material eventually grow to be unwieldy, we might eventually create an article titled genetics of acute myeloid leukemia or similar, but the amount of content available right now – if cleaned up and properly formatted and referenced – wouldn't seem to warrant doing so.)

Video content is something that has been requested by many readers.  Did any of you catch the presentation at Metrics last week on the strategy consultation?

This section begins on slide #11, and some of the most interesting slides are 42 and 43.)  The most common request from logged-out respondents was more video, audio, images, interactive features, and other multimedia.  They also care about mobile functionality (e.g., that infoboxes are pretty busted on phones), the site's appearance (they want it to look more modern), and the ease of sharing with friends.  As far as actual readers are concerned, more video = more goodness.  But established editors basically hate videos:  they're hard to make, hard to control, hard to edit, and hard to customize.  And it's not one-size-fits-all:  a good drawing can be used across most Wikipedias, and a good paragraph can be translated to any of them, but a good video may need to be re-created for every language and culture.

I don't think that videos (e.g., a video of a television news show) are difficult for verification.  They might be slow, and you can't search, but they're pretty straightforward.

MEDDATE and the expiry of systematic reviews

I ran across an interesting little paper today (I thought it was mentioned on Retraction Watch, but I can't find it there now) that sought to quantify the reliability and robustness of the conclusions of systematic review articles as a function of time since publication.  In other words, how much time elapses between the time a systematic review is published and the time a new (typically primary) study is published which may invalidate some of the review's conclusions?

The paper isn't new (it's from 2007), and because of the nature of the question the publications it examines are necessarily even older, but I thought it worthwhile to mention because I can't immediately locate anything more recent; I can't find a previous mention of it here or on ; it's relatively short (and the terminally impatient can get the high points from the abstract and pictures); and it's free. 

*K.G. Shojania et al. &quot;[http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=736284 How Quickly Do Systematic Reviews Go Out of Date? A Survival Analysis]&quot; Ann Intern Med. 2007;147(4):224-233. Pubmed: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17638714 17638714].

The median 'survival time' for a systematic review article was 5.5 years (95% CI, 4.6 to 7.6 years).  Before patting ourselves on the back for the 5-year threshold in  – or worse, deciding to mechanically, blindly, and rigidly apply MEDDATE – we should also note the attached caveats and qualifiers, and the breadth of the distribution.  For instance, 7% of systematic reviews were potentially out of date at the time that they were published.  At the other end, about a third of systematic reviews were still valid after 10 years.  Obviously, fields which were active areas for clinical research, with lots of money and trials, tended to see shorter review lifetimes—cardiology in particular was singled out as having particularly short-lived reviews.  As well, this study did not attempt to track which parts, or how much of, any given systematic review was in question; scoring was all-or-nothing, so it is quite likely substantial parts of many older reviews were still up-to-date. () 20:42, 5 July 2015 (UTC)
Yes agree with that. Some reviews in some poorly researched areas stay uptodate for a long time. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 06:27, 6 July 2015 (UTC)
It's not clear to me why this would be an issue for Wikipedia in the first place. In medicine, primary research results that have the potential to overturn some well established consensus are typically large scale RCTs which have to be announced well in advance, typically there will be quite a few publications about these RCTs long before they start. So, everyone in the field will know years in advance when potentially new results could in theory overturn some consensus view that currently exists. Also, good review articles that draw their conclusions on what current and past primary articles say, will also discuss such planned research.  () 15:51, 6 July 2015 (UTC)
Medical consensus changes based on lots of little studies, too.  Also, we don't tend to look in our  balls and report things that might happen later.  Sections on planned research get mentioned (if someone is diligent) in a

section, but not under treatment, diagnosis, etc.   () 22:02, 6 July 2015 (UTC)
Per WhatamIdoing.  As well, in any moderately active research area there will almost always be one or more trials in progress—waiting for all the trials to finish means never writing a systematic review.  And new trial outcomes don't always overturn the consensus on any given point (and very rarely do they overturn our understanding of an entire field); even a technically &quot;outdated&quot; review is still often substantially correct.  
Finally, it's far from unheard of for a researcher to want to get his opinion out in print – or to add a bit of padding to his CV – now, rather than two or three years from now.  Clinical trials aren't always timed correctly from the standpoint of any given individual's career.  Worse, the publication process can be rather fickle and finicky at times.  Some papers sail through the process from submission to acceptance to online 'print' in three weeks; it more often takes a couple of months, and can sometimes take more than a year.  There are a lot of reasons why a systematic review or meta-analysis could be out of date less than a year from its publication. () 13:00, 7 July 2015 (UTC)

List of benzodiazepines dose equivalence

The list attempts to establish an approximate equivalent dose between benzodiazepines.  raised a concern about this at  with no response. I share in this concern especially since there don't appear to be a references.  () 00:52, 7 July 2015 (UTC)

Opinion
I just added some controversial information to the prostate cancer article and want to give those who are interested a heads-up.  I would characterize my edit as 'an extraordinary claim by an extraordinary source'.  A respected and well-referenced systematic review and meta-analysis has found a significant link (20%) increase in the risk of developing prostrate cancer from even one episode of gonorrhea.  Comments are very welcome and take them to the Prostate cancer talk page.  Best Regards,

The article already had &quot;In particular, infection with the sexually transmitted infections chlamydia, gonorrhea, or syphilis seems to increase risk.[40]&quot; cited to , so it's not that extraordinary.  () 11:26, 8 July 2015 (UTC)
nevertheless still important (perhaps the related text should be expanded?)-- () 11:51, 8 July 2015 (UTC)
The older (2002) review should probably be removed as the new one found other STDs had no significant impact.  () 12:06, 8 July 2015 (UTC)

Biography of scientist who questioned HIV–AIDS link


I've raised concerns at  that recent edits lend undue validity to a fringe viewpoint.  Courtesy-pinging ; also pinging  and  who are experienced in this area.  (•) 13:37, 8 July 2015 (UTC)
.This article did not call Margulis an &quot;AIDS denialist&quot;, but quoted a source that referred to her &quot;endorsement of HIV/AIDS denialism&quot;. It appears the source was both justified in this wording and accurately represented by Wikipedia[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Lynn_Margulis#HIV_and_AIDS]..i concur with this opinion-- () 14:38, 8 July 2015 (UTC)</segment>
