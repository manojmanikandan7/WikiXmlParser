Interesting [http://communicationandhealth.ro/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/BEHDIN-NOWROUZI.pdf]. They found that Wikipedia is as complete as WebMD and Mayo Clinic. But more difficult to read.
WebMD and Mayo however are plastered with advertising and give the actual content so little room. They also like clip art. ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk · pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 17:55, 21 June 2015 (UTC)

 Dr Google 

A pertinent read (imo) from the Guardian today, written by a thoughtful oncologist called Ranjana Srivastava  [http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/22/bronte-doyne-cancer-google]:

The modern cancer patient has typically Googled the diagnosis, the oncologist, prospective treatment and a whole lot more before setting foot in the office. This can mean that serious, life-changing issues compete with the frankly nonsensical.

Last week, between cajoling a patient to enter a hospice and treating a homeless man I heard a discourse on Mexican garlic, another on healing spinach juice and a patient demanded scans recommended by a popular blog.

I resent Dr Google being the silent spoiler in my life but only until I recognise how the internet has allowed patients to seek counsel that would have been unthinkable in another era, and access to often high-quality information written with the patient in mind. My last few patients have probably learned more about clinical trials from the internet than from me.

But look up “best treatment for cancer” and you have an astonishing 300 million offerings. Right there with rigorous, evidence-based sites there are those offering fermented foods and DIY cancer cure kits. ...worried patients need help to distinguish between sensible advice and fanciful claims.

 Camel urine/blood and ERS 

Hello, we've had someone asking us (editors on the ikipedia:WikiProject_Sanitation|wikiproject sanitation) about cultural practices relating to the consumption of camel urine and/or blood in the Middle East.  It isn't really our focus, however, I have been talking to a virologist who says that this is considered to be a source of MERS. In briefly investigating wiki pages, I have not been able to find this mentioned on rine therapy or the main amel#Food_uses|Camel page.  I don't think it is really my place to get into iddle East respiratory syndrome or any of the (possibly relevant) medical pages, but I was wondering if anyone might consider whether this should (or quite possibly should not) be added to some of these pages?  There are a number of strong looking reviews talking about the link [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673615604548#cesec70 including this] one in The Lancet. Thanks! ser:JMWt|JMWt (ser talk:JMWt|talk) 09:43, 22 June 2015 (UTC)
to begin the Lancet ref you indicate does not have full access...the closest I found was this [http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2338303] but I would prefer a better quality reference to comply with ikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources_(medicine)--ser:Ozzie10aaaa|Ozzie10aaaa (ser talk:Ozzie10aaaa|talk) 10:49, 22 June 2015 (UTC)
* ser:Ozzie10aaaa|Ozzie10aaaa, the NLM already has the Lancet &quot;Seminar&quot; article listed as a review (per MID|26049252, publication types). I don't  have access to the full paper, but I suspect it could be a strong candidate MEDRS, especially given the fast-moving circumstances. pecial:Contributions/109.155.60.103|109.155.60.103 (ser talk:109.155.60.103|talk) 11:37, 22 June 2015 (UTC)
your right,...but we could use full access--ser:Ozzie10aaaa|Ozzie10aaaa (ser talk:Ozzie10aaaa|talk) 11:58, 22 June 2015 (UTC)
 is it not full access? I'm pretty sure I didn't need to login to see it. Edit: sorry, nope I was logged in without realising. ser:JMWt|JMWt (ser talk:JMWt|talk) 12:06, 22 June 2015 (UTC)
 ser:JMWt|JMWt, while open-access is always nice, it definitely *isn't* a requirement for MEDRS. pecial:Contributions/109.155.60.103|109.155.60.103 (ser talk:109.155.60.103|talk) 12:14, 22 June 2015 (UTC) 
 I thought it was a bit sneaky for Ozzie10aaaa to edit his/her comment to take out the claim that it was not a review. But anyway, as far as I can see (reading the whole paper) it is a secondary rather than a primary source. ser:JMWt|JMWt (ser talk:JMWt|talk) 12:18, 22 June 2015 (UTC)
it didn't look like one (theres nothing &quot;sneaky&quot; about it, for any article you need to show the reader what the reference is that supports the statement) because there is no full access you so indicated here [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine&amp;diff=668107278&amp;oldid=668107185]....MEDRS is very clear ikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources_(medicine)--ser:Ozzie10aaaa|Ozzie10aaaa (ser talk:Ozzie10aaaa|talk) 12:20, 22 June 2015 (UTC)
 Excuse me, I am not writing any article including this paper, I am just highlighting that maybe it is something that should be addressed.  ikipedia:MEDRS does not specifically say that open access is needed, it is not my problem that you do not have access to the journal.  Get access, or don't.  It isn't my paper, I don't much care. ser:JMWt|JMWt (ser talk:JMWt|talk) 13:32, 22 June 2015 (UTC)

A cultural practice such as drinking camel urine or blood is not a medical claim and therefore does not need a MEDRS compliant source.

 Wikipedia + Reddit 

A bit ago Lane [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine/Archive_63#Reddit_Science_AMA_.2B_PLOS_.2B_Wikipedia posted an idea] to try to integrate Wikipedia with Reddit. Just today I have [https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:IdeaLab/Reddit_Science_AMA_%2B_PLOS_%2B_Wikimedia#Draft_Proposal formalized a draft proposal with the basic ideas] which I would like some input on from anyone. The basic idea is I think we should make content such as videos and other other interesting content for people to enjoy. the overall goal is to educate the public on how Wikipedia works behind the scenes to provide good content. We have seen many studies where a vast majority use Wikipedia in the healthcare sector but do not state they trust it. While this is meant to improve brand image, it also would serve as an editor recruitment tool. While most of the time we try to actively tell people to edit Wikipedia with little success, perhaps we should want them to do so organically? 

Look forward to hearing everyone input! ser:Peter.C|Peter.C • ser talk:Peter.C|talk • pecial:Contributions/Peter.C|contribs 16:18, 22 June 2015 (UTC)

 Financial toxicity/cancer merge 

Hi all, I'm suggesting that the stub on inancial toxicity be merged with ancer#Economic_effect|Cancer's section on economic effects. Cancer is protected so I've held back on moving forward. The page on financial toxicity has minimal sources, both articles by the same co-author, but I'm not super familiar with medicine, so I thought I'd bring it to your attention.

Looks like a neologism of questionable merit to me. And the 'Economic effect' section in the cancer article needs globalising, if it is merited at all - our readers aren't all from the U.S. ser:AndyTheGrump|AndyTheGrump (ser talk:AndyTheGrump|talk) 23:07, 23 June 2015 (UTC)

 Re-writing an article? 

Hey, I need some people to help with the article for itten's sign (lung). It'd been tagged as a hoax but from what I can see this is a term that's used. That's about the extent of my knowledge of this as I don't really know what to put aside from that and this desperately needs to be edited by someone who is familiar with the term as it applies to lungs. I have no problem with this being merged into the main article for itten's sign, which is currently only about the term as it applies to eyes. It looks like this term was applied to both, so maybe they can be merged? ser:Tokyogirl79|Tokyogirl79ser talk:Tokyogirl79| (｡◕‿◕｡) 07:50, 24 June 2015 (UTC)

 Input wanted for a small blinded study of the quality of WP:Med articles 

Hi.
I am planning on doing a small study of the quality of or cardiology articles with C- or B-status.
A random sample of the articles will be selected, anonymise by reducing them to a text-only version, and be reviewed by blinded (MDs incl. cardiologist) reviewers (the do not know the articles come from Wikipedia).
After each article they will be presented with a questionnaire with a couple of questions. The reviewers can chose an answer based on a 1 to 7 scale (3 increasing positives, 1 neutral and 3 increasing negative) e.g. Excellent, Very Good, Good, Neither good nor bad, Poor, Very poor or Terrible.

I am looking for input for the questions on the questionnaire. This is what I had in mind:

Please rate your overall opinion about the quality of this article
Compared to medical textbooks, such as Medicinsk kompendium (Danish golden-standard-textbook for internal medicine) or Harrison´s Principles of Internal Medicine, how would you rate the quality of this article
Compared to medical textbooks, such as Medicinsk kompendium or Harrison´s Principles of Internal Medicine, how would you rate the readability of and language used in this article
Are there important omissions or errors in the article?
Is the article adequate in its coverage of the subject?
Would you recommend this article to a source of patient information?
Would you recommend this article to a colleague?

Do any of you have suggestion to changes or comments to the questions? If so please let me know. By the way there will also be pre- and poststudy questionnaires.
I know it is not the best study design and I was planning on doing a study with control articles taken from textbooks or e.g. NHS or WebMD (if very interested there is a ikipedia talk:WikiProject Medicine/Archive 65#Golden standard for comparison of cardiology articles|previously post) but it turned out to be too much comparing oranges and apples.

ser:JakobSteenberg|Jakob, did you consider trying to use a regular medical encyclopedia as the control?

Just a few quick thoughts about the *focus* of the questionnaire/survey. The questions seem to be aiming to assess doctors' expert opinions as an indicator of &quot;quality&quot; – an approach that has some intrinsic limitations as you're no doubt aware. The first question seems to be the most resonant one, but ultimately perhaps the most potentially misleading because of its extreme subjectivity (&quot;quality&quot; in what sense/context?). &quot;Textbooks&quot; like Harrison´s and &quot;patient information&quot; are normally two very different types of publication (and this sort of questionnaire will inevitably provide a &quot;doctor-skewed&quot; view). I wonder what your precise research question is. pecial:Contributions/109.155.60.103|109.155.60.103 (ser talk:109.155.60.103|talk) 09:24, 22 June 2015 (UTC)
*|JakobSteenberg Please see ikipedia:WikiProject Medicine/Research publications for what research has come before. My biggest objection to most Wikipedia health critiques is that Wikipedia articles are often compared to imaginary ideal sources rather than any existing comparable source. You say that you would compare Wikipedia to a medical textbook, and I think that is fine, but during the research I think you should dictate that to which Wikipedia is compared.
If possible, it would be nice if a given topic in Wikipedia could be compared 1:1 with a given source, but I recognize that to read Wikipedia content it is required to jump from article to article through links and perhaps in a textbook one would also need to check several chapters to cover a concept. If it were possible, I would prefer a solid comparison with a defined source. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 13:20, 22 June 2015 (UTC)
Agree with Blue. There is no perfect source / no gold standard. All sources contain errors / become out of date. The problem with using a rating scale is it needs to also run on a comparator. I do not think their is a way around this. ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk · pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 14:41, 22 June 2015 (UTC)
Please, pleeaaase include at least one control source.  I've read several studies that assess Wikipedia's content in comparison to, well, nothing, and I've found every one utterly worthless.  They come up with some sort of number at the end, but there's no way of knowing whether that number is good or bad, and after a critical reading you feel like the whole thing was a waste of time.  If you want to know whether Wikipedia is a good source for patients, compare it to WebMD or Mayo Clinic.  If you want to know whether it's a good source for students, compare it to a textbook or some content from a MOOC.  Just asking for a subjective comparison to a textbook isn't worth much if the reviewer has not also done a blind critical reading of the textbook content; you'd be largely testing their faith in the textbook.  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22166182?dopt=Abstract This] is an outstanding example of how to conduct a study, though I recognise they had more resources available than most groups.  ser:Adrian J.

[fwiw]...fully concur with Adrian's observations; if there's no blinded comparison (textbook / website ?) the survey will inevitably regard doctors' *attitudes* to the content, and there'll be no way of disentangling the objective from the subjective. pecial:Contributions/5.80.198.100|5.80.198.100 (ser talk:5.80.198.100|talk) 15:42, 24 June 2015 (UTC) (=109.155.60.103 above)

dI echo comments made by others. Important to test whether the blinding has worked. And what is the appropriate comparison? Is it a medical textbook, i.e. is Wikipedia trying to be a medical textbook? Or should it be compared with, say, a website aimed at the public? ser:Bondegezou|Bondegezou (ser talk:Bondegezou|talk) 17:11, 23 June 2015 (UTC)

First, thank you for your responses. It it much appreciated.
Blinding and improvements questions: I like the idea and will try to include a &quot;where do you think the content was from?&quot; and &quot;what can be improved about the article&quot;-type of question into the questionnaire. I think the first question should only be addressed in the post-study questionnaire while the latter should be part of the questionnaire immediately following the article/it review.
Yes, there should be a control group: I completely agree with you here. This was also my initial approach. But I have spend a couple of weeks looking for a control group (textbook, on-line source like WebMD and what have you) but I could not find any where it would make sense do a a 1:1 comparison even when if I have used a non-random sample (I tried looking up &quot;main&quot;-articles like acute coronary syndrome, angina pectoris and atrial flutter but still it was also to much oranges and apples to make any sense). That being said I will still try to make such a study but it is somewhere down the line.
For doctors or patients? ...and what the hell is quality anyway? As stated above quality should be measured against a control and being that Wikipedias is neither for doctors or patients in some sense this poses a problem. That is why I am trying to measure both parameters individually with the latter questions but also in a way combined with the first question.
To sum up: It is no where near the best methodology in the world. It is actually kind of shitty. It is however the best I can do at moment since I am only postgraduate student with very limited research experience who is doing this in my very limited spare time and have a tight deadline; for several reasons this study has to be done by fall. In my opinion it is still better than nothing and being that the research being conducted on the quality of Wikipedias medical content only amounts to a very limited number of pub-med indexed articles a year that mostly measures bias towards Wikipedia as a concept I still think it can provide some information of value.
 Again, thank you for your responses and keep them coming. All help and comments are appreciated. Kind regards ser:JakobSteenberg|JakobSteenberg (ser talk:JakobSteenberg|talk) 16:57, 24 June 2015 (UTC)

ser:JakobSteenberg|Jakob, just wondering (again!) whether you might not be better off shifting your focus from &quot;quality&quot; to &quot;attitudes&quot;/&quot;observations&quot; of a certain relevant type of reader (eg some cardiologists). Personally, I feel it's always good to try to design a study capable of generating, after all limitations have been taken into account, some incremental/useful information, rather than just repeating... So I'm wondering whether it might be worth adjusting your aim (literally!). I'm sorry if I haven't expressed this very well.

...(@ser:WhatamIdoing|WAID) hum, I think it could be hard for a reader to gauge, say, adequacy of coverage from an isolated (decontextualized) section. Pertinent content may be spread across different sections (even in articles that have reached FA, eg ancreatic_cancer#Diagnosis|here/ancreatic_cancer#Signs and symptoms|here). Also, judgements can vary on what constitutes, say, &quot;Diagnosis&quot;: just relevant tests (and their predictive value) / or also clinical suspicion based on signs and symptoms etc.  pecial:Contributions/5.80.198.100|5.80.198.100 (ser talk:5.80.198.100|talk) 09:19, 25 June 2015 (UTC)
I apologize if I am making a suggestion in the wrong thread, but I believe a question should be in the evaluation that asks the cardiologists for whom do they believe the article was written? answers could be, the public, a person who has just been diagnosed with a cardiac condition, nurses, nurse practitioners, PCPs, or cardiologists.  The audience matters!  We are not writing for medical practitioners and I don't think we should be evaluated to that standard.

I'm making progress, I think but not as quickly as I would like.  I have started the translation of two of Project Med's priority articles that have been identified as needing translation:  Female genital mutilation and Yellow Fever.  Female genital mutilation is a long, and heavily referenced article in English. Even the references have to be translated because they contain so many notes. It is a featured article in English and I have been in contact with the major editor who brought to featured status. As for building community, I thought I would wait until I had a significant number of edits and then start looking for those editors who are active.  The translatewiki.net 'people' first rejected my application.  Then I reapplied and submitted 20 edits to show that I could translate.  Then they 'accepted' me as a translator. THEN a few days ago I was informed that I was rejected (again) and unable to contribute.  Translatewiki.net has only translated one medical article to haitian.  I don't need to be a part of translatewiki.net (their loss, I suppose) to keep working on translating med articles.  So far, no other active editor on the ht:Wikipedia has reverted any of my edits, but then again I am not sure I am getting any page views, either.  Would you like me to keep you informed on my activities on the ht:Wikipedia with some kind of periodic report?  I could just leave an informative weekly or biweekly message on your talk page.  I could ping Doc James so he knows the progress that is being made on the translation of high priority med articles. Best Regards,

For me, the issue that the ombucha discussion exemplifies is a different one, namely the opacity of MEDRS to many editors coming from outside of wikiproject medicine. Some may intentionally boost a bad review to promote their POV, but for others, a significant part of the problem is that MEDRS doesn't put forth a clear framework for evaluating reviews that are on the borderline - impact around 1 to 2. These would be RS in other parts of the encyclopedia, but as long as project medicine is setting medical refs to a higher standard, it should make that standard transparent and as objective as possible.ser:Dialectric|Dialectric (ser talk:Dialectric|talk) 19:21, 25 June 2015 (UTC)

Good luck, but, ack. This is the kind of subtlety you either already know or won't fully understand from a wiki FAQ.

The guide sounds like a step in the right direction. Opabinia regalis, your guideline is going in the opposite direction with something of the same goal. There will always be a few editors who unning–Kruger effect|think their understanding is impeccable, and setting some outer bounds on acceptability shouldn't limit editors - what I would ideally like to see is a hard position taken on specific quality indicators, ie. review sources with an impact rating less than 1 should not be used. The 5 year point called out in MEDDATE is a move in this direction, and if there were just a few more criteria agreed upon by a majority, it would make sourcing less of a grounds for endless argument. And Sword and Skeleton is a lot better than it was a few years ago.

 I suspect the people who don't know what they don't know also don't know the underlying reasons for journal quality metrics like impact factors. You'll just end up with someone arguing their source is fine because the journal IF is 1.5. I'm generally not in favor of trying to reduce pointless arguments with arbitrary numerical criteria. Make the rules simple to follow and simpletons will manage.

There has always been some tension between whether our articles should emphasize evidence (the &quot;biomedical reviews&quot; part of the definition of &quot;secondary&quot; in MEDRS) or consensus (the &quot;statements by major medical and scientific bodies&quot; part of the definition of &quot;secondary&quot;).

What is the plausible biological explanation as to how acupuncture treats various cancers, assorted bacterial infections,  viruses, and all the other diseases it claims to treat by sticking needles in specific locations?

@ser:FloraWilde|FloraWilde: sorry, poorly expressed... I meant &quot;intervention&quot; within a ICO process|PICO context.

d this is getting way too long.  acu-proponents wave their hands at neurotransmitters or neurohormones as possible mechanisms and some even murkier stuff.  there is no scientific explanation for meridians/qi etc.  the evidence for the indications the NCCIH mentions are from empirical studies with problematic placebos and results were barely significant over placebo.  but both placebo and acu were much better than standard of care.  and nobody serious talks about all those things you list (viruses etc) - that is what quacks push and they are pretty much strawmen/big waste of time in any serious discussion. but we constantly have to deal with people making those claims and with other people over-obsessing on them. ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 23:11, 26 June 2015 (UTC)
You know, a web search engine can find someone saying almost anything, so there probably is someone who thinks that acupuncture cures the common cold, but it's my impression that people mainly see acupuncturists for pain and fatigue.  Fatigue is probably helped quite a lot by lying still on a table for an hour, and pain is notoriously affected by expectations and theatrical elements like the mood of the provider.  It probably &quot;works&quot;, if by &quot;works&quot; you mean &quot;the patient feels better (for a little while) afterwards&quot;.  And the side effects of conventional treatments for serious pain are not to be overlooked:  Acupuncture isn't 100% harmless, but fentanyl kills people.
Also, it's worth remembering that systematic reviews don't have any standards at all, except for what's declared in the methodology section.  You could do a systematic review of the number of words in the abstracts of acupuncturists whose first names start with &quot;E&quot;, if you wanted to.  &quot;Systematic review&quot; is P:NOTGOODSOURCE|not just some fancy spelling for 'good source'.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 04:21, 27 June 2015 (UTC)
Among many epidemiologists at least, Bradford Hill's radford Hill criteria|position remains, I think, a fairly widely respected scientific POV: It will be helpful if the causation we suspect is biologically plausible.

My understanding is that intrusive thoughts are a symptom, officially recognized as a defining characteristic of OCD and some other conditions.  Scrupulosity is a pattern of behavior which is the defining characteristic of &quot;scrupulosity disorder&quot;, a subtype of OCD.

Thanks ser:Looie496|Looie496. I feel that it might be good to clarify those points in the main text (including the leads?). Fwiw I've requested a medical citation for the claim that &quot;Scrupulosity is the modern-day medical *diagnosis*[medical citation needed] that corresponds to a traditional use of the term scruples in a religious context, e.g. by Roman Catholics, to mean obsessive concern with one's own sins and compulsive performance of religious devotion.[ref]&quot;. Also, to my layperson's brain, I'm puzzled by what the scientific basis could be for the claim at the end of the Intrusive thoughts lead that &quot;Intrusive thoughts, urges, and images... can be divided into three categories: &quot;inappropriate aggressive thoughts, inappropriate sexual thoughts, or blasphemous religious thoughts&quot;&quot;.[ref] (surely a highly selective/incomplete classification?). pecial:Contributions/5.80.198.100|5.80.198.100 (ser talk:5.80.198.100|talk) 15:36, 29 June 2015 (UTC)

 medical advice on the refdesks 

Posting here because I wonder if any of you have experience dealing with people giving medical advice on Wikipedia. In articles it seems rather straightforward, but what about on a talk page or other non-article venue on Wikipedia? On the reference desk talk page there's a ikipedia talk:Reference desk#Medical advice?|discussion of what constitutes medical advice and the kinds of medical advice that should not be allowed on the reference desks (or on Wikipedia).

It started with this thread (linking to old version of the page because someone has since removed the advice, but well after the OP responded in a way that clearly took it as medical advice): [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Science&amp;oldid=669057639#Possible_to_stop_eyes_from_watering.3F Possible to stop eyes from watering?]

The gist: a user posted a question explaining that he views himself as unemotional and wanted a method to avoid having his eyes water during emotional parts of films per expectations of masculinity. Clearly any direct answer is going to be fraught, but a refdesk regular quickly responded with simply &quot;SSRIs should work well&quot; and went on to defend that as not being in conflict with Wikipedia's medical disclaimer. 

Seeking additional eyes/thoughts, especially from those who may have more experience dealing with medical advice on Wikipedia. — ser:Rhododendrites|Rhododendrites ser_talk:Rhododendrites|talk \\ 19:02, 28 June 2015 (UTC)

Note, I just defended the statement in the context of the discussion there (i.e. that the OP should of course always stick to whatever his/her doctor prescribes). The issue is then simply mentioning that X can help with condition Y as a statement of fact instead of saying that &quot;you should use X as a cure for Y&quot;. The latter is clearly not allowed.  My problem with not allowing the former statement  is that this amounts to censorship. There may still be problems with the way I suggested that SSRIs could help with the condition, but the objection to my statement suggests that even mentioning something more clear cut like e.g. that antihistamines can help to deal with allergies wouldn't be allowed because only doctors are in the business of prescribing antihistamines. That sounds over the top to me, as we're not prescribing medicines, only doctors can do that. ser:Count Iblis|Count Iblis (ser talk:Count Iblis|talk) 19:19, 28 June 2015 (UTC)

You don't know that X is a good way to treat &quot;condition&quot; Y because condition Y is &quot;my eyes water during emotional parts of movies, and I'm a guy so I don't want that to happen&quot;. As far as I know, there is no medical literature on the use of SSRIs to enhance one's performance of masculinity by preventing eyes from watering.... 
So your statement of &quot;fact&quot; is bogus, first of all, but the distinction you're trying to make doesn't hold water either, because you're comparing &quot;statement of fact&quot; as though in a vacuum to a more explicit recommendation. Your &quot;statement of fact&quot; was presented as an answer to a particular person who asked for treatment advice for a particular problem. By saying &quot;SSRIs should work well&quot;, the &quot;...as a treatment for what you asked for help with&quot; is implicit. 
Cry censorship if you like, but it's still [lousy] medical advice and thus inappropriate. — ser:Rhododendrites|Rhododendrites ser_talk:Rhododendrites|talk \\ 20:45, 28 June 2015 (UTC)

It's not medical advice, because I didn't advice him to start a medical treatment using these drugs (and saying that it still does, doesn't make it so, no matter how large the consensus is that says so). Thing is that in the very same thread there were other contributors who on the one hand argued that what I wrote amounted to giving medical advice, but then they had no qualms about writing what you wrote here, i.e. that a treatment of such a problem using SSRIs would be a bad treatment. That sounds a lot more like giving medical advice to me, because if someone was prescribed by his/her own doctor to use SSRIs for such a problem then that person could read here that this is not good.
What this demonstrates to me is that this whole brouhaha about &quot;Medical Advice Blaaargggh&quot; has nothing whatsoever to do with any real potential problems, that the people who make a big fuss about it have other motives, wanting to play the boss, wanting to censor information they disagree with or whatever.

 Dubious articles 

An editor has written a series of articles on health-related topics. Although they do not appear to be P:COPYVIO, they look suspiciously like P:OR and are poorly referenced.

 TheNNT 

ser|Meyershp added some content to hypertension- and cardiac arrest-related articles based solely on the summaries from the heNNT website. While I support the principles behind the site, I didn't feel that the content was P:MEDRS-proof.

I have now been contacted by David Newman (Meyershp's supervisor and the site's founder[http://www.wired.com/2014/10/number-needed-to-treat/]), to see if some form of collaboration can be explored. He informs us that the site has a peer review mechanism, and that this perhaps could make it P:MEDRS-compatible.

As a general comment, we've done a pathetic job of communicating the umber needed to treat and umber needed to harm to readers, and those numbers matter.  We're so focused on &quot;my source proves that it works!&quot; part that we forget the &quot;for just 1 in 12 treated patients&quot; part. 
Given what a lousy job we're doing on this particular point, and given the site's reputation for fact-checking and accuracy (e.g., their peer-review process), I could see something like [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cardiac_arrest&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=669115657 this] being acceptable as an incremental improvement.  It should, of course, be replaced by better information from a stronger source, but I would not revert it on grounds that it wasn't perfect on the first try.  A combination might be particularly valuable:  A citation to one or more reviews that support this information from the POV of a formal scholarly source, plus a ara|laysource link to TheNNT's website for the sake of actual humans.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 19:10, 1 July 2015 (UTC)
Imo, ser:WhatamIdoing|WAID makes a strong point here. Like it or not, some Wikipedia readers will be gleaning information to help make personal decisions (&quot;patient choices&quot;). While evidence, or otherwise, of efficacy may sound helpful, by itself it doesn't say that much... NNT provides a measure that (unlike [http://www.cebm.net/number-needed-to-treat-nnt/ absolute risk reduction]) is reasonably intuitive to understand for the general public. However, like all measures, it needs to be cited/deployed [http://www.cmaj.ca/content/179/6/549.long with care].

 Sinclair Method 

Hello there! I was doing my rounds yesterday, and stumbled upon a curious Third Opinion request. One thing led to another, and now we've nominated ikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sinclair Method (2nd nomination)|the Sinclair Method for deletion, given a) it is a construction by Sinclair himself (we're all familiar with WP:NOT), for which b) there are currently no extensive independent nor reliable sources available, as I detail in the linked discussion. I am afraid the AfD needs some experienced medical eyes, as one of the keep votes is a possible sockpuppet involved with the editing of the article itself. The same thing happened the first time around, when only one actual vote led to a speedy keep. I also need to point out that I am planning on creating an article about the use of Naltrexone for alcohol dependence in the near future. Thank you for your input.

 olecular Therapy and uger therapy 

A couple of months ago I came across two articles that I'm not sure what to do with, but which need cleaning up (and maybe more scrutiny applied, depending on what exactly is going on). The articles are olecular Therapy and uger therapy. Both were created by ser:Rbaker1793 in December 2013 and October 2012 respectively. Both are tagged (for merge to olecular medicine and for excessively intricate detail respectively). IMO, the current articles were created by a P:SPA|single-purpose account pushing a new medical technology, but I'm checking here in case opinions differ. There are journals called 'Molecular Therapy' and 'Molecular and Cellular Therapies', but I don't think that is what these articles are about. They appear to be about a proposed form of radiation therapy and my concerns are that the references at the bottom of olecular Therapy are to a patent filed in 2007 and 2008. If you switch over to the uger therapy article, you see the same patents from CG Wang and Lawrence Helson. And some more patent applications from 2011 and 2012. I think the CG Wang that filed that patent is the same person as Chia-Gee Wang of Nanodynamics Inc. The same name crops up in the OTRS permission tag for one of the images (see [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Auger_Therapy42.jpg here]). The nanodynamics website is at http://nanodynamics-88.com/. The whole uger therapy article appears to be a direct copy from [http://nanodynamics-88.com/Auger%20Therapy.pdf here] (I doubt it was copied the other way). Even if they have released that text under the appropriate license, there may be COI and notability and P:MEDRS issues involved here. This may be all rather advanced cutting edge stuff (or maybe something else, depending on how cynical you are), so I am not entirely sure what to do here. I did read more about Nanodynamics [http://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/21/business/patentssome-scientists-are-cool-his-idea-but-inventor-aims-for-breakthrough.html here] (Wang's name also appears there), which made me highly sceptical, but YMMV. Any ideas on the best approach to take here? ser:Carcharoth|Carcharoth (ser talk:Carcharoth|talk) 05:20, 2 July 2015 (UTC)

With respect to auger therapy there is one review from 1996 [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8912375]
It has been picked up by some textbooks [https://books.google.ca/books?id=TMJm41g6YZYC&amp;pg=PA177] ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk · pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 06:38, 2 July 2015 (UTC)

 From a page naming and search ontology perspective, the two page names/search terms &quot;molecular therapy&quot; and &quot;molecular medicine&quot; should not fail to land on the same article. As for which one redirects to which, it doesn't matter, as long as the redirect happens. Regarding title case, the only smart thing to do with the title case &quot;Molecular Therapy&quot; is redirect it to that same common target as well. If anyone ever wants to make an article about the journal, they should name it &quot;Molecular Therapy (journal)&quot;, not &quot;Molecular Therapy&quot;. I perceive the content currently residing on the page &quot;Molecular Therapy&quot; as a partial P:Content forking|content fork of the olecular medicine and uger therapy articles (a molecular medicine specialist could prove me wrong, but barring that, I don't see it). Accordingly each chunk of it should be merged into the olecular medicine or uger therapy article, as appropriate. ser:Quercus solaris|Quercus solaris (ser talk:Quercus solaris|talk) 21:42, 2 July 2015 (UTC)
While I tend to agree with Quercus' position above re journal titles, p:DIFFCAPS has not usually been applied that way. We have many articles on publications that are distinguished from the similarly-named articles on subject matter only by capitalization, without the appended &quot;(journal)&quot;. The place to make a change stick would be t:WikiProject Academic Journals.ser:LeadSongDog|LeadSongDog ser talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl! 22:10, 2 July 2015 (UTC)

 Ah, I see. OK, then an article about a journal could give a hatnote to the common noun (sentence case) to escape the wrong landing. That's good enough. Not the best IMO, but I leave it to the consensus of WP:DIFFCAPS, and this instance wouldn't meet the Jesus threshold described there. The first sentence of my comment, though, I would haggle to preserve. ser:Quercus solaris|Quercus solaris (ser talk:Quercus solaris|talk) 22:28, 2 July 2015 (UTC)

I hope we don't get too sidetracked by the page naming issues. My main concern here is that Wikipedia ends up with pages that explain, concisely and clearly, what the terms 'molecular medicine/therapy' and 'auger therapy' refer to. The current pages are not easy to understand and my fear is that they present the perspective of specific companies/inventors rather than an overview of this subfield of nuclear medicine and the context it has with other techniques. Is this an experimental technique, still under development? That is not made clear enough on the current pages. ser:Carcharoth|Carcharoth (ser talk:Carcharoth|talk) 23:35, 2 July 2015 (UTC)

 Agree. This is exactly why not all erbalism is valueless just because it involves lacebo effect. Value in health care includes making people feel less shitty, both physically and emotionally, even if the latter is only &quot;in their head&quot;. I totally, totally get that we need to keep people from elevating seudoscience and ntiscience as if they were &quot;equally valuable as&quot; cience. Wrong, wrong, wrong—they're not, they're 99% bullshit. But don't take someone's t John's wort, or its placebo effect, away from them if they really think it's helping them feel less shitty. It's helping them in some way and it's not harming the world, at least not enough to count. This is, of course, different from tiger body parts, bear bile, opium, heroin, and other bullshit that is not harmless—whether it's not harmless to the patient, the environment, the society, or any combination of those. No, those things should not be tolerated, because they harm the world more than they help it. The hardest part about talking about this topic sanely is keeping the loonies and bullshit separated from the valid aspects. Many people exhibit an attitude of &quot;well you can't (keep them separated), so the only answer is to be radically extremist in the other direction, declaring all placebo effect worthless trash.&quot; ser:Quercus solaris|Quercus solaris (ser talk:Quercus solaris|talk) 22:06, 2 July 2015 (UTC)

 drug names (especially for generics) 

i've been making it a habit to clear away all/most trade names for generic drugs and just provide a link to drugs.com where the whole laundrylist of names can be found - when I remove the list i always include that link.  i do that b/c for generic drugs, names of drugs became spam-magnets.  if a drug is still on patent i think it makes sense to include the brand name, and i think it makes sense to keep the original brandname after it goes generic... but after that it seems to me we have no justification for barring any one if we allow some names ... that's my thinking anyway.  |KDS4444 noticed when i did this on cenocoumarol and expressed some concern, that folks should be able to easily see in the article if they are in the right place, by seeing the relevant brand names there.  i hear that.   the two of us just had a very nice discussion on my Talk page, and it seemed good to both of us to get wider input.  i should stop doing that if folks generally disapprove.  thoughts? ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 22:34, 28 June 2015 (UTC)

I think that the best answer depends upon the number of brand names.  If it's just a couple, then include it.  If it's a lot, then don't – unless (Tylenol!) a couple are particularly well-known, in which case include (only) those couple of well-known brand names.  Also, you need to consider the reader's context:  most people don't know what rastuzumab is, but they might have heard of erceptin in news stories (probably about how expensive it is).  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 05:55, 29 June 2015 (UTC)

The concern was to avoid making the opening sentence hard to read, with a lengthy bracket between &quot;Article title&quot; and &quot;is a ...&quot; containing every conceivable alternative name. Insofar as there was any conclusion, opinion seemed to favour a horses-for-courses approach rather than laying down a universal rule: convey the naming information in whatever way is most appropriate for the content in the context of the particular article. Keep the bracket in the opening sentence if very few words: use the infobox, if any, or a separate sidebox as Opa says: or even a separate &quot;Alternative names&quot; section further down the page if some prose were wanted, such as &quot;In Eastern Europe it is usually known as Xxxyz,(ref) except in Ruritania where since 2005 it has been marketed as Zzzyx.(ref)&quot;ser:Noyster|: Noyster ser talk:Noyster| (talk),  07:26, 29 June 2015 (UTC)

Two things that seem to have been missed in this discussion.  First, any redirect (with in reason) should be bolded within the lead. This includes trade names.

Since the brand names are the names the drug is known by, they're an important tool for users looking for information, so we need to leave as many as practical in the article. I completely agree that we need to relegate them to the lower sections of the article, maybe to a multi-column list or something?

I need some help with redirecting to other Wikipedia pages of the named diseases, I got almost all of them, just a few that I need help with. 
Also I hope the lay-out is ok? And also the sections are ok? 

I updated the Fever of Unknown Origin because I thought it was just really sad to see so little diseases listed. After thinking about the best way to do it I have decided to pick a really good book for reference as a starting point (Harrison's). It seemed not really logical to choose articles, even good ones, because of the change to miss out on something.

I decided to put the reference behind each disease instead of on the top, so that one can truly see where it came from and also, to prevent future added diseases from other people to get lost in references that do not include those terms. It seems a little overkill, but I thought it would be the best way. If there is another way, please do change.
Thank you!

references #1,6,7,10 are non-MEDRS compliant...( ser:CorenSearchBot/manual indicates it doesn't appear to be a copyvio, though its presentation is unusual)--ser:Ozzie10aaaa|Ozzie10aaaa (ser talk:Ozzie10aaaa|talk) 12:14, 4 July 2015 (UTC)
ing|Ozzie10aaaa I am...concerned by the off-the-cuff declaration that the sources are &quot;non-MEDRS compliant&quot;.  I have said this many, many, many times before, but it seems that I have to keep saying it—sources aren't intrinsically reliable or unreliable.  The (un)suitability of a published paper depends both on the publication itself (the type and date of study, along with all the other factors mentioned in MEDRS) along with the claims that it is being used to support.  MEDRS is not a magic checklist.
Since the references in this article are broken in such a way that the footnote numbers aren't actually shown in the body of the article, it's virtually impossible to determine which claims are attached to which sources (if any).  It is therefore entirely inappropriate to make a blanket declaration that particular sources are &quot;non-MEDRS compliant&quot;.  I would ask Ozzie10aaaa to explain his process for determining whether or not sources are correctly used, and to refrain from making any such judgements in the future until he demonstrates a firmer grasp of MEDRS (and WP:RS in general). ser:TenOfAllTrades|TenOfAllTrades(ser_talk:TenOfAllTrades|talk) 18:09, 4 July 2015 (UTC)
it is best if you read MEDRS that way you can give a more objective interpretation of ikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources_(medicine) following this link,[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources_(medicine)] Primary sources should generally not be used for medical content. Many such sources represent unreliable information that has not been vetted in review articles, or present preliminary information that may not bear out when tested in clinical trials  and Look for reviews published in the last five years or so, with newer being better if you take the time to look at the references in question some are dated  (old), some are not reviews ( one article had prior correction[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3910665/] ) thank you (should you have further questions ask Doc James)--ser:Ozzie10aaaa|Ozzie10aaaa (ser talk:Ozzie10aaaa|talk) 19:38, 4 July 2015 (UTC)
What you're saying, then, is that you are indeed (mis)reading MEDRS as a series of binary yes/no checkboxes, and basing your conclusion about reliability on that mechanical assessment.  Please don't do that—especially when you don't know which claims are being based on which sources, or even if a given source is being presented to support a medical claim at all.  (And incidentally, the fact that a published paper has an associated erratum – as opposed to a retraction or an expression of concern – does not necessarily reflect on its usability as a source for Wikipedia content.  I'm not sure why you would bring that up.) ser:TenOfAllTrades|TenOfAllTrades(ser_talk:TenOfAllTrades|talk) 00:40, 5 July 2015 (UTC)

I'm not sure why you keep referring me to ser:Doc James|Doc James; he's not my keeper, and I'm assuming he isn't yours either.  Neither is he the sole expert or arbiter of the application of MEDRS.  (I suspect, however – based on my own experience with that guideline and the constructive interactions I have had with him about its development, use, and interpretation – that he and I usually aren't far apart on how MEDRS works.)  ser:TenOfAllTrades|TenOfAllTrades(ser_talk:TenOfAllTrades|talk) 14:38, 5 July 2015 (UTC)
My positions is that we should be generally using high quality secondary sources. The use of primary sources should be rare and should only include very high quality ones. Low quality primary sources should generally be removed and replaced with something better. ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk · pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 14:49, 5 July 2015 (UTC)
The problem here is the word &quot;generally&quot;.  When someone says &quot;not MEDRS&quot; about a primary source, it's not clear whether that editor means &quot;this is a primary source, and primary sources are bad&quot; or &quot;this is a primary source, but those are sometimes acceptable.  However, in this particular case, and after carefully considering all of the facts and circumstances, I believe that this particular primary source is not acceptable for this particular statement&quot;.

Video content is something that has been requested by many readers.  Did any of you catch the presentation at Metrics last week on the strategy consultation?

This section begins on slide #11, and some of the most interesting slides are 42 and 43.)  The most common request from logged-out respondents was more video, audio, images, interactive features, and other multimedia.  They also care about mobile functionality (e.g., that infoboxes are pretty busted on phones), the site's appearance (they want it to look more modern), and the ease of sharing with friends.  As far as actual readers are concerned, more video = more goodness.  But established editors basically hate videos:  they're hard to make, hard to control, hard to edit, and hard to customize.  And it's not one-size-fits-all:  a good drawing can be used across most Wikipedias, and a good paragraph can be translated to any of them, but a good video may need to be re-created for every language and culture.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:56, 5 July 2015 (UTC)

 MEDDATE and the expiry of systematic reviews 

I ran across an interesting little paper today (I thought it was mentioned on Retraction Watch, but I can't find it there now) that sought to quantify the reliability and robustness of the conclusions of systematic review articles as a function of time since publication.  In other words, how much time elapses between the time a systematic review is published and the time a new (typically primary) study is published which may invalidate some of the review's conclusions?

The paper isn't new (it's from 2007), and because of the nature of the question the publications it examines are necessarily even older, but I thought it worthwhile to mention because I can't immediately locate anything more recent; I can't find a previous mention of it here or on T:MEDRS; it's relatively short (and the terminally impatient can get the high points from the abstract and pictures); and it's free. 

*K.G. Shojania et al. &quot;[http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=736284 How Quickly Do Systematic Reviews Go Out of Date? A Survival Analysis]&quot; Ann Intern Med. 2007;147(4):224-233. Pubmed: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17638714 17638714].

The median 'survival time' for a systematic review article was 5.5 years (95% CI, 4.6 to 7.6 years).  Before patting ourselves on the back for the 5-year threshold in P:MEDDATE – or worse, deciding to mechanically, blindly, and rigidly apply MEDDATE – we should also note the attached caveats and qualifiers, and the breadth of the distribution.  For instance, 7% of systematic reviews were potentially out of date at the time that they were published.  At the other end, about a third of systematic reviews were still valid after 10 years.  Obviously, fields which were active areas for clinical research, with lots of money and trials, tended to see shorter review lifetimes—cardiology in particular was singled out as having particularly short-lived reviews.  As well, this study did not attempt to track which parts, or how much of, any given systematic review was in question; scoring was all-or-nothing, so it is quite likely substantial parts of many older reviews were still up-to-date. ser:TenOfAllTrades|TenOfAllTrades(ser_talk:TenOfAllTrades|talk) 20:42, 5 July 2015 (UTC)
Yes agree with that. Some reviews in some poorly researched areas stay uptodate for a long time. ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk · pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 06:27, 6 July 2015 (UTC)
It's not clear to me why this would be an issue for Wikipedia in the first place. In medicine, primary research results that have the potential to overturn some well established consensus are typically large scale RCTs which have to be announced well in advance, typically there will be quite a few publications about these RCTs long before they start. So, everyone in the field will know years in advance when potentially new results could in theory overturn some consensus view that currently exists. Also, good review articles that draw their conclusions on what current and past primary articles say, will also discuss such planned research. ser:Count Iblis|Count Iblis (ser talk:Count Iblis|talk) 15:51, 6 July 2015 (UTC)
Medical consensus changes based on lots of little studies, too.  Also, we don't tend to look in our P:CRYSTAL balls and report things that might happen later.  Sections on planned research get mentioned (if someone is diligent) in a Research directions section, but not under treatment, diagnosis, etc.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 22:02, 6 July 2015 (UTC)
Per WhatamIdoing.  As well, in any moderately active research area there will almost always be one or more trials in progress—waiting for all the trials to finish means never writing a systematic review.  And new trial outcomes don't always overturn the consensus on any given point (and very rarely do they overturn our understanding of an entire field); even a technically &quot;outdated&quot; review is still often substantially correct.  
Finally, it's far from unheard of for a researcher to want to get his opinion out in print – or to add a bit of padding to his CV – now, rather than two or three years from now.  Clinical trials aren't always timed correctly from the standpoint of any given individual's career.  Worse, the publication process can be rather fickle and finicky at times.  Some papers sail through the process from submission to acceptance to online 'print' in three weeks; it more often takes a couple of months, and can sometimes take more than a year.  There are a lot of reasons why a systematic review or meta-analysis could be out of date less than a year from its publication. ser:TenOfAllTrades|TenOfAllTrades(ser_talk:TenOfAllTrades|talk) 13:00, 7 July 2015 (UTC)

 ist of benzodiazepines dose equivalence 

The list attempts to establish an approximate equivalent dose between benzodiazepines. ser:LeadSongDog raised a concern about this at T:PHARM#List of benzodiazepines with no response. I share in this concern especially since there don't appear to be a references. ser:Sizeofint|Sizeofint (ser talk:Sizeofint|talk) 00:52, 7 July 2015 (UTC)

Opinion
I just added some controversial information to the rostate cancer article and want to give those who are interested a heads-up.  I would characterize my edit as 'an extraordinary claim by an extraordinary source'.  A respected and well-referenced systematic review and meta-analysis has found a significant link (20%) increase in the risk of developing prostrate cancer from even one episode of gonorrhea.  Comments are very welcome and take them to the Prostate cancer talk page.  Best Regards,

The article already had &quot;In particular, infection with the sexually transmitted infections chlamydia, gonorrhea, or syphilis seems to increase risk.[40]&quot; cited to MID|12100928, so it's not that extraordinary. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 11:26, 8 July 2015 (UTC)
nevertheless still important (perhaps the related text should be expanded?)--ser:Ozzie10aaaa|Ozzie10aaaa (ser talk:Ozzie10aaaa|talk) 11:51, 8 July 2015 (UTC)
The older (2002) review should probably be removed as the new one found other STDs had no significant impact. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 12:06, 8 July 2015 (UTC)

.This article did not call Margulis an &quot;AIDS denialist&quot;, but quoted a source that referred to her &quot;endorsement of HIV/AIDS denialism&quot;. It appears the source was both justified in this wording and accurately represented by Wikipedia[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Lynn_Margulis#HIV_and_AIDS]..i concur with this opinion--ser:Ozzie10aaaa|Ozzie10aaaa (ser talk:Ozzie10aaaa|talk) 14:38, 8 July 2015 (UTC)</segment>
