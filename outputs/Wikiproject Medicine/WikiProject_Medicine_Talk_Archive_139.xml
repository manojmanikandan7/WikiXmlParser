I have published a poster titled [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Abhijeet_Safai/publication/324951014_SYMHEALTH_2018_WIKIPEDIA_EDITING_BY_HEALTHCARE_PROFESSIONALS_NEED_OF_TIME_Introduction/links/5aec7e19458515f5998282f7/SYMHEALTH-2018-WIKIPEDIA-EDITING-BY-HEALTHCARE-PROFESSIONALS-NEED-OF-TIME-Introduction.pdf 'Wikipedia editing by healthcare professionals: Need of time'] in year 2018.

Regulatory compliance for IVD medical devices

I realize this isn’t particularly wiki-related, but I figured I’d reach out anyway since this is relevant to primary/tertiary care physicians, nurses, and technologists.

I started a precision diagnostics company with 4 others; would love to talk about it, but need to file a patent first, and before that I have to wait on the FDA to return written feedback and then teleconference with my team on our device design.  Working on getting approval for a CLIA-waived POC rapid diagnostic testing device for virtually all known infectious pathogens (each biofluid entails a unique test) and their unique AMR profiles; it’d be permitted for use in hospitals and primary care clinics that have a CLIA-waiver.  Expect the pricing to be ~$14000/device + ~$75/test (less if I can leverage my patents to get the manufacturer to reduce their &gt;100% margin on reagents). Attaining maximal sensitivity+specificity per pathogen is fairly trivial with the hardware/software tech we’re using, but phase 3 is probably going to cost upwards of $100 million. Lol 

Anyway, anyone happen to know any expert medical device consultants or current/former employees of the FDA office of IVD?  I need an advisory board member with that expertise to whom I can pose an occasional question on regulatory compliance. 

I’m not monitoring this page, so please ping/email me if you reply. [[User:Seppi333|Seppi333]] () 20:37, 23 July 2020 (UTC)

 You wouldn't happen to know of any similar ones in San Francisco and Maryland (DC metro area), would you?  My team is rather scattered, hehe. [[User:Seppi333|Seppi333]] () 08:52, 25 July 2020 (UTC)
, the San Francisco Bay/Silicon Valley area has a lot of groups.  You might start by looking at https://sfbn.org/about/ (there's a list of other orgs at the end of the page) or even try Meetup.com to see if you can find a group that's specific to devices.  I don't know anything about groups in the DC area, but I would expect there to be multiple options.  It's possible that if you find a good group in one city, that the current members could recommend another elsewhere.
I believe there are also a couple of WPMED folks who currently work in the device side of the industry, and they may see your note and have specific recommendations.   () 18:52, 25 July 2020 (UTC)

Clinical guidelines from non-Anglophone countries

I've been working on improving the Complete blood count article recently, and I'd like to incorporate some information about screening and quality control guidelines in non-Anglophone countries, but I've struggled to find sources for this.

ICD-10 lists and copyright

From what I can see, the WHO licences the ICD-10 codes under nothing less restrictive than CC BY-SA-NC - making the content of those lists copyrighted and non-free for use on Wikipedia. We have quite literally a complete copy of the ICD-10 codes on Wikipedia, and unless I'm missing something, they appear to all be copyright violations. The ICD-10 classification system certainly is eligible for copyright, and the exact classifications and titles are therefor copyrighted from what I can tell. Before I go mass AFD dozens of articles from over a decade ago in some instances, does anyone have an explanation for this? And even if it is allowed, there is no attribution in some of the articles' history/talk pages - which will be necessary to add (but again, I doubt this is acceptable). bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez (/) 06:53, 27 July 2020 (UTC)
*Great pickup if this is true! (Will wait for more knowledgable editors to contribute) I personally really dislike us reposting these lists of ICD or other codes. We intensely dislike people copying our content verbatim to mirror websites, and that's pretty much what we do with them. Secondly, there is a risk the lists are erroneous and not updated. Thirdly, I dislike the lists because in my personal opinion they violate . Editors seem to differ on opinion on this issue however. -- () 07:37, 27 July 2020 (UTC)
** If you can provide a link to the WHO license info, and the relevant Wikipedia articles, we can ping in Diannaa, who is knowledgeable in this area. [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] ()  12:40, 27 July 2020 (UTC)

We need to consider all the following WHO classifications. The ICD-9 is public domain.[https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/publishing-policies/who-faq-licensing-icd-10.pdf]
* ICD-10: International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision
* ICD-O: International Classification of Diseases for Oncology
* ICF: International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health
* ICF-CY: International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health for Children and Youth
It seems fairly clear to me that we cannot reproduce the lists. -- ° 13:29, 27 July 2020 (UTC)
 I also agree with Tom for all the other reasons we should not have these lists. [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] ()  14:22, 27 July 2020 (UTC)
I agree about ICD9 - it’s clearly public domain, and so if we want to reproduce it we aren’t committing infringement to do so. However, even utilizing the ICD10 classification system as a way to organize navbox templates may be infringement, as we may still be copying enough of the “originality” in determining the classification in the template - especially when the organization of our templates is substantially based directly on the ICD10 classification. bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez (/) 14:59, 27 July 2020 (UTC)
 so would the next step be to wait for an administrator to delete them? Can they be deleted outside of an AFD discussion given how old they are? I tried to look through and I think they would qualify for &quot;speedy&quot; but I decided to bring it here in case I was missing something. If the next step is an AFD discussion, I'm happy to create one for them. bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez (/) 16:10, 27 July 2020 (UTC)
I'm afraid I'm not an expert on Wikipedia deletion -- more used to Commons for deleting images. I don't see any need for a speedy even if you think they qualify. Better to get some admins to review. Is there another forum on Wikipedia to post copyright queries before preparing an AfD? That might be a better next step than relying on WP:MED members -- you'd get folk with more experience. -- ° 16:37, 27 July 2020 (UTC)
There's , but that's for media (non-free file usage, etc). I figure an AFD at worst would result in us finding out the reason it's allowed, and at best it allows others to input and be aware of the deletion discussion. I'll wait for Diannaa and SandyGeorgia to reply again before I do anything. bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez (/) 16:42, 27 July 2020 (UTC)

According to [https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/publishing-policies/who-faq-licensing-icd-10.pdf this document] ICD-9 is in the public domain. For ICD-10 I found online [https://www.who.int/classifications/icd/ICD-10_2nd_ed_volume2.pdf a second edition] as well as a [http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/246208/1/9789241549165-V1-eng.pdf fifth edition] and found both are marked as Copyright-All rights reserved. Since the material is organized in a non-alphabetical way, my opinion is that Yes, the even the list-like material enjoys copyright protection. This would to apply content such as what we are hosting at .  However, we are citing the source, so it's not plagiarism, it's non-free content, the equivalent of a quotation. But if we are in fact reproducing the whole classification system or the majority of it, that's excessive non-free content in my opinion. Pinging additional current copyright patrollers:  please comment if you like.—  () 19:33, 27 July 2020 (UTC)
 Yes, we have the entire scheme, split up into different articles because of length.  No idea whose brainiac idea that was.

It has always been surprising to me that the UN and WHO do not provide more open access. WHO even declares:

WHO supports open access to the published output of its activities as a fundamental part of its mission and a public benefit to be encouraged wherever possible.

Unfortunately, I've had to revert a number of cases where a well-meaning editor tried to incorporate material from the UN or WHO. I usually check, and they usually see that the source material is identified as fully copyrighted or subject to a license that is not consistent with our needs.

That appears to be the case here. My only caveat is that I've occasionally been burned, when some page clearly has a copyright notice or incompatible license, and someone points out a clause on a separate site that expresses a different copyright status for certain information, but absent that, I concur that this information appears not to qualify for inclusion. 
Lists can be tricky in copyright discussions. Very roughly speaking, a list that exhibits no value judgments, such as a list of the states of the United States cannot be copyrighted, but lists that show selection and arrangement are typically subject to copyright. See , which is an essay but seems valid. I think it would be a stretch to argue that this qualifies under the list exception. given the amount of material, I would be uncomfortable calling this a pure list without an opinion from legal counsel.

However, before we go ahead and nuke the material, it may be worth considering other options. Obviously, an acceptable solution would be if WHO agrees to license the material acceptably. I Don't anticipate that individual editors have the heft to persuade the WHO, but perhaps we could persuade the Foundation to take this on. I think the coverage of medical issues and Wikipedia has considerable support within many communities, and press coverage of the possibility we might have to remove useful medical information from Wikipedia might persuade WHO to rethink their position. [[User:Sphilbrick|S Philbrick]][[User talk:Sphilbrick|(Talk)]] 20:12, 27 July 2020 (UTC)
Per Diannaa, I would say that is a copyright violation, although this seems like a case where something that should be in public domain isn't. Licenses, man.   20:24, 27 July 2020 (UTC)
I'm pessimistic that WHO would be at all interested in making the ICD 10 free for commercial use. They have clearly chosen, as many do, the path that permits non-commercial use but seeks to get a share of the money when used commercially. The impact on Wikipedia is small: a few list articles and perhaps the need for an edit warning not to turn our grouping templates into mirror copies of ICD 10 sections. This is rather nerdy &quot;medical information&quot; in a format/presentation that one would struggle to call &quot;encyclopaedic&quot; for the &quot;general reader&quot;. I think the main benefit to Wikipedia is a structured list of topics about which one might create articles. -- ° 21:36, 27 July 2020 (UTC)
 I've spent the last hour or so trying to figure out a way to articulate it - It's hardly encyclopedic to base our organization around one specific organizational method - even if that is something used by the entire medical field, it's not useful to the average reader. I also agree that the &quot;grouping templates&quot; (by which I think you include navboxes) need to avoid basing off ICD10 because of its copyright (even if we are making minor changes, I think we would still fall afoul of non-free requirements due to &quot;close paraphrasing&quot;). Most (almost all?) navboxes related to diseases seem to be at least primarily based on ICD classification - a few on ICD9 but most on ICD10... iff those are against non-free rules (which unfortunately I think they likely are), there's a lot of work ahead. bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez (/) 22:39, 27 July 2020 (UTC)

According to , the WHO uses a license that is not compatible with Wikipedia.

So, what’s next? Can we just put  on articles, link to this thread, and wait for an admin to delete? Or put a list here and ask Diannaa et al to do it ??  Back to, we can’t keep asking RexxS to do all adminly things.  WAID, why are you not an admin?  [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] ()  01:13, 28 July 2020 (UTC)

Personally,  I think it may be best to AfD the articles - maybe there's something we're not seeing, and listing them in a batch AfD gives the community at least a few days to let people know if there's something being missed. They've been on WP in some cases for well over a decade - a few more days won't hurt. Furthermore, that provides a record of why it's deleted beyond just &quot;copyvio&quot; - being more specific that ICD10 lists are not &quot;free&quot; for WP use. If nobody opposes, I'm going to create a list of articles at  tomorrow I'll create the AFD with a full reasoning. If my list (which I'll create in the next 10 mins or so) is incomplete please help create it if this is the route we're going to go. bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez (/) 02:24, 28 July 2020 (UTC)

 I'm always happy to help out on request for adminy-things, of course, but I do miss stuff sometimes. In this particular case, I could delete via  (copyvio), but I would almost certainly be asked to  the articles, and in refusing, I'd have to make a full explanation of the copyvio, and even then, there would be no protection against re-creation. It's much better in those sort of cases (IMHO) to have the debate at an AfD, as  suggests, to thrash out the arguments and give us a record of the process for the future. We'd then have  (recreation of a page that was deleted per a deletion discussion) as a speedy criterion thereafter. Hope that makes sense. -- () 19:40, 28 July 2020 (UTC)

Follow-up #1: Remove ICD-9 chapters?
As a follow-up to the above, although it does not have the same copyright issues, for the other reasons we've discussed above (mainly , ), what is the thought about a follow-up nomination for the ICD-9 chapters? (within this cat: [[:Category:International_Classification_of_Diseases]]). -- () 05:06, 7 August 2020 (UTC)

Maybe it'd be better to wait a while, and see how much work cleaning up this set of deletions turns out to be.  If the process turns out to look like delete – de-link – regret – create redirects or actual non-copyvio articles – re-link, then it'd be better to be able to apply that process to the ICD-9 pages from the start.  () 16:18, 7 August 2020 (UTC)

Redirects to ICD-10 may be valid, but they aren't valid search terms imo so redirects would only serve to make it so we don't have to delink everything. I do not think the individual ICD sections are independently deserving of articles, unless one section has somehow obtained more controversy or coverage than any other. Most of the ICD-10 coverage is going to be as a whole, or passing mentions of specific sections. bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez (/) 17:39, 7 August 2020 (UTC)]]
I think WAID approach is sensible. We can wait a little and nominate in a month or two when the waters have died down a  bit and the implications of the discussion are better known. -- () 00:05, 10 August 2020 (UTC)

Follow-up #2: Remove ICD-10 from navboxes?
As a follow-up to the above, I see above a mention by  that it may also be a copyvio to use ICD-10 codes in our navbox titles (please see here for what I mean by this: [[:Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine/Archive_138#Proposal_to_remove_ICD_codes_from_templates]]). I've currently got a local and Wikidata bot request waiting to port these to Wikidata. Is it more appropriate just to delete the ICD-10 codes in navbox titles outright? -- () 05:06, 7 August 2020 (UTC)
Well, I think yes. I also think that the navboxes themselves are likely copyvios if they substantially and largely copy the organization ICD came up with. The organization of diseases isn’t alphabetical, there is some originality to it, and as such, even if we aren’t listing the codes themselves, we are still copying the organizational method used. That’s not a battle I want to fight right now, but I think a good easier step is to start removing the ICD10 codes as we can. bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez (/) 13:08, 7 August 2020 (UTC)
Ok; in the meantime I'll push forward with my plan to port them to Wikidata, following which they can be removed. If there's some worry about that in the future, the ICD codes can be discussed for deletion separately, on Wikidata. Because we have about 1000 non COVID templates, I think it is better if we can get a bot to do this work. -- () 00:05, 10 August 2020 (UTC)

Follow-up #3: Remove all ICD codes from navboxes?
As a follow-up to the above statement about ICD-10, is it useful at all to have navboxes have ICD codes associated with them at all? We are an independent unaffiliated encycopedia and navbox contents change all the time, I personally don't see it as useful in any respect, we are  and, although I mentioned I am waiting for a local and Wikidata bot request to port these to Wikidata, such a port is likely ultimately to produce some degree of inaccuracy as navboxes change over time. What are the opinions about just stripping the ICD codes, without preserving them in Wikidata at all? -- () 05:06, 7 August 2020 (UTC)

FWIW, my understanding used to be that the Med project used ICD codes ( perhaps[?] along with  MeSH terms - imo, an inappropriate usage ) as a tool for hierarchical/skeletal indexing of disease/condition content on Wikipedia, as accessed via navboxes, or wherever. While that doesn't directly match any of the [https://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/ uses prescribed by the WHO], it's reasonable to suspect (as others have noted above) that  provides a good general fit with WHO's position on free digital access to health research, per its &quot;long history of making health information and evidence widely accessible.&quot;[https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/29-08-2019-who-joins-coalition-for-free-digital-access-to-health-research] As regards the copyright/legal aspects, I suspect the WMF would find an open door to discuss and agree acceptable usage. As regards our own WPMED decisions on how to index/organize our disease/condition content, I feel it's important to ensure we don't rush into throwing out the baby with the &lt; aptly delisted ;-&gt; bathwater. Just as a personal pov (from someone who believes certain 'nerdy' attributes can facilitate appropriate content :-), I'd prefer ICD codes (and MeSH terms, etc) to be somehow visible  directly from a Wikipedia disease/condition page where they can be readily consulted and pondered, rather than exiled to Wikidata, where they're not so readily accessible either for reference or maintenance.  () 12:58, 12 August 2020 (UTC)
Oh, I think it'd be great for the WMF to use their platform to encourage the WHO to actually make their things &quot;open access&quot; in line with what truly open means. And I don't think anyone's saying remove the ICD10 codes from individual articles - just to remove them from things like navbox templates that are too &quot;copy&quot; for comfort. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez (/) 14:24, 12 August 2020 (UTC)

Statpearls reliability

I looked at the previous postings on this page which suggest tentative acceptance, but when I read on topics I know a bit about, they seem q. inaccurate and the sourcing quite off base e.g. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553030/ Chronic pain] calls opioids second line analgesics in intractable neuropathic pain, fails to mention that TCAs are first line for neuropathic pain. i.e. Their guidance is far removed from clinical guidelines. Secondly, the grammar and writing quality is of concern, it makes me think they are not peer reviewed. Thirdly, the authors seem to be pumping them out quite rapidly, which normally isn't good for clinical reviews, these would normally take time and be written by subject matter experts rather than generalists. As best as I can tell they don't have the same quality as UptoDate for instance, but they are free. They seem to be used in a lot of articles here, so I'm curious what others think of them.  () 02:53, 1 August 2020 (UTC)
I've looked at a few, and the phrase &quot;low-quality tertiary source&quot; sprang to mind (since they seem to draw on both primary and secondary material). Some of the sources used seem old - the articles probably wouldn't pass muster on Wikipedia. I think they might be best categorized as a MEDRS of last resort (like WebMD) - maybe okay for mundane claims but definitely not okay for anything contested/surprising, particularly for treatment efficacy. Perhaps if we can get consensus here this should be entered at  as I foresee a recurrent debate about this.  () 05:24, 1 August 2020 (UTC)
I don't think we should encourage RSP entries for anything except the very worst.  RSP entries tend to be enforced mindlessly, even when the entry specifically says not to do that.  RSP in general has a problem with our fundamental  approach (in which what you're writing is important, not solely the identity of the source).  Something like StatPearls or MayoClinic.com might be okay for a simple claim, and inappropriate for something more complex.  () 17:32, 1 August 2020 (UTC)

Thanks for bring this topic up. Statpearls is used as a ref &gt;20 times at Prostaglandin E2. As part of watching the med students work on this article, I will check if the use of Statpearls is of good quality.  () 17:21, 14 August 2020 (UTC)

Transition/success rate of each vaccine trial phase

Any idea where to find references to answer the &quot;Success of each phase&quot; question in ?  () 21:03, 14 August 2020 (UTC)

GI health

Pemphigus includes references to &quot;GI health&quot;, without defining the term. GI health is a red link. Please can someone clarify the topic, and create a redirect?  (Pigsonthewing); ;  23:30, 15 August 2020 (UTC)
It's short for gastrointestinal health. I expanded the acronym. I'm not sure there's a good target for GI health to redirect to... Gastrointestinal system#Clinical significance maybe, but that section is really about diseases, not health per se. Also, effectively all of that paragraph in the Pemphigus article is unsourced... the single source doesn't mention anything about gastrointestinal disorders.  () 23:42, 15 August 2020 (UTC)
Thank you. I've redirected to GI, a disambiguaton page, for now.  (Pigsonthewing); ;  10:55, 16 August 2020 (UTC)

The new Russian COVID vaccine

These seems to be a push to have Wikipedia make prominent mention of this. How to do it with a  requires the sort of skills which could, I think, be usefully provided by WT:MED regulars; more eyes would help.  () 17:45, 11 August 2020 (UTC)
The bottom line is that there is no published scientific evidence that this vaccine is non-toxic, produces an immune response, and prevents COVID-19 infection. It's racing way ahead of the vaccine development process as political propaganda which is what it would be called if the Brits suddenly announced the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was &quot;approved and registered&quot; or if the US short-circuited the FDA approval process and gave a green light now for selling and vaccinating with the Moderna candidate. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine#Clinical_trials_started_in_2020 See clinical trial status of the COVID-19 vaccine candidates.]  () 19:01, 11 August 2020 (UTC)

 I've put the general sanctions notices on  and placed a restriction on adding biomedical content without MEDRS-compliant sources. That is our best bulwark against speculative claims. Nevertheless, there are reliable sources indicating that Russia has &quot;registered&quot; the vaccine (whatever that means). The reporting of that fact is subject to , so while it's interesting, it doesn't warrant extra emphasis on one particular vaccine among the 200+ candidates, IMHO.
  has fully-protected  for three days, so the discussion there should shift to the talk page for now. Cheers -- () 19:21, 11 August 2020 (UTC)
 I was thinking about imposing the sanction on the article, but it is stupid to do for three days full protection. After the full protection expires, one would need to restore semi or even extended-confirmed protection, and it would be reasonable to log the sanction at that point.-- () 19:26, 11 August 2020 (UTC)

An exception to ?

Are primary research articles, even with very preliminary results, acceptable if one discusses and cites them in a &quot;Research&quot; section? For example, Alcoholism#Research and Cocaine dependence#Research.

Only if they are frequently cited in some fashion, I'd say. Scores of primary research is published every day, we can't catalogue it all and we can't arbitrarily pick out some to mention.  () 20:56, 16 August 2020 (UTC)
 Generally no, except in exceptional circumstances (which are outlined - in rough - at ). Significant research tends to get discussed in secondary sources.  () 20:58, 16 August 2020 (UTC)
Excellent. Thank you both for your responses. :0) [[User:Markworthen|  - Mark D Worthen PsyD]] [[User talk:Markworthen|(talk)]] (I'm a man—traditional male pronouns are fine.) 22:28, 16 August 2020 (UTC)</segment>
