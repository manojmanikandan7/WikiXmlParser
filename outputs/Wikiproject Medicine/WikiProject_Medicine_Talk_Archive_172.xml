, I think that  looks okay.  My main suggestion is that you remove unnecessary details from the descriptions.  This would probably include some of the exact dates and ways to identify which products were recalled.  Knowing that products with this code or that best by date have been recalled is useful during the outbreak but basically trivia years later.   () 18:55, 23 August 2024 (UTC)

CRAM diet

The CRAM diet article describes an (apparently) medical dietary treatment for diarrhea and gastroenteritis. The sources for it are terrible. We've had the article for 14 years, and it's been flagged as poorly sourced the entire time. I can't find any worthwhile references to add (but this is very far from my field of knowledge). Can anyone find anything about it? What should we do with the article? -- ··–· 21:40, 19 August 2024 (UTC)

Anyone know the fate of Human Anatomy Online?

Apparently there was a resource for anatomy images assembled by SUNY Downstate Medical School called [https://web.archive.org/web/20160605191201/http://ect.downstate.edu/courseware/haonline/ha.htm Human Anatomy Online] (archive from 2016). Sadly, I was ignorant of its existence until I saw it referred to in  today. We even have a template  transcluded on a few hundred pages that provides deadlinks to what I'm sure was a lovely resource. Does anyone know if this resource lives on under another name? I tried Googling, but didn't turn up anything. It'd be great if we could update the MEDMOS suggestion and fix the template.  () 20:00, 23 August 2024 (UTC)

https://web.archive.org/web/20160504211300/http://ect.downstate.edu/courseware/haonline/acknow.htm has a list of names of people who might know.  https://www.gold-standard.com/ might be the website for the publisher.  One of the linked websites suggests learn  gold-standard.com as a possible way to reach them, though if you can find them on a social media platform, that might be more effective.  () 20:30, 23 August 2024 (UTC)
Thank you WAID, I haven't reached out to those people yet. But I have checked about 5 dead links, and for each there's a version of the page archived in Internet Archive ([https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202804/http://ect.downstate.edu/courseware/haonline/figs/l22/220204.htm example]), and it's the type of static page that an archive can fully recapitulate. Unfortunately, the archives aren't all on the same date, so I can't rescue the template by just building an internet archive URL. My un-clever idea is that I could manually replace each templated instance with a link to an appropriate archived version, but that would take some time. Any chance you can think of a clever-er way to replace the links with the archived versions? You seem tech savvy.  () 23:20, 25 August 2024 (UTC)
AFAICT all clever ways of linking to the Internet Archive begin with talking to .  () 03:15, 26 August 2024 (UTC)
I did this  as a generic solution, imperfect but should mostly work. If you want to replace each template with an archive URL I can do that via bot, which is better since it will verify each archive is working and leave a  if not. But takes a little more work to setup and run. Post a request to .  -- [[User:GreenC|Green]][[User talk:GreenC|C]] 04:29, 26 August 2024 (UTC)

Input for List of chronic pain syndromes

I recently created List of chronic pain syndromes. This is my first time creating a list class article and I would really appreciate some feedback. Additionally I was wondering if since not every entry has a wikilink (nor do I think it would be reasonable to make each entry one) should I have descriptions for each disorder?  () 01:31, 1 September 2024 (UTC)

That looks pretty good.  It's a good idea to have links to &quot;vocabulary words&quot; (e.g., for anyone doing a 'Dr Google' search on a diagnosis) or an explanation, but when I look at the list of &quot;Chronic visceral cancer pain, Chronic bone cancer pain, Chronic neuropathic cancer pain&quot;, I think people just need to know what viscera and neuropathy are.  I don't think they need an explanation that says &quot;Chronic bone cancer pain is when you have pain in your bones all the time because of cancer&quot;.  They'll be able to guess that much.

What to do with Lists of diseases

I feel that our various lists of medical conditions have gotten out of date. Both List of genetic disorders and List of syndromes are inapropriately short considering their topics (many syndromes are missing). Our alphabetically sorted Lists of diseases is also in bad shape. Half the entries are syndromes (which I have also accidentally added syndromes to this list). Just looking at List of diseases (0–9), I don't think a single article on that list is a disease; all of them seem to be syndromes. There are also many duplications, redirects, and red links. I'm not sure how to fix the issue, but I do have a couple of ideas. I could go through all the pages and sort them into their respective lists (either List of diseases, List of disorders, or List of syndromes. This would obviously be time-consuming but would hopefully help with organization and also help de-orphan some pages. I was wondering if anyone knows what was originally used as a source for these lists. Also, should ref links and redirects be removed? (Pinging page owners   () 05:05, 1 September 2024 (UTC)

The only exception I'm aware of is the List of skin conditions, which largely came out of a medical school textbook.  () 18:12, 1 September 2024 (UTC)

Symptoms of methanol poisoning

Hello MED folks. For 2016 Irkutsk mass methanol poisoning, is it fair to say the following:
* &quot;symptoms of methanol toxicity include central nervous system depression&quot; 
* &quot;The human body breaks down methanol into formaldehyde and formic acid, both of which act as nerve toxins and damage the optic nerve.&quot;

The article is currently going through a FAC, and I am not a medical expert, so I'd appreciate any input from project members. Thank you!  ] ] 21:46, 3 September 2024 (UTC)

@ I'm not a medical expert either, but I have edited a lot of medical articles so hopefully I can help a bit. Both of these setences are medical claims which means ideally they should have  sources to back them up which it doesn't look like they do. As for the accuracy of the two statements, I'm not sure but I would feel more confident if they referanced a medical article. To sum up  biomedical information, such as symptoms, have a higher standard for sources. This means that ideally the source should be secondary (liturature reviews, systematic reviews etc.), published in reputable journal, and if possible published in the last 10 years. The source used doesn't fit the standard of  so do with that what you will. As for the wording &quot;central nervous system depression&quot; is a bit vaugue and overly technical. It might be more helpful to list symptoms. To save you the hassle of searching for MEDRS sources I found this article which might be helpful: 

This article is recent, from a repurable publisher and is a review.  () 04:39, 8 September 2024 (UTC)
Thanks for the info, ! I rewrote that part of the article with that source you gave. I appreciate you not making me find a source myself. :-))) I was aware of MEDRS, but haven't had to interact with it before. I didn't realize it applied to what I thought of as basic things, like these symptoms. The wording of &quot;central nervous system depression&quot; was taken straight from the Wikipedia article title, and I've simplified it.  ] ] 04:24, 10 September 2024 (UTC)

Page views

I've been playing with some page views numbers.  One thing I've learned is that, based on a sample of 10K random articles, most articles on Wikipedia get read once a week or less.  

I think that WPMED's core articles (e.g., about diseases and drugs) traffic tends to be higher than average.  If you're interested in checking out a favorite article, you can get the total annual page views at https://pageviews.wmcloud.org/ (default is the last 20 days, so switch it to a full year), and here's a quick cheatsheet to compare the result against (these are all from the 2023 calendar year):

* 100K page views per year:  top 1%
* 10K page views per year:  top 5%
* 1K page views per year:  top 20%
* 100 page views per year:  top 40%

If you are interested in working on our most popular articles, then you can find an updated list at .  For example, Polio vaccine was the 994th most popular WPMED-tagged page last month, and its page views during 2023 (283K) put it around the top third of a percent of all Wikipedia articles, but it's barely in the top 2% of WPMED articles.

Help with writting about pseudoscientific topics

I'm not sure where this question belongs but I thought I pose it here. I would like to improve the page Adrenal fatigue however I'm running into a bit of an issue. Normally with an article about a disease people write about symptoms, causes, diagnosis, treatment etc. but when said disease doesn't exist should we be deviating from that format? I've found a number of reputable sources debunking adrenal fatigue however they don't always go into detail about symptoms, causes, diagnosis, and treatment. I've also found two somewhat reliable sources that go into detail about the theories behind adrenal fatigue. However my other question is, does the fact that these articles support the existance of adrenal fatigue make them inherantly unreliable? Could these sources be used to say &quot;the symptoms associated with adrenal fatigue are xyz&quot; or &quot;proposed treatment for adrenal fatigue includes xyz&quot; (note I would also follow this up by talking about why those treatments don't work etc). The two sources that I'm not sure about are:

* 
* 
They are both published by Elsevier and seem okay at first glance but I'm not sure if it's appropriate to use them. Any guidance on the topic is appreciated.  () 23:31, 10 September 2024 (UTC)

There are definitely editors who would prefer to use a non-standard article format, because they want to signal in every way that it's Not Real™.  There are also editors who prefer to use the standard format because it's generally a good way to organize the material, and prefer to use the words inside the section to communicate the complexities.
I think the best answer depends on exactly how non-real it is.  I'd avoid the standard format for fictional (e.g., Dragon pox), invented (e.g., Marthambles), or purely historical diagnoses (e.g., Female hysteria).  I'd use something similar to the standard format for diseases that are contested but tacitly accepted (think Gulf War syndrome, which may not be a single disease in nosological terms, but it's definitely not imaginary).   () 02:55, 11 September 2024 (UTC)
I think I'm going to stick to the typical format but just make it clear that it's not a real pathology as the concept behind adrenal fatigue isn't too out there. Do you have thoughts on the sources?  () 14:43, 11 September 2024 (UTC)
Sometimes the 'standard' (/not standard) MOSMED headings are useful, but sometimes the FRINGE stuff is so whack they don't apply. A frequently useful heading for altmed topic is, for example, &quot;Conceptual basis&quot; which is not a 'standard' MOSMED one.  () 07:10, 11 September 2024 (UTC)
I was also thinking of modifying the headings a bit. Like instead of signs and symptoms putting &quot;Associated symptoms&quot; to show that they are associated with the disease but not actual symptoms persay. For causes I was thinking of putting &quot;Proposed causes&quot; to show that they haven't been proven (or in some cases even disproven).  () 14:45, 11 September 2024 (UTC)

Since I pulled the page views numbers above, I checked these for fun.  They're approximately in the top third of all Wikipedia articles for popularity.
These all look like the kinds of things that someone might see in a lab report or a doctor's note and ask Dr. Google to explain what the terms mean.  I'm not sure that we need a separate article for any of them, but I believe that we need to have the information somewhere.  Consequently, I think I would make a very general recommendation that you spend more time in  than in  or , especially for diseases and variations on diseases (e.g., Hypertrichosis simplex of the scalp, which is a specific monogeneic type of Hypertrichosis – a viable merge target – and also about which you might be interested [https://www.google.com/books/edition/Progress_in_Monogenic_Hair_Disorders/A-zGlpYzlRYC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=%22Hypertrichosis+simplex%22&amp;pg=PA2&amp;printsec=frontcover in the table of genetic mutations here], and [https://www.google.com/books/edition/Haare_und_Haarboden_Schweissdr%C3%BCsen_Talg/-H3RBgAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=%22Hypertrichosis+simplex%22&amp;pg=PA172&amp;printsec=frontcover its place in a broader classification scheme here] [in German]).  () 17:49, 14 September 2024 (UTC)
Some of these I was on the fence about and some (such as the tumor alopecia page) I wouldn't choose to put up for deletion now (I would have instead redirected to alopecia). However I have redirected a lot of these smaller pages and the ones I chose to put up for deletion are pages that I didn't see a clear page to redirect to (although I do miss things). I do prefer to redirect when possible but some of these pages don't really have a page where I feel like they could be merged/redirected to. For example the page Acral arteriolar ectasia doesn't seem to have a page that it could be redirected to. As for Hypertrichosis simplex of the scalp there is no evidence that said disease exists. I could not find it in the source given and the only other mention of it described it as a type of alopecia and cites an article about HYPOtrichosis simplex of the scalp which leads me to believe it may have been a typo hence why I opted for deletion over a redirect. As always I really appreciate your feedback and knowledge. (I also for some reason could not access the two links you provided).  () 18:00, 14 September 2024 (UTC)
Oh, that's fascinating.  The table says that hyPERtrichosis simplex is autosomal dominant, MIM 146520 in gene CDSN at locus 6p21.  But https://omim.org/entry/146520 names the same gene and the same locus and says it's about hyPOtrichosis.  Perhaps different mutations in the same gene have opposite effects?
The book says:
tqb|1=Michelson unterschied bei der Hypertrichosis folgende Formen: 
# Hypertrichosis indoles hereditaria
#: A. Hypertrichosis universalis
#:: a) die exzessive Behaarung der Haarmenschen,
#:: b) die allgemeine starke Behaarung des männlichen Körpers,
#: B. Hypertrichosis localis: 
#:: a) Hypertrichosis simplex, die zu starke Behaarung einer Stelle bei unveränderter Haut
#:: b) Hypertrichosis hypertrophica, die exzessive Behaarung der sog. Naevi auf überpigmentierter und pathologisch veränderter Haut.
# Hypertrichosis acquisata transitoria (Klebs) als im extrauterinen Leben erworben:
#:: a) Hypertrichosis neurotica, infolge neurotischer Ursachen,
#:: b) Hypertrichosis irritativa, als Folge von Hautreizungen

with the relevant bit being 1.B.a): 1. says that it's hereditary, B. says that it's localized, and a) says that it's too much hair in one place on otherwise normal skin.
BTW, Google Books gave the publication date as 2013, but it's a reprint of a 1932 book.  Perhaps this is an older name and rarely used now?  () 19:40, 14 September 2024 (UTC)

Since  matters, I think it's worth taking a look at the proposed text, which is this (three paragraphs, three different parts of the article):
----
More recently, the meta-analysis and systematic review by Belladelli et al. (2023) of 55,761 men from 75 studies, done between 1942 and 2021, and based on estimations of pooled mean length, indicated that the average erect penis length was , average stretched penis length was , and average flaccid penis length was . Belladelli (2023) indicated that &quot;all measurements showed variation by geographic region.

, , and , thanks for sharing your thoughts, findings, and observations. 

Bon courage has pointed out that Belladelli et al. (2023) is a review in a non-MEDLINE journal ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/101596899 World Journal of Men's Health]). Bon courage has also shared the source from PubPeer, which shows: Guillaume Cabanac shared two excerpts (accepted by PubPeer in August) from the Times Higher Education's &quot;Peer review will only do its job if referees are named and rated&quot;, which was authored on August 14, 2024 by Randy Robertson. Per [https://www.susqu.edu/live/profiles/456-randy-robertson Susquehanna University], Randy Robertson is an Associate Professor of English and Creative Writing. Robertson does not appear to be a subject-matter expert in a relevant field, which seems to make the claims made in the article, including the cited excerpts from PubPeer, questionable in terms of weight as it relates to this present discussion.

WhatamIdoing has shared the source from Scopus and pointed out that Scopus gives the World Journal of Men's Health a good rating ([https://www.scopus.com/sourceid/21100943924#tabs=1 CiteScore rank 2023: 7.6, #11/120, 91st percentile]) as well as pointed out that Belladelli et al. (2023) has been cited by Bene et al. (2024) via Journal of Clinical Medicine (an MDPI journal). [https://wjmh.org/DOIx.php?id=10.5534/wjmh.220203 World Journal of Men's Health] indicates that, via Crossref, Belladelli et al. (2023) is cited by [https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/13/10/2760 Bene et al. (2024)], [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-024-02871-z Hanson et al.

(2023)] via International Journal of Impotence Research (a Springer Nature journal).

If the observation made about the cited excerpts from PubPeer being questionable is accepted and PubPeer, in this particular case, is accepted as not ultimately bearing weight in the discussion about Belladelli et al. (2023), then what has apparently been established is that the World Journal of Men's Health is a non-MEDLINE journal with a good rating from Scopus, and that Belladelli et al. (2023) – an article in the World Journal of Men's Health – is cited by three articles, one from an MDPI journal, one from a Springer journal, and one from a Springer Nature journal.

Would you please read the [[Talk:Human penis size#WP:MEDSAY copyediting]] and try to implement that for a couple of sections?  After you learn how to apply  to this subject, then I think you'll be in a better position for talking about this particular source.

I think the contributors there are trying their best, but they seem to be creating a comprehensive bibliography instead of an encyclopedia article.  I'm pretty lenient about the five-year recommendation in , but about 20% of the cited sources are from the previous century, meaning that a whole generation has been born and finished university since they were published.

Improving + Translating APBD article

My name is Jeff Levenson and I am a volunteer co-president of the Adult Polyglucosan Body Disease Research Foundation (APBD RF). 
APBD is a genetic neurodegenerative, glycogen storage disease type IV which often mimics MS. Because of that, most of our patients are misdiagnosed and take on average seven years to be properly diagnosed. I have been working on the APBD Wiki page in hopes of improving awareness about this disease. There is an English and German versions of the APBD page, but we desperately need help on other translations. i.e. Spanish, Portuguese, Polish, etc. 

Can someone tell me if there a red link index and if it is recommended to use Wikidata  platform and/or Wiki Project: medicine to grapple with the challenges of spreading the word about APBD and allied diseases?  () 15:49, 24 September 2024 (UTC)

Welcome to Wikipedia, @.  Before you request translations, I suggest that you look for some more sources.  The main goal is to have the facts be up to date, but also to make it easy for editors to see at a glance that the facts are probably up to date, just by looking at how old the cited sources are.  The ideal is to get high-quality sources within the last five years; for rare diseases, it's often necessary to stretch that a bit.  Here is [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Adult+polyglucosan+body+disease&amp;filter=pubt.meta-analysis&amp;filter=pubt.review&amp;filter=pubt.systematicreview&amp;filter=datesearch.y_10&amp;filter=other.medline&amp;sort=date&amp;size=200 a list of newer medical journal articles] that might be useful, if you'd like to have a look.  
When you feel like it's in good shape, then I suggest that you go to [[m:Talk:Wiki Project Med]] and click the &quot;Add topic&quot; button at the top of the page, and leave a note to ask if anyone is coordinating translations at the moment.    () 21:24, 24 September 2024 (UTC)
 yes we at Wiki Project Med have an ongoing translation project. We generally are only translating the leads of articles and for a lead of an article to be deemed ready for translation every sentence must be referenced to a high quality secondary source. Our translation dashboard is [https://mdwiki.toolforge.org/Translation_Dashboard/index.php here] and we have had more than [https://mdwiki.toolforge.org/Translation_Dashboard/leaderboard.php 3,500 translations] created by volunteers as a result of this initiative since 2021.

Priority rating maintenance

We seem to have some creep in [[:Category:High-importance medicine articles]].  Here are a few that I thought should be removed (presumably to Mid-importance, but let me know):

* Alteplase
* Aliskiren
* Amantadine
* Arachidonic acid
* Blue baby syndrome
* Benzodiazepine dependence
* Bifidobacterium
* Bifidobacterium longum
* Clostridium (the genus, not Clostridioides difficile infection)
* Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
* Economic impact of HIV/AIDS
* Error (not Medical error)
* Friedreich's ataxia
* GI cocktail
* Human T-lymphotropic virus 1
* ICD-10
* Innate resistance to HIV
* List of medicine contamination incidents

The rules are:  You tell me what rating you want, and it's okay with me.  I've picked these out by scrolling through the first half of the category, and it would actually be extremely helpful and desirable for you to tell me that I'm wrong about any of these that you think should be kept at this level.  If you don't have a good feeling for how we usually rate things, then [[:Category:High-importance medicine articles|click on the category]] and scroll around for a few seconds (or , but scrolling through the cat will be faster and may be more helpful).

One user came along and keeps putting their preferred version:

Non-stigmatizing language is preferable, of course, as is a writing style that is clear, direct, and concise.  It is not always possible to achieve all of these desirable things in the same sentence.  As for which to prefer in a tradeoff, we have not found it necessary to have a hard and fast rule, and of course one of the fundamental policies is that there are  anyway. 
Personally, if I were going to try to improve that article, I think it would be more productive to focus on the outdated facts instead of the wording of the one sentence.  () 03:01, 12 October 2024 (UTC)

Introduction and Hello

Hello everyone

I have been advised to come to this page and introduce myself. I am part of a team of instructors guiding undergrad students in creating articles on medical topics. These students are from the pharmacy and biomedical science disciplines at the faculty of medicine in our Uni. For various reasons, last semester I was involved in moving articles to the main space. Going forward this part will be handled by a more experienced editor in my location. How this space will be hugely beneficial is in helping us guide our students in writing quality articles. 

To give you some background about our process, we begin by showing our students the . There are issues with this list and thanks to some helpful members of this community, I have already been given some suggestions on how to handle this list and ideas for modifying this element of our guidance. Any other suggestions regarding this list or suggestions on how to get our medical students started are welcome! The suggested ideas so far will require some substantial restructuring in our syllabus from assignment design to modification of the assessment rubric which may not be possible for the next cohort. Students go through a 3-month period from topic selection to drafting, peer reviewing to final submission before we move the articles to the main space. We make students submit a downloaded PDF version of their sandbox drafts to Turnitin for plagiarism checking. Their submissions come at the end of the semester, and students tend not to engage in continuous edits once they have completed the course with us despite us encouraging them to do so. We understand well that not all articles will be accepted and we tell students that the best ones will go through. 

I have a lot of questions regarding general Wikipedia protocols as well as questions specific to medical articles. Now that I have found this space, I will use it to check our alignments when the course gets going in January and students submit drafts. Nice to meet you here and I look forward to engaging with you.   () 02:14, 14 October 2024 (UTC)

Thanks for this note.  But first I want you to show off some of the work done by your previous students.  Nobody expects a perfect article from any new editor, but yours seem to have done pretty well so far, and you've done a good job of teaching them that material needs citations from the beginning. 
If you've got a list of those still in Draft: space, that would also be useful to have.    () 03:50, 14 October 2024 (UTC)
Here you go:
Dorsal pancreatic agenesis
Artificial saliva
X-linked genetic disease
Dermatologic surgical procedure
Acquired hand deformity
Blue light spectrum
Sex and drugs
Face washing
Microneedles
Pregnancy hormones
Catatonic depression
Human chimera
Virus crystallisation
Tissue transplantation
Congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia
High-dose chemotherapy  () 03:57, 14 October 2024 (UTC)
Thank you for your comments @  () 04:09, 14 October 2024 (UTC)
With the next cohort, I will share excerpts during the drafting phase for comments and suggestions if I need them (very likely!).   () 04:19, 14 October 2024 (UTC)
Thanks for this list.  I see a couple of them ended up getting  and redirected to another article, which is fine. Some of these surprise me:  How did we not have articles on face washing or high-dose chemotherapy until this year?  In general, I think we're missing a lot of &quot;intermediate&quot; level articles:  we have Chemotherapy and we have articles on individual drugs and regimens, but we don't have all the articles on general categories.  
I know that you and IntentionallyDense are working on a list of possible articles for the next class, which should make things a little easier.   needs some clean up work.  You might also think about topics that are unrequested but still appropriate.  For example, we have the general article for Brain tumor, but no article specifically about brain tumors in children, and that's the second most common category of pediatric cancer.

PRAL

Hello everyone. In Potential renal acid load (PRAL) it appears that this concept is somehow valid and is somehow contradicting: One the one hand the body produces acid which on the other hand does not affect pH of the blood (which is good, as otherwise the wrong food will kill you).

Is there more reliable information about this? Best -- () 17:44, 15 October 2024 (UTC)

There's an alternative medicine diet about acid-producing foods, and I think that having a good article here might be the best defense against pseudoscientific nonsense creeping in.

PRAL correlates with Net acid excretion.[https://www.google.com/books/edition/Modern_Nutrition_in_Health_and_Disease/9zZvEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=%22Potential+renal+acid+load%22+%22PRAL%22&amp;pg=PA120&amp;printsec=frontcover]  [https://www.google.com/books/edition/Fluid_Electrolyte_and_Acid_Base_Disorder/kBC-EAAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=%22Potential+renal+acid+load%22+%22PRAL%22&amp;pg=PA518&amp;printsec=frontcover This book] and [https://www.google.com/books/edition/Nutrition_Therapy_for_Urolithiasis/xipADwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=%22Potential+renal+acid+load%22+%22PRAL%22&amp;pg=PA103&amp;printsec=frontcover this one] describe it in terms of a dietary pattern (fruits and vegetables good; aged cheese bad) for kidney patients.

Best Practices for Teaching Students to Write Effective Lead Sections

The boxed content originally appeared at ; please follow up below the box.  () 17:41, 16 October 2024 (UTC)



Discussion moved here upon request. Please respond to 's questions about &quot;&quot; below. Thanks,  () 17:41, 16 October 2024 (UTC)

You'll want to look over , if you haven't before.  The lead for a well-developed article about a disease usually has four paragraphs, and they usually combine some of these elements:
* Definition, cause, and symptoms
* Diagnosis and treatment
* Screening, prevention, prognosis
* Epidemiology, history, cultural information
I've broken this list up to suggest four possible paragraphs, but ►you must use your judgment to pick the right elements.  For example, some disease have no treatment and the diagnostic process is simple and boring (e.g., run a lab test), so diagnosis and treatment wouldn't make a good paragraph.  Or the cause is unknown and it has no symptoms.  In that case, merge, rearrange, or omit whatever doesn't seem important.
I don't think that medication articles follow the same pattern, but  has a few specific details that they recommend including.  As a general rule for a Wikipedia article, you can look down the Table of Contents for the article, and the lead ought to say something (sometimes only half a sentence) about most of the sections.
I helped with the recent updates to , and I think that your students could set a goal of having at least 100 words in the lead.  That's usually feasible even for an article that isn't very long or well-developed yet.   () 19:34, 16 October 2024 (UTC)
Thank you and all noted. A lot has been clarified for me now regarding the lead.   () 23:37, 16 October 2024 (UTC)

What the heck happened to the nicotine article?

I am posting this here instead of on the talk page of the article, because I'd like to get the opinion of a broader base of editors interested in this, rather than just the (likely zero) people who read the talk page of the article in question.

I was reading the article on nicotine and noticed that the &quot;Adverse effects&quot; section was looking very sparse considering the nature of the substance. Particularly the subsection on the effects on the cardiovascular system was suspiciously sparse, given that nicotine is widely known to have an effect on blood pressure and heart rate. I checked an [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nicotine&amp;oldid=877772054#Adverse_effects older version] of the page from 2019, and back then the &quot;Adverse effects&quot; section was much longer with many paragraphs of comprehensively cited text (did not evaluate the contents of the citations though), including on cardiovascular health. Sure, it wasn't perfect and was in obvious need of cleanup, but the difference to the current article is night and day.

What happened? Given the subject matter, my spidey sense detects a whiff of foul play. I am probably incapable of really doing anything about it myself (far from my field of expertise, and the article seems pretty controversial), but this bothered me enough that I wanted to ask for the opinions of editors with more experience on articles like this. — -  19:12, 19 October 2024 (UTC)

@, it looks like there was a  named  editing that article in 2020, but I thought all of that got reverted.  That section had [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nicotine&amp;oldid=877772054#Adverse_effects already] been re-written by that point.  I wonder if the changes you've noticed could be found in [https://sigma.toolforge.org/usersearch.py?name=QuackGuru&amp;page=Nicotine&amp;server=enwiki&amp;max= the list of edits from this user].
The best thing to do at this point would be to find a really great source and start over from scratch.   () 21:13, 19 October 2024 (UTC)

How to use withdrawn Cochrane reviews

Hello! I am currently working through this [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Articles_citing_retracted_publications&amp;pageuntil=Shame#mw-pages] category of articles which retractionbot has tagged as citing retracted articles. While doing so I noticed a substantial portion of these related to medicine come from Cochrane Library. Cochrane withdraws articles after a period of time - even before forthcoming updated medical reviews are published. [https://retractionwatch.com/2010/09/20/progressive-how-the-cochrane-library-handles-updates-in-progress/]

I understand the risk of outdated medical articles, but many of them that I have seen cited are done for what I understand to be showing common treatment methods, rather than experimental treatment methods. This post here is seeking advice from those with more experience editing medical articles on how such withdrawn papers can or should be used. The following questions are especially helpful:
* Should withdrawn Chochrane reviews still be cited for basic information on common treatment methods and/or experimental methods, or should they be tagged with ?
* Should withdrawn Cochrane reviews have their year cited in text if they have been withdrawn due to being outdated?
 () 10:13, 23 October 2024 (UTC)
Good question! I remove a withdrawn review citation entirely. If the evidence shared is still accurately conveyed, I try to replace it with a high quality secondary source that shares the same evidence in background sections or by looking to see if a new review supersedes it (if not updated).

Thanks for the clarification! I think that fits with the examples I gave in the comment below of where I handled it. Please feel free to give those a look and see if there is perhaps a more preferable way to tag those.  () 16:45, 23 October 2024 (UTC)
I do the following:
* I check the context (is it a medical claim, is it just one sentence or is it something integral to the page, is it the author's work, is the retraction mentioned on the page, etc)
* I check the retraction notice/reason
* If it is intentional cite, I tag it (you just insert '|intentional=yes' at the end of the reference) and mark the edit as minor (if that's all I do, otherwise I leave it as a major edit).
* If it is an unintentional citation that is specific to that one study, I remove the claim citing the reason in the retraction. (Data manipulation, fraud, etc)
* If it is an unintentional citation that seems likely to be backed up by other sources, then I tag it with  and  per the context.
* If it is any more complex than that to where I would need to pick apart the page or find replacement sources, I will either leave it alone for now (not tag it so it stays in the category) or I post on the page's talk section so someone more familiar with the subject can handle it.
On that last point I actually intended to narrow down the simple retracted citations until it was just the difficult ones that are too woven into the page or should be handled with care (around half of the retracted citations are medical in nature), and once that happened I would make a topic here with a list + summary of the more complex ones left. Examples of these complicated cases would be Weight Loss and Type A and Type B personality theory where both cases are cited many times throughout the body of the article, and would likely need the eyes of someone far more familiar with the subject. I am a historian, so I have been leaning on caution when choosing what to edit and what to leave alone.
I came here to ask this question since this particular source gave me trouble, and I know that there is a higher standard of scrutiny for editing medical articles and wanted to make sure I was doing it correctly. So far I have only edited three articles with a cochrane retraction. 
# One was for a routine treatment for tongue disease that had been retracted due to the dentists not being able to update the study years later. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tongue_disease&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1252875795] This is the dif for that.
# Another was [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Osteoarthritis&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1252868643] where I removed the source. In hindsight I believe given the context that this was a mistake, and so I have put it more in line with the previous example.
# The third I would need to hunt down again, but I handled it like the first.
Hope this helps.  () 16:38, 23 October 2024 (UTC)

The Cochrane update bot is still working well. This flags reviews that are cited in articles when an updated version of the same review is published via MedLine, it updates the list monthly. It is up to date this month. This does not flag retracted reviews though. () 21:29, 23 October 2024 (UTC)

DMOZ and Curlie in External links

For a long while, this group has encouraged people to add a link to a DMOZ or its successor, Curlie.  The advantage is that having a link to a Web directory means we had less on-wiki maintenance to do and could redirect any spammy promoters to those websites.  However, the nearly moribund Curlie has finally shut down, and after a  discussion, all of these links are being removed by bot.

If you want to add  to an article, please consider a web directory.  You should pick the best site you can find, even if it's not an &quot;official&quot; webpage in any way.  Alternatively, pick a small number of websites that .  Finally, if you decide that the best result for that article is no links, then consider moving any bulky sister link templates up into the top of the previous section (whatever that is), and then remove the

section heading.    () 07:00, 20 October 2024 (UTC)

Thank you for the update WAID. Any chance someone who isn't afraid of template syntax could remove Curlie support from ? It's  so you'll need to be a  or administrator (or setup an edit request, which should be fairly straightforward; I can sort the latter out, I just thought it might be smoother coming from someone who understands templates).
I think that's the only change needed in our guidance docs. I removed the Curlie recommendation at MEDMOS relatively recently.  () 17:40, 25 October 2024 (UTC)

Added stuff on the socioeconomic/legal reasons that we don't have a vaccine in production yet. See also economics of vaccines. 

I should like to see an analysis of whether the existence of legal monopolies in the biomedical field is a net benefit to taxpayers, because it clearly has enormous negative externalities. This is doubly important because, outside the chemical and pharma sector, patents seem not to be a net benefit even to their owners (in the US, as of 2008; from ). So the onus is rather on patents to show that they should exist.  () 02:56, 3 October 2024 (UTC)

DOIs vs PMIDs

Given the choice we should be preferring the former I think as it is an International Standard not a proprietary one. I suppose there may be a risk that PMIDs stop working if the US govt has its resourcing pulled?  () 06:36, 30 October 2024 (UTC)

But they aren't equivalent.  takes me to the PubMed website with its own copy of the abstract and author details and other links and information.  takes me to the publisher website's copy of the article. Surely there's a similar risk that a publisher might go under or suffer a Crowdstrike-like systems failure. And if PubMed stops being funded, who's to say International DOI Foundation might have some big falling out or loss of funding too, meaning all our doi.org links stop working.  I don't know why you are asking us to prefer one or the other. Let's have both. -- ° 09:12, 31 October 2024 (UTC)
Both sounds a safe option. I suppose I'm feeling jittery after seeing what problems the disappearance of the Internet Archive caused, which it was easy to assume was a permanent part of the Web, and because it's apparent the PUBMED infrastructure is subject to one government's ideals, which might change in odd ways.[https://edition.cnn.com/2024/10/29/politics/rfk-trump-control-hhs-usda/index.html]  () 11:18, 31 October 2024 (UTC)
I suspect if PubMed lost funding from US Gov then it would be important enough to the international community to keep alive elsewhere. We'd have to rewrite the URLs from pubmed.ncbi.nlm.gov to pubmed.org or something, but that's a problem for the templates. -- ° 16:14, 31 October 2024 (UTC)
 At least part of PubMed is already mirrored by Europe PubMed Central.  If PubMed lost funding from the U.S. government, then we are in a real world of .  () 16:49, 31 October 2024 (UTC)
That sounds like a reason to prefer DOI to PMID. DOI represents the publisher's intention.  () 17:07, 31 October 2024 (UTC)
 Both are useful for different reasons. There is no reason to prefer one over the other.  () 17:11, 31 October 2024 (UTC)
 PubMed provides a lot of useful information that is often lacking in the publisher sites, such as related citations, cited by, indexing (MeSH, gene ID, etc.).  () 17:20, 31 October 2024 (UTC)
 Not to mention links from PubMed to PubMedCentral which contains full text that is sometimes missing from the publisher site.  () 17:26, 31 October 2024 (UTC)
 What makes PubMedCentral so valuable is the NIH Public Access Policy. In short, any publication resulting from research funded by the NIH must be freely available to the public through PubMedCentral.  () 17:45, 31 October 2024 (UTC)
In the event of an announcement that PubMed was closing (it surely wouldn't happen by surprise overnight) then one of our bot wizards could look up all the PMID links to extract the DOI on the PubMed page, and add any missing DOI parameters/link to our references. Maybe there's a bot doing that already? If I use the Cite Journal editing tool, and supply a PMID, it can fill in the citation fields and the DOI. But if I supply a DOI then it can't lookup the PMID. So arguably the PMID is more useful at the moment, as it unlocks information about the other IDs that a DOI can't.  I remain puzzled why we are being asked to prefer one. -- ° 08:37, 1 November 2024 (UTC)
 Yes,  already does this. If at least one of , , or  is specified, it can usually fill in the missing ones if they exist.  () 09:49, 1 November 2024 (UTC)

Fake AI-generated article?

I'm concerned about the content of canfosfamide.  I noticed that the references for this article have broken DOIs.  Upon investigation, I found that the titles of the references cannot be found by a Google search.  This type of real-looking but fake references is characteristic of what is written by ChatGTP and other AI text generators.  I suspect that this article was largely written by AI.  Other medical articles started by Ashleythesciencenerd may have the same problem ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cancer_exodus_hypothesis&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1251633723 example]).   () 16:13, 2 November 2024 (UTC)

 Yep, this article contains AI-generated fake references. While the topic is legitimate, the entire article needs to be rewritten. It appears that ChatGPT was used to create this content, which is cannot be used for reliable sourcing. Perplexity is generally a much more reliable option for generating accurate references. Regardless, if an AI tool is used to create content, it must be carefully checked by editors before posting.  () 18:33, 2 November 2024 (UTC)

Request for Help: Expanding Psychological and Neurodevelopmental Disorders Section in NF1 Article

Hello everyone,

I am currently working on improving the 
Psychological and Neurodevelopmental Disorders section of the Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) 
article. Specifically, I need assistance with finding reliable resources and expanding the content related to Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in NF1.

Both ASD and ADHD are highly prevalent in individuals with NF1, and they often exhibit distinct characteristics compared to idiopathic forms. I believe that enhancing this section will be especially useful for parents of affected children, as it could provide valuable insights into these unique challenges.

If anyone has access to relevant studies or publications, or if you have experience with this subject, I would greatly appreciate your guidance in improving this section.

I have found articles about ADHD in NF1, such as the one by Lion-François et al. (2020), which discusses the differences between ADHD and the syndromic ADHD in NF1. Honestly, I feel like this topic is a bit beyond my understanding, and I don't want to make mistakes when editing the article. If anyone has a good grasp of this issue, I would greatly appreciate your collaboration.

Thank you in advance for your support!  — Preceding  comment added by  ( • ) 21:29, 20 October 2024 (UTC)

Bots tagging &quot;outdated&quot; Cochrane reviews

Hello, 

This bot-tagging of Cochrane reviews when they are updated with newer ones is a helpful feature to keep wp up to date. However I have a situation where both the older review and the updated one are cited. Therefore, the bot's actions are unhelpful. I reverted one such bot edit already, but now it happened again.  

Here is the section in question: Ventral_rectopexy#Controversy_regarding_use_of_mesh

This section of the article is a &quot;background&quot; or &quot;history&quot; of the development of the procedure. I thought the earlier Cochrane review was an important landmark publication to include in this section. The latest Cochrane review is cited in the next sentence. Thoughts? Thank you  () 07:31, 3 November 2024 (UTC)

Delirium caused by Anticholinergic medications

Hello. An experienced Doctor recommended I ask for help with the Delirium article here, he says he isnt available and very busy.

Delirium, as most of you know, is a disorder / syndrome which occurs mostly in old / elderly people above age 70 or so. However, there is another type of Delirium caused by anticholinergic medications, and the Delirium article confuses readers by talking about mostly the elderly part of age over 70 people who have Delirium, not the other type caused by anticholinergic medications.

I came here to ask for help with improving the Delirium article for that. Are there any people who can possibly help me improve Delirium article? Doctors I prefer of course, but anyone with medical knowledge generally.  () 06:00, 1 November 2024 (UTC)

I forgot to say. I've improved Delirium article myself by alot! But theres some work needs to be done.  () 06:01, 1 November 2024 (UTC)
I suppose there are many substances which can cause acute delirium.[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33040861/] These should be mentioned in context without giving undue weight among the many causes overall.[https://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/brain-nerves-and-spinal-cord/delirium/]  () 07:33, 1 November 2024 (UTC)
Perhaps the redirect Substance-induced delirium (also ICU delirium) should be turned into a separate article.  , the latter might be a good option for your students.  [[:Category:Redirects with possibilities]] might be an interesting place to find likely missing articles.  () 01:50, 2 November 2024 (UTC)
Thats an amazing idea. I had no clue this redirect even exists. If a doctor can help write the basic info and start that new article it'd help alot. Although the current Delirium article talks about delirium caused by medication as well, it doesnt go into full details about it. Readers who read Delirium article, read about the one in old / elderly 70+ patients in hospitals. We need to separate the 2 types of Delirium.
Another thing is. In the past Delirium was also called &quot;Acute confusional state&quot;? What does that mean?  () 02:06, 2 November 2024 (UTC)
@, if we wait for one of the physicians to do this, it could be years.  Why don't you try putting together a very short article in , just to get us started?  You can copy relevant text and sources out of the main article.  You can make a list of substances from [https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Treatment_Of_Psychiatric_Disorders/jnt0DwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=anticholinergic+delirium&amp;pg=PT25&amp;printsec=frontcover this book].

Although I haven’t looked through the Crohn’s disease article it’s not uncommon to remove sources for various reasons. For example according to  articles over 5 years old should be replaced with newer sources. So perhaps maybe a couple older refs were replaced in favour of newer more comprehensive sources? It’s also not uncommon to have one comprehensive article replace several smaller less comprehensive sources. Pretty much what I’m trying to say is although it may look odd, removing sources isn’t always a bad thing especially with medical articles.  () 01:20, 5 November 2024 (UTC)
@ if there aren`t any newer sources, is it ok to keep the existing ones? what would be recommended?  () 12:06, 5 November 2024 (UTC)
If there is no newer sources then use the most recent, reliable and comprehensive source you can find.  () 15:07, 5 November 2024 (UTC)
I agree with IntentionallyDense:  Use the best sources you can, and remember that MEDDATE is trying to guide you to the best sources, rather than providing a hard and fast cut off date.  Usually, in a heavily researched area (think Hypercholesterolemia), you can write a great article using only review articles from the top-ranked journals and the best med school textbooks, every source published in the last five years, and still have plenty of high-quality sources left over.  In a less popular area, you may need to stretch that:  maybe the sources need to be from mid-ranked journals.  Maybe you need a couple of primary sources.  Maybe you need sources that are 10 years old.
Our advice is to aim for the ideal, but to do what's practical.  () 19:41, 6 November 2024 (UTC)
When I updated prostate cancer and brought it to  status, the number of references dropped from 355 to 128. Some of that was trimming material, but much of that loss was updating the sourcing to more recent, higher-quality references. When an article grows bit-by-bit you often get 100 facts with 100 references. When sections or whole articles are updated at once you might get 100 facts with 20 references. Neither is inherently better. I'd suggest picking a section of Crohn's disease (or any other article you're concerned about) and comparing the text/sources before and after to see if you feel it's improving or not. Hopefully you'll find it is (I haven't looked at it myself). If you find particular concerns, we'll have more to discuss here.  () 20:12, 5 November 2024 (UTC)

Article on subjective refraction

Hello - as there does not seem to be an optometry WikiProject I am asking here instead in the hopes that someone has the necessary expertise. The article Subjective refraction, despite being (as far as I know) a fairly important topic in optometry, is in a rather unacceptable state. The vast majority of the article is written as a how-to guide and not a well-formatted one at that. Some content is probably salvageable, but everything else needs to be completely rewritten, so I think this will require some subject matter expertise. There seems to be a list of medical textbooks in the references. Thanks.  — [[User:RTao|RTao]] ( • ) 01:13, 7 November 2024 (UTC)

Not really. My suggestion would've been, &quot;Maybe I could at least replace citations of the old guideline with the current 2024 one,&quot; but I think the Stroke article does not cite the old guideline at all! I otherwise have not had a chance to closely compare the article to the current guideline; I actually heard about the update from the Associated Press, but I don't know if the AP summary is accurate. I know AP itself is accurate and that scientific reporting in even reputable newspapers for laypeople like me can be all over the place.  ( · ) 14:42, 13 November 2024 (UTC)

WHtR below 0.4, values for anorexia, emaciated?

At Waist-to-height_ratio#Recommended_boundary_values there are clear boundary values 0.4, 0.5 and 0.6 and above.

Any boundaries known below WHtR 0.4? E.g. for
* Anorexia_nervosa
* Emaciation
* what is the lean counterpart of Obesity-associated_morbidity?
 () 09:08, 17 November 2024 (UTC)

@ I’m not fully sure of your question here but I’ll try my best to answer. 
Anorexia is diagnosed based partially off BMI not waist to height ratio although i’m sure you could find some study that gives info on the average WHtR.
Malnutrition, specifically Malnutrition#Effects has information on the health effects of malnutrition. Anorexia nervosa#Prognosis goes over the complications of anorexia as well. [[User:IntentionallyDense|Intentionally]][[User talk:IntentionallyDense|Dense]] () 19:46, 17 November 2024 (UTC)
Doing a little quick math, for an average-height woman, it's called Size zero.  The average US woman is 5'4&quot;, and 0.4 ratio means a waist size below 25.5&quot;, which is a size 0 dress on the Lands' End website (it will be a size 2 or 4 for some other brands).   It's not automatically a medical problem.
I don't think there is a single lean counterpart, because causes become more important.  Anorexia nervosa, BTW, can appear in any size body.  It's about what happens in your head, not about the current shape of your body.  () 19:46, 17 November 2024 (UTC)
Please have a look at: Waist-to-height_ratio#Recommended_boundary_values and .
NICE defines 0.4 as the lower bound of healthy.
Anything below 0.4 is unspecified, grey in the chart.
Any source that defines 'yellow' and 'red' boundaries below 0.4?
Is grey really grey? Unspecified? Really?  () 21:09, 17 November 2024 (UTC)
It might be.  The thing is, especially for women, two individuals could have the same overall body composition, but because one has an hourglass figure and the other has a straight/rectangular figure, they could fall on different sides of the same line.  That doesn't mean that the one with the narrower waist is more or less healthy.  The cutoff lines for these things are always somewhat arbitrary.  () 21:36, 17 November 2024 (UTC)
Yes, I understand all of that, especially at the high end of the scale. That is not my question.
The question is: Any boundary values known below 0.4, just like above 0.5?  () 21:52, 17 November 2024 (UTC)

Arthur E. Hertzler

I've started an article on Arthur E. Hertzler. Having started to dig into the numerous references about him, there's much more there than I currently have the time to write about, particularly in material found at [https://union.ku.edu/creation-ku-med this page]. There is also other material that I can see referenced, but can't read because of journal paywalls, such as [https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/article-abstract/212276 this article], and there's material about him in The Kansas Doctor: A Century of Pioneering by Thomas Neville Bonner, which I also don't have access to.

Hertzler by all accounts seems to have lived a fascinating life, and was clearly both brilliant and quite a character. Would anyone here be interested in expanding this article? —  () 07:28, 21 November 2024 (UTC)

The JAMA article is available via .  After you're logged in, [https://jamanetwork-com.wikipedialibrary.idm.oclc.org/journals/jamasurgery/fullarticle/212276?resultClick=1 this direct link] will probably work.  () 18:31, 21 November 2024 (UTC)

Autism on Wikipedia

Hi, a friend at Wikimedia UK suggested it could be wise to post about this here: I have a piece just out in Thinking Person's Guide to Autism, on '[https://thinkingautismguide.com/2024/11/how-wikipedia-systematically-misleads-people-about-autism.html How Wikipedia Systematically Misleads People About Autism]'. It describes some of my experiences editing relevant pages here, and argues that Wikipedia's autism coverage is badly out of date. I don't use the term in the article, but effectively Wikipedia's guidelines tend to enshrine a strong status quo bias. One consequence of this is that a biomedical framing of autism is largely taken for granted, despite the attitudes and insights of contemporary autism specialists, not to mention autistic communities.

I understand that similar biases have affected Wikipedia's coverage of marginalised groups across the board, but it seems that to date, there has been far more coordinated and institutional investment in correcting systematic gender bias, LGBT exclusion and racial prejudice.

I bring this up here because my impression is that Wikipedia's main Autism entry has inherited a framing and structure that is ubiquitous in our coverage of diseases and disorders, but which is questionably relevant and arguably unhelpful when it comes to something like autism - with pathophysiology, management, prognosis, epidemiology and so on.

Its physiology is much-studied, but still poorly understood, and many would question the appropriateness of the 'patho-' prefix; 'management' is not really an appropriate way of thinking about a difference that affects someone's entire way of being; 'prognosis' can be summed up in the single word 'lifelong'; 'epidemiology' …I mean, there are some reasonably interesting things to be said about the statistics (variations in which inevitably reflect the limitations of the data more than objective real-world differences) but there are so many other things that are more important.

So I guess I'm posting here partly to just give people a heads-up about the article, and partly to enquire about how attached people are to this general structure… and why?

I note that gender dysphoria is a separate article from transgender, allowing one to focus on the formal, medicalised interpretation of trans experience, while the other is more about being trans. Stuff that non-clinicians are actually likely to want to know, or benefit from knowing. Not sure that's an ideal solution, but it's an interesting one that's been discussed a couple of times in  as well; there are various helpful parallels that are worth considering, I think.

Sourcing milestone

Hello, all:  

We've been working this month on getting at least one source into unreferenced medicine-related articles.  There are now  on the list!  A few years ago, that list was over 400 articles.  Less than a year ago, it was over 200 articles.  We have made really good progress this year.  Please take a minute and see if you can add a source to at least one article.  

We are doing this now to support the  and also because we think that sources are particularly important for anything medicine-related on Wikipedia.  The backlog drive has officially resulted in about 7,000 of Wikipedia's unsourced articles getting a new source (i.e., with #NOV24 in the edit summary), plus all the pages that got new references but which weren't tagged.  

Please join in and do your bit.  We'd really appreciate it.  () 18:31, 27 November 2024 (UTC)

PCORI (Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute) as MEDRS?

Is there a consensus that using PCORI is an acceptable  source? There is a six-year [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Identifying_reliable_sources_(medicine)/Archive_28#PCORI_(Patient_Centered_Outcomes_Research_Institute):_Evidence_update_for_clinicians_and_patients old discussion about using PCORI] that was [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Whywhenwhohow#Recent_revert_discussion pointed out to me]. - () 00:48, 21 November 2024 (UTC)

I place PCORI in the same category as CDC or NIH. But I have seen edit wars centered on whether or not an NIH medical dictionary was , and the resolution was not(!), so I suppose these sources in whole or in part may not be . But if none of their work product is, one starts to get very close to the conclusion that nothing is .  () 11:08, 21 November 2024 (UTC)
One of the challenges with &quot;MEDRS&quot; is that there is the ideal (e.g., a peer-reviewed review article published in a highly reputable journal within the last five years) and then there is the good-enough (you don't need an &quot;ideal&quot; source to say that the common cold is caused by a virus).  Even if PCORI isn't &quot;ideal&quot;, it might be &quot;good enough&quot;, depending on what's being said.  () 18:26, 21 November 2024 (UTC)
I agree. I think that it is depending on what is being shared from the source and if it is a medical claim or paraphrased background information that fills an important gap in an article. () 22:30, 27 November 2024 (UTC)

Do The Lancet's Personal View articles meet the standards for a secondary source?

Hi WikiProject Medicine, 

The Lancet has a kind of article called a 'Personal View' that is peer reviewed. It has a lot of the formalities of a review article -- description of search strategy and selection criteria, extensive citations for claims, etc. Does this count as a review, and if not, does it still count as a suitable secondary source for biomedical information?  () 11:12, 14 December 2024 (UTC)

Oh I forgot to add. 'Personal View' articles come up when you search The Lancet for review articles only, so clearly The Lancet's editors consider them as part of the Review category. But does WikiProject Medicine?  () 11:34, 14 December 2024 (UTC)
Should be fine for non-contentious knowledge and non-novel claims. Novel personal views may be due and should probably be attributed. Any examples in mind?  () 11:37, 14 December 2024 (UTC)
Thank you for this. 
I was asking in general but here is an example: 
Hashimoto’s disease has a widely discussed issue with persistent symptoms in about 10-15% of patients despite euthyroid status. There’s a number of commonly discussed hypotheses for why this might be. An article like this https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(22)00004-3/abstract
discusses one of the more common hypotheses, that some patients lack peripheral tissue conversion of t4 into t3. I feel something like this makes for a suitable source in context?    () 13:03, 14 December 2024 (UTC)
I think that an article like this would be sufficient for paraphrasing a background section of an article, if a higher quality review/textbook etc is not available. In my own editing I would not share the hypotheses of a mechanism responsible for persisting symptoms from a commentary article without higher quality supporting MEDRS sources. () 13:13, 14 December 2024 (UTC)
Thank you Jen, that makes perfect sense.   () 13:17, 14 December 2024 (UTC)

TNIK and comparable genes with inhibitors in clinical trials

I started this discussion at , and it was suggested that I inquire here. Basically, Wikipedia has tens of thousands of articles on individual human genes, many bot-made and maintained with very little human attention. TNIK caught my eye because a happened to read about clinical trials underway for inhibitors thought to be cancer-preventative. As noted in the other discussion, Wikipedia coverage of gene-directed trial therapies ranges from something like USP1 (which currently contains no information on investigative efforts), to CD47 (which is reasonably well-covered in this respect).

This is a political 'thing' in the US at the moment, so having a decent article will be the best way to prevent well-intentioned but imperfect attempts to improve it.

Usually, if we put in something that says &quot;____ was claimed, but this is wrong because...&quot; then that will work, but if we remove it, then people assume that it's accidentally missing, and that we would consider if helpful for someone to add &quot;____ is true!&quot; to the article.

Correct; and it is a difficult topic complicated by multiple factors. The topic has long been plagued by canvassing that occurs at popular tic-related message boards and online support groups for parents -- a phenomenon mentioned in multiple sources -- so editors who understand policy and guideline as well as medicine have been lacking to keep up with that.  Some dated sections need rewriting (not so much for changed content, but to update the citations used that usually say same), but motivation wanes when much educating about policies and guidelines has to be done along the way, along with answering a lot of misinformation or overinterpretation of sources.

A good deal of the talk discussion at PANDAS is now about PANS, which was AFD'd 12 years ago ().  Is it time now to create that article?

I don't think we need a second article. A google shows most coverage is on PANS/PANDAS together. If PANDAS is a subset of PANS then what is needed perhaps is to move the existing PANDAS article to PANS and cover PANDAS within that. That allows us to use sources talking about &quot;PANS/PANDAS&quot; together but also sources covering just one where appropriate. -- ° 10:02, 19 December 2024 (UTC)
