Please could someone with a good knowledge of immunology read over Aphthous stomatitis#Causes? It was all supported by sources, but during the integration of these several sources into the subsections of the article &quot;bad things&quot; may have happened.

Dubious open-access publishers

There are some interesting conversations ongoing around Wikipedia about the publishing practices of some open-access journals and publishers. The discussions were probably kicked off by [http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/08/health/for-scientists-an-exploding-world-of-pseudo-academia.html this New York Times article] on the predatory practices of some such publishers; the phenomenon has also been noted recently in a series of articles in Nature ([http://www.nature.com/news/investigating-journals-the-dark-side-of-publishing-1.12666 &quot;The Dark Side of Publishing&quot;], [http://www.nature.com/news/open-access-the-true-cost-of-science-publishing-1.12676 &quot;Open access: The true cost of science publishing&quot;], [http://www.nature.com/news/sham-journals-scam-authors-1.12681 &quot;Sham journals scam authors&quot;]).

The articles focus on a subset of open-access publishers which employ dubious methods of peer review, questionable handling of editorial-board duties, and predatory financial practices. The articles point to a highly regarded list of &quot;predatory&quot; and dubious open-access journals maintained [http://scholarlyoa.com/individual-journals/ here] by an academic librarian.

I think it's worth being aware of these issues, and possibly consulting the list of dubious journals (or even linking it from ) in terms of the sources we use in our medical articles. As usual,  has some very thoughtful commentary on his talkpage on the subject; I'm not advocating a blanket search-and-remove of these journals, but it would be interesting to know how often, and in what contexts, we cite them in our articles. In any case, I just wanted to raise the issue here so that it's visible going forward, and would invite any discussion. MastCell Talk 17:14, 9 April 2013 (UTC)

Thanks very much for that. One of the comments under that NYT article says scientists are not paid to do reviews. Is that always the case, or do some journals pay their reviewers? --Anthonyhcole (talk ·  · )  18:02, 9 April 2013 (UTC)
I'm not aware of any reputable journal which pays its peer reviewers. (I sometimes wish they did, but...) It's a volunteer job. MastCell Talk 18:26, 9 April 2013 (UTC)
Thanks. --Anthonyhcole (talk ·  · )  06:08, 10 April 2013 (UTC)

* Is there a list kept like the ? If not, anyone want to set one up for dubious journals etc? IRWolfie- (talk) 21:56, 10 April 2013 (UTC)
There is great conflict between &quot;open access&quot; publishers and &quot;publishers supported by advertising revenue and subscription fees&quot;. Both have their issues as a model of publishing and IMO open access has far less than ad revenue/pre print based. Many subscription based journals for example will be pressured to publish an article as the company/authors publishing it have agreed to by 10,000 copies once it is published sometimes at the cost of $100,000.

JMIR Wiki Medical Reviews

Of all the initiatives being championed by , James and others,  (a peer-reviewed open-access journal of Wikipedia articles) is to me the most exciting. If all goes well, it could foster much greater involvement of experts in the creation and curation of our articles, by offering them the incentive of a citable publication while removing the disincentive of mutability (at least from the reviewed version of the article). But the strength of the incentive will depend on the status afforded Wiki Medical Reviews by the academic community, which in turn will depend among other things on the standing of the peer reviewers engaged and the rigor of their reviews. I'm wondering if, at least for the first few years of the journal's life, while it is establishing its reputation, we should consider offering sufficient compensation to reviewers to ensure the most highly-regarded minds in each field are engaged, to help the journal acquire a reputation for excellence from the outset.

It could be that the gods of each field will be climbing over each other to get involved from the start, which would be great, but if that's not the case, is compensation a sensible approach? --Anthonyhcole (talk ·  · )  06:08, 10 April 2013 (UTC)
I am not sure. There is a related problem of what to do with gray literature, which is what I would say Wikipedia articles most closely resemble in their current form when considering all types of scholarly publication. There are a lot of organizations which are already compiling the kind of information which would be useful for inclusion into Wikipedia, but because it is layman-targeted, it is not appropriate for publication within a scholarly academic journal. I also think that Wikipedia articles are not appropriate for publication in traditional academic journals because they also are layman-targeted, but this JMIR project is an excellent and novel approach to getting base versions of Wikipedia articles reviewed through standard channels.
Recently  by someone from Eli Lilly and Company's [http://portal.lillycoi.com/ Clinical Open Innovation] lab who had collected a lot of gray literature in the form of government publications on standards of healthcare. These included well-cited reports based on recommendations from various countries' leading medical societies, and were the basis of national health policies, but were not published in traditional academic channels for a variety of reasons including, I think, some of the same reasons why a &quot;Wiki Medical Review&quot; journal has never existed before now.
On my end, I work at Consumer Reports, a United States-based non-profit organization which collects health information from medical professional societies and republishes it so that the general public can understand it. Our work here is a lot like what Wikipedia does now, except Consumer Reports has done this for decades on paper and without publishing it in academic journals. We also are considering whether any of our work should go through the process of formal peer review (it already is &quot;peer reviewed&quot; informally, and so are government publications and a lot of gray literature, but not like an academic journal), get indexing, and then be available for reuse in some way.
I think it is not so wild to assume that other organizations would freely share their guidelines if someone offered them a path to publication, archiving, and indexing of their gray literature. And far from requesting pay to have them offer their work, I think there might even be funding available for such a community effort to share their information. Likewise, I expect that getting reviewers will not be a problem. The surest route I see to making this progress is supporting the JMIR project and talking more about this. Anyone who participates will want to see evidence that there is community support and demand for this. Thoughts?  Blue Rasberry (talk) 17:38, 10 April 2013 (UTC)
We are still slowly working to get the first article, Dengue fever, published in Open Medicine. We will then see how much interested there is from academics. This is simply a carrot. They still need to come to Wikipedia and bring one of our articles to FA status through the usual channels before it is submitted for publication / formal peer review. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 01:34, 11 April 2013 (UTC)
And maybe we should try to get 5, 10, or more carrots like this published before we assess interest. Academics might want to see a track record of success before they perceive a proof of concept—that Wikipedia editing can be a reliable way to generate potential publications. It seems ideal, to my mind, to partner with an existing journal or two or three at this stage. Biosthmors (talk) 01:51, 11 April 2013 (UTC)
Anthony, maybe we should try to get volunteer peer reviews first. Since Wikipedia is a volunteer endeavor, we could appeal to them to volunteer their time towards Wikipedia in that way. Essentially they will have become a contributor, except that their comments might not appear on a talk page or peer review page. Has anyone tried to do that with a medical article, by the way? Biosthmors (talk) 01:56, 11 April 2013 (UTC)

Absolutely; if very highly regarded leaders in their field want to volunteer their time to review our articles, that's the best outcome. 
I emailed the corresponding authors of the main sources for Cancer pain before I put it up for GA review, as a courtesy, giving them the opportunity to correct me if I was misrepresenting them. Several simply thanked me, a couple said they saw no problem with my interpretation, and one worked with me until she was satisfied with the weight and meaning of her section. I guess that's a kind of informal review. (I've asked the lead author of one of the article's core supporting textbooks if he'd like to collaborate on bringing it up to JMIR Wiki Medical Reviews standard.) --Anthonyhcole (talk ·  · )  06:27, 13 April 2013 (UTC)

The JMIR will take care of finding peer reviewers for the articles submitted. What we need is academics. You will notice the anonymous comments from the peer reviews for our first article here and me trying my best to address them [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Dengue_fever#Formal_peer_review_by_Open_Medicine] Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 21:19, 12 April 2013 (UTC)
I was under the impression JMIR Wiki Medical Reviews editorial board would be finding and proposing reviewers. Will the names of the Dengue Fever reviewers be published, James? Am I right in thinking the reviewers of JMIR Wiki Medical Reviews articles will be published? --Anthonyhcole (talk ·  · )  06:27, 13 April 2013 (UTC)
Peer reviewers are generally anonymous as far as I know. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 06:38, 13 April 2013 (UTC)
Yep. But I thought I saw something to the effect that they would be declared, somewhere on the JMIR website. Could be wrong, though. --Anthonyhcole (talk ·  · )  06:48, 13 April 2013 (UTC)
James, is there an article you have in mind to be #2 in line to work on after dengue? Biosthmors (talk) 21:38, 12 April 2013 (UTC)
My hope is that academics will then show up and begin editing, taking article from poor to professional. I do not really need publications myself. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 21:43, 12 April 2013 (UTC)

Copyright problem

I just posted this in the striatum article:

I have found an important copyright problem in striatum. It has been there for almost two years. On March 2011   of text (the biggest addition up to date). In May 2012 some copyright problems were found as seen in his talk page. I do not know if they were solved. I have found further problems since lots of text have been copied from
&quot;The Role of the Dorsal Striatum in Reward and Decision-Making--Bernard W. Balleine, Mauricio R. Delgado, Okihide Hikosaka&quot;. This probably indicates the full contribution by the user is tainted. Since the copyright problems have been here for so long not sure on how to act.

--Garrondo (talk) 13:23, 11 April 2013 (UTC)

Issue has already been fixed by Looie. Nevertheless it is really sad that such a clear copyright infrigement (tons of text completely unwikified) remained in an important article for two years. --Garrondo (talk) 15:49, 11 April 2013 (UTC)

I don't really consider that a very important article.  Basal ganglia is more important.  We have lots of terrible articles about parts of brain structures. Looie496 (talk) 19:21, 12 April 2013 (UTC)

Well... it is not as important as basal ganglia, but much more important than many other brain areas... Nevertheless the fact is that we were unable to fix this for quite a long time, even when the evidence was just in front of us.--Garrondo (talk) 20:19, 12 April 2013 (UTC)
Just found some copyright issues myself here [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Abdominal_aortic_aneurysm&amp;diff=485347249&amp;oldid=475241726] ~2000K of text which had been in place for a year. It is an uphill battle. We need an automated plagiarism detection tool that notifies volunteers right after the edit is made. I know a few people are working on one. IMO the WMF needs to be helping develop this sort of thing as a priority. And this should be done before we encourage more people to edit via the education project or make editing easier via the new WYSIWYG. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 21:13, 12 April 2013 (UTC)

WhatamIdoing (talk) 01:30, 11 April 2013 (UTC)
They are silly templates IMO. I guess we could just remove them from WP:MED articles. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 20:59, 14 April 2013 (UTC)

Alternative Medicine

Do you agree with the alternative medicine articles to be treated differently from mainstream medicine articles? 

Such as adding a section about it in ? Or better yet establishing WikiProject Alt Medicine and establishing it's own version of MEDRS - ALTMEDRS?

Many articles about Alt Med are not informative. That is because few or no reliable secondary sources exists to support the content. That are the facts on the ground. By virtue, anything is generally called Alt Med because not enough research has been conducted. Once enough research has been conducted it's generally no longer Alt Med.

I would give an analogue to Olympic games and Paralympic games. Can we request Paralympic athletes to follow all the regulations and perform similarly to Olympic athletes? Aren't we giving them special considerations? So far there is only one athlete, Pistorius that has managed to perform well and cross from Paralympic to Olympic games.

Is there any editor that is aware of any Alt Med article that has been nominated for GA? Many editors said that under current conditions it's very difficult to maintain Alt Med articles. Many editors have agree that there are many gaps in alt med article's coverage on the Wikipedia. Ryanspir (talk) 15:35, 11 April 2013 (UTC)

If you're talking about making the use of secondary source non mandatory for alt med pages (not sure if this what you mean, since there are no specific details provided as to how you would change the policy), this is not merely making it non MEDRS, its making it non ...basically suggesting that the same content rules that apply to the whole encyclopedia should not apply to alt med topics, is that correct? Lesion (talk) 15:44, 11 April 2013 (UTC)

To clarify, at this topic I do not propose any concrete measures. I'm letting know of the issue and would like to receive possible proposals. Thank you. Ryanspir (talk) 16:00, 11 April 2013 (UTC)
Apologies, I thought from what you said you were proposing the above. FYI, I think there is already a . Lesion (talk) 16:20, 11 April 2013 (UTC)

I'm glad that I have provided a clear clarification. Thanks for the link. Are there also 1. anything like altmedrs; 2. guidelines for writing alt med articles? Ryanspir (talk) 17:06, 12 April 2013 (UTC)

Ryan, yes, Wikipedia has a special guideline covering the sourcing for biomedical claims made in alt-med articles, or for health claims for alt-med interventions made in any article, anywhere.  The guideline is:  .  Zad68 17:15, 12 April 2013 (UTC)

This is just wrong:  —you know, except for the 8,000 review articles published in the last five years that you find at PubMed if you search for alternative medicine, not to mention the hundreds of books on the market.  (Most health-related books are secondary sources.)  There has been so much research done that we've even got reviews of other reviews, like .  There is no shortage of research.  Once you've fully exploited those thousands of sources, then you can come back and complain about a lack of acceptable sources.
This is also wrong:    Something becomes conventional, rather than alternative, when it is accepted, not when it is supported by evidence.  Some AltMed is evidence-based; most is not.  This is not normally because of a lack of research, but because the research proved that it didn't actually work.  Most conventional medicine is evidence-based; some is not.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:40, 12 April 2013 (UTC)

@Ryanspir: Moreover; since prior probability of alt med theories is so very low (See for example homeopathy), and extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence I would agree with you  that there should be an specific guideline for altmed (ALTMEDRS?), which however (from my point of view) should indicate that any proposed claim of evidence regarding altmed treatments should be taken with huge care unless there were simply no possible doubt on its scientific validity and reliability.
 ALTMEDRS in a nutshell:Only clear consensus among the highest quality secondary sources can be used to propose the efficacy of any treatment with a low prior probability of working due to a lack of scientific base. This includes most treatments under the umbrellas of Alternative medicine, CAM or integrative medicine.
--Garrondo (talk) 22:14, 12 April 2013 (UTC)
Support adding this as ALTMEDRS Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 23:37, 12 April 2013 (UTC)
That sounds a bit like &quot;Don't say that anything 'alt med' works, unless you can get the Cochrane Collaboration to triple-swear that it does.&quot;  I don't really believe that we need special rules for alt med.  There have been so many thousands of research papers and reviews published on alt med therapies that we can follow the same standards that we would use for a conventional treatment.  For example, the type of sources you would use to write about the efficacy of antihistamines when you have the common cold are the same type of sources you should use to write about the efficacy of an herbal preparation when you have the common cold.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 00:25, 13 April 2013 (UTC)
This is not special rules for alt med. This is more like the same rules for alt med as for medicine. This is &quot;if a 2006 Cochrane review says it doesn't work do not dig up an 1998 systematic review quoted by a 2008 literature review in an attempt to refute said Cochrane review&quot; which is were we are at now. Or if a review in JAMA says it does not work do not attempt to say it does with a source only available in Chinese.Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 02:48, 13 April 2013 (UTC)
I don't see any need for a separate alt med guideline. We require exactly the same strength of evidence behind any health-related claim, regardless of who's making it. --Anthonyhcole (talk ·  · )  05:50, 13 April 2013 (UTC)
When I wrote the line on Altmedrs I was half in &quot;irony mode&quot; half not. While I do not really think Altmedrs is neccesary as a separate page, I wrote that lines since it is probably a good idea to have in mind that alt med is a domain were it is specially important to describe scientific consensus among secondary sources since it is quite easy to find (short of) secondary low quality sources (either reviews or metanalisis) in crappy journals which are far from being reliable. In this sense it is specially so for meta-analysis since primary research is of so low quality that metaanalyisis of that data is in many cases invalid but widely done to make a point. I do not know if it could be useful to integrate some of this content is MEDRS or is really not necessary.--Garrondo (talk) 19:29, 13 April 2013 (UTC)
I was thinking some clarification on alt med could be added to medrs. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 21:33, 13 April 2013 (UTC)
Fundamentally Support adding some sort of Alt Med clarifying statement to  and liked the direction Garrondo was heading in.  We should then create a  shortcut to it.  Agree with others here that we're not making up special rules for Alt Med by doing thus, just clarifying the application of existing sourcing policy and guideline to this area.  Zad68 04:26, 14 April 2013 (UTC)

Support creation of Altmedrs and propose to move the talk to AltMedicine talk page. That's where it should be decided what have to be included in it.
Propose also an essay/policy that will overview the issues facing editors while writing alt med article. Propose to have some special considerations for alt med, according to a consensus on AltMedicine talk page. Recommend to explicitly explain what do in case no secondary reliable studies can be found, and in cases that also no reliable primary research can be found. Ryanspir (talk) 15:10, 15 April 2013 (UTC)

The requirements for any medicine-related article should be the same.  I strongly oppose any hint of allowing a different set of policies for alt.med.  The only content that could possibly be relevant in an altmed policy would be reiteration of what is required and accepted for a medical article.  Since this would be redundant with what we already have there is no reason to add it.  With regard to:

&quot;Recommend to explicitly explain what do in case no secondary reliable studies can be found, and in cases that also no reliable primary research can be found.&quot; 

it is already clear.  Secondary sources are preferred for medical claims.  Notable primary studies can be used under some circumstances.  If neither primary or secondary sources exist then no comment can be made.Desoto10 (talk) 18:01, 15 April 2013 (UTC)

How about anecdotal reports, amazon reviews and other practical use information? Shouldn't we use them especially in cases that no reliable sources exist? Ryanspir (talk) 14:14, 17 April 2013 (UTC)

Absolutely not, per  and .  If as you say &quot;no reliable sources exist&quot; the solution is not to start using the unreliable source that is customer-provided Amazon reviews.  This idea is a complete non-starter.  Zad68 14:34, 17 April 2013 (UTC)

New article

A reader at help desk mentioned that we should include Period of purple crying in Wikipedia. See  (April 13) for detail. This subject is way out of my expertise though. Thoughts?.--Canoe1967 (talk) 16:07, 14 April 2013 (UTC)
I hope someone writes that one. --Anthonyhcole (talk ·  · )  16:28, 14 April 2013 (UTC)
The basic framework is done in my user space. The video reference has a 'nutshell' description and probably just needs paraphrasing (to avoid copyvio), into a short lead. The external link should have more detail in text. I would probably make a mess if I expand it further.--Canoe1967 (talk) 16:41, 14 April 2013 (UTC)
~35K hits on google, so seems to meet notability. Consider including content + linking the main crying article. Lesion (talk) 17:17, 14 April 2013 (UTC)
 ... And [http://www.tripdatabase.com/search?criteria=%22Period%20of%20purple%20crying%22 ~4 hits on Trip Database], of which zero are secondary. The popular press and social media seem to understand the phrase, but medical literature seems only to mention it in association with &quot;shaken baby syndrome&quot;. I'm not very impressed by the credentials of the sources that Google turns up either. Do any of the sources from Google &quot;have a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy&quot;?  and  look like the best bets for establishing notability, but all of the primary sources need to be used with care. --RexxS (talk) 18:22, 14 April 2013 (UTC)

The Dr. in the Youtube reference I added to the draft article is claimed to be a world expert. He claims that he is asked about it often.

It is a campaign to raise awareness about child abuse. A mention there might be sufficient.Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 20:47, 14 April 2013 (UTC)
I am wondering if it could be an actual syndrome(?) that could cause child abuse similar to Posttraumatic stress disorder causing issues with soldiers recently. I don't know if it has been researched or codified at all. It may be a recent label on a very old condition?--Canoe1967 (talk) 21:03, 14 April 2013 (UTC)
This book states &quot;A national campaign, “The Period of Purple Crying,” is underway to educate parents about the normalcy of crying in infants and the dangers of shaking an infant. (See the website of the National Center on Shaken Baby Syndrome)&quot;[http://books.google.ca/books?id=ACj2XeQYUX8C&amp;pg=PA103] which is similar to many other books.

It is also a registered trademark, diseases and syndromes are not.[http://www.dontshake.org/sbs.php?topNavID=4] Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 21:13, 14 April 2013 (UTC)

As I said in the OP, I am out of my fields here. Could we have it as a redirect to &quot;shaken baby syndrome&quot; with a description of the campaign and the definition of the acronym? With the trademark I don't think we are violating copyright just documenting it. When readers wish to know what it refers to then at least they can find it by the common name. Does 'Two all-beef patties...' redirect to Mcdonald's?Two all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun. An article on the awareness campaign may work as well. --Canoe1967 (talk) 21:24, 14 April 2013 (UTC)
Sure that would be fine with the campaign discussed in the section on &quot;society and culture&quot; Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 01:32, 15 April 2013 (UTC)

Healthcare quality

We have a category,  but no head article on Healthcare quality. Do you think one should be written? and (b), what should be the criteria for inclusion of an article in the  category? --Obi-Wan Kenobi (talk) 17:37, 14 April 2013 (UTC)
It seems like one could definitely be written. If it was well written, I'd like for it to exist and that would help address your second question. Biosthmors (talk) 23:46, 14 April 2013 (UTC)

DualPortGYN Surgical Technique

Could members of this project please have a look at DualPortGYN Surgical Technique? I can't find any coverage of the technique from reliable, secondary sources online, just lots of company press releases. None of the secondary references cited so far mention DualPortGyn, though all talk about dual port laparoscopy, which certainly seems to be notable. But how is DualPortGyn  enough for an encyclopedia article? Thanks, Captain Conundrum (talk) 10:13, 12 April 2013 (UTC)
Yes agree. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 16:04, 12 April 2013 (UTC)
Also agree that we should probably make a dual port laparoscopy article with much of this material moved there first, then split off in the future if the material warrants. Yobol (talk) 13:43, 17 April 2013 (UTC)
Well it's just been proposed for deletion by another editor, so there's a week left to move it (or copy to a draft subpage). If someone with a reasonable knowledge of laparoscopy can point out the good content, I'm happy to help dig for more references etc. Thanks, Captain Conundrum (talk) 08:39, 20 April 2013 (UTC)
One possible template to work from for dual-port laparoscopy is the existing article single-port laparoscopy. Captain Conundrum (talk) 17:46, 21 April 2013 (UTC)

Hi everybody, I need your help and advice. I created an article about a world known lymph specialist Waldemar Olszewski. I added to my article his main publications on the lymphatic system which are very important for his scientific profile. There is a person, his name is Captain Screebo, who deleted already twice all the publications fro my article. He says that my article is too long and if I don't stop undoing his addition (on my article!!!) he will report me and block my account. What can I do about it? Is it ok if I add those publications? They all have got PubMed index number and are important. The person who deleted all of them has no conections to medicine and has no idea what is important or not!!!
Please give me an answer.
Thanks!

If you take a look at the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Waldemar_Olszewski&amp;action=history edit history] for that article, you'll see that it wasn't only Capt. Screebo, but also at least three other editors that trimmed the publications list or reverted your re-additions. It would be a good idea to discuss your proposed additions at the article's talk page, since there doesn't seem to be a  for adding them. Thanks, Captain Conundrum (talk) 15:15, 19 April 2013 (UTC)
Also Anna, please read .  As surprising and frustrating as it might be, once you create it, the article is no longer your article, it is Wikipedia's.  The thing to do about it is to read Wikipedia's policies regarding biographies of living persons , understand that you do not own any of the work you submit to Wikipedia, and learn about working within Wikipedia's collaborative developing environment.

Lots of page protection

Very popular health articles including obesity, Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and many others are under page protection - perhaps perpetual page protection - which restricts unregistered users from editing them. I am not sure how page protection works, but some of these pages are showing a lock and some do not, and right now all of them are locked. Could I get some thoughts from other members of this board about the risks of leaving these unlocked? I believe that when it is practical, pages should be left unlocked, and that it is generally a bad idea to intend to leave articles locked perpetually. Thoughts from others? How much of a burden is there from unregistered users making bad edits?  Blue Rasberry (talk) 14:02, 21 April 2013 (UTC)
IMO most articles of good or featured status should be semi protected if they receive a fairly high degree of poor quality edits. This is especially true when they are of top importance and are some of our most viewed medical articles as the above are. None registered users can add comments to the talk page to suggest changes. I find pending changes to be a little clunky. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 14:28, 21 April 2013 (UTC)
100% agree with Doc on this. Zad68 14:34, 21 April 2013 (UTC)
In addition we typically need to protect many pages deal with sexually transmitted illnesses and psychiatric conditions as they get a great deal of vandalism. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 14:40, 21 April 2013 (UTC)
While we're on the subject, I propose that we give the gynecomastia article more protection. This is another page that gets a good amount of vandalism as well. Thoughts? TylerDurden8823 (talk) 17:47, 21 April 2013 (UTC)
 I have to disagree. Wikipedia can only flourish if we encourage new editors, and we know that making as many articles as possible editable by IPs has been a successful strategy since Wikipedia began. I know it's irritating to revert the piece of vandalism for the 100th time, but that's the price we pay for attracting new editors. May I suggest that for many of the articles that are presently , we could consider changing to ? That would keep vandalism out of view, but still allow IP editors to submit good-faith edits. We know there are certain types of article that PC doesn't work for (vary highly vandalised articles is one example), but is there any reason why we couldn't try changing some of those popular semi-protected articles to PC as an experiment and see if it helps? --RexxS (talk) 19:28, 21 April 2013 (UTC)
Agree with sticking to WP guidance (i.e. use PP as briefly and reluctantly as possible) to avoid frustrating new users and appearing to own articles. While we have differing levels of new content contribution and involvement (e.g. mop wielding), I suspect that one of the things most WPMED members share is an active and diverse watchlist.  -- Scray (talk) 21:36, 21 April 2013 (UTC)

I support James here. I'd say that edits to these articles are &gt;90% vandalism or highly misinformed edits. Health articles get a disproportionate amount of vandalism because of their visibility and troll magnetism. I'd much rather be doing editing rather than reverting/correcting total rubbish. JFW | T@lk 21:58, 21 April 2013 (UTC)
This is exactly the point.  Also, I question whether in general there really is &quot;lots&quot; of page protection.  If I remember right there are tens of thousands of articles under  scope.  How many are actually under protection?  Is that number really at a higher ratio than for other projects, especially if you focus on the articles with the highest visibility, at GA or FA quality, and with the longest history of vandalism or poor quality edits?  I also question the idea that semi-protecting the most visible and most contentious articles really goes against the principle of attracting new editors.  IPs that make poor-quality (even if well-intentioned) edits at contentious articles with an invested editor base can get shot down hard, especially if it is (as described) the 100th time that kind of bad edit has been made.  At these particular articles, the more likely thing that would happen to that IP would be to get driven away after a bad experience.  These articles are the last ones you'd want a new IP editing for the first time.  Also, if the principle is not just to attract new editors but to retain existing experienced editors, protecting those articles helps that for the reasons as Jfdwolff describes.  Zad68 22:31, 21 April 2013 (UTC)

We have two kinds of problems:  One is malicious (&quot;John has AIDS!&quot;) and mostly affects sex-related articles.  The other is the garden-variety vandalism that any popular page attracts (it might be interesting to look at the protection status for the 100 or 500 most popular pages).
I like RexxS's suggestion for using pending changes, but I have a suggestion:  why not run a randomized, controlled trial on reducing protection?  Why not pick out a dozen or two medicine-related pages under long-term semi-protection, and randomize half to PC and half to SEMI?  If dropping to PC works (e.g., does not result in lots of edits, because PC doesn't function so well on high-volume pages), then we'll do more of it.  If it doesn't, then we can rest easy with our choice of SEMI.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 00:20, 22 April 2013 (UTC)
I would bet that less than 1% of our 26,000 medical articles are semi protected. I consider how we have used it right now &quot;briefly and reluctantly&quot;. While I support pending changes in principle it is clunky and slow right now. We have it on breast cancer and it makes the article a pain to edit. It is even slower reverting vandalism with it.
We need to have a balance between everyone editing and making sure people have some commitment before editing. The first article I ever tried to edit was one that was semi protected. I made suggestions on the talk page and edited a less viewed article before returning and being able to bring this one to GA.
I have recently cut back my watchlist as I much prefer to write content than deal with vandalism. Most people can still edit most of Wikipedia most of the time. Many poor quality edits / vandalism never gets reverted (just check out some of these edis [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Colin/Introduction_to_Psychology,_2013 here]) Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 00:29, 22 April 2013 (UTC)
Bundle branch block

Hi, I am reviewing  for AfC. My first instinct was that it should be merged to the article Bundle branch blocks. I find however that the following exist as seperate articles: Heart block, First degree AV block, Second degree AV block, Third degree AV block, Right bundle branch block, Left bundle branch block, Left anterior fascicular block, Left posterior fascicular block, Bifascicular block, Trifascicular block. Is this OK? Or would it not be more practical and give the reader more of an overview to merge all these articles under the title heart blocks or bundle branch blocks? At least in the case of Tachycardia-dependent bundle branch block, it is in my view better to treat the topic toghether with the Bradycardia dependent blocks under the title &quot;rate dependent bundle branch blocks&quot;. But I think all the above named articles are better merged. What do I do?Ochiwar (talk) 18:21, 15 April 2013 (UTC)
 While I know nothing about this subject, GScholar and GBook searches show the term to be an important part of multiple studies, so the article could conceivably  pass an AfD test. The article under review discusses both bradycardia and tachycardia dependent versions and mentions rate-dependent bundle branch blocks multiple times. Based on my very superficial understanding, I agree that &quot;rate-dependent bundle branch block&quot; may be the better topic. As someone who has eagerly waited for the results of an AfC review in the past, I wouldn't recommend holding up this article for the potentially considerable discussion it would take to make the proposed 12-way merge to Bundle branch block. --Mark viking (talk) 18:44, 15 April 2013 (UTC)

Tachycardia-dependent bundle branch block is just a rare event in patients who have BBB. Usually is due to reciprocating rythm. There is no reason to exist an individual page. Is better to put it as a section of BBB and of tachycardia articles. Doc Elisa ✉ 19:13, 15 April 2013 (UTC)

I have accepted the article and taged it proposing a merger to Bundle branch block. I have also taged the following articles, proposing a merger with Bundle branch block i.e Right bundle branch block, Left bundle branch block, Left anterior fascicular block, Left posterior fascicular block, Bifascicular block, Trifascicular block. If there is consencus on this, I would prepare a tentative merged article containing all of the above for approval here.Ochiwar (talk) 16:35, 16 April 2013 (UTC)
Without having gone through all the literature, I would suspect that left bundle branch block and right bundle branch block both could easily have enough material for their own articles, but I suspect every other article in that list could probably be merged into one. Yobol (talk) 13:42, 17 April 2013 (UTC)

These shouldn't be merged. These are very broad subjects, and the different types of blocks are identified and managed in different ways. A merged article would be unwieldy. --Arcadian (talk) 13:30, 22 April 2013 (UTC)

Improper use of case studies and possible conflict of interest

I've removed everything added by  and  that hadn't already been removed, due to major concerns about their use of case studies and promotion of particular authors. Hope this is OK. Graham87 09:14, 22 April 2013 (UTC)

See Kazem's [//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Graham87&amp;diff=551626792&amp;oldid=551626371 response on my talk page], noting that he was unfamiliar with our guidelines for medical articles. We're now talking about this through email. As far as I'm concerned, this is resolved now, unless somebody strongly objects to my actions here. Graham87 15:04, 22 April 2013 (UTC)
Thanks for doing this.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 15:38, 22 April 2013 (UTC)

First of all I would like to sincerely thank Graham for kindly providing me with the guidelines of Wikipedia on how to write and revise the medical articles. As he mentioned I was not familiar with the guidelines for medical articles. However, there are some issues that I would like to discuss with you: 
What I added to medical pages was all based on scientific articles published in peer-reviewed journals. My assumption was that if each member of the scientific community adds the results of his or her studies to Wikipedia, it will help to spread the knowledge. Moreover, I added similar content to several pages because those fields are related to each other.  I completely agree with Graham that systematic reviews and meta-analyses are the most reliable sources of information in the medical field. However, in order to be able to do systematic reviews and meta-analyses,  you should have a minimum number of studies, usually more than 10. Most of the medical articles that I revised in Wikipedia were about rare diseases like pemphigus vulgaris, uremic pruritus or  malnutrition in hemodialysis patients. Currently there are no systematic reviews and meta-analyses for these diseases specifically related to the field that I discussed. It's also noteworthy to mention that most of the studies that I referred to were done for the first time and therefore were novel.  Therefore, I briefly mentioned the findings of those studies in the articles. As I mentioned previously, my goal was to share the new medical knowledge in layman's term in those Wikipedia articles. Please let me know what we should do in this situation that we don't have systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Should we withhold the information from the public until systematic reviews and meta-analyses may become available few years later?
 
Many thanks for your consideration.
Kazem.fa (talk) 17:01, 22 April 2013 (UTC)

Take a look at , our guideline in choosing sources (you may already have). While secondary sources are preferred over primary articles professional text books are considered adequate secondary sources. I am sure that you would be able to find some info to such rare diseases in specific professional text books. If not, in most cases it means that actually content may not be notable enough to be included in an encyclopedia, altough (very) occasionally primary articles may be used (with extreme care). Regarding the &quot;we could each add our results&quot;: wikipedia is not a repository of primary articles but an encyclopedia. Since there are hundreds of thousands of investigations each year the only way we have to weight them in in order to create meaningful content and not simply a list of articles (for that we already have pubmed) is to use secondary sources that indicate which results are important and which are not.
--Garrondo (talk) 19:53, 22 April 2013 (UTC)
 Just as an example, Trip Database shows [http://www.tripdatabase.com/search?criteria=uremic%20pruritus 125 articles matching &quot;uremic pruritus&quot;] of which 12 are identified as secondary. There were however 35 controlled trials and 64 e-textbooks, so how would we decide which evidence to include unless we relied on secondary sources? I should also mention that &quot;pemphigus vulgaris&quot; has a [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006263.pub2/abstract;jsessionid=4D169C3809A743C62BABB25B85F758A9.d03t03 2009 Cochrane review] and a British Association of Dermatologists guideline for management, so why would we want to try to analyse the 450 primary results on Trip ourselves? --RexxS (talk) 00:50, 23 April 2013 (UTC)

Garrondo and RexxS, many thanks for your clarification. I generally agree with what you have said. However, most guidelines and meta-analyses focus on management and treatment of diseases; i.e. other issues like pathophysiology of diseases are not usually included in these reports. For example the 2 secondary sources you have introduced about pemphigus focus on treatment of this disease. They don't discuss its pathophyisology.  Moreover, it usually takes at least 2-3 years for new information to be cited in medical textbooks. Therefore, the textbooks are not usually up to date. That's why websites like uptodate.com have been developed that renew their articles every few months. However, I certainly agree with you that it's better to use secondary sources as references when they are available in order to reduce bias of selection. Thank you again. Kazem.fa (talk) 01:04, 23 April 2013 (UTC)
Literature reviews are usually good for pathophysiology and it allows new ideas to stand a bit of test of time. Uptodate.com does not really discuss pathophys either. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 03:49, 23 April 2013 (UTC)

Elevating Alpins Method entry from low to mid priority

I'd like to request your permission to elevate the importance of this article (Alpins method of astigmatism analysis) from low to mid priority (as Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Medicine appears to have made the original assignment). The article fits the definition for mid priority: &quot;Normal priority for article improvement. A good article would be interesting or useful to many readers. Subject is notable within its particular specialty. This category includes most medical conditions, tests, approved drugs, medical subspecialties, well-known anatomy, and common signs and symptoms.&quot;

The Alpins Method is notable in its particular specialties: refractive, cataract, and corneal surgery. Groups of ophthalmologists devote themselves solely to these specific individual areas, such that they refer to themselves as a refractive surgeon, a cataract surgeon, or a corneal surgeon. Each of these areas also have societies and journals devoted specifically to the respective areas. The American Academy of Ophthalmology acknowledges these subspecialty areas (http://www.aao.org/careers/envision/subspecialties.cfm).

The Alpins Method is of clear importance to these specialists, and is used daily in their professional lives by many.

Thank you.
Kcroes (talk) 21:50, 22 April 2013 (UTC)

 because if it isn't an improvement, you shouldn't have made the revert on those grounds either. --RexxS (talk) 20:24, 9 May 2013 (UTC)
Other problems are it appears to duplicate content in the main virus topics box (tho' that is linking articles, not templates); and pure text doesn't look right in the context -- it looks ragged and unfinished. One solution might be to simply delete it altogether (which is what I did in the , where I first encountered the problem). I'm not sure the current version is doing much more than providing a multi-coloured base bar. Espresso Addict (talk) 23:26, 9 May 2013 (UTC)
I'm not suggesting deleting them: the links to the other templates are helpful. But &quot;cutn&quot; as an abbreviation for skin conditions is just as utterly absurd and unhelpful to the readers as all the rest. These aren't even dictionary abbreviations; someone just made them up without any precedent or context. What's wrong with the way I had it? &quot;Ragged and unfinished&quot; in what way? I suggest that ragged and unfinished is several dozen steps up from utterly incomprehensible. EJM86 (talk) 01:45, 10 May 2013 (UTC)

Tables summarizing section content

We have a table summarizing the first sections content in our Alzheimer's disease article as seen here [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease#Characteristics]. The content is already dealt with in the text. Wondering what peoples though are regarding doing this more widely? Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 17:43, 1 May 2013 (UTC)
My impression is that it should be a case-by-case decision. We want to be efficient and not redundant, but tables can help people digest prose and understand important concepts. Biosthmors (talk) 11:12, 2 May 2013 (UTC)
In the case with Alzheimer's disease, I really like. It simplifies and sums up what is equal to one - one and a half pages of text in the article. It is helpful, if I just want a quick look and would otherwise skim the text or if I read the text and needed to sum up some of the information I just read.
I agree with Biosthmors that it is a case-by-case decision. But in this case it works. There are of course the same pitfalls as there are with pictures: The table must be able to be understood without reading the text and the other way around. JakobSteenberg (talk) 11:57, 2 May 2013 (UTC)
I have made some other tables. I am considering making more. In some cases the tables summarize article content and in other cases they share new content. Right now I am experimenting slowly to see what gets a response. In many cases I am not even making complete tables; I am just sharing what information I have and leaving empty spaces in hopes that someone else would share more. 
*Statin#Adverse_effects
*Pap_test#Indications
*Drugs_for_acid-related_disorders#Availability_of_drugs
*Anti-diabetic_medication#Comparison
*Headache#Diagnosis_approach
Could I have feedback on these?  Blue Rasberry (talk) 15:31, 2 May 2013 (UTC)
Regarding the Alzheimer's table, the only thing I dislike about it is that it is hard to see anything that links together the entries on a given row.  I think tables can be very helpful to readers, but they ought not to be used unless the information has both column structure and row structure.  Without row structure, you really just have a set of lists with an artificial structure imposed on them.  (Note: It isn't clear to me whether there actually is a row relationship that I've merely been able to decipher.) Looie496 (talk) 15:48, 2 May 2013 (UTC)
I also felt the same problem, so I changed it. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alzheimer%27s_disease&amp;oldid=553217412#Characteristics This new format] does not convey any parallel structure by rows, I hope, which [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alzheimer%27s_disease&amp;oldid=553073303#Characteristics this old format] did. The source content is [http://www.consumerreports.org/health/resources/pdf/best-buy-drugs/AlzheimersFINAL.pdf here on page 5]. Thoughts?  Blue Rasberry (talk) 16:36, 2 May 2013 (UTC)



I think you have an  problem with your current designs.  If you're going to provide a summary (which is not a bad idea for very long sections), then why not use a plain old list?  Why not say:

quote box|
;Effects of aging on memory not diagnosable as Alzheimer's disease
* forgetting things occasionally
* misplacing items sometimes
* sometimes failing to remember names of things
;Early stage Alzheimer's
* minor loss of short-term memory
* misplacing items and then forgetting the memory lapse
* deeper difficulty remembering recently learned information


This list is simpler to read, quicker to make, doesn't require you to have the same number of items for each category, and can be easily edited by anyone without knowing how to keep the table intact.

And if you really want to have a table floating on the right, then why not use a simple one?  Why not this:




This kind of table doesn't have those checkerboard squares that make everyone wonder whether the items in a given row are supposed to be related to each other (which is almost certainly an ACCESS violation), it's a bit quicker to make, and it will be simpler to maintain.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:05, 4 May 2013 (UTC)
Agreed, thanks a lot. I have no idea how the idea to do it the hard way got into my head. I will implement this later this week, but until then, I will pause and see if there is other feedback.
Let me reiterate all of this - WhatamIdoing is saying that the table code on the back end is unnecessarily confusing, which it is, and that there is a less complicated way of doing things. I agree to reformat tables such that people who want to edit them can do so without understanding the templates I used.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 15:36, 6 May 2013 (UTC)
I think a straight-up-and-down stack-of-boxes or list format is, from the reader's POV, quicker and easier to decipher than the grid/box format. Of the two, I think a simple bullet list is the more readable - and probably is more  for those using text-to-voice screen readers. --Anthonyhcole (talk ·  · )  03:41, 9 May 2013 (UTC)

VisualEditor is coming

The  is designed to let people edit without needing to learn wikitext syntax.  The articles will look (nearly) the same in the new edit &quot;window&quot; as when you read them (aka WYSIWYG), and changes will show up as you type them, very much like writing a document in a modern word processor.  The devs currently expect to deploy the VisualEditor as the new site-wide default editing system in early July 2013.  

About 2,000 editors have tried out this early test version so far, and feedback overall has been positive.  Right now, the VisualEditor is available only to registered users who opt-in, and it's a bit slow and limited in features.  You can do all the basic things like writing or changing sentences, creating or changing section headings, and editing simple bulleted lists.  It currently can't either add or remove templates (like fact tags), ref tags, images, categories, or tables (and it will not be turned on for new users until common reference styles and citation templates are supported).  These more complex features are being worked on, and the code will be updated as things are worked out.  Also, right now you can only use it for articles and user pages.  When it's deployed in July, the old editor will still be available and, in fact, the old edit window will be the only option for talk pages (I believe that  (aka Echo) is ultimately supposed to deal with talk pages).

The developers are asking editors like you to join the alpha testing for the VisualEditor.  Please go to  and tick the box at the end of the page, where it says &quot;Enable VisualEditor (only in the main namespace and the User namespace)&quot;.  Save the preferences, and then try fixing a few typos or copyediting a few articles by using the new &quot;Edit&quot; tab instead of the section [Edit] buttons or the old editing window (which will still be present and still work for you, but which will be renamed &quot;Edit source&quot;).  Fix a typo or make some changes, and then click the 'save and review' button (at the top of the page).  See what works and what doesn't.  We really need people who will try this out on 10 or 15 pages and then leave a note  about their experiences, especially if something mission-critical isn't working and doesn't seem to be on anyone's radar.

Also, if any of you are involved in template maintenance or documentation about how to edit pages, the VisualEditor will require some extra attention.  The devs want to incorporate things like citation templates directly into the editor, which means that they need to know what information goes in which fields.  Obviously, the screenshots and instructions for basic editing will need to be completely updated.  The old edit window is not going away, so help pages will likely need to cover both the old and the new.  

If you have questions and can't find a better place to ask them, then please feel free to leave a message on my user talk page, and perhaps together we'll be able to figure it out.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 00:59, 7 May 2013 (UTC)
Correction:  Talk pages are being replaced by , not by Notifications/Echo.  This may happen even sooner than the VisualEditor.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 14:30, 7 May 2013 (UTC)

We currently have a new editor, , editing a number of articles on the &quot;antipsychotic drugs are evil&quot; theme.  The edits are very far from neutral, and certainly don't represent mainstream opinion.  The articles concerned so far are psychosis, antipsychotic, thought disorder, and frontal lobe disorder.  The editor has also been doing numerous logged-out edits, from IP addresses that geolocate to northern Spain.  There are [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AI_dream_of_horses&amp;diff=554076110&amp;oldid=554075887 strong indications] of a battleground attitude, including accusing another editor of &quot;terrorism&quot; for reverting edits.

Wiki Project Med Foundation Newsletter, Ok to send?

Hi docs and folks, 

We have our first report from the early months of building  as a global non-profit focused on medical outreach.  We have 70+ editors signed up as interested members on our .  I'd like to also message the English WikiProject Medicine participants, the signed-up members.  

There's an easy link to remove oneself from future deliveries.

Objections, thoughts?

Here's the full newsletter, but the messaged version I would sent out is just a short summary with a link to the full version.


Cheers, Ocaasi t | 20:13, 8 May 2013 (UTC)
Just to be cear I'm wondering if anyone has any objections to sending out The Stethoscope to Wikiproject Medicine members?  I think it's relevant and reasonable to do at least once, so if I don't hear back from anyone today I'm going to send it out.  Thanks! Ocaasi t | 17:22, 9 May 2013 (UTC)
I'm active in the group and it seems prudent to wait until the organization defines how to become a member. This might be our only chance to do outreach this way, and I'd rather us have a clear path to official membership when we do. Biosthmors (talk) 18:19, 9 May 2013 (UTC)

Whether to send it is first up to you and the rest of the board for the non-profit.  When/if you all have agreed that you want to do this, then it's next up to us to decide whether it violates any policies here at the English Wikipedia.  IMO a single &quot;mailing&quot; is not a policy violation on our end, so long as what's sent clearly distinguishes between &quot;us&quot; (WPMED here at en.wp) and &quot;you&quot; (WPMEDF, a separate non-profit organization with some similar aims and some overlapping membership).
I don't believe we've cleaned out our membership list for a long time, and you might find it useful to do that before trying to use it.  We probably have a lot of inactive members listed.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 19:14, 9 May 2013 (UTC)

Opinions requested about facial pain pages

Wouldn't mind other opinions on some issues surrounding a few pages:
* . &quot;Atypical trigeminal neuralgia&quot; I do not feel is universally accepted as a Trigeminal neuralgia subtype. I think that it can only exist as a category if the definition of atypical facial pain is narrowed. Some sources seem to treat atypical trigeminal neuralgia as a synonym of atypical facial pain. I feel the content from the current atypical trigeminal neuralgia page should be merged into either the main trigeminal neuralgia page. Or into atypical facial pain.
* Furthermore, I feel that the Trigeminal neuralgia page should follow international classifications like the International Headache Society (IHS) or the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP).
* Similarly the neuralgia page.
* The IHS and the IASP now prefer to use the term &quot;Persistent Idiopathic Facial Pain&quot; (which I've currently created as a redirect) instead of atypical facial pain. The ICD-10 still uses atypical facial pain, and I have one textbook that states it is still in common use by clinicians despite the naming controversy. Pubmed yields many more &quot;Atypical facial pain&quot; hits.
Opinions much appreciated. Lesion (talk) 20:27, 9 May 2013 (UTC)

NIH

A couple of us are spending a week at the NIH at the end of this month.  Will be meeting with a number of groups there regarding how we can better work together to get high quality health content out to the world. A few ideas:
#More images under an open license
#Creating an automatic list of high quality reviews on the talk page to help people with sourcing
#A Wikipedian in Residence at the NIH (it sounds like they are interested, are their any potential applicants among us?)
Do people have other suggestions? Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 23:07, 9 May 2013 (UTC)
Please ask them to require [http://www.badscience.net/category/trial-registers/ trial registration] as a condition for indexing journals in MEDLINE. ([http://www.ted.com/talks/ben_goldacre_battling_bad_science.html This video has more detail.]) If a medical trial wasn't registered with its protocol in advance, it shouldn't be published; if it was registered then the results should be available whether the outcome was positive or negative. This lack is the number one source of pharma industry abuse today. If the NIH threatened to pull MEDLINE indexing for journals that don't include this as a publication requirement, then it would be fixed overnight. Please be bold about this! EJM86 (talk) 01:55, 10 May 2013 (UTC)
Agree completely. Will bring this up. But this of course only applies to experimental human trials not to review articles or other types of literature. Maybe we could ask if they could tag article to indicate this. Another useful peice of info is if the primary end points have been switched. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 05:03, 10 May 2013 (UTC)
The quality of review articles on health topics is highly variable, and the NIH could address this as part of their public information mandate. As a reader, I see many primary publications that have a better-quality summary in the introduction than is found in the most recent review on the same topic. As a referee, I am often amazed by the low quality of the other referees' critique(s) of review articles (in fairness, they're a lot of work to review; doing so in detail is laborious because their scope is broad). The usual 2-3 referees may not be enough, and the lack of crowd-sourcing (post-publication) means that errors don't get fixed (the PLoS journals address this in a limited way by allowing comments). NIH-funded investigators have little incentive to publish review articles - they are given little or no credit by NIH study sections when assessing the productivity of an investigator, because reviews involve no experimentation. If referees of review articles were named (after the review process is complete, perhaps), that might make them feel more responsible for the content, and limit their temptation simply to suggest citation of their own publications (then 3 referees, plus the associate editor, might be enough). In summary: NIH needs to provide incentives to NIH-funded investigators (intramural and extramural) to publish and referee high-quality reviews; if they could encourage journals to handle corrections (e.g. through refereed edits, or some other mechanism) that would be even better.  -- Scray (talk) 20:05, 10 May 2013 (UTC)
The problem in rating a review is what the reader wants to know - it could be 5 lines of a Physiol-Rev or the XVIIth Receptor compilation in Pharm-rev, or how to eradicate h.pylori. Or the reader could be someone who heard the word electrospun and is in need of an introduction. A systematic review is somewhat complete like a 200pp HTA but unreadable by principle. The current PT qualifier has many options, but in the Reviews, it does not differentiate (e.g. systematic vs. narrative) but has some complementary options(Interactive Tutorial (207), Introductory Journal Article (24800), Lectures (5685), Meta-Analysis (38400), Practice Guideline (17500), Video-Audio Media (4200), Webcasts (277) Editorial (328k)- and Review (1759857))  as displayed [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3827/table/pubmedhelp.T42/?report=objectonly here], which should be included in the official pubmed filter if one clicks &quot;review&quot;. A bigger problem is to access 'the rest' - NOT review, e.g. to look at reviews from 2000 to current and all publications from 2012 to current. As I have immediately understood, the Review filter is exactly review[PT], there is no composite filter as proposed, and 'review' gives 2.1M, 'review' AND the filter only 1.7M; review[TI] is 241k, review[TI] and Filter only 135k, obviously these authors and journals think that these items are reviews... . Quite a lot of arguments showing the errors which are inherent in the cryptic and insufficient filters.
Personally, I have my own medline application and it is by definition the best available, but users would trust the original. It is technically impossible to give a fair humanized rating system and a correct assignment of a review to its subclass i.e syst or narr, and such a task would lead to worse roc for the users who do not understand such a two-dimensional rating scale - rating field. Some roots of humanity lie in the equality of man, and I would not trust 1 or 5 star ratings - at least 3 or 4 would not differentiate at all. Knowledge would get lost for the researcher if PubMed would enable a hieroglyphic pseudointelligent rating system like google. Every collection of evidence has its own and equal worth and nobody should differentiate between 4/5 and the rest if the result should remain scientific valid - not basically informing.
Last opinion is the fully consent on the idea that a good paper has a good introduction and a well-done compilation of the essential papers as the first references given. Should one set a PT 'review-like introduction' for exceptional introductions ? This is a way to proceed, but how to rate 4.000 papers a day ?
Should one encourage people to write reviews, if you are excluded from science, you are not from fiction, or to let their brain generate really new output - I would say people should communicate their current opinion if they urge to do so, but they should not be urged to do so to rate-up in the funding rounds. This would lead to an explosion of hyperfractionated reviews, not 7200 G-protein-coupled receptors, each on its own...

If you're responding to my comment just above in this section, then it might help if I clarify that my comments were about the process of refereeing a manuscript (submitted as a review of a topic) prior to publication. I just can't be sure what you're saying, but I think you're talking about post-publication assessment; we seem to be talking about two very different things. Also, I did not mean to hijack Doc James' request regarding his visit to NIH - I was just suggesting that review articles could be a topic of discussion. -- Scray (talk) 00:34, 12 May 2013 (UTC)

Edit request at

I am doing the GA review of the article.  The editor requesting it  looks like a school student doing the edit for an assignment.  It looks like some form of that edit got into the article already.  Also, the sourcing looks terrible - something from 1934 was used to support something talking about &quot;modern cultures&quot;.

Since links are not correct I cannot find discussions named, but it seems indeed that mandragua is back.

I'm not 100% certain that this is Mandragua, although it very well could be.  Mandragua's sockpuppets and IPs made exactly the same edits as Mandragua did.  Booklaunch is editing the same articles on similar themes, but with different content.  Unfortunately meatpuppetry is a real possibility for this topic.  Anyway, I'll keep an eye on the articles, and file an SPI request if the situation clarifies further. Looie496 (talk) 15:42, 12 May 2013 (UTC)
The benefits of antipsychotics are controversial with the WHO reporting better outcomes for schizophrenics in developing than developed countries. Long term antipsychotic use was 16% verses more than 60% if I remember correctly.[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18019048?dopt=Abstract] Life expectancy is also 12 to 15 years less in those with schizophrenia which is primarily attributed to the side effects of the &quot;new atypicals&quot; including obesity and metabolic syndrome [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19700006?dopt=Abstract].
We know they have a small benefit in the elderly and a number of harms including shortened life expectancy / stroke and EPS symptoms.[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22784311] They are thus not recommended treatments in this group. Two of them are the 5th and 6th most prescibed medications by sales in the USA [http://www.webmd.com/news/20110420/the-10-most-prescribed-drugs] so there of course is a strong financial incentive to show them in a good light. The history is interested as the original antipsychotics were referred to as &quot;pharmaceutical lobotomies&quot; in a positive manner in the 1950s when these were still believed to &quot;work&quot; [http://books.google.ca/books?id=1VL5Xmaws7sC&amp;q=%22pharmaceutical+lobotomy%22&amp;dq=%22pharmaceutical+lobotomy%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8MSPUafdEoe7iwKc_IHoBg&amp;redir_esc=y]. High dose antipsychotics were also used to &quot;torture&quot; political dissidents in the USSR. [http://books.google.ca/books?id=UXu-aO3bIx0C&amp;pg=PA74]. I will have a look... Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 16:43, 12 May 2013 (UTC)
It is widely recognized that antipsychotic drugs, especially the older ones such as chlorpromazine, have terribly serious problems, including very nasty, unpleasant, and long-lasting or even permanent side effects.  The only excuse for using such nasty drugs is that not using them may have consequences that are even worse.  Our articles already cover the negative effects, and there could probably be even more coverage of them.  But basic policies such as NPOV and MEDRS still apply. Looie496 (talk) 17:11, 12 May 2013 (UTC)
Agree completely and there are excellent references to improve these pages. Do we have a clear ref for &quot;The only excuse for using such nasty drugs is that not using them may have consequences that are even worse.&quot; Of course when one says &quot;may&quot; it equally means &quot;may not&quot; but the sentence does not work as well. This 2010 Cochrane review on respirodone is a little more sedate in its conclusions [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20091611]. And here is the review stating that the difference between atypicals and typicals is unknown [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22893011?dopt=Abstract] Doc James (talk · · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 17:21, 12 May 2013 (UTC) 
By &quot;consequences that are even worse&quot;, I mean things like walking down the middle of the road at night with no clothes on, as a schizophrenic friend of mine once did during a psychotic break.  Whatever else they do, antipsychotic drugs acutely suppress psychotic behaviors of that sort.  They allowed a huge reduction in the numbers of people who were long-term institutionalized.  There is some controversy about whether it might be better to use drugs less heavy-handedly in hopes that the condition will eventually remit, but there is no serious dispute about the acute effect of these drugs in suppressing psychotic behaviors. Looie496 (talk) 18:07, 12 May 2013 (UTC)
The WHO multi country study however gives pause regarding the long term benefits of antipsychotic treatment. And the comparison of risperidone with placebo by Cochrane looking at short term benefits also gives pause. To be a bit of a devils advocate lobotomies were also affect in decreasing these behaviors and tentative evidence supports antipsychotic use decreasing brain matter.[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20085668] This statement &quot;They allowed a huge reduction in the numbers of people who were long-term institutionalized&quot; is also controversial. Having spent a few months treating people with schizophrenia in Vancouver most of them were in &quot;supportive housing&quot; and far from independent.

Dealing with the specific edits in question.

I still happened to have that article on my Watchlist from Mandragua.  Booklaunch may have a point, but the most recent edits didn't look like article development accurately reflect the best sourcing.  I have removed the recent changes while discussion continues on the Talk page.  Surely you do not have to worry about the request on Doc's User Talk.  The best thing to do is just ignore anything not related to article content and let's use the Talk page and see what consensus develops.  Zad68 13:36, 13 May 2013 (UTC)
 I was not worried of getting blocked, but since nobody expressed any opinion the feeling this editor had of being a victim of a personal persecution by me was being reinforced. Moreover I do not really have an opinion on his POV on drugs since it is outside my area of expertise, so in this sense, any direction the edits take is ok for me if MEDRS and NPOV are followed (Which was not the case right now).

Videos from Science Museum, London

Hi All

I'm the Wikimedian in Residence at the Natural History Museum and Science Museum in London for the next few months, today the Science Museum released 3 videos about pain under an open license as a test to see how open knowledge projects can help them in their educational aims. I think they're really nice and hopefully will be useful.



--Mrjohncummings (talk) 22:19, 9 May 2013 (UTC)
Some of the issues I have with videos is 1) the content is not easily verifiable 2) they are not easily edited by others. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 22:58, 9 May 2013 (UTC)

I think this is the sort of thing that you would add as an image in an article, or link under
External links
.  I looked at the first bit of the first one, , and it's an interview with a patient about his personal experience with phantom limb pain.  It's not the sort of thing that needs to be verified or edited; it's not an encyclopedia article.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 04:55, 10 May 2013 (UTC)
I watched them all and like them all. James is correct - videos are not easily verifiable and the content is not easily edited by others, but I also agree with WhatamIdoing in that further verification is not necessary in this case. Since the videos are coming from the Science Museum, London and since that is a respected curator of science media, I trust the source as  and I am satisfied with these meeting  requirements of being single accounts of health conditions each co-presented an expert and a patient. I do not think that these claim to represent all perspectives any more than any image in any article on a health condition represents all cases, but videos like these are an excellent attempt to present the subject matter of Wikipedia articles in a way that compliments the existing text.
I added these videos to the following articles:
*Phantom_limb#Phantom_limb_pain
*Twilight anesthesia
*Congenital insensitivity to pain
I can think of no rule to determine when videos are good or bad, but it is my opinion that these videos are ideal for inclusion into Wikipedia. They are high-quality, short length, and exemplify concepts which would be difficult to to communicate in any other way.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 16:26, 10 May 2013 (UTC)

Neuroaid

 Looks like mostly primary sources, mostly very weak and in some cases misquoted. Will have time too look in detail in 18 hours or so.Ochiwar (talk) 19:04, 13 May 2013 (UTC)
The article has been cleaned up quite a bit by Garrondo, Biosthmors and myself. I am still a bit unsatisfied about the use and quality of references in the article and would like to make use of this case to learn a bit more about the use of medrefs on wikipedia. A specific example is [http://stroke.ahajournals.org/content/40/3/859 this ref] used in the article. This is basically the only study that ascribes any positive effects from the use of Neuroaid. The problems I have with this reference are firstly that it is original research and primary source (as are most if not all other refs in the article). Secondly (and more importantly) there is an obvious conflict of interest inherent in the study. Several authors of the study are shareholders and employees of Moleac which produces the stuff. At the time of the study David Picard was the CEO of that company and other authors where paid consultants (examples [http://www.neuroaid.com/about-moleac/173.html Marie Bousser and Christopher Chen]) and/or shareholders. To quote the study itself under the section &quot;Disclosures&quot; (near the very end of the PDF) 
I had tried to introduce some of these facts in [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuroaid&amp;oldid=555119835 this edit] of the article, but it was modified by Garrondo. In its present state the article does not adequately inform the reader of these important facts and associations concerning this study. Garrondo requires secondary sources for me to include such a warning in the text of the article but the information is contained in the reference itself (see quote above). To my understanding, it is rather the reference/study itself which is original research/primary source and not the self evidenced (and referenced) facts I added to try and put the claims into perspective for the average reader. My question here is that since the inherent conflict of interest is specifically declared in the study itself (see section Disclosure) would it not be pertinent for us to at least hint at this (to the understanding of the average reader) while using this study as a medref?

My opinion, although it could be discussed: there are many articles where a potential COI is stated, but it is only &quot;potential&quot;, by itself it does not invalidate the article conclussions. If we say something in the line of &quot;the article is not valid because there is a COI we are drawing our own conclussions and therefore it is a case of mild original research unless somebody else (a secondary source) has said that that COI is indeed probably invalidating the article. At most we could say something like: authors declared a potential conflict of interest since XXX. In this sense we are not drawing a conclussion since we are not saying that the article is not valid, but just quoting the content of the primary source. Nevertheless my personal preference is to not indicate the COI unless it is stated in a secondary source and explain succintly the conclusssions of the primary source using a secondary high quality source if possible, but if not using with GREAAAAAAT CARE the primary source. In this case I tried to explain with care the primary ref, using as help the commentary in the pakistany journal (secondary, but probably not peer-reviewed) you added, and eliminated your probably a bit POV edit on the COI. Opinions?--Garrondo (talk) 19:42, 15 May 2013 (UTC)

 To my mind using such a ref with great care would include boldly mentioning a potential conflict of interest, for example in the way you suggested above. My intention is not to invalidate the reference but to let the reader know not to take the study at face value but to have a closer look before making conclusions as to the value of the study. The reader should be able to put the source into perspective. Your suggestion above: &quot;authors declared a potential conflict of interest since XXX&quot; or something along those line would do the job nicely. Ochiwar (talk) 04:24, 16 May 2013 (UTC)

I would rather leave it without mentioning it per reasons above, but lets see if anybody else gives their opinion. I am not sure if there is any written policy in this sense.--Garrondo (talk) 09:07, 16 May 2013 (UTC)

I avoid saying that a published source is &quot;original research&quot;, because it's easy to confuse people here.  &quot;Original research&quot; in the  sense is something that Wikipedia editors must never do, but that our sources are freely permitted to engage in.
I think that the &quot;debunking&quot; effort was too much.  We can't say that the neutrality of the study (another thing that sources aren't required to do) &quot;may be questioned&quot;; either it was, in which case you should cite it, or it wasn't, in which case we don't mention that.  We could add a very brief mention of the authors (&quot;In a paper published by several of Neuroaid's employees...&quot; or whatever the facts support).
In general, I think that whole section needs to be revised and substantially shortened.  Have a look at , especially this item:

Keep in mind, too, that average people (i.e., not you) usually assume that the inclusion of methodology details like sample size means that we're trying to say that this is a good, trustworthy, fully scientific study.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:29, 16 May 2013 (UTC)

 Thanks for the links especially the one on original research as it has helped me with the terminology and explains the distinction between original research and primary source. Yes I agree that the debunking attempt was a bit plump, but my fear is exactly that which you address in your last sentence: average people will think that we are saying that this is a good trustworthy, fully scientific and unbiased article, that is &quot;sanctioned by wikipedia&quot; unless we somehow make our reservations clear. To that effect, I have added a list of ingredients (and made them readable to the average person)to the article which I think puts the whole product into perspective very nicely (at least to the discerning reader). The list had been published by Moleac only in latin. I think I understand why because going through the list in english brings up associations of Snake oil in me. Anybody who knows what is in the stuff would probably look twice at any studies or references, I hope. Thanks Garrondo and WhatamIdoing for the explanations.Ochiwar (talk) 17:45, 16 May 2013 (UTC)

Wow. The current version lists &quot;horn of an endangered antelope species&quot; as an ingredient in this stuff. Thanks for your contributions. Biosthmors (talk) 18:51, 16 May 2013 (UTC)

Preventive mastectomy article/topic

Simply alerting editors of this project who are unaware of this new article about surgery, considering that it was very likely created in response to Angelina Jolie's preventive double mastectomy (the article was created yesterday), the topic is getting a lot of attention right now, and there may be significant improvements editors of this project may want to make to the article.

Medline plus

This has probably been discussed before, so apologies for not paying attention, but is medline plus an acceptable source? Especially when it seems that high quality sources (e.g. Cochrane) contradict some of the content...sometimes it seems that the task of writing a patient summary on medline plus has been outsourced to another organization, although usually these sound like mainstream, reliable ones. Lesion (talk) 13:43, 17 May 2013 (UTC)

All sources are reliable for something.  A free, mid-quality website (like Medline plus or WebMD) can be useful to many readers, especially the ones (the majority) who are unable to access or even understand technical papers.
That said, if a mid-quality source is contradicted by most high-quality sources, then you should go with a better source.  If it's just one high-quality source, then it's possible that the expert opinion is divided, or that there is new information in the field, and then you have to figure out DUE weight.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:39, 17 May 2013 (UTC)
I typically never use it as there are better sources. Is it acceptable, yes but barely. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 12:50, 18 May 2013 (UTC)
The problem- if it is a problem- is that it is already used several times before I started editing the page. I think in this instance I will try to find better sources and see if I can remove it entirely as a source. Lesion (talk) 18:28, 18 May 2013 (UTC)

New pages

TedderBot is back!  See  to find new articles that might be medicine-related.  Also,  is filling up again, if anyone wants to spend a while removing anatomy articles and assessing the rest.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 17:34, 17 May 2013 (UTC)
Hi. I am currently rating many anatomy articles on the importance scale and will gladly remove the WPMED banner from proper articles when I come across it, but... Is there a clear cut definition on when and when not an article should have both banners? I tried to look into this earlier, but came up empty. I know that the discussion have been brought up many times before but it seems to me that a clear consensus never been reached (so I abandoned the idea again). If such a consensus exists I will gladly remove unnecessary WPMED banners, when I come across them and maybe more important they (or some sort of guidelines) can be posted on  to reduce double work in the future. Does an article about an anatomy subject fall under WPMED if:

* If it has one or a couple of sentence about pathology or clinical relevance (Posterior tibial artery)?
* It has a clinical relevance section (Middle meningeal artery)?
* It has some sort of developmental biology or physiology section (Round ligament of liver)?

If someone could sort out these three examples for me, I could remove a lot (or few depending on the answers) of WPMED banners for you (I am pretty much just lurking on this side of the fence). Kind regards JakobSteenberg (talk) 12:38, 18 May 2013 (UTC)
No anatomy articles fall under WPMED IMO. Some of us here also edit anatomy articles. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 12:46, 18 May 2013 (UTC)
Okay, that was easy (if everybody else feels this way). If none of three examples above falls under WPMED, then for my purpose it settles it (I got 951 anatomy stubs left to rate at the moment, so I can pretty much remove the banner when I come across it). But just to be clear; even articles about organs e.g. liver and heart are correctly labeled at the moment (only WPAN)? JakobSteenberg (talk) 13:07, 18 May 2013 (UTC)
I have not seen those debates, and would like to hear more from Doc James or others regarding the &quot;none&quot; position.  You (JS) have provided some great examples. The clinical content in those is potentially (and in some cases, currently) substantial. Do we advocate deletion (and prevention) of such content, or leave curating that clinical content by WP:AN editors?  -- Scray (talk) 13:18, 18 May 2013 (UTC)
No we do not advocate deletion of any content and we are all free to be WP:AN editors and curate these pages. We need to draw a line somewhere. Lead of course has lots of medical content in it but it is not part of WPMED (Lead poisoning is). Breast would not be part of WPMED but breast cancer is. It keeps us a little more disease / clinical focused. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 13:25, 18 May 2013 (UTC)
That makes sense, thanks.  Agree.  -- Scray (talk) 13:57, 18 May 2013 (UTC)

I would very likely keep the leg artery, I might or might not keep the brain artery (the longer I think about it, the less likely it seems), and I would reject the ligament.  Generally I keep both tags when the current article has more than a sentence or two about diseases, especially if the material isn't  obvious, but developmental biology or physiology generally doesn't justify a WPMED tag to me.  On pages that are purely physiology, we're taking them largely because no WikiProject Physiology exists, and since WPAN is also taking these pages, then it isn't necessary for us to double-tag these partly-physio pages.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 15:27, 18 May 2013 (UTC)
What is your rationale for wanting posterior tibial artery double tagged and not middle meningeal artery? JakobSteenberg (talk) 17:21, 18 May 2013 (UTC)

How to find the pulse is an obviously clinical/medical action, and &quot;stuff healthcare professionals do every day&quot; is within our scope.  
The second contains some obvious material (head injuries sometimes damage blood vessels in the brain:  a good way to , but not really news to anyone) and some information about research (the artery is easy to study in century-old dry specimens), which is not so much &quot;medical-ish&quot; as &quot;research-y&quot;.  This could go either way; I would probably remove it if I ran across it, but I wouldn't insist on it being removed.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:12, 19 May 2013 (UTC)

Rads Wiki images at commons

I have found the following [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Images_from_RadsWiki category at commons]: Images from RadsWiki, consisting in radiological data.
Images in this category are taken from radswiki.net. They are published under the following license:

The copyright holder of this file allows anyone to use it for any purpose, provided that the radswiki.net is properly attributed. Derivative work is permitted. Commercial use is NOT permitted.

Following this license, in which commercial use is not permitted, they should be eliminated from commons. I have gone to radswiki.net and it seems they are part now of radiopedia.org, in which content is not free. Anybody knows something about this? Some of these images are surely included in articles from the project, and they may have to be eliminated. Unless somebody knows or proposes anything I will contact commons for a mass deletion.

--Garrondo (talk) 21:51, 18 May 2013 (UTC)

OK: I found that this had already been discussed at commons: there was a license change, so images previous to that license change were kept. In that case something should be made about the license text. --Garrondo (talk) 21:57, 18 May 2013 (UTC)
The person who runs rads wiki is also a Wikipedia. He has agree to allow us to use images on a case by case basis under a more open license. If there remains issues send me a note.

I am not really sure, it seems that does uploaded to commons after 2009. With those before 2009 they were kept, but the license thing should be changed: now they say that the cannot be used commercially, but it seems that before 2009 the licence permitted commercial use, and they were kept because of that. In such case license should state so. Nevertheless this is only what I have understood from a deletion discussion.--Garrondo (talk) 10:17, 19 May 2013 (UTC)

Primary or secondary?

* http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11915652
* http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12569969

Could someone please tell me if these sources are primary or secondary? much appreciated, Lesion (talk) 12:23, 19 May 2013 (UTC)
An important consideration when making such a determination is, &quot;for what claim?&quot;  That said, from the abstract of the Shankland reference I have the impression (with phrases like, &quot;As a result of this study, it appears ...&quot;) that it is a primary report, so it's unlikely to be a secondary source for much of anything (it's also from a very specialized journal of low impact). Schwartz &amp; Freund appears is a review article about the use of botulinum toxin for treating facial pain, but it's published in a supplement with the note: &quot;Publication of this supplement was supported by an unrestricted educational grant from Elan Pharmaceuticals, Inc&quot;. Elan Pharmaceuticals markets &quot;Myobloc&quot; (botulinum toxin). I would be cautious in using that.  -- Scray (talk) 13:25, 19 May 2013 (UTC)
So even if these are secondary, they may be secondary sources which seek to advance a particular view, and I think I read somewhere that these kind of sources are bad =D. I'm really looking for a reason to remove these sources from the article rather than wanting to add them, and you make good arguments for their removal. I can get better sources for the content they support anyway, thanks. Lesion (talk) 13:51, 19 May 2013 (UTC)
The second one is a perfectly good source unless there is some specific reason to think it doesn't reflect the mainstream of opinion.  That doesn't mean you can't find a better one, of course. Looie496 (talk) 17:00, 19 May 2013 (UTC)
Doesn't the possible conflict of interest highlighted above call the validity of the information into question? It was supporting at least some of the second paragraph of this section: Bruxism#Botox. There are Cochrane reviews, and few other reviews to hand... Lesion (talk) 17:56, 19 May 2013 (UTC)

The first is primary; the second is secondary.  It's perfectly fine for a source (primary, secondary, or tertiary) to advance a view.  You may not advance your view.  Sources may freely do so.  In fact, some of the best sources are ones that advance a view, e.g., Cochrane Collaboration papers that are &quot;advancing a view&quot; that the subject they covered either do, or don't, have enough evidence to support a particular action.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:07, 19 May 2013 (UTC)
 - yes, you are correct. Here's what I read/misread &quot;Synthesis of published material that advances a position is a form of original research and should be avoided in Wikipedia articles&quot; the advances a position refers to the action of an editor, e.g. cherry picking references that support their own view, and not to the sources themselves. I might actually read these policies fully at some point, but life just seems too short. Trial and error is not so bad either =D. Lesion (talk) 18:18, 19 May 2013 (UTC)
There are many great sources out there with a estatement of COI, and many more that even if they do not estate it it is out there (which is probably quite worse). I would say that unless 1it -contradicts another better source, 2-A secondary source states that this COI may be relevant in this case; the COI does not invalidate the source. When in doubt search for a better source (more recent and/or better journal) and see what they say on the issue, and if there is a contradiction follow both the better source and your judgement.--Garrondo (talk) 19:17, 19 May 2013 (UTC)

Vagina article

So we just got through discussing the vagina in the #Human vaginal size article section above. I'm here about the vagina again because the Vagina article, a little earlier this hour, was [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vagina&amp;curid=32476&amp;diff=555799737&amp;oldid=554947119 significantly expanded] with information about &quot;the vaginal ecosystem.&quot; That information was first proposed as an article for creation (see ), and then it was suggested that it be merged into the Vagina article. I need this project's help to determine whether or not some of this information should be removed because some of it is based on old sources that are far behind 's Use up-to-date evidence criteria and because a lot of it is based on primary sources. I'll go ahead and do some heading and  cleanup for the addition in the meantime. I first thought that the editor who added the information was a student, because, as a lot of you know, we've been getting significant expansions of sexual, medical, psychological and physiological topics from students (often times problematic expansions....ranging from problematic in a minor way to problematic in a big way or huge way), but now I'm not sure.

A link from the talk page to evidence

Pubmed allows one to sort literature into &quot;review article&quot; and &quot;last 5 years&quot; and &quot;free full text&quot;. I am wondering what people think about adding something like this to the article talk pages to help our fellow editors find high quality sources? I have created a mockup for the talk page of gout.

There are a few issues that need to be address before possible rollout. While we can currently get a url that links to a specific top, we need to have the url also specify the filters. I will speak to the NIH about this. Would also need a bot. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 19:42, 11 May 2013 (UTC)
Great idea!  I think we can refine the links.  Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't think the link at the end of line 2 assures the reader they'll get free full text (isn't it just a Pubmed search), nor does this provide much assurance of high-quality journals.  Some options to consider including searching:
#[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=gout Pubmed Central for the same &quot;gout&quot; term]: guarantees free full text results
#[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=gout+AND+review%5Bpt%5D Pubmed for &quot;gout AND review[pt]&quot;]: review articles on gout (not all full-text)
#[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=gout+AND+review%5Bti%5D Pubmed Central for &quot;gout AND review[ti]&quot;]: full-text reviews (imprecise; I don't know whether PMC supports the Publication Type ([pt]) field)
#[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=gout+AND+review%5Bpt%5D+AND+jsubsetaim Pubmed for &quot;gout AND review[pt] AND jsubsetaim&quot;]: this last flag limits the search to the [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/aim.html Abridged Index Medicus], providing a limited but high-quality subset of clinically-oriented journals
Of course, any of these can be limited to a range of dates as desired (in Pubmed, could use 'AND &quot;last 5 year&quot;[dp]' - rather than using a specific range of years that will go stale quickly). The kernel of the idea is great.  I think we should leverage PMC (with its full-text guarantee) and flags like &quot;review[pt]&quot; (need this for PMC) and &quot;jsubsetaim&quot; (would be great to use this in PMC, and if there were other lists that included a broader swath of high-quality biomedical journals). -- Scray (talk) 23:58, 11 May 2013 (UTC)

I know of two projects doing this in other contexts. One is , which seeks to connect any given Wikipedia article to library resources. This proposal has the attention of Wikidata and WMF folks but still does not have community support. Another project is , wherein external links to videos from a Khan Academy project are given special preference in Wikipedia articles. There are things that I like and dislike about both of these proposals. This proposal to have special talk page linking on health articles seems simpler to execute than those and a good idea presuming that people would find and use them, but I am not sure that users would.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 12:53, 12 May 2013 (UTC)
This is more for editor (I am not sure if that is what you mean by users). It is NOT to go in the article space but only on the talk page.

 I'm getting a problem with the PubMed results, James. I looked at the box at  and cross-checked the PubMed results with the Trip results. I wasn't expecting to get identical results, but I was expecting something similar.
 PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Croup+AND+%28Review[ptyp]+AND+free+full+text[sb]+AND+%22last+5+years%22[PDat]%29&amp;cmd=DetailsSearch) shows me 3 results that look very good, but Trip finds [http://www.tripdatabase.com/search?categoryid=1%2C11%2C16%2C18%2C10%2C9%2C4&amp;criteria=Croup 70 secondary sources], which on inspection shows (as an example) a 2012 Cochrane review on &quot;Glucocorticoids for croup (Review)&quot; which I can see as [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001955.pub3/pdf full text]. I agree that it's confined to one aspect of croup, but it seems too good to miss - in fact it's used in the article. I suppose there's a tension between getting a very precise set of hits from PubMed, which are going to be first choice, and a broader set of results from Trip that you have to do some work on if you want to expand the article. It certainly shows to me that Trip is a very useful alternative to PubMed and deserves its place in your template. Good work, by the way! --RexxS (talk) 01:15, 17 May 2013 (UTC)
Cochrane is not free full text in my area of the world. The TRIP results also show none free secondary sources. SO yes some overlap but we should have both. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 01:55, 17 May 2013 (UTC)
Progress
I have managed to figure out how to link directly to free full text review articles from the last 5 years automatically based on the name of the article in question. Examples are here  and . I still need to fiddle with it to figure out how to get it to work for two work articles. Do people support this idea in principle? Would it be reasonable to apply it to all medicine disease related article talk pages / medication talk pages? If so we could look at a bot to put it there.

Yes agree. TRIP of course is both and I am about to adjust pubmed to also link to all reviews. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 03:53, 17 May 2013 (UTC)
It's not a bias to look at free reviews first. It's about understanding who reads and contributes to Wikipedia and trying to start from a more accepting place. Just because someone came up with an acronym for a provocative hypothesis doesn't make non-free reviews better. Generally for any established topic I have trouble finding non-free reviews which don't cover what free reviews already do. II | (t - ) 04:22, 17 May 2013 (UTC)
 First of all: Greaaaaaaaaaaaaat work. Second: While I would say that most commonly non-free sources are more useful than free ones, I think that in this case it would be more useful to leave in the template only the free ones. Most of us who have access to non-free sources are also used to finding them so we do not really neeed the help of the template. However this template could be a great way to engage new editors who do not have neither the knowleadage nor the access on how to get to secondary sources. Best idea is to have the two options as I see that has been done in at least some articles such as ADHD. --Garrondo (talk) 06:56, 17 May 2013 (UTC)
The abstracts of non free sources such as Cochrane reviews however can still be useful. Thus the three options. Hope to eventually combine  work on getting access to paid sources via  into the template. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 08:46, 17 May 2013 (UTC)

--Ossip Groth (talk) 20:29, 19 May 2013 (UTC)
If I might make a suggestion: I would tweak the wording a tad to suggest that those two links would be &quot;a good place to start looking for MEDRS compliant sourcing&quot; or some similar wording.  While it is not explicitly stated, a new editor might see this notice and assume that any and all search results from either database automatically meets , which is not necessarily true (especially with the increasing number of non-MEDLINE indexed &quot;open access&quot; journals in PubMed now through PMC, and the usual fringe topics published in foreign nursing journals).  Just my 2 cents. Yobol (talk) 23:44, 19 May 2013 (UTC)
Yes good suggestion. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 00:49, 20 May 2013 (UTC)

 Hi, this is nice! Some suggestions:
 * Move the template to the top of the others (I did this for ).  I think if you want to have any hope of it getting noticed/used, this is important.
 * Have some kind of bold header line in the template box, like &quot;Finding sources for this article&quot;, in order that it might catch people's eyes.  Maybe it would be enough to bold &quot;Ideal sources&quot; in the beginning, but I'd vote for something a little more.
 * Unlink &quot;review articles&quot; -- anybody reading this template will know what a review article is.
 I'm trying to figure out if there's a way of linking directly to PMC search results just for review articles ... I should know this, but the closest filter I could find, &quot;research and review articles&quot;[Filter], is not the same. 
 Klortho (talk) 03:10, 20 May 2013 (UTC)
Agree moving up looks good. The picture makes it fairly bold and have added the additional bolding as you suggest. Most people are not clear the difference between review article and peer reviewed thus the link. How would a like to PMC be different than the current link to all free reviews on pubmed? Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 03:24, 20 May 2013 (UTC)
 Hmm ... you had asked about linking to PMC above, so I set about trying to figure out how to do it.  But now I see that what you have here, linking to PubMed, is better, because it lists free full text articles whether they're in PMC or available free from the publisher.  Cheers!

Folk Medicine

Can we add something like a &quot;Folk Medicine&quot; section to medicine articles?

The purpose of this section is to include all treatments that lack sufficient evidence to prove or disprove their suitability to affect the condition in question.

Why have this section?
- There are treatments that are popular in certain segments of the population and may not have been subject to randomized controlled trials.  Therefore, we can't say that the treatments are equal to placebo as there have been no tests.  It is possible that these treatments have been in use for thousands of years and may be effective.
- This can also be a place to put experimental treatments, so maybe &quot;Folk&quot; is not the best term.  
- This will also help control a treatment being added, then removed, then re-add and a long discussion on he talk page about secondary sources and despite the treatment being &quot;common knowledge&quot; it isn't proven, so eventually removed.  Then after some amount of time, the process will start again with another well intentioned person adding the obvious oversight of a popular treatment being ignored by Wikipedia.

What do you think?  — Preceding  comment added by Sthubbar (talk • ) 17:34, 20 May 2013 (UTC) 

The recommended headers include &quot;History&quot; - (the history of the science), and a &quot;Society and culture&quot; sections. Personally I would tend to put folk medicine/traditional remedies etc into the latter, although it could be argued that if such treatments were common historically then they could also be included in the History section. These are suggested headers in the MOS, not mandatory, so I say if you think a particular article would benefit with such a section then go ahead. Also remember you can always use subsections...e.g.


Society and culture


asdf


Folk medicine


asdfasdf 

Lesion (talk) 18:11, 20 May 2013 (UTC)
But nevertheless we still would need adequate (secondary) sources for such sections, although in such cases we do not need to prove that they were effective, but merely that they were used.--Garrondo (talk) 18:40, 20 May 2013 (UTC)
I notice that someone added a lot of references to ayurvedic medicine treatments on several medical pages I've worked on, and these tended to be placed in the society and culture sections already ... mainly I think because they are still in use and therefore not historical. Lesion (talk) 19:23, 20 May 2013 (UTC)

You could also include ineffective remedies under
Treatment
, like &quot;aspirin is not used for children with fevers due to Reyes&quot; or &quot;dextromethorphan is commonly taken for coughs, but it doesn't really work worth beans&quot;.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 01:42, 21 May 2013 (UTC)

Lesion, thanks for the suggestions.  I think it would then fit best under the &quot;Treatment&quot; or &quot;Management&quot; sections and add a sub-section header of something like &quot;Other Treatments&quot;.
WhatamIdoing, I'm more thinking about treatments that haven't been subject to modern testing and may still have been used for many years, like Ayureveda or Traditional Chinese Medicine, so it's not really possible to say if they do or don't work according to WP:Medicine guidelines.
Garrondo, your requirement of &quot;But nevertheless we still would need adequate (secondary) sources for such sections&quot; violates the whole purpose of the section.  The whole idea is that there are many treatments that may have been used for thousands of years, or may just be some crack pot idea that someone came up with yesterday.  There are no secondary sources, though these treatments may or may not work.  I'm OK with providing a link to some external website, tough not requireing secondary sources.  Does that make sense?Sthubbar (talk) 07:49, 21 May 2013 (UTC)
No, it does not IMO: We would need somebody reliable saying they are used, independently of their efficacy, and certainly an external random website (for example of the person selling the product) would not be valid if not reliable by itself. With this I do not mean that such secondary sources should be MEDRS compliant or peer reviewed (although they would be perfect if found), but they have to be reliable for the kind of statement we are making. The kind of sources I am talking about and would be valid:
*First I would look for reviews on medical journals: For example there are many reviews on traditional or alternative medicines and they might indicate if such products are used. These would be the best possible sources.
*Second I would look for non-MEDRS-compliant high quality secondary sources: I am thinking for example on newspapers reports where they indicate that a treatment is used (it does not matter if they say that it is usefull or useless)
*Thirdly, I would also accept in this case (although these could be debateable) a primary peer-reviewed article which has its main focus on the use of such products: I am thinking for example of articles where they have asked people if they use this product, how often, etc.

Moreover: I would not include them under the section treatments unless it is made absolutely clear that there is no indication of usefulness in reliable sources. A subsection called &quot;other treatments&quot; is IMO misleading since it implies they are valid. --Garrondo (talk) 09:48, 21 May 2013 (UTC)

Garrondo, how about this:


Other Treatments


The following treatments lack reliable evidence to prove their efficacy, safety and/or lack of either.

?  — Preceding  comment added by Sthubbar (talk • ) 12:04, 21 May 2013 (UTC) 

It is a possibility, but negative statements pose a bit of a problem for MEDRS: they are a medical claim (that such treatments are not effective or have not been studied) that should be sourced, and therefore there would be a need to find reliable (secondary) sources indicating that they are either not effective or have not been well studied. If there are no secondary sources on their efficacy, or their use is more &quot;folk&quot; than &quot;medicine&quot; (such as leaving a key at night outside to be later put in the eye for eye problems- traditional Spanish remedy) it might be wiser to directly include it in the society and culture section instead of treatments.
Nevertheless I would again strain that the most important thing for such additions is to find high quality sources on the importance of their use in folk medicine. WP should not include a list of all possible remedies that any crank has proposed for a disease, but only the notable ones (even if completely crazy), and such notability would be indicated by the existance of secondary sources.
--Garrondo (talk) 15:02, 21 May 2013 (UTC)
It all comes down to sourcing. If you want to talk about historical treatments that goes in the history section. If you want to talk about current use of ineffective treatments were the notability is simply how much they are used than that would go in society and culture. Some may also go in the treatment section under alt med. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 15:36, 21 May 2013 (UTC)

I haven't yet seen a folk remedy for which secondary sources couldn't be found.  Keep in mind that &quot;secondary&quot; is not a weird way of spelling &quot;peer-reviewed, scientifically sound review article&quot;.  The Great Big Book of Grandma's Favorite Folk Remedies on the self-help shelf at the bookstore is a secondary source.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 15:46, 21 May 2013 (UTC)

Human vaginal size article

Note: As mentioned below at the same time as this small piece of text, I should have initially thought of this topic outside of anatomy in a strict sense/medical sense when seeing this article. Flyer22 (talk) 22:43, 13 May 2013 (UTC)

So this article [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Human_vaginal_size&amp;diff=554940667&amp;oldid=554940484 was created] late the previous hour [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Human_penis_size&amp;diff=554939576&amp;oldid=553533954 in response] to the Human penis size article, though the vagina is not homologous to the penis. Since the editor participates at , and was at that project right before creating this article, a feminist aspect might also have something to do with the creation of this article; I know that some of our feminist editors, and non-feminist editors as well, feel that Wikipedia lacks balance between the sexes/genders. And while I understand the need to create such an article in response to the Human penis size article, the Human vaginal size article clearly cannot be expanded beyond a stub and therefore I see no reason that this topic should not be directed to the Vagina article and covered there instead. The editor has already taken some information from there, using [http://web.archive.org/web/20090320170917/http://www.engenderhealth.org/res/onc/sexuality/response/pg2.html this] and [http://www.engenderhealth.org/res/onc/sexuality/response/pg2.html this] poor source (the latter source is also a dead link), and added it to the Human vaginal size article. Once I get around to significantly fixing up the Vagina article, which is long overdue, I would likely redirect the Human vaginal size article there. But I am obviously open to hearing comments on this matter. I'll alert the creator of this article, and , to this discussion. Since this WikiProject (WP:MED) is significantly more likely to leave a few or more replies on this matter than WP:ANATOMY is because WP:ANATOMY is significantly less active, I've decided to have this discussion here. Flyer22 (talk) 20:45, 13 May 2013 (UTC)

Thanks for offering to improve it, and bringing it to notice here; a poor stub is all I could produce, and it could be greatly improved. I think the relevant factor in interlinking the two is not that the structures are homologous (they're not), but that one is (typically) inserted into the other as part of their key biological function. It could easily be expanded, if there's data for the changes in size due to sexual intercourse (there's at least one in vivo MRI study of the mechanics of human sexual intercourse, although that had N=1), and childbirth (for which there is abundant data.) I'm not sure about merging it completely into the main article, though, unless you can find a way to pare down all the figures to something that flows smoothly as text. Perhaps this is a case for the  template? -- The Anome (talk) 20:52, 13 May 2013 (UTC)

As always it comes down to sourcing.  If there's lots of good sourcing for human penis size but nothing or next to nothing for human vaginal size then we should have a fully-developed article about the one and not the other... real-world differences in how humans think about or study male things vs. female things will be reflected in Wikipedia content in the same way, it isn't good or bad or biased, Wikipedia content just reflects the sources.  (I think I'm preaching to the choir here.)  If doing the redirect becomes an issue, bring it to the attention of ... Zad68 21:00, 13 May 2013 (UTC)

(As an off-topic aside, yes, it's really quite interesting to compare the extreme interest in one to the relative disinterest in the other -- it certainly suggests that the primary interest in the size of the penis isn't its ability to fit the vagina -- which actually works just fine in all but the most extreme cases -- but male insecurity and competition.) -- The Anome (talk) 21:44, 13 May 2013 (UTC)

I agree, Zad. Thanks for weighing in.

The Anome, wow, how did you type a response so fast? Considering that you posted here before [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:The_Anome&amp;diff=554949083&amp;oldid=554948769 I posted on your talk page] about this topic, were you already alerted to this discussion, perhaps by the new notification system? Regarding the article, I still don't think it can be expanded beyond a stub, certainly not much beyond a stub. It wouldn't be an issue at all to have it as a subsection, or as a few subsections, in the Vagina article. I'm more for not creating a  article unless needed. But I'll wait and see what more editors state on this matter, if more comment on it. And the &quot;main&quot; template wouldn't be needed unless there was a section in the Vagina article specifically about the size of the vagina; we would use the main template to point readers to the Human vaginal size article for in-depth information on the topic. But again, there is not a lot of information out there on this topic, and the Human vaginal size article is a stub, so not having the Human vaginal size article merged with the Vagina article means that the Vagina article would have a very small section on the topic just to point readers to the main article on it; and per , &quot;[s]hort paragraphs and single sentences generally do not warrant their own subheading.&quot; Flyer22 (talk) 21:16, 13 May 2013 (UTC)

I'm happy to defer to the subject experts here about both content and layout. Yes, it was the new notification system. I'm surprised to find the new system, which I initially disliked and found gimmicky, is actually more useful than the old one. -- The Anome (talk) 21:36, 13 May 2013 (UTC)

 I have no expertise here, but two points. First, it seems that human vaginal size is a notable topic. Searching for &quot;vaginal size&quot; in GScholar nets 248 hits. Glancing at the first few papers suggests that there are a number of relevant issues surrounding this topic, both medical and non-medical: vaginal dilation at birth and during sex, physical anthropology studies of different human ethnic groups, size issues surrounding sex-change surgery, sociological and psychological perceptions of size, vaginal tightening surgeries, etc. There are nearly 800 hits in GBooks. I wouldn't think that lack of material would be a problem. Second, this article is being actively developed by an experienced editor. It is already beyond a stub, IMO. Why the rush to merge? --Mark viking (talk) 21:43, 13 May 2013 (UTC)
Not a rush to merge; after all, I did bring the topic here for discussion. It's that I have doubt, as expressed above, that the topic should have its own article. Besides that, it doesn't seem that The Anome was aware that this topic, aside from social aspects, is going to require -compliant sources. But you have touched on aspects that now make me think that the article should exist. As for the article's size, it has been divided into sections, but it's still not beyond a stub. I am waiting to see how it develops, and may expand it as well. But discussing whether or not it should exist is productive. Flyer22 (talk) 22:12, 13 May 2013 (UTC)

 I apologize for the assertive tone of my question; I intended no challenge. I agree that it was good to bring the topic here for discussion and look forward to seeing what others think. Thanks, --Mark viking (talk) 22:18, 13 May 2013 (UTC)

Thanks. At the moment, I know it's a very crude stub article that does not meet WP Medicine's standards, for which I apologise. However, I believe it was still worth creating, as fruitful soil for developing a proper article on the topic. In particular, the sexual arousal, intercourse, pregnancy and childbirth aspects are surely of medical and scientific interest, both from the viewpoints of sexology and obstetrics, but currently non-existent in the article. There must surely be material out there in the literature  that is more recent than Masters and Johnson that touches on all of these. (Also, as an afterthought, perhaps the article should also touch on the topic of vaginal atresia, Müllerian agenesis. and intersex conditions which create unusually-sized, missing or deformed vaginas?) -- The Anome (talk) 22:21, 13 May 2013 (UTC)

Mark viking, no problem. When seeing this article, I should have thought of this topic outside of anatomy in a strict sense/medical sense, especially since the Human penis size article also covers social aspects. Taking into account the aspects you mentioned, some of which the article already touches on, it can be easily expanded beyond a stub. Flyer22 (talk) 22:43, 13 May 2013 (UTC)

I am not yet convinced that this proposed material covering vaginal size should be anywhere else besides Vagina.  &quot;Chamberousness&quot; (if I may make up a word) is part of the essential nature of the vagina's two main functions:  to support sexual intercourse and childbirth.  Vaginal size already has some coverage at Vagina, and that article is only 13 Kb of readable prose, there is plenty more room for content to be expanded there before considering spinning it off to a subarticle.  Absolutely Wikipedia should cover it, but with the information we have right now it should be in Vagina.  Zad68 23:04, 13 May 2013 (UTC)
Try: vacuousness (I think that is a word). While you guys are talking about this stuff I noted on potential space that the vagina had been listed as an example. I understand that a potential space does not exist in health, and requires pathologic separation to be created, e.g. spread of pus that dissects between fascial plains. If someone can confirm that the vagina is anatomically classed as a potential space with a source please add to article. Lesion (talk) 00:56, 14 May 2013 (UTC)

I'm a dyed-in-the-wool mergeist, so you may discount my view, but I really think that this should be integrated directly into the main article.  All of the basics and at least most of the pathological variation needs to be covered at the main article anyway, so there would be a lot of overlap.
My suggestion is to merge now, and to split later if it's really necessary.  It is far easier to merge in a stub and split out a major section than to merge in a more significant article, especially if there is significant overlap in the two independently developed pages.   WhatamIdoing (talk) 05:52, 14 May 2013 (UTC)
I agree with this. Biosthmors (talk) 19:07, 16 May 2013 (UTC)
I agree with a merge too. I think the most important related parameter is the maximal potential size of the canal during childbirth, which is completely missing now, and I can't recall any study on this topic. The current contents of the article describing baseline dimensions are relatively unimportant, but if we merge this article to the Vagina article we can deal with this issue later. Mikael Häggström (talk) 14:32, 20 May 2013 (UTC)

As it looks like there's good support here for the idea that this content should be merged directly into Vagina I've tagged the article for merge, discussion is here:  .  Please voice your opinions, and if there's consensus to merge we'll complete the merge.  Zad68 02:03, 24 May 2013 (UTC)

Bupropion has several problems that I feel compromise its status as Featured Article. Please read  for my two cents. If these problems are not addressed, I will take it to FAR. Ten Pound Hammer • (What did I screw up now?) 07:28, 22 May 2013 (UTC)
Agree FAR might be a good idea. A little out of date. Many refs are primary sources. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 10:08, 22 May 2013 (UTC)

An invite to the NIH

If anyone is in Maryland, wishes to visit the NIH next week and meet with fellow medical Wikipedians join us. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Medicine/May_2013#Participants] Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 22:17, 23 May 2013 (UTC)
Vitamin U

Does vitamin U really cure ulcers?  I stumbled upon this article and found much of the content dubious, but I don't know enough to try to fix it.  Can anyone here take a stab at it?  Edgeweyes (talk) 11:47, 23 May 2013 (UTC)
This article should be merged to S-methylmethionine, I am fairly sure they are the same thing. Lesion (talk) 12:31, 23 May 2013 (UTC)
Sorry to comment here again, but more input is required to reach a consensus , thanks. Lesion (talk) 10:46, 25 May 2013 (UTC)

The NCI thesaurus [http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/46317/?p=terms&amp;conceptid=Methylmethionine_Sulfonium_Chloride entry] is pretty clear that S-methymethionine chloride and Vitamin U are both synonyms for Methylmethionine sulfonium chloride, so it's just the difference of the chloride ion. Should be one article with redirects and an explanatory hatnote. Certainly the sourcing should be improved, there are scads of primary sources in there.

It seems from the history of S-methylmethionine that vitamin U used to redirect there, but was made into a stand alone article. Since, there has been a discussion to merge it to Methylmethionine sulfonium chloride before, citing the same source as you have above, however the consensus (incorrectly imo) did not merge it. Might be good to alert wikiproject molecular biology about this. My merge tags were taken off with the explanation that this merge was proposed before. I directed one of the IPs to  and another secondary source treating Vitamin U and S-methylmethionine as synonyms. Might be the case that there are sources using the term slightly differently from each other, but the source you provide above sounds authoritative to me, and I think we should follow that.

 Further support for S-methymethionine chloride as a synonym:  and 
 Unfortunately it appears there is a lack of suitable [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=%22Vitamin%20U%22%5BMesh%5D%20AND%20%28Review%5Bptyp%5D%29&amp;cmd=DetailsSearch Vitamin U review articles]. Boghog (talk) 16:37, 23 May 2013 (UTC)
 (talk) 16:41, 23 May 2013 (UTC)To do the merger properly, all of the content from one article would hav to be put into the other article. At this point, that means moving all content from S-methylmethionine to Vitamin_U, then making the chemical name into a redirection, so that the other chemicals in Vitamin_U can be accomodated. Note that accomodating the other chemicals invalidates three dictionary entries for being overly simple. Note also that such a thing az an appeal to authority iz.Following the rules will not get the job done.-- Dilbert
 (talk) 16:54, 23 May 2013 (UTC)I am not prone to doing the merjer, because I suspect that s-methyl-methionine will be shown az a downstream metabolite of I3C, at which point there might be a race to find out whether I3C haz more effects on microbes, which it probably duz.To believe it makes it true, therefore it's brain fart.

 (talk) 17:42, 23 May 2013 (UTC)Doing the merjer actually requires deleting content from MMSC, because the chembox would be confusing: It would lead people into thinking that Vitamin U wuz one compound. That iz my second reason not to do the merjer; lost content.QUANDO OMNI FLUNKUS MORITATI (when all else fails, play dead)--Red Green

This review again lists vitamin U as a synonym of S methylmethionine. My understanding of this situation is as follows:
* we have 3 reliable secondary sources which describe the term as a synonym.
* we have an IP editor who turned the original vitamin U redirect into a stand alone article, which apart from the secondary sources recently added, is based almost entirely on primary sources
* the IP is using some of the primary sources to over-rule the secondary sources and change the tone of the article to state that vitamin U is not a synonym but a term referring to several chemicals. The IP particularly prefers to use the primary sources of one author, which could be argued constitutes ,  and .  may also apply here.
* the IP has failed to provide a reliable secondary source to support the content currently supported by these primary sources
* they are also willing to make personal attacks towards other editors and edit war
* Given the multiple primary sources, and the other problems of undue weight to fringe theories, and the fact that we have several reliable sources which use the term &quot;vitamin U&quot; as a synonym of one chemical, I support merge, either to Methylmethionine sulfonium chloride or to S-methylmethionine, and deletion of the content supported by primary sources.

I am largely in agreement with Lesion, but this extended discussion really belongs on the article's  and not here. Boghog (talk) 17:40, 24 May 2013 (UTC)
