		<segment id="id51224686">Using UNESCO open license text in medical articles 

Dear all

I'm currently working at UNESCO as their Wikimedian in Residence. I have been working on making it easier for people to reuse the content that UNESCO produces on Wikimedia projects. As part of my work I have developed a template and . UNESCO produces the majority of publications under an open license, the text from which is freely usable on Wikipedia, [https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/WikiProject_UNESCO/UNESCO_text I have started to develop a page too help people to use text from these publications on Wikipedia]. I think that some of the text from these open license publications may be suitable for medical articles e.g:

* [http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=232179&amp;set=005790EFBC_2_123&amp;gp=1&amp;lin=1&amp;ll=1 Case studies and indicators;UNESCO's contributions to the United Nations world water development report 2015]
* [http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=218793&amp;set=005790ECA2_2_45&amp;gp=1&amp;lin=1&amp;ll=1 Gender equality, HIV and education] 
* [http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=232607&amp;set=005790ECA2_2_45&amp;gp=1&amp;lin=1&amp;ll=1 State of early childhood development in West and Central Africa in 2010-11]
* [http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=227284&amp;set=005790ECA2_2_45&amp;gp=1&amp;lin=1&amp;ll=1 Adolescents' HIV prevention and treatment toolkit for Eastern and Southern Africa]
* [http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=211954&amp;set=005790ECA2_2_45&amp;gp=1&amp;lin=1&amp;ll=1 Sustainable development, climate change and human health in the Arctic]
* [http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=212536&amp;set=005790ECA2_2_45&amp;gp=1&amp;lin=1&amp;ll=1 Environmental health, Engineering: issues, challenges and opportunities for development]

I would appreciate your thoughts on import text from these publications and external sources more generally into medical articles on Wikipedia and how I could improve the process and documentation I have made. In addition ways to make it easier for people to use the UNESCO publications which are not available under an open license (either older publications or co-published works) as references. 

Many thanks

Thanks. The menstrual hygiene article would be good for ref for here Menstruation#Menstrual_management Doc James (talk ·  · ) 01:43, 22 July 2016 (UTC)

Thanks , do you you see any reasons why text from open license UNESCO publications couldn't be copied into Wikipedia articles? I've created a workflow to do it, I just want to understand if there are any other barriers other than the workflow and the suitability of the text. --John Cummings (talk) 10:15, 22 July 2016 (UTC)
There are problems with &quot;the suitability of the text&quot; in terms of using long pieces of text directly, not least the considerable length of these pieces. The ones I looked at tended not to have a neutral encyclopedic voice, but were advocating specific policies/actions, not doubt very sensibly, but the phrasing would need either quoting as the UNESCO view, or adjusting. Otherwise the source obviously needs to be clear, and where specific medical statements are made (rather than those on the social and economic aspects of public health issues),  would probably prefer other sources, perhaps going directly to the work UNESCO cites. So I think there is a role, certainly as refs, or in quotations, but also some incorporating text directly. Hope that helps. Johnbod (talk) 11:25, 22 July 2016 (UTC)


Thanks very much , this is really helpful, I've tried to articulate this for a little while but haven't been able to, that open license publications can be used as
* A source of openly license text that can be directly copied into Wikipedia articles
* A reference for Wikipedia articles
* A source of references of other works that the UNESCO publications cite
* A source for quotations

Does this sound right to you?

Thanks

John Cummings (talk) 13:10, 22 July 2016 (UTC)

Pretty much. There is a dislike, overdone imo, for quotations in medical articles, but sometimes (without overdoing things) this is the best way. Johnbod (talk) 13:23, 22 July 2016 (UTC)
I think it is very much down to encyclopedic voice, and from my experience this can vary much between publications. It's also something that is rather simple to rework, sometimes you just have to fix some of the most egregious examples, and then someone else will come along and help with the rest.When it comes to giving advice that is a problem, but as long as any editor is aware that this needs to be qualified as coming from UNESCO or just needs changing from &quot;you should&quot; -&gt; &quot;it is recommended&quot; I think that it is a lesser problem.For an article that was nearly fully based upon CC-BY sources that were rewritten see Heart.If we're looking at outside Wikipedia uses, the materials can of course be reused by other UN bodies, or national bodies.Are the PDFs available on Commons under any specific category? Carl Fredrik 💌  14:58, 22 July 2016 (UTC)
Also, a note. If anyone chooses to copy long paragraphs of UNESCO material, remember to tell them to add a reference at the end of every sentence. Otherwise someone else may stick something in the middle of the paragraph that isn't supported by the UNESCO reference and it may look like it is. (This I've found takes some explaining, and not all Wikipedians get it right either). Carl Fredrik 💌  15:00, 22 July 2016 (UTC)

Thanks very much  (sorry don't know how make a ping show your name correctly). I think that referencing after every sentence is super important and something that I hadn't thought about before. The way I'm thinking about it is using external text as a start to build upon, its an additional opportunity for external organisations to contribute to Wikimedia without having to learn how to edit directly (which has around 1% retention rates) using content they have either already written or could write and use for Wikipedia and other platforms. I'm wondering if there are any open license medical journals or other medical sources that may have suitable text to trial what I've done and improve upon it. John Cummings (talk) 15:35, 22 July 2016 (UTC)
There are some, but we'd have to choose properly so as not to introduce too much bias if we only select open source articles. We need review articles, which when it comes to open access are somewhat rarer than primary sources (for example PLoS doesn't publish reviews). I'll get back to you about that, but for now if your volunteers are willing to write about anatomy and physiology there is [https://cnx.org/contents/FPtK1zmh@8.25:zMTtFGyH@4/Introduction] which is an excellent source (all the images are on commons at ), it just needs some rewriting for encyclopedic tone. Carl Fredrik 💌  15:46, 22 July 2016 (UTC)

Thank you, , this opening-up of licensing information on UNESCO sources is very encouraging. If there is any way that similar clarity can be brought to other UN bodies' publications it would be very welcome. For WPMed interests, that primarily means the World Health Organization, but there are often media published through the UN News Centre, the FAO, or UNICEF (just to name a few) that could be usefully employed in Wikipedia if compatible licensing permitted. [https://shop.un.org/rights-permissions So far], some other UN organizations have applied an incompatible &quot;noncommercial&quot; or &quot;no derivatives&quot; license similar to CC-By-NC-ND without even realizing that clause effectively prevents us from using the work. If we were able to get this idea through to the necessary people, it could be very productive. Even short of liberalizing the license, it is helpful to know clearly whether or not it is compatible.
The non-text media may be as useful if not more so. LeadSongDog come howl! 18:58, 22 July 2016 (UTC)

Pokémon Go and health

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Go#Effects_on_health An entire section] of dubious health claims sourced to the popular press, mostly AOL. Needs some work, especially in light of the popularity.--TMCk (talk) 14:22, 24 July 2016 (UTC)
Oh man, that first sentence, &quot;It has been suggested that Pokémon Go could potentially improve the mental and physical health of players suffering from depression and social anxiety.&quot;[https://www.engadget.com/2016/07/13/pokemon-go-mental-health-science/][http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/pokemon-go-catching-pikachu-your-phone-really-good-your-mental-health-1570473][http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/how-pokemon-go-is-helping-players-tackle-anxiety-and-depression-a7132946.html]→Aol.com and 2 other non-MEDRS sources. Can I just delete it? —PermStrump(talk) 16:27, 24 July 2016 (UTC)
I would've deleted it but thought, even though it's quite new (the game), there might be medrs sources that, at least, talk about the subject outside the pop. press.--TMCk (talk) 17:40, 24 July 2016 (UTC)
 It is of course too early for published research on this, but places like Baylor College of Medicine are touting health benefits[https://www.bcm.edu/news/healthcare/pokemon-go-health-benefits-safety-tips]. Science Daily, too.[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/07/160715181715.htm]  RS, not MEDRS, but the claims aren't too strong either: it encourages walking and walking can have health benefits. It is just a virtual version of geocaching.[http://www.besthealthmag.ca/best-you/fitness/fitness-trend-geocaching/]. --Mark viking (talk) 18:37, 24 July 2016 (UTC)
The touted benefits could be part of their covert marketing. QuackGuru (talk) 18:48, 24 July 2016 (UTC)

Claims like &quot;...praised by some medical professionals for potentially improving the mental and physical health...&quot; in the lead are surely over the top, or at least it seems to me.--TMCk (talk) 18:59, 24 July 2016 (UTC)

 I've tried to tighten the language used which seemed rather uncritical of the speculation seen in the sources so far. In the absence of MEDRS sourcing, we need to make clear the status of the claims against evidence-based medical standards. Is that any better? --RexxS (talk) 19:41, 24 July 2016 (UTC)
Much better.--TMCk (talk) 20:50, 24 July 2016 (UTC)
Duckduckgo has [https://duckduckgo.com/?q=pokemon+go+autism&amp;t=hc&amp;ia=web search results] for pokemon go autism.
After reading the OP, I was expecting the health claims to be about increased physical activity and cardiovascular benefits or something, so I was surprised to see how many were mental health claims, which just seems ridiculous, especially the ones about autism. —PermStrump(talk) 20:07, 24 July 2016 (UTC)
The fact that the &quot;health effects of Pokemon Go&quot; has made its way onto Wikipedia makes me . &gt;.&gt; Seppi333 (Insert 2¢) 05:16, 25 July 2016 (UTC)
I'm not surprised.  Every big fad sees a spate of sources that talk about how Popular Thing X relates to My Favorite Subject.  So people who are interested in health will write about how it affects health.  I don't know much about the game (Mark Viking's description as a virtual form of geocaching is the most sensible explanation I've seen), but I've seen headlines about its relationship to criminal activity (trespassing, drug deals), church attendance, agile software coaching, and other weird subjects.  By comparison, the mental health benefits of walking and engaging in casual social interactions seem quite tame.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 07:21, 25 July 2016 (UTC)
I think this is a pretty interesting discussion, because it related to what MEDRS should cover. I find that the pretty benign speculation on increased health due to walking ought to be mentioned in the article, as long as it is stated as unproven speculation — but then again I see the issues of where we ought to draw the line of benign vs. harmful speculation. , you found some review article already? Carl Fredrik 💌  07:43, 25 July 2016 (UTC)
There's no issue with content policies if we cite appropriate sources and say &quot;Individuals who play Pokemon Go generally walk [possibly qualify this with 'X more steps' or 'Y more minutes' here] more than non-players.[WP:RS-quality citation]  Regular light exercise like walking is associated with such-and-such health effects.[WP:MEDRS-quality citation here]&quot; It's not ok to say &quot;Playing Pokemon Go improves the health of players via [list of health effects of regular walking] health effects.[citation of any quality here]&quot; because it attributes these to Pokemon Go, not light exercise; someone going around playing Pokemon Go on a motor scooter is obviously not getting those health benefits.  It's definitely not ok to say that Pokemon Go improves mental health like the article did previously because there isn't a single study published on Pokemon Go at the moment. It basically read like: &quot;Random guy named Bob with X credentials said Pokemon Go can improve player health by [list of health-promoting effects, according to Bob]&quot;.

Funny, QuackGuru, I must have been replacing that mass removal of sourced criticism at the same time you were posting it here. CFCF, I could see an argument for a few accurately worded statements about the speculation of health benefits as far as increased physical activity and hypothetical increased socialization, but the claims in the article this morning were basically that this game cures depression, agoraphobia, and autism (I'm not even kidding). IMO it's better to leave that section out, because that material will make its way back into the article (and is/was probably already present in other areas), but have a section header about health benefits seems like an invitation for dubious and potentially harmful claims. —PermStrump(talk) 08:07, 25 July 2016 (UTC)
To add to Seppi333's last comment, a lot of the claims about the potential mental health benefits originated from twitter posts by regular people without credentials who play the game. —PermStrump(talk) 08:11, 25 July 2016 (UTC)

It's interesting that the criticisms of Pokemon Go players with disability (including some by The AbleGamers Foundation) were removed from the article as well as the beneficial health claims.  What provisions does MEDRS have for inclusion/the social model of disability?  -- (talk) 07:31, 26 July 2016 (UTC)
I think it was an oversight (just a guess). I don't think the paragraph you're referring to needed MEDRS. It's not like it was saying the game causes disabilities, just that people complained about the lack of accessibility for people with mobility issues. —PermStrump(talk) 07:37, 26 July 2016 (UTC)
Yeah, that makes sense.  , what are your thoughts?  -- (talk) 08:16, 26 July 2016 (UTC)
Restoring these statements would be fine:it has also been criticized for its inaccessibility to those with physical disabilities. The game is more difficult for those who are not able to move around, requiring players to walk around and have manual dexterity to experience the game.

*as I said before it seems a good idea to me, and these charts are even better( I think (hope) some of WAID's concerns might be taken care of now...?), great effort/work Carl!--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 12:13, 16 July 2016 (UTC)
* Progressing nicely, CF! In the &quot;referencing a guideline&quot; chart, I suggest a better term than &quot;health technology assessment&quot; and request clarity. To some, a &quot;technology&quot; means a pre-approved drug, device or diagnostic, as for biotechnology. A note about sources mentioned in : all of these science-based bodies (appearing to be &quot;national&quot;) have international policy influence, and so may be legitimately called the highest quality of reference guideline to source. Included among them should be EFSA [https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/publications scientific opinions] which affect food and nutrient labeling and marketing in the EU. Because EFSA scientific reviews are so thorough, there is cross-referencing among international organizations, [http://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/edepot/177309 such as for the supposed health claims of probiotics.] --Zefr (talk) 15:36, 16 July 2016 (UTC)
Hmm, the problem is that they are called &quot;Health technology assessments&quot; — but I agree it is a horribly confusing name, I just can't really think of a better term. The alternative I can think of is to use HTA and to clarify in text — but being rare few editors will come across these and it feels sort of unnecessary, assuming that such as &quot;dry&quot; section will be read at all, and not only bore readers enough so they don't read the rest.
An alternative to international is multi-national — but this is also problematic because the FDA, EMA, or CDC pull a lot of weight internationally, despite being either EU or US-agencies. But these are sort of one offs, and the ECDC or CCDC might on the surface seem to be similar in size and scope, but just don't pull the same weight. So I'm afraid we'll just end up making things more confusing rather than less. I'll await some more comments before making any changes there. Carl Fredrik 💌  16:06, 16 July 2016 (UTC)
I made some changes, I'll see if I can bake in an explanation. Carl Fredrik 💌  16:17, 16 July 2016 (UTC)

* I'm very uncomfortable with the questions &quot;Does it explain its search methodology; inclusion and exclusion criteria; and are these valid? Is it free from overt bias?&quot; Who are we expecting to make the judgement on validity and freedom from overt bias? If the answer is Wikipedia editors (i.e. by local consensus on the article talk page), then we might as well hand over all of the CAM, fringe and controversial topics to the POV-pushers, because they will be more than happy to do that sort of analysis in order to reject sources supporting mainstream views and insert sources supporting the fringe view. Just look back at the talk page archives of Abortion, Acupuncture, Ayurveda for examples, and that's just the 'A's - don't get me started on the rest of the alphabet. The talk page for Bloodletting starts with a complaint that the article is too negative; and it doesn't get any better by the time you've reached the article Wobenzym (&quot;the focus of over 200 clinical studies conducted by both the German Wobenzym manufacturer, Mucos Pharma, and third-party researchers.&quot; - sourced to Wobenzym.com). I'm sorry to be so negative on those questions, but to keep our encyclopedia honest we need the bulwark of 's  --RexxS (talk) 17:02, 16 July 2016 (UTC)
What makes it work, at least in my mind, is that we here provide links to some real guidelines on how to assess evidence quality. As I read the current guideline, it allows for qualified objections, just not personal objections. I think it would actually be easier to deny such objections if we actually explain what you need to qualify a valid objection. The way it works today is that these discussions arise anyway, and pointing to the line that says no personal objections and the shill just says &quot;well, it isn't personal&quot;, — and we have to explain that for objections to be valid they need to abide by certain criteria. This has to be done over and over again.
As I mentioned above to WAID, I think we need to take the fact that there is bias by the horns — and instead of shying away from it we should explain what it is — and what can be deemed legitimate bias. There are great guidelines about bias that we can refer to, and these get rid of stupid ideas like stating that you can't cite a paper by a surgeon, in a heart-beat.
That said, I'm willing to discuss how to improve that text so that maybe this is more clear. Do you have any suggestions ? Carl Fredrik 💌  17:20, 16 July 2016 (UTC)

 I agree that it's a nuisance having to repeatedly tell the shills and &quot;true believers&quot;™ that they aren't qualified to perform their amateur analyses on respectable sources. I also agree that it's inconvenient to have to constantly point out to the vested interests that the WHO is allowed to be biased against banning abortion or that Ernst is actually qualified to write papers on CAM, but I'd rather do that than give them carte blanche to reject those sources on their personal say-so. In my humble opinion, the only qualified criticism of sources falling into the high-quality &quot;type&quot; is from other published, reliable sources independent of the subject. And that's what we need to be saying. --RexxS (talk) 17:47, 16 July 2016 (UTC)
, I agree. I didn't see your comment, but it's basically what I wrote. Great minds think alike . Take a look again and say what you think. Carl Fredrik 💌  17:55, 16 July 2016 (UTC)
The diagram that supports the inclusion of large RCTs is at odds with MEDRS – &quot;&quot;.  RCTs of any size are not MEDRS-quality because they're primary sources.[TLDR: A larger RCT is not necessarily a better RCT]Moreover, if two RCTs have exactly the same statistical design, except one has a sample size of 1 billion people and the other has a sample size of 100, they'll only differ in the precision of the estimator (e.g., for an arbitrary population parameter with a true value of 4, the associated parameter estimates on these samples could be something like 4.000000000000001 ± .000000000000001 vs 3.95 ± .5 for the larger/smaller study respectively).  In other words, all else equal, massive RCTs are not &quot;truer&quot; or more accurate than smaller RCTs - they're just more precise.  This is really only notable when an effect size is very small (e.g., a population parameter's true value is very close to the null hypothesis value) or there is a lot of noise in the data (i.e., large standard error for an estimator with a non-zero effect size), since larger sample sizes shrink the standard error of the estimate and therefore reduce the likelihood of failing to achieve statistical significance in these cases.As a statistician, I'm much more concerned about statistical bias in a study since this can effectively invalidate all the findings/statistics-based conclusions in a paper; sources of bias are not always reported and are sometimes not readily apparent/easy to identify. In the vast majority of cases (including all commonly employed statistical models in medicine that I know about - any exceptions would involve a biased yet consistent estimator, which is asymptotically unbiased), a study's sample size has absolutely no effect on the bias of an estimator.  If the aforementioned RCTs had different statistical designs, the massive RCT might be biased with a highly misleading but very precise estimator (e.g., suppose that this RCT attempts to estimate the efficacy of an oral antibiotic against a gastrointestinal bacterial pathogen but somehow ends up giving the individuals in the treatment group a capsule containing the pathogen instead of the antibiotic – both the magnitude and direction of the parameter estimator would differ from the true value of the population parameter that is being estimated), while the smaller RCT might be unbiased (i.e., it actually gives the treatment group the antibiotic) with a less precise estimator. Assuming everything else was done correctly and in the same manner in these studies, the RCT with the sample size of 1 billion would be a flaming pile of shit, while the RCT with a sample size of 100 would yield statistically valid results. Seppi333 (Insert 2¢) 17:54, 16 July 2016 (UTC)
I know it goes against the current interpretation of MEDRS, and its probably the most controversial thing I've got in here, and also the first thing I would get rid of. I still contend that if there is ever to be made an exception for a primary study (as is allowed exceptionally) it would be for a high-quality, large RCT.The things you mention are why I added the little gray &quot;high quality&quot; rather than just &quot;very large&quot;. And this is why I'd originally planned on not making the flow-chart too MEDRS specific, but more general when it comes to evidence quality. Now I agree, few editors here are in reality capable of determining if an RCT is high quality or not — and we shouldn't expect them to. So, just to be clear I kept it in for accuracy, rather than actual usefulness on Wikipedia — but I'll get rid of it. Carl Fredrik 💌  18:05, 16 July 2016 (UTC) Carl Fredrik 💌  18:06, 16 July 2016 (UTC)

 That's probably best - or at least point it below MEDRS' normal threshold. The reason should be that if there exists a very large high-quality RCT on a particular topic, then it would be extraordinary if it wasn't analysed in a review within a reasonably short period. In general, it's better to wait for the secondary source than to allow the thin end of the wedge with primaries, IMHO. --RexxS (talk) 19:20, 16 July 2016 (UTC)

* Quick reply:  Carl, before I finish reading this, can you please find a way to separate the concepts of &quot;evidence quality&quot; and &quot;source quality&quot;?  MEDASSESS is about the quality of scientific evidence.  It is not the sum total of &quot;source quality&quot;.  &quot;High-quality evidence&quot; is not a synonym for &quot;high-quality source&quot;.  This is important because &quot;evidence quality&quot; is irrelevant for much of what an article needs to cover.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 19:37, 17 July 2016 (UTC)
 — I made this change a couple of days ago. I've never considered MEDASSESS to be about &quot;evidence quality&quot; in a general sense, so I think we agree, I just never assumed it covered that in the first place. Carl Fredrik 💌  19:59, 17 July 2016 (UTC)
If you actually made this change a couple of days ago, then why does the column that says &quot;Quality&quot; at the top specifically refer editors to MEDASSESS (i.e., the section of MEDRS that is labeled &quot;Assess evidence quality&quot; and contains two large pyramids that rank the levels of scientific evidence in medical papers), and ignore other sections of MEDRS that also impinge upon source quality, e.g.,  and ?   WhatamIdoing (talk) 05:45, 18 July 2016 (UTC)

CF: I'm still feeling reluctant about HTA as the highest level of evidence in the draft chart for guidelines under . The HTA article is about &quot;technologies&quot; specifically, such as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_for_assessment_of_telemedicine_(MAST) telemedicine within MAST.] A position statement based on systematic reviews as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine#Assessing_the_quality_of_evidence Level I for evidence-based medicine] would likely be the highest standard for a clinical practice guideline which would be adopted and held unchanged for 5 years internationally if sufficiently strong. As for the other charts and text you have drafted, what tasks remain needing collaboration and what is the process for implementing the consolidated changes for MEDRS? --Zefr (talk) 14:58, 20 July 2016 (UTC)

*These are great charts. I like them as they are. I am comfortable with content not being perfect, but instead good enough. Because of this I recognize the criticism here as valid but still think these charts are fine to display and use as they are.
About reading the charts - I am a little confused that they read right to left as &quot;most acceptable&quot; to &quot;least acceptable&quot;. I would have expected that a chart which was communicating a progression would have the lowest measured values on the left and the highest measured values on the right, but these charts all reverse that. Artistic taste is no barrier to accepting these but if the art is ever considered, my vote would be for &quot;least acceptable&quot; on the left and &quot;most acceptable&quot; on the right.

 That's an interesting point, , and it highlights the differences in different people's cognitive processes. I think that from the point of view of categorisation, it is logical to proceed from least to most as we move from left to right - at least for those of us who read habitually from right to left.
 However, from an instructional point of view, we want to present desired outcomes first, as those imprint preferentially over ones presented later. When teaching, we always give correct examples first, and only later show wrong examples, if at all.
 So for me, I'd prefer to see the best quality sources placed on the left (as now), because those are probably read first and those are the ones we want folks to use wherever possible. When we translate into Arabic (or any other rtl language), I'd recommend mirroring the chart for those same reasons. Incidentally, there's an argument for reducing the distraction of the poorer sources by using less saturated colours and less contrast, and conversely increasing them for the best sources (and/or using a bolder font), so that the eye is drawn preferentially to the part of the chart that we want the reader to start at. --RexxS (talk) 16:02, 26 July 2016 (UTC)
agree, in regards to categorization that would be best--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 10:24, 5 August 2016 (UTC)

Emotional support animal (ESA)

The opening sentence of the ESA article says: &quot;An emotional support animal (ESA) is a companion animal which provides therapeutic benefit, such as alleviating or mitigating some symptoms for individuals with mental disorders.&quot; (I haven't looked at the rest of it yet, but it looks like it mostly covers the legal aspect of things). I added a  tag to that sentence, but I'm second guessing after reading a little more. Apparently that is a pretty close paraphrase of how ESAs are defined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) according to this [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15228932.2013.765734 academic/legal source]: &quot;Under rules of the HUD, such animals must alleviate 'at least one of the symptoms or effects' of the patient’s disability, or 'affirmatively enhance a disabled [person’s] life by ameliorating the effects of the disability' (Bronk v. Ineichen, 1995).&quot; No one has raised an issue about my tag as it's not a very heavily edited article. I'm just having some indecision, so I'm looking for input from other editors. Does that sentence need MEDRS or is the legal definition sufficient? Thanks! —PermStrump(talk) 22:09, 4 August 2016 (UTC)

 Having read through the article, I've edited the lead sentence to read &quot;&quot; I think that the problem was making an unqualified statement in Wikipedia's voice that the animal provides therapeutic benefit, whereas the rest of the article discusses the animals that are labelled an ESA by an appropriate medical professional. If we now relate the definition to a professional opinion, does that alleviate your concerns? I've removed the  on the assumption that it would, but please feel free to re-instate it if my edit hasn't met your concern. --RexxS (talk) 23:10, 4 August 2016 (UTC)
, I agree that makes sense. I thought I saw a second comment here from someone else that said &quot;mental disorder&quot; should say &quot;disability&quot;, but IDK where the comment went, anyway, I was going to say that that person was right too. It said that before but linked to &quot;mental disorder&quot; and I removed the pipelink without thinking it through. I changed it to now say,  —PermStrump(talk) 23:56, 4 August 2016 (UTC)
I know a bit about this subject in terms of US law, so let me tell you the key points, in case the articles aren't clear:
* A service animal has been individually trained to do something specific for the person – something more than what a pet would do.  For example, if you have a severe anxiety problem, and that manifests by you pulling out your hair, then a service dog could be trained to gently put its mouth on your hand, to discourage you from pulling your hair.  An emotional support animal has not been trained to do anything specific.  It's just a pet (note that proponents prefer the more clinical term &quot;companion animal&quot;, but it's the same thing), and you feel better/have fewer symptoms when you have a pet keeping you company (e.g., fewer symptoms of depression because you feel less lonely when you play with your cat).
* Service animals are mostly used for severe physical disabilities, e.g., blindness, although trained PTSD dogs are increasingly common.  Emotional support animals are mostly used for common psychological problems, e.g., depression or anxiety.  ESAs are generally defined in US law as being used for mental health conditions, so I'd double-check the source that claims physical and intellectual disabilities. 
* Service animals are dogs or (rarely) miniature horses – by US law.  Emotional support animals are usually dogs or cats (because those are the most popular pets), but can be anything.  People have claimed snakes as emotional support animals.
* Service animals are legally permitted in almost any public place that the disabled person is permitted.  There are a few common-sense limits (e.g., restaurant kitchens), but pretty much, if you can go there, then your service dog can go there.  An emotional support animal is legally permitted:   in your home and (with some exceptions) on an airplane.  That's it.
** Because of this distinction, there is a problem with fraud.  Some people (people both with and without disabilities) claim that their pets are service animals so that they can take them in stores and other public places.  This causes annoyance for everyone, and since these pets (and their owners – remember, we're talking about people who are willing to commit fraud over this, not the normal responsible pet owner) tend to be poorly behaved, it degrades the reputation for real service animals and makes people less willing to accommodate people with disabilities.  Some states have started prosecuting this. 
** The law does not treat all disabilities equally.  This isn't intentional, but it's a result of explicitly creating a right for some disabled people to have service animals without explicitly creating a right for other disabled people to stay away from service animals.  The result is that people whose disabilities absolutely require them to stay away from animals get less accommodation than people whose disabilities can optionally be mitigated by using an animal.  To quote the DOT, if you are allergic to dog dander, then risking an allergic reaction is just &quot;a function of going out in public&quot; and of no concern to them.  The general hierarchy is:  people with service animals, people with allergies to animals, and people with emotional support animals.  So if a teacher has a severe allergy to dog dander, and a student wants to bring a dog into the classroom, then the teacher is expected to just cope somehow if the dog is a service animal (the official recommendation is to stay on opposite sides of the room, assuming that it's a lecture-style class; they make no recommendations for classes in which this isn't feasible), but the teacher can legally refuse if it's an emotional support animal (or a therapy animal).

Thanks! I want to tighten it up a bit though. It's a pretty windy topic with a lot of different definitions for similar terms. The article is kind of redundant and could be more clear about the different levels of assistance animals, but it could be worse I guess. The source I linked in my first post was really informative and mentioned all of the things you're talking about that I didn't really know before. I only knew that those certificates they sell online are basically a scam. —PermStrump(talk) 16:38, 5 August 2016 (UTC)
 It could be helpful to get input from  as well. —Shelley V. Adams ‹blame› 18:35, 5 August 2016 (UTC)
 And perhaps  while we are at it. I believe that ESA is a perhaps borderline nebulous term with no precise legal definition. The only two federal laws (other than the ADA which does not define ESAs but excludes them from their definition of service animals) that appear to apply to it are [https://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/documents/huddoc?id=servanimals_ntcfheo2013-01.pdf a law concerning reasonable accommodations for assistance animals] from HUD and [http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=0c03ecb328fa7ed46b86097162930d61&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se14.4.382_1117&amp;rgn=div8 the Airline Carrier Access Act] for which guidance is provided in [http://airconsumer.ost.dot.gov/rules/20030509.pdf Policy Guidance Concerning Service Animals in Air Transportation] from the DOT, neither of which define ESAs.
* In the HUD document ESAs are explicitly stated to be excluded from being considered service animals, but are included in assistance animals.
The Department of Justice's (DOT) amendments to its regulations' for Titles II and III of the ADA limit the definition of &quot;service animal&quot; under the ADA to include only dogs, and further define &quot;service animal&quot; to exclude emotional support animals. This definition, however, does not limit housing providers' obligations to make reasonable accommodations for assistance animals under the FFHAct or Section 504. Persons with disabilities may request a reasonable accommodation for any assistance animal, including an emotional support animal, under both the FHAct and Section 504
HUD goes on to provide two criteria for whether an animal is to be considered an assistance animal.
1. Does the person seeking to use and live with the animal have a disability — i.e., a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities?
2. Does the person making the request have a disability-related need for an assistance animal? In other words, does the animal work, provide assistance, perform tasks or services for the benefit of a person with a disability, or provide emotional support that alleviates one or more of the identified symptoms or effects of a person's existing disability?
Although it is tempting to draw from this wording a definition for ESAs, without an explicit definition provided, nor a legal background I will not so. However, two things are clear from this, 1) HUD considers ESAs to be included as assistance animals with regards to FHAct and Section 504, and 2) assistance animals that provide emotional support in order to alleviate identified symptoms or effects of a disability (physical or mental) are considered assistance animals with regards to FHAct and Section 504. So while it may be most common in this situation for an ESA to be used for mental disabilities, I believe situations where only a physical disability (especially ones with an emotional component) are valid here as well. For instance, imagine a person with a physical disability that makes movement highly uncomfortable but tolerable, and which has a documented history of negative effects occurring due to resultant inactivity such as constipation. Let this supposed person receive a dog which motivates them to get out of their house each day to take it on walks, and several months go by with them reporting to their primary care physician a continuing decrease or total elimination of these negative symptoms. If this person were to move into new housing, and had documentation from their primary care physician attesting to all the above, then I believe the conditions outlined by HUD would be met for the animal to be considered an assistance animal. But I am not familiar with these laws so take my opinions with a grain of salt.
* The DOT document states that it:
refines DOT's previous definition of service animals by making it clear that animals that assist persons with disabilities by providing emotional support qualify as service animals and ensuring that, in situations concerning emotional support animals, the authority of airline personnel to require documentation of the individual’s disability and the medical necessity of the passenger traveling with the animal is understood.
 The actual updated definition for a service animal is provided in the glossary as follows:
Any animal that is individually trained or able to provide assistance to a qualified person with a disability; or any animal shown by documentation to be necessary for the emotional well being of a passenger.
Later, in a section describing steps that airline personnel can take to help them determine if an animal is an emotional support animal, the document affirms the authority of airline personnel to require the following:
current documentation (i.e., not more than one year old) on letterhead from a mental health professional stating (1) that the passenger has a mental health-related disability; (2) that having the animal accompany the passenger is necessary to the passenger’s mental health or treatment or to assist the passenger (with his or her disability); and (3) that the individual providing the assessment of the passenger is a licensed mental health professional and the passenger is under his or her professional care.
However, while airline personnel may require this documentation for allowing passage of the animal, such documentation does not necessarily constitute a definition. Furthermore it should be noted that [http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=0c03ecb328fa7ed46b86097162930d61&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se14.4.382_1117&amp;rgn=div8 the ACAA has been updated since then to slightly refine the contents of the documentation that can be required] although the guidance on this policy has not been subsequently updated to reflect this.
* So I don't think we can use a precise definition of an ESA for the lead, and think we should instead use a broad description of ESAs that conveys the lack of specific meaning, and subsequently introduce discussion on how it is used legally and non-legally. Lastly I would recommend to anyone who is interested to look at this document which I just found: [http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&amp;SID=0c03ecb328fa7ed46b86097162930d61&amp;ty=HTML&amp;h=L&amp;mc=true&amp;r=APPENDIX&amp;n=ap28.1.35_1191_635_1999.a Guidance to Revisions to ADA Regulation on Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in State and Local Government Services] which contains useful contextualization and discussion on ESAs.
