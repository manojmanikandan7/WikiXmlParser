 If a vandal blanks the page and you restore it, are you then listed as writing 100% of the article? ser:Natureium|Natureium (ser talk:Natureium|talk) 21:34, 27 November 2017 (UTC)
 Reverts are not counted if a revert is marked as a revert.
 It starts with the current version. Splits that into &quot;words&quot;. Then it examines every revision (except reverts) stating with the very first one and tries to assign every occurrence of every single word to that revision (if it is not assigned already) and thus to the user making this change. Changing the order of words does not matter, adding/removing Space/Newlines does not change anything, since spaces/newlines are ignored. At the very end every word is multiplied by its length.
 So changing &quot;Hello&quot; to &quot;Hello Hello&quot; is 50%/50% (The first &quot;Hello&quot; is assigned to the first user, the second &quot;Hello&quot; is assigned to the other user). Changing &quot;Hello&quot; to &quot;Hello crude whatever&quot; is 37.7%/72.2%. Changing &quot;Hello&quot; to &quot;Hello world&quot; and reverting it to &quot;Hello&quot; is 100%/0%/0% (when three different users are involved). BTW: Google translate does a good job in translating the german text …
 Summary: If a vandal adds whatever text or deletes whatever part, it is not taken in account when you revert it. It may be taken in account when you restore the old version with a typical edit. It &quot;may&quot; because this happens when a vandal duplicated the text and in later revisions word from this duplication are reused (eg. often used words like &quot;the&quot;, &quot;and&quot; …). I hope this helps. --ser:Wurgl|Wurgl (ser talk:Wurgl|talk) 00:27, 28 November 2017 (UTC)

A real example with a small article: ntosca User Xezbeth is counted as 100%, 2 other authors are shown with 0%. When looking at the history, you see 4 edits. Jd22292 changed urname|Antosca (two words: &quot;surname&quot; and &quot;Antosca&quot;) to urname, then HindWIKI added isambiguation and the last edit is again done by Xezbeth who removed isambiguation (Note: This is not detected as a revert! It is an ordinary edit, therefore the user HindWIKI is mentioned in the list of authors). When you compare the initial version with the current one, only one word (&quot;Antosca&quot;) was removed, so 100% of the current version's text was written by Xezbeth. Adding isambiguation is not counted, since it does not appear in the current version.
Or ussman. This was first a redirect and changed later. The two words &quot;Gérard&quot; and &quot;Fussman&quot; appear in the current version, the word &quot;redirect&quot; does not appear. So when you count all the words (multiplied with the length of the words, giving actually the number of characters) you find 132 characters in the current version (special characters are changed to spaces and ignored). 13 of these 132 characters, namely from the words &quot;Gérard&quot; and &quot;Fussman&quot;, can be seen in the previous version, so these 13 characters are 9.848% of the final text and 90.152% are written by the second author and this is what you see. BTW: The word &quot;Fussmann&quot; appears three times and it is counted three times, one occurrence is assigned to Xezbeth and the other two to Tahar Jelun. --ser:Wurgl|Wurgl (ser talk:Wurgl|talk) 10:32, 28 November 2017 (UTC)

 allmann syndrome 

Hello,

I have taken a very close interest in the page on allmann syndrome. I am a patient with the condition and very keen to raise awareness of the condition. Since it is such a rare condition the Wikipedia page can be a very good source of information to new patients. I make no secret of the fact I am a patient with the condition and I have plenty of You Tube videos and blog sites where I talk about the condition.

I am keen to improve the article as much as I can and raise the standard of the article. Doc James has recently made some helpful alterations to the article but I am keen to keep improving the article.

As a patient advocate I am keen to ensure that the page is relevant and useful to all patients but at the same time I do try to keep a balanced and neutral look to the content I post there and to keep within the rules of Wikipedia medicine pages.

I would welcome any feedback on the page.

Thank you.

 Rare disease notability 

What are the criteria for notability for articles about are diseases? ser:Natureium|Natureium (ser talk:Natureium|talk) 18:26, 29 November 2017 (UTC)
 e|Natureium q|&quot;If a topic has received significant coverage in P:reliable sources|reliable sources that are P:Independent sources|independent of the subject, it is presumed to be suitable for a stand-alone article or list.&quot; See P:GNG. There are no subject-specific notability guidelines for diseases that I'm aware of. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 20:44, 29 November 2017 (UTC)
Basically, if it's a real/accepted disease, it's notable.  (If it's in the &quot;one lab says that they've discovered this thing&quot;, it's more complicated.) 
Note that you don't have to have high-quality MEDRS-ideal sources for a disease to be notable.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 21:40, 29 November 2017 (UTC)
 I read this paper [https://www.nature.com/articles/gim2017140] and was going to create an article on eotenic Complex Syndrome, but saw that it was deleted just last year. Does one new primary research paper now make this notable? ser:Natureium|Natureium (ser talk:Natureium|talk) 23:09, 29 November 2017 (UTC)
Not per se.  P:MEDRS specifies that Wikipedia articles should use secondary sources, i.e., review articles.  If no review articles exist, there is no good basis for constructing a Wikipedia article.  As soon as somebody reviews the primary research paper, or even writes a perspective about it, the story changes. ser:Looie496|Looie496 (ser talk:Looie496|talk) 23:50, 29 November 2017 (UTC)
If it's real, it's notable. For something published in September 2017, that may be a bit too recent. We need reviews/substantiation/replication/something of a 3rd party source. ser:Headbomb|Headbomb {ser talk:Headbomb|t · pecial:Contributions/Headbomb|c · P:PHYS|p · P:WBOOKS|b} 00:48, 30 November 2017 (UTC)
That's the opposite of what e|WhatamIdoing said above. ser:Natureium|Natureium (ser talk:Natureium|talk) 03:02, 30 November 2017 (UTC)
utdent
Yes, it is.  This has been discussed before.

P:Notability (and related guidelines and policies) say that you can have an article if all of the following are true:
# you can find multiple (i.e., ≥2) sources, that:
## are P:INDY|independent and
## are P:USEPRIMARY|secondary and
## provide &quot;significant coverage&quot; of the subject (think &quot;500 words about it&quot;, although the real rule is at P:WHYN), and
# editors don't want to merge it into a larger article, and
# it's not outright banned by P:NOT.

Any accepted disease will trivially meet the first and last.  Sometimes editors choose to merge them, but that's pretty unusual except when we're talking about sub-types (although nearly every subtype will trivially meet all of the other rules, too).

So, to use a rare disease as an example, an entry in NORD and/or Eurodis and/or OMIM pretty much means guaranteed notability, but two long articles in two different popular science magazines would technically be enough.

Of course, once you've started writing, there will be a chance that someone will come along and demand that only MEDRS-ideal sources be used because it's &quot;medical&quot; and somebody might get hurt.  You're allowed to have an article, but now you can't put any content in it, because the known review articles are more than five years old (notability is not temporary, so this doesn't affect notability), or the recent information is on a website or a magazine article (notability doesn't restrict itself to the academic literature), etc. 
We have collectively refused to believe that this disconnect between the guidelines is a problem.  I think it's a problem; I also think that it would be difficult to solve in practice.  This group and the FTN regulars don't appear to want the actual as-written notability guidelines to apply to anything that we think isn't conventional medicine.  And because of NPOV, we're not really going to get community approval to have one notability standard for conventional medicine and a different notability standard for altmed.  So we're stuck, and the short answer to your original question is still:  if it's a disease accepted by conventional medicine, then it's notable, no matter how rare it is.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 04:44, 30 November 2017 (UTC)

 4. There are secondary sources that provide enough content to write the article.

I believe that you will find that my rule #1 is exactly that rule.  &quot;Significant coverage&quot; is supposed to mean &quot;enough to write the article&quot;.  Also, both NORD entries and almost all articles in pop sci magazines are secondary sources.

Given that eoteny in humans is currently C-class, I would ask how relevant one primary article introducing a novel nomenclature for a nebulously defined yndrome could be. If I read it correctly it essentially says they've identified five mutations any of which can delay development, then called the combination of delay with one of those mutations a &quot;complex syndrome&quot;. If others start to use the term, we might find a place for it, but a whole article for a neologism? ser:LeadSongDog|LeadSongDog ser talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl! 19:39, 30 November 2017 (UTC)

 Sourcing question 

The discussion at alk:ʻOumuamua#Is the Inbound Velocity table original research.3F may interest some of you.  It's an interesting case:  Someone has pulled data for an astronomical object from a NASA tool, somewhat similar to how we look up information in the SEER database, and added it to the article.  The ref is a link plus the search parameters.  Nobody doubts the accuracy, relevance, or encyclopedic nature of the data, but an editor wonders whether extracting data from a web-based tool is technically compliant with a strict reading of WP:V.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:55, 30 November 2017 (UTC)

 That isn't quite the issue, or at least not the only one. The question is about an editor searching/plugging into an online calculator and using the results, considered OR? It's not cut and dried, as there has been plenty of criticism of online calculators in this project and others, even as EL entries. In this case, JPL Horizons is about the highest quality orbital calculator you can get. Hence it reduces to if one considers this a routine calculation or one sufficiently complex that it qualifies as OR. --ser:Mark viking|Mark viking (ser talk:Mark viking|talk) 19:45, 1 December 2017 (UTC)
You can plug quite a lot into the SEER database, e.g., to extract [https://seer.cancer.gov/explorer/application.php?site=47&amp;data_type=1&amp;stat_type=2&amp;compareBy=race&amp;chk_sex_3=3&amp;chk_race_5=5&amp;chk_age_range_157=157&amp;advopt_precision=1&amp;advopt_display=1&amp;showDataFor=sex_3_and_age_range_157 only rates of diagnosis for women over a particular age, of a particular race, for a particular kind of cancer in each year], and presumably that trend line is being calculated on the fly, too.

This article seems to focus mostly on the infectious type of CJD, while it is reported that this only makes up &lt;5% of cases.

The lead does not concentrate mostly on the &quot;infectious type&quot;. The symptoms are the same between both, the treatment is the same between both.
And it says &quot;Most cases occur spontaneously, while about 7.5% of cases are inherited from a person's parents in an autosomal dominant manner.&quot;
From what I understand the spontaneous type can turn into the infectious type so no a slit is a bad idea IMO.

Hello again.  This post contains multiple questions so I have numbered them.
#Does anyone currently use these: ser:AlexNewArtBot#Biology_and_medicine (specifically, ser:AlexNewArtBot/MedicineSearchResult or ser:InceptionBot/NewPageSearch/Medicine/log which are filled using articles matching the regexp patterns at ser:AlexNewArtBot/Medicine?
#Has a better tool replaced it?  I'm wondering because the only WikiProject Medicine page I saw linking to it (other than archives) (ser:AlexNewArtBot/MedicineSearchResult) appears to be ikipedia:WikiProject Medicine/Tasks (which itself, or part of it is reported to be transcluded at ikipedia:WikiProject Medicine/Tools, which is what the main project's menu links to (but I still failed to see the link in the latter, interestingly)).
#If this is still considered useful, perhaps links to these could be made more prominent (or the results transcluded on a more prominent page)?
#I'm wondering if the project would also be interested in tracking alternative medicine using this tool.  Various reports I have made here were as a result of pages reported by the WikiProject Skepticism filters which includes some alternate medicine terms (ser:AlexNewArtBot/Skepticism).  While that project also deals with other fringe topics and pseudoscience, it would be possible to create a rules list specific and specialized to finding new articles related to alternate medicine (alternatively, it would be possible to add related terms to the existing main medicine rules).  Of course, this also depends on if the project is interested in tracking new alternative medicine article creations.

 Request for support in 2017 Community Tech Wishlist Survey 

Annually since 2015 the Wikimedia Foundation meta:Community Tech|Community Tech team conducts a survey to select the top 10 community wishes for coding development for Wikimedia editors. I have been pleased with the meta:2015 Community Wishlist Survey/Results|2015 results and the meta:2016 Community Wishlist Survey/Results|2016 results. I recommend checking out past years' wishes for insight into what ideas people have had to improve editor's experiences.

I made a proposal for this year and I am writing to request support for it from my WikiProject Medicine colleagues. Unlike with some other Wikimedia surveys and polls, this one encourages canvassing and soliciting groups to vote. The proposal that I made is of special interest to the development of medical articles.

*meta:2017 Community Wishlist Survey/Programs and events/Development of the programs and events dashboard|Please check and out and hopefully sign on to support - Programs and Events Dashboard
*Check out all wishes at meta:2017 Community Wishlist Survey

The Programs and Events Dashboard is the best available tool for organizing Wikipedia meetups. The iki Education Foundation developed it for enabling classes to edit Wikipedia and for them to help monitor everything. Some of you might remember the chaos in the education program until about 2013; I believe that the reason why we hear fewer complaints is because of this monitoring system. Meanwhile, class participation has increased several fold.

Personally, I used this system to do outreach to medical schools. [https://outreachdashboard.wmflabs.org/campaigns/consumer_reports__health_project/programs Please check out the results which I got], which say that with this monitoring service I was able to coordinate 17 events in which 190 students and participants in higher learning programs added 90,000 words to 525 articles which thereafter got 173 million pageviews. The data is challenging to slice but generally I tried to give slices of the reports to various institutions, like for example, if a school had multiple programs I used this system to report back all that school's activities.

WikiProject Medicine attracts more attention from partner organizations than any other program outside general university outreach. I definitely would not have done outreach of the sort I did without WP:MED backing up my programs and conversations to schools, because I knew I could always send anyone to this board. I think that WikiProject Medicine should take credit for guiding the direction of institutional partnerships and university collaboration in general, just because this project has been so involved. I feel that it is in this projects' interest to see this tool developed. For that reason I am asking for your wikisignature on the support page.

Two of my teammates track this, so I looked in on it earlier today.  I strongly encourage everyone to go to m:2017 Community Wishlist Survey, pick one of the 15 categories, and review the proposals there.  Here are a few notes:

* The big winner (m:2017 Community Wishlist Survey/Tracking|so far):  m:2017_Community Wishlist Survey/Miscellaneous/Kartographer_improvements, which requests improvements for maps.  As the tool can let you define regions and locations on a dynamic map, this might be useful for some epidemiology sections.  This map tool has been popular at multiple wikis, and nobody seems to know what its overall future is.
* m:2017 Community Wishlist Survey/Miscellaneous/Allow 'thanks' notification for a log entry would let you thank someone for moving a page.
* m:2017 Community Wishlist Survey/Watchlists/Multiple watchlists would be handy for people who want to be able to look at articles in different groups.  There's also been talk about making a shared watchlist (imagine WPMED folks being able to share a watchlist of pages with certain types of problems), and this work is likely a prerequisite for this.
* m:2017 Community Wishlist Survey/Watchlists/Automatically unwatch pages after a certain, user defined, amount of time is another perennial power-user request, and would be particularly handy for temporarily watching a page that's affected by current news, but which you don't want to follow indefinitely.
* m:2017 Community Wishlist Survey/Citations/Develop precision of citation by showing which text span the ref applies to has some technical challenges (the &quot;right&quot; way to do this is to blow up the entire wikitext structure) but the overall sentiment is something that most of us can agree with.
* People who care about translation will care about m:2017 Community Wishlist Survey/Multimedia and Commons/SVG-Translate and m:2017 Community Wishlist Survey/Citations/Citations translations. 
* People who care about vandalism will care about m:2017 Community Wishlist Survey/Wikidata/Better countervandalism tools.
* m:2017 Community Wishlist Survey/Miscellaneous/Get feedback using a yes/no microsurveying is a project that I've been advocating for for years now.  I think that a lot of us would benefit from a little box that asks newbies, &quot;Do you need help editing?&quot;, followed by &quot;Ask for help at the P:Teahouse, okay?&quot; 

Voting is quick and easy:  Find something that interests you, click the &quot;Support&quot; button, add a comment if you want (most people don't, and all votes are counted equally regardless of comments), and click the blue &quot;Support&quot; button to save the page.  You can vote for a proposal in less than five seconds.

The top 10 vote-getters – it is a plain majority-rule pproval vote – &quot;win&quot; the right to be &quot;addressed&quot; (i.e., not necessarily implemented) by the Community Tech team.  If you are thinking that the best actical voting|voting strategy is to vote for no more than 10, then I want to say that the fact that there are now 10 proposals mentioned in this section is purely coincidental.  There are more worthy proposals, but I'm out of time.  I strongly encourage you to look through at least one of the categories and make your own choices.  But please do consider voting, even if you don't usually get involved:  Total votes are up this year (about 3500 right now, compared to just 2000 at the same time last year), and I always want this group's voice to get counted.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 19:51, 1 December 2017 (UTC)

Many of you use Article Alerts to get notified of discussions (PRODs and AfD in particular). However, due to our limit resources (one bot coder), not a whole lot of work can be done on Article Alerts to expand and maintain the bot.

So if you make use of Article Alerts and want to keep using it and see it ported to other languages, please eta:2017_Community_Wishlist_Survey/Bots_and_gadgets/Deploy_Article_Alerts_to_other_languages|go and support the proposal.

One prominent example is the development of the treatment for malaria, rtemisinin by China. Another example is that development of treatment for HIV/AIDs was lead by the NIH. 
Some company in the US got exclusivity for showing low dose olchicine was useful despite the med being in use a long long time for gout already.[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4617917/] ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk · pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 16:47, 4 December 2017 (UTC)
Even if we pretended that it was simple to design (multiple) clinical trials, I would think that the first step in the business decision to seek regulatory approval would look a lot more like &quot;How much will it cost us to get this approved as a drug?&quot;  When the answer is &quot;The filing fee is two million dollars, the lawyers are several million dollars, and the present value of the expected profits for our company are much less than that – and we haven't even started in on the cost of the trials&quot;, then no for-profit company is going to even contemplate getting regulatory approval.  They might contemplate a simple clinical trial in the hopes of boosting sales, but they're not going turn it into &quot;a registered product or pproved drug&quot;, which seems to be what the actual subject of the discussion is about.
The diff shows you removing a statement that &quot;there are no patented or approved rugs from tea tree oil&quot;, with this kind of simple business calculation being cited as the main reason.  That companies could choose to produce scientific evidence is pretty much unrelated to the question of whether they could get patent rights or whether they would choose to seek regulatory approval.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:59, 4 December 2017 (UTC)
cArtemesinins are an exceptional, not usual, example (and, btw, it's [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4492341/ not as if there was never anticipation of exclusivity]). The HIV drug example seems like a non sequitur in this discussion - e.g. I personally participated in protests against the drug companies that were charging exorbitant prices for those medicines, i.e. those companies enforced IP rights and market exclusivity even though the NIH funded early work - same was true of many of the HCV antivirals). Colchine is an excellent example of the &quot;novel clinical trial data&quot; path to exclusivity that I mentioned in my immediately previous comment.

[https://omim.org/entry/105500]indicates from clinical synopsis(click orange box)
*Inheritance 
- Autosomal dominant

That doesn't quite reflect the point I am making.  The OMIM reference refers to several primary sources, and shows that they are far from in agreement as to whether this is a genetic disease at all.  There is a familial pattern; one theory - which has been questioned - suggests it is commensal.  My position is that to update the tertiary source - Wikipedia - to indicate (in the infobox) that this is an autosomal dominant disease when the secondary source indicates clearly that there is no consensus that this is the case, is misleading and therefore wrong. ser:Philip Trueman|Philip Trueman (ser talk:Philip Trueman|talk) 15:15, 6 December 2017 (UTC)

 This discussion belongs on the talk page of the article, alk:Lytico-bodig disease. FWIW, it's true that the primary sources disagree markedly on the cause and mechanism of lytico-bodig, and the secondary source OMIM hedges its bets on neurotoxins vs an autosomal dominant disorder without necessarily addressing the findings of what is probably the strongest primary source, mid:11673323. My suggestion would be to rewrite the article to better reflect the uncertainties, but the detail of that really needs to take place at article talk where it won't be archived away within a week. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 15:59, 6 December 2017 (UTC)

 Emotional State 

I've got a simple question which has large implications if the answer is yes.  Anyway, would a persons emotional state be considered a P: MEDRS problem?  --ser:Kyohyi|Kyohyi (ser talk:Kyohyi|talk) 14:44, 6 December 2017 (UTC)
MEDRS applies to general medical statements, not to ones about a single person — otherwise we would not be able to write out cause of death about anyone. However, P:BLP applies and is quite strict when it comes to things such as &quot;emotional state&quot;. Also the spirit of MEDRS ought apply in my reading, for example the following: 
alkquote|Primary sources should not be cited with intent of &quot;debunking&quot;, contradicting, or countering any conclusions made by secondary sources.&quot; 
I'm not sure if that is what you were getting at, or whether something such as &quot;depression&quot; is covered by MEDRS. That is more difficult to say, because the term &quot;clinical depression&quot; isn't validly the only type of depression even in the medical literature, and MEDRS covers more than &quot;just&quot; clinical depression. It all depends on the implication of the statement/series of statements/sentence/paragraph/article and of the health aspects associated with the statements. MEDRS does not cover something like &quot;Happiness is the feeling of&quot;, but may arguably cover &quot;sadness is the psychological state of&quot; and most definitely covers &quot;loneliness is associated with negative health outcomes&quot;. So, your answer is like most of the time: &quot;it depends&quot;, and I'm sorry to say that your question is neither simple nor answerable with a yes/no. ser:CFCF|Carl Fredrikser talk:CFCF| talk 15:03, 6 December 2017 (UTC)
 Alright, let me rephrase the question a bit then.  What type of sourcing would be required to place someone's emotional state on Wikipedia?  Do we need a statement from a professional in the field of psychology?  Or can we just take the statement of a journalist? --ser:Kyohyi|Kyohyi (ser talk:Kyohyi|talk) 15:24, 6 December 2017 (UTC)
 Again, this isn't a simple question. A journalist isn't qualified to make psychological assessments, but I suspect you're considering the case when a journalist interviews or reports on a statement from an expert. While we wouldn't be likely to accept the view of a journalist as to someone's state of mind, the opinion of an expert may be considered a reliable source, although our guidance at P:SPS dismisses self-published sources in BLPs: q|&quot;Never use self-published sources as third-party sources about living people, even if the author is an expert, well-known professional researcher, or writer.&quot; Frankly, if you want the best quality sources (as MEDRS tries to emphasise), you'd be better off looking for a book from a respectable publisher, or something similar to support those sort of claims.
 Actually, I'm looking at a situation that the best I can tell an individual's emotional state has only been evaluated by journalists (In essence I'm not aware of an expert who has weighed in on the subject), and we are in turn adding that descriptor in Wikipedia's voice.  --ser:Kyohyi|Kyohyi (ser talk:Kyohyi|talk) 16:24, 6 December 2017 (UTC)
It looks like you're trying to keep [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zo%C3%AB_Quinn&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=814034521 this claim that she rejected her ex-boyfriend] out of a GamerGate article, which has nothing to do with health and almost nothing to do with his emotional state.  wikt:en:scorned (or any other dictionary) might be particularly informative here; the idea that rejected people are angry is ell hath no fury like a woman scorned|a cultural notion.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:30, 6 December 2017 (UTC)
 You should read the situation a little more thoroughly.  The original statement from DrMies was that he was &quot;a vindictive&quot; ex-boyfriend.  ttps://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zo%C3%AB_Quinn&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=812653458&amp;oldid=811259627.  This was then changed to Scorned after I reverted, and I'm not inclined to believe that the intent was to describe the relationship, but to still describe Eron Gjoni's emotional state.  (In this particular case a book review which used the term to describe Eron Gjoni was applied).  So, no I'm not trying to keep a claim that she rejected her boyfriend from the article.  I simply don't believe that we are using the term scorned in such a manner.  Simply put, I think there's a push to describe Eron Gjoni as angry in some form, and we shouldn't be using book reviews to do so.  --ser:Kyohyi|Kyohyi (ser talk:Kyohyi|talk) 16:48, 6 December 2017 (UTC)
 I'll try to make this as clear as I can: &quot;scorned&quot; is not a state of mind and has nothing to do with MEDRS. If there's a reliable source that describes her ex-boyfriend as as &quot;scorned&quot;, then the only thing that would keep it out of the article is P:DUE. I suggest the editors of that article start a discussion on the article talk page rather than participating in an edit-war. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 17:10, 6 December 2017 (UTC)
 Are you saying then, that scorned doesn't have the implication of being angry.  In essence, saying that a person is scorned doesn't say that a person was rejected, and angry about it.  --ser:Kyohyi|Kyohyi (ser talk:Kyohyi|talk) 17:40, 6 December 2017 (UTC)
Yes:  we (and the dictionaries) are saying that &quot;scorned = rejected&quot;, and that people do not necessarily feel angry about being rejected.  They might, for example, feel sad.  Or surprised.  Or, in a few situations, luster B personality disorder|genuinely relieved.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:22, 6 December 2017 (UTC)

Sure, if your goal is to have fancier sources even when the information is known to be correct, then you could swap in a midwifery textbook such as https://books.google.com/books?id=dbaNAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA663 if you don't like reputable lay books.  It'd also be interesting to cite [https://books.google.com/books?id=nKSZBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA40 Taylor's] for the fact that about 4% of pregnant women are given significantly wrong due dates when LMP is used rather than BBT or ultrasound.

 List of OMIM codes 
How should this be merged in? Does each OMIM code need its own row or can we merge rows where one disorder is associated with more than one gene (e.g. ardet-Biedl syndrome types 1-15)? There are tons of red links in the OMIM list because each type of a disorder is listed separately, and each separate type does not need it's own article. In essence, is it a list of OMIM codes and their associated syndrome, or a list of syndromes and their associated OMIM code(s)? –ser:Natureium|Natureium (ser talk:Natureium|talk) 17:24, 20 November 2017 (UTC)
 Now that I think about it, I think maybe OMIM codes should be a separate list. It's really a list of codes rather than a list of disorders. For example, BN1 is listed on 6 lines with 6 disorders and 6 OMIM codes. I think the purpose of a list of OMIM codes would be to allow someone to look something up by code.

Tables
The Help page provides this as its first example (i.e., the one almost everyone copies):

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Header 1
! Header 2
! Header 3
|-
| row 1, cell 1
| row 1, cell 2
| row 1, cell 3
|-
| row 2, cell 1
| row 2, cell 2
| row 2, cell 3
|}


VisualEditor currently produces this in the wikitext mode:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ Caption
! Header cell !! Header cell
|-
| Content cell || Content cell
|}


and this in the visual mode:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!
!
!
!
|-
|
|
|
|
|-
|
|
|
|
|-
|
|
|
|
|}

In other words, where accessibility is concerned, all of the editing environments behave the same. 

You're right that elp:Table contains a hatnote link to a page that contains information about how to mark scope.  (The same hatnote contains links to two other pages that don't.)  But the information in the help page itself does not contain any of that information.  If you want to this markup to be used, then IMO you need to actually change the help page itself, so that experienced editors will see this markup as being normal and recommended.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:57, 16 November 2017 (UTC)

 The ikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility/Data tables tutorial link gives the following basic example:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ [caption text]
|-
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | [column header 1]
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | [column header 2]
! scope=&quot;col&quot; | [column header 3]
|-
! scope=&quot;row&quot; | [row header 1]
| [normal cell 1,2] || [normal cell 1,3]
|-
! scope=&quot;row&quot; | [row header 2]
| [normal cell 2,2] || [normal cell 2,3]
...
|}

 That is canonical as far as accessible tables are concerned. It's also canonical as far as I'm concerned. If you think that some other pages need to be updated to reflect the consensus of our Manual of Style, then IMO m|you need to change those pages, for exactly the reasons you give. See P:SOFIXIT, and ask yourself why it's always somebody else's job to try to improve accessibility on Wikipedia. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 22:06, 16 November 2017 (UTC)
I agree that it's a better approach, but I'm frankly not sure that the core community will accept it.  I'm not volunteering to get yelled at this week, so I'm not going to push that approach to the other pages.  And by &quot;not sure that they'll accept it&quot;, I mean that it's not even being followed in Featured Articles, all of which are theoretically supposed to comply with every single page of the MOS.  See, for example, lzheimer's disease, cute myeloid leukemia, holangiocarcinoma, engue fever, ndometrial cancer, untington's disease, nfluenza, ung cancer – every single FA that I've checked from the list at ikipedia:Featured articles#Health and medicine either has no tables or fails to mark the column or row scopes.  I also mean that the column scope (which should be more common than row scope) appears in fewer than one out of 3,000 of articles.  For comparison, I believe there are tables in about one out of seven of articles (not including infoboxes or other tables constructed via templates).  The fact that some editor [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Accessibility/Data_tables_tutorial&amp;diff=671229974&amp;oldid=671229810 boldly slapped a guideline template at he top of the page] two years ago, without any P:PROPOSAL or even a discussion on the talk page, does not mean that the community accepts or supports this particular page (or even knows about it, which I suspect is the bigger problem).
But my point is about your comment above, which advocated against creating tables in one piece of software.  I hope that, since I've shown that all of the editing environments produce equally inaccessible code, you can agree that the visual editor is no worse (if also no better) for creating tables than the other options.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:17, 17 November 2017 (UTC)

 The page at P:DTT gives a more in-depth explanation of ikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility #Tables, but the latter page contains exactly the same example. I hope you're not going to suggest next that ikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility doesn't enjoy project-wide consensus?
 You'll note that the Featured Article process doesn't insist on images having P:Alternative text for images text, either – despite ikipedia:Manual of Style/Accessibility #Images being clear that q|&quot;Images that are not purely decorative should include an alt attribute that acts as a substitute for the image for blind readers, search-spiders, and other non-visual users.&quot;, and ikipedia:Featured article criteria requiring that q|&quot;It follows the ikipedia:Manual of Style|style guidelines&quot;. Your point that the FAC process regularly falls below its own requirements when it comes to accessibility is understood, and I'm only too well-aware of it. But just because the FAC process has been poor at improving accessibility doesn't meant everybody else should be as well.
 It doesn't have to be that way, and assistive software doesn't have to produce inaccessible markup. In the days when I used to use reamweaver to create webpages, it wouldn't allow me to add an image without explicitly supplying something for the alt text.
 I agree that the visual editor is no worse than other pieces of software that automatically create tables. I hope you will agree in turn that manually creating a table by adapting one of the accessible examples produces far more accessible tables, so that particular other option is preferable. You might like to consider as well whether there is any need for the visual editor to create tables that don't meet our standards for accessibility. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 19:16, 17 November 2017 (UTC)
I hope that everyone follows all of the advice from P:ACCESS.  But the fact remains that the community isn't actually doing this particular thing, which means that there is no evidence of community support for doing it.  To put it more bluntly, &quot;our standards for accessibility&quot; do not appear to include accessible tables.  If accessible tables were actually part of our standards, then we'd actually use them in a lot more than 0.003% of articles.  The community's practice, rather than a written page, is still the ultimate source of, and the most accurate measure of, &quot;our standards&quot;.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 04:36, 18 November 2017 (UTC)
d De facto, only some parts of the MOS are considered mandatory at FA level.

 eply to |WhatamIdoing Meeting the standards outlined by CAG for all websites ought not to be beyond the capability of a site as large and important as Wikipedia. Failing to meet those standards results in a poorer experience for those whose disabilities include blindness and other visual impairments. To be honest, I'm not prepared to accept people's excuses for not doing their very best to improve the experience of disadvantaged visitors. OS:ACCESS is part of our standards, and it is sad that it is ignored so often. Our editing community ought to be ashamed of that fact, not promoting it as an excuse.
 eply to |Jo-Jo Eumerus The reason some parts of ACCESS are ignored at FAC is that it's hard to acquire the skills to produce good P:alternative text for images. That resulted in some very over-prescriptive advice a few years ago, and the push-back resulted in the dropping of P:ALT from the requirements. But understand this: just because something is difficult, it doesn't mean it's not worth doing. An image with good alt text and a properly marked-up table make the experience of reading an article much more pleasant for the visually impaired. Featured articles that fail to do that do not represent Wikipedia's best work, and the fact that these shortcomings are accepted does not stop them being shortcomings. Yes, the MOS is too long and too pedantic, but that does not grant a licence to ignore it when it's inconvenient, nor when its benefit is only apparent to a very small minority of disadvantaged visitors. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 18:16, 18 November 2017 (UTC)

Well, if you're feeling cynical, then the evaluation could effectively be done with a single question:  Does it claim that all abortions are always harmless?  If yes, then it's a good source, and if no, then it's a bad one.
MID|23859662 appears to be a standard systematic review, about psychiatry and published in a psychiatry journal, by researchers with suitable degrees and working in a relevant field.  For those who believe that the P:Impact factor is a magic number, then the journal's impact factor is a bit below median for the field of psychiatry and rather above the median for psychology.  The ISI Journal Citation Reports ranking for 2016 was 83rd out of 142 psychiatry journals, which puts it in the middle quintile (barely) of all psychiatry journals.  It seems to be listed in MedLine, and it meets all of the other superficial &quot;rules&quot;, at least until this time next year, when someone will doubtless complain that it's five and a half years old, and that MEDRS &quot;requires&quot; five years or less.

We already discussed that exact reference ikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine/Archive_102#Sources_about_PTSD_and_abortion|here.  Barbara actually just found a very recent source that for some reason she is not bringing here (but that she is very familiar with as she cited it 10 times at iscarriage and mental illness and three times at iscarriage and grief and also at the PTSD article [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Posttraumatic_stress_disorder&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=814140426&amp;oldid=814138948 here]. That ref is MID|27838460 (published feb 2017) and it says: q|The PTSD diagnosis differs from all other psychiatric disorders (expect for acute stress disorder) in that it requires exposure to a traumatic event which then serves as the source of all flashbacks and other re-experiencing symptoms. Thus, it is essential to the validity of the PTSD diagnosis that systematic reviews ensure that the studies reviewed are based on events that do in fact qualify as traumatic, rather than just stressful. The psychological response to induced abortion is not consistent with that found after acute loss or other traumatic events, and PTSD is much less common (Broen, Moum, Bødtker, &amp; Ekeberg, 2004; Hamama et al., 2010). These differences suggest that it is problematic to combine non-medical induced abortion with spontaneous abortion and other types of acute loss

I have not decided what articles to use this in. It's been removed from PTSD for reasons explained above. The review article  also states that the percentage of those who have medically induced abortions have less of a chance in developing PTSD when compared to those experiencing a spontaneous abortion ten months to five years later (perhaps not so fringe?) I'm not as familiar with P:RSN as I should be. Since many medical editors read this talk page rather than the RSN page, I thought this talk page would give me some better feedback. I'm concerned, periodically, that we often judge references that may not agree with 'fringe' or not-so-popular topics to be inferior, even if they meet guidelines for inclusion. Every once in a while, a reliable source (graduate, medical textbook) mentions the fact that some people benefit from Zinc supplements or probiotics (gasp). Or if you don't agree with the last statement, let's pretend that some reliable sources someday mentions that a 'fringe' topic might work for some people. What then? Since we at WP have decided that the whole topic is fringe - then there will never be a source good enough to support content that might hint at such a thing. It is a disservice to readers and researchers to not include a source that may not agree with others. Such a situation can be remedied in the text of an article by conveying the fact that this information is not supported by the majority of other researchers.

The question originally was to assess the source and discuss whether or not to use it in a number of articles. It has a lot of content, most of which doesn't address medically induced abortion. It is an review article on pregnancy loss and the psychological sequelae after pregnancy loss. I don't know if you read a comment from above where I mention that the source says that those who have a medically induced abortion do NOT tend to have PTSD further out from the event compared to those who miscarry (spontaneous abortion). See? I can't use the source to say that those who have pregnancy loss through an induced abortion get PTSD afterwards because the source doesn't say that. Take a deep breath. There is no agenda here, at least on my part. Basically the source reviews the connection between pregnancy loss and PTSD. Not politics, not fetal pain, not propaganda just information.

P:MEDRS exists for very good reason: there's a LOT of crap published, we need expert reviewers to examine publications and publish their reviews, otherwise we don't know which primary publications are gold among the dross.

Disease versus infectious agent articles
We often have an article for both the disease and the infectious agent. IMO we may need clearer guidelines around what is included in each to reduce overlap. For example:

oa loa

oa loa filariasis

There are other more obvious cases for separate articles, such as BV as cause of ononucleosis, airy leukoplakia, and pstein–Barr_virus#Role_in_disease|others - some of which illustrate the many-to-many relationships like BV and MV, each of which can cause ononucleosis.

 SUL accounts 

If you're seeing notifications about &quot;new&quot; accounts at wikis you've never visited, this is expected.

Some wikis use pecial:Import to make local copies of the entire history of translated pages.  (This isn't required by the license, and the English Wikipedia normally doesn't do it, but each wiki makes its own choices.)  There's a maintenance script running to connect these imported revisions to your normal account.

 Nonconfirming Animal Research on Resveratrol 
a|Resveratrol

esveratrol was a nearly unknown dietary supplement until a 2006 report that it increased lifespan in mice; the media seized on this report, often without mentioning that the mice were obese and diabetic and sitll lived short lives even after supplementation. This resulted in a huge surge of sales of resveratrol sales, which continues to this day. &quot;The global resveratrol supply market is valued at $50.2m (€40m) according to a Frost and Sullivan report, with 90% of volumes accounted for by the US food supplements market.&quot;[https://www.nutraingredients.com/Article/2012/06/13/US-dominates-global-resveratrol-market] (2012)

What has gotten a lot less attention is that at least four subsequent lifespan studies in lean, genetically normal mice and rats have failed to demonstrate any increase in lifespan.

The [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Resveratrol&amp;oldid=814759885 latest revision] of the article says only,

There is no evidence for an effect of resveratrol on lifespan in humans sof|2011|lc=y.ite journal | author = Fernández AF, Fraga MF | title = The effects of the dietary polyphenol resveratrol on human healthy aging and lifespan | journal = Epigenetics | volume = 6 | issue = 7 | pages = 870–4 | date = Jul 2011 | pmid = 21613817 | doi = 10.4161/epi.6.7.16499 | last2 = Fraga 

The lack of evidence on human lifespan will not be convincing to proponents, as it can rightly be said to be rgumentum ex silentio, since no human lifespan studies have been conducted. Because of the history and ongoing sales of a likely-useless dietary supplement, I thought it to be of significant public interest to highlight the non-replication of the animal research. In [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Resveratrol&amp;oldid=814757418 this edit], I added:

This was reverted by user ser:Zefr, on the otherwise-reasonable grounds that medical articles should rely on human research. But, again, in this case  non-replication of the animal lifespan study is of public interest. I would like an opinion on making an exception to the general rule in this case.ser:Mikalra|Mikalra (ser talk:Mikalra|talk) 22:40, 10 December 2017 (UTC)

 I think you'll need to go to the section esveratrol #Dietary supplements and tell the story of the mice there. There is already some background to the hyping of the chemical in that section, so it would make sense to also make the point about the lack of evidence even in mice when they are healthy. I would also recommend copying much of your post here to a new section on the article talk page. It's a kindness to other editors of the article to have any further discussion in a relevant place where it won't be archived away in a few days' time.
