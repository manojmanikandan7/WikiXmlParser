Johnson

Samuel Johnson, most well known person with Tourette syndrome, is just about FAC-ready if anyone wants to have a look.  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 04:50, 20 August 2008 (UTC)
Yup, as Johnson said to Boswell, encouraging him to comment at FAC: &quot;I would rather be attacked than unnoticed. For the worst thing you can do to an author is to be silent as to his works.&quot; Of course, Johnson also remarked rather famously that no man but a blockhead ever wrote except for money, which explains a lot about Wikipedia. MastCell Talk 05:46, 20 August 2008 (UTC)

Scope:  Involuntary celibacy

An banner-spamming anon has repeatedly placed the WPMED tag on .  Involuntary celibacy, according to the article, is not having sex for at least six months due to the lack of a suitable sexual partner.  

It is the anon's apparent position that this is an issue of sexual health.  What are the opinions of the members of this project?  Is involuntary celibacy a disease or medical condition?  Is this article within the scope of this project?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 02:02, 6 September 2008 (UTC)

Undue Weight in schizophrenia article

[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Schizophrenia&amp;diff=236598038&amp;oldid=236597451 the difference] between these two versions is, I feel, giving undue weight to the latter version. More eyes would be nice. Cheers, Casliber (talk · ) 06:04, 6 September 2008 (UTC)
Phenylpropanolamine is well known to cause psychiatric effects, as does dextromethorphan when abused—plenty of literature on both—, but guaifenesin? I don't think so. Probably a misunderstanding as many DXM preparations also contain guaifenesin. Fvasconcellos (t·) 14:52, 6 September 2008 (UTC)
 Most strange.  Guaifenesin is specifically recommended over other medications for individuals with Tourette syndrome because it allegedly causes less exacerbation of symptoms.  I periodically unwatch Schizophrenia because I'm so busy elsewhere now; do I need to re-watch?  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 18:08, 6 September 2008 (UTC)
I doubt it, Sandy. Many of us already watch the article and any problems with it tend to arise here anyway :) Your choice, though. It depends if you want to be the one to change it or not! —Cyclonenim (talk ·  · ) 21:05, 6 September 2008 (UTC)

Multiple sclerosis


[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Multiple_sclerosis&amp;diff=236621238&amp;oldid=236541177 This edit] added a link to a foundation/trust that helps the sufferers of MS. This isn't allowed per , is it? —Cyclonenim (talk ·  · ) 10:45, 6 September 2008 (UTC)

I saw this as well but was hesitant, as you probably were as well, because it is a good cause. Still, this is purely promotional and should indeed probably be avoided. Many of our articles contain links to foundations; should we try to bring some consistency into this? I think some foundations deserve a mention in EL if they are highly prominent, whereas others probably should not be mentioned. There is often a problem that only US or US and UK foundations are mentioned, which constitutes a limited geographical scope. --Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 12:13, 6 September 2008 (UTC)

Dehydration needs review

Dehydration could use some overall cleanup.
In particular, it contains the line &quot;It is often thought that the sudden influx of salt into the body from seawater will cause the cells to dehydrate and the kidneys to overload and shut down but it has been calculated that an average adult can drink up to 0.2 liters of seawater per day before the kidneys start to fail&quot;, which is tagged as needing a cite. --  (talk) 23:07, 6 September 2008 (UTC)
Well, obviously the amount of seawater you could &quot;safely&quot; drink in a day is highly dependent on how much fresh water you're taking in. I will try to take a look. MastCell Talk 00:12, 7 September 2008 (UTC)

Blood glucose monitoring

I saw the comment at the top of the Blood glucose monitoring article on the idea of merging it with the Blood glucose article. The latter is a much more scientific article while the former one is an article more geared toward average users. I feel they should stand separate from each other.

One suggestion I had was to break SEPARATE from Blood glucose monitoring the entire topic on Continuous Blood Glucose Monitoring (more commonly referred to as Continuous Glucose Monitoring), since it's becoming an ever increasing technology that many diabetes patients are using BESIDES their regular meters. Thoughts? manny (talk) 01:03, 22 August 2008 (UTC)


I think that the articles Blood glucose monitoring and glucose meter could easily be merged.  However, the monitoring blood glucose deserves it's own page in my opinion. Zoork34 (talk) 04:44, 10 September 2008 (UTC) —Preceding  comment added by Zoork34 (talk •  19:19, 2 September 2008

Cooking#Health_effects

Cooking#Health effects is interesting for what it doesn't mention.  Can anyone else spell infectious disease?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 05:06, 30 August 2008 (UTC)
Yeah, I had noticed that section when it popped up on my mercola.com spam detector. It is a bit one-sided. I would suggest a controlled trial in which participants are randomized to raw or cooked beef, with a primary endpoint of overall survival. That should solve things. Lacking that, we could at least balance it a bit with existing data. MastCell Talk 05:18, 30 August 2008 (UTC)
The devil is in the details.  There is a classical French dish of raw beef.  And raw beef is used in some Japanese dishes also.  It is safe if the animal was healthy, the meat was handled properly, and time to plate is kept short.  Unless you grow your own beef, such meat can be very expensive, though.  -Una Smith (talk) 22:11, 30 August 2008 (UTC)

I was just drug into some mess at raw foodism, in case anyone is inclined to peek in there.  I'm uninterested.  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 11:34, 11 September 2008 (UTC)

FAs needing review

A Wikimania [http://www.kaltura.com/devwiki/index.php/The_quality_of_scientific_articles_on_the_English_Wikipedia talk on the quality of Wikipedia's scientific articles] by a biochemist, discussing the high quality of our scientific .

Praise for our developed content, not so for our undeveloped content.  He singled out breast cancer as particularly bad, and mentions DNA repair, which is an older FA and needs review.  

By the way, these are our oldest medical FAs that haven't been reviewed, it would be stupendous if they could be reviewed and restored without :



Now that Helicobacter pylori has been restored to status, I will probably submit Chagas disease to  next; speak now or forever hold your peace. SandyGeorgia (Talk) 17:46, 10 September 2008 (UTC)
FYI: I worked quite a bit on Chagas a few weeks ago (with help from FV and Arcadian). I think it has improved a lot, you might take a second look. An FAR probably wouldn't hurt though.--DO11.10 (talk) 18:05, 10 September 2008 (UTC)

Sandy, are you sure that Menstrual cycle actually passed FA on the date given above?  Here's the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Menstrual_cycle&amp;oldid=671304 article on that date].  I know that our standards have gotten higher... but that much higher?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 20:15, 10 September 2008 (UTC)
 That was an RBP.  To make a long story short, it's not easy to tell when they passed and digging up the actual date in 2003 is a bear, but they generally all need work.  When we built articlehistories, we put a general date on some of them to save time.  (Yes, that much higher.  You may be surprised even to see some of what passed in 2006; standards are much improved, and Medicine helped lead the way :-))  The reason I suggested getting Chagas out of the way first is that it's on , while menstrual cycle isn't (that just means that when the list was generated at the end of 2005 when inline citation requirements changed, Chagas had less than 10 inlines, while Menstrual cycle had more than 10).  If Chagas is cleared, Medicine has nothing left on the citations list, which is winding down, and we can move on to Menstrual cycle (or whichever we think most urgent from the list above).  I'll look at Chagas; do you all think we can avoid FAR or will a FAR help it?  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 02:07, 11 September 2008 (UTC)

 I started in on Chagas disease, left an inline query for someone to resolve, and found a bigger problem.  Is it Chagas disease or Chagas' disease?  Does the article need to be renamed/moved to include the apostrophe?  Isn't there a convention about no apostrophes in eponymous names, even though ICD seems to use them?  Unsure what to do with this, need consensus.  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 02:20, 11 September 2008 (UTC)
Accurate and complete answer:  There is no convention for eponymous names -- neither in the real world nor on Wikipedia.
Possibly less unhelpful response:  Some people use the possessive for diseases named after a patient and omit the possessive for diseases named after a researcher.  In that system, it's Down syndrome, but Lou Gehrig's disease.  
In the specific case, the CDC, WHO, and eMedicine pages all use the non-possessive name, so I would not add the apostrophe.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 03:06, 11 September 2008 (UTC)
 But the ICD does use the apostrophe, and someone added it throughout, so we either need to remove it, or we need to rename the article.  Right now, the article usage disagrees with the article name.  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 09:50, 11 September 2008 (UTC)
A recent comment on the  gave quite a good rationale for why the apostrophe appears sometimes and not others: pronunciation. Much nonsense has been written wrt whether the possessive form is appropriate for physician-eponymous diseases -- in fact there are so few patient-eponymous diseases that you can count them on one hand, so that can't explain the variation. I reckon the apostrophe gets dropped on Chagas disease because you don't hear it and because many folk won't even know it is eponymous. I say we drop it on that article, consistently. BTW: it was  who [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chagas_disease&amp;diff=144007072&amp;oldid=143941896 added] the ' throughout. Colin°Talk 10:40, 11 September 2008 (UTC)
The literature almost uniformly uses the non-possessive form, most notably the WHO and English-language literature from Portuguese- and Spanish-speaking sources. I say we follow the convention. Fvasconcellos (t·) 12:56, 11 September 2008 (UTC)
I checked and I used Chagas' in my PhD thesis, probably following the lead of my supervisor (eg ). However, looking at the literature we are in a minority, so it should probably be switched back to the non-apostrophe form. Tim Vickers (talk) 18:41, 11 September 2008 (UTC)
 Thanks, Tim; unless someone else gets to it sooner, I'll work on it later tonight.  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 18:43, 11 September 2008 (UTC)

I have been working in Multiple sclerosis, and solved the problems in half of the sections (probably the easiest ones). It will take me two months more or less to fix the remaining sections (Causes, pathophisiology and prognosis) and any help would be welcomed, but I think I can take it to actual FA standards.--Garrondo (talk) 08:31, 11 September 2008 (UTC)

Sure. JFW | T@lk 23:30, 11 September 2008 (UTC)
I cannot think of any particularly useful sources.  Late diagnosis is a significant problem in so many diseases, but the reasons why diagnosis is late are so diverse.  And  early diagnosis is not without problems of its own.  Then there is overdiagnosis.  Perhaps all of them should be considered together, under Diagnostic dilemma or a similar title. --Una Smith (talk) 21:40, 12 September 2008 (UTC)

Would anyone mind if I MfD an unused redirect, ?  It's long-standing, but the only link is to an archive of this talk page. 

Normally I wouldn't bother, but it's existence has once or twice resulted in having our banner appear twice on an article's talk page, as the connection between the two wasn't apparently obvious enough (and people, including myself, don't use the preview button often enough).  WhatamIdoing (talk) 06:17, 13 September 2008 (UTC)

Some are such exceptionally broad topics that it is actually pretty hard to find authoritative sources that are strong enough to support them. I'll try to expand respiratory failure and coma because they are of current relevance to my job. I'm sure Delldot will swallow the bait and deal with physical trauma.

2008 Chatsworth Metrolink collision

This article has been tagged for this project under the &quot;Emergency medicine and EMS task force&quot;. Is this an appropriate tag? --NE2 03:29, 14 September 2008 (UTC)

I agree that this is silly. Does that mean every single incident where EMS are called now needs to be tagged under this Wikiproject? I can't possibly see the point in that. I would limit tagging to topics that have greatly influenced the development of emergency/prehospital medicine as a field. JFW | T@lk 06:29, 14 September 2008 (UTC)

Given that it happened not quite two days ago, &quot;lessons learned&quot; is clearly premature.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 05:31, 15 September 2008 (UTC)

Posthumous diagnosis

Over in the land of literature we've been dealing with the posthumous diagnosis of Tourette's Syndrome for Dr Johnson. For those of us who know FA about such things a Posthumous diagnosis article would be helpful. It would probably be best written by people who don't usually spend their time grappling with reclusive poets' second-rate love-lives. Like you guys, for example almost-instinct 22:44, 7 September 2008 (UTC)

Hmm, maybe an article.  Rather some guideline, I'd say.  One does get tired of the lists of Famous People with XXX-diagnosis, when said famous people died centuries before the diagnosis ever was defined.  These &quot;diagnoses&quot; are often based on speculation in some article or other, solely speculation.

Thanks, Graham.  I think on this occasion I have helped Wikipedia, and perhaps also this project, which (excuse me folks) sometimes puts solidarity ahead of quality.  DYK &quot;hooks&quot; appear on the main page and are intended to excite interest and attract attention, and for that reason they must be neutral and factual.

Hyperandrogenism

I'm posting this here to attract attention to an ignored topic (symptom? syndrome?), one which currently does not have its own article. I hope that some knowledgeable people will add to the stub article I've created, hopefully providing citations as they go. (I unfortunately don't have a textbook on hand to cite the information presented.)

Hyperandrogenism used to redirect to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). It finally has its own article, but it's a stub. Hyperandrogenism (elevated levels of androgens) is a symptom, not a syndrome or a disease in and of itself, and it certainly isn't a synonym for PCOS. If it were, what then would hyperandrogenism (i.e. &quot;PCOS&quot;) be called in males? Anabolic steroid use, perhaps? 

The androgen article has information about androgen insensitivity, but no information about hyperandrogenism. I've concluded that information on hyperandrogenism is currently lacking on Wikipedia. Please add to the hyperandrogenism article, especially if you consider yourself knowledgeable about the topic. Thanks.

Cheers,

* It might have been caused by the injections, perhaps depending on what kind of injections. Ask your ophthalmologist.

Everything that is currently tagged with a template as from the CDC-PHIL is in , I've done most of the re-tagging/moving of images in that category.

Convert the TIFF image in MSPaint (GIMP removes the metadata on me) and upload the updated version if needed; 4. If the uploaded image finds a dupe then tag one for deletion, otherwise try to link any similar/dupe images in the other versions line; 5. Repeat for each image in the category you're working.

Image needs replacement

Hello all... 

An image used in the Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder treatments article, specifically , has a little bit of a licensing issue.  The image was uploaded back when the rules around image uploading were less restrictive.  It is presumed that the uploader was willing to license the picture under the GFDL license but was not clear in that regard.  As such, the image, while not at risk of deletion, is likely not clearly licensed to allow for free use in any future use of this article.  If anyone has an image that can replace this, or can go take one and upload it, it would be best.

Eucalyptus oil a conventional medicine

It was suggested that I discuss this subject in the Doctors Mess if I disputed a fellow editors decision to exclude Eucalyptus oil from the Wikiproject Medicine banner on the basis that it should not be considered as a conventional medicine. 

However, it appears that eucalyptus oil is indeed a conventional pharmaceutical on this basis:

1. Medicinal quality of Eucalyptus oil is specified by minimum standards defined in the British, United Sates and other pharmacopoeias (Boland et al, 1991) and cited in the Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology[http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=846202].

2. &quot;Eucalyptus oil&quot; is included as an active ingredient in pharmaceutical products [http://www.rowlandspharmacy.co.uk/department/decongestants/index.cfm] [http://www.deliverypharmacy.co.uk/Pharmacy/Nasal_Decongestants.html].

3. The efficacy of eucalyptus oil is supported by pharmacological research[http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1094553904000562][http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0954611103914326].

4. Products containing eucalyptus oil as an active ingredient are recommended by doctors to patients.

5. Eucalyptus oil has a long history of use by surgeons and the medical fraternity (see history in Eucalyptus oil article).

I think the confusion by the fellow wiki editor appears to be a result of branding issues (but not based on evidence of EO as a pharmaceutucal active), and also a confusion between essential oils and homeopathics (which are quite different of course). Of course, eucalyptus oil is also used in natural therapies, however this does not automatically exclude an ingredient as a conventional pharmaceutical as well, if that ingredient is used in conventional pharmaceuticals as an active ingredient. 

I recently spoke to my local pharmacist and he is of the opinion that eucalyptus oil as an active ingredient within a pharmaceutical product should be most definately considered conventional, as it is a recognized active ingredient in pharmaceutical products that are also recommended by doctors to patients attending their pharmacy, and because it had a defined pharmaceutical standards per the BP, and is used in pharmaceutical-style products. 

Of course, pharmaceutical products containing eucalyptus oil are sold over-the-counter but that has no bearing as to whether it's considered pharmaceutical or not, as many other conventional pharmaceutical medications are also sold over the counter.

Given the evidence, I find it hard to see how eucalyptus oil can be excluded from conventional status.

I would appreciate any comments. Thank you.John Moss (talk) 05:50, 30 September 2008 (UTC)

I agree that eucalyptus oil is mostly something used in complementary and alternative medicine but also has strict pharmacological and medical applications. Even if that weren't true, CAM is still a part of medicine. --Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 18:36, 30 September 2008 (UTC)

Thanks for that Steven - that's very helpful. I'm also curious to know if any Wiki physicians actually recommend pharmaceuticals containing eucalyptus oil? Maybe as a decongestant or topical for muscular pain.
Thanks once again. Cheers.John Moss (talk) 22:05, 30 September 2008 (UTC)

Let's have one discussion, please, at .  Steven, perhaps you'd like to add your comments to that page, and perhaps expand on them to name the conventional medical applications of this herbal preparation.  You might also like to have a look at  to see the standard divisions between the projects.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 05:43, 1 October 2008 (UTC)

Hi WhatamIdoing, just a technical correction: an essential oil is not usually considered a &quot;herbal preperation&quot; per the school of herbalism. Herbalists tend to use whole leaf tinctures etc, and specifically the standards in the BP and other pharmacopoeia are defined by measurable quantities of isolates per conventional medication standards - unlike herbalism which shys away from isolates.
Also I checked the WikiProject Medicine, and it does say there is scope for both categories. Eucalyptus oil is a widely used pharmaceutical ingredient in decongestants and topicals for treating musculoskeletal pain, and as Steven says with &quot;strict pharmacological and medical applications.&quot; If eucalyptus oil is used in a conventional pharmaceutical product, supported by pharmacological research, recommended by doctors, than surely it's a conventional medication.
Also, if you refer to the history of eucalyptus oil in the article, you will see that it's grounded in conventional medication - not alternative therapies. It was surgeons and pharmacists who originally initiated the development of eucalyptus oil. Eucalyptus oil by itself never existed as a folk remedy - the distillation of eucalyptus oil was first done by surgeons. It's actually drifted from conventional into alternative therapy use. Not the other way. And that conventional history is also why there are very well established standards for eucalyptus oil in pharmacopoeias and explains why it's still uesd in pharmaceutical products.
WhatIamdoing, it was your original suggestion to flag the issue in the Doctors Mess, and I fully concur with that. We need to flag the issue with physicians to get fresh perspectives. Why change that now?John Moss (talk) 08:46, 1 October 2008 (UTC)
It's one thing to point everyone to an ongoing suggestion, it's a bad idea to discuss in several places at the same time. Article specific issues should be discussed on the talk page. --Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 18:05, 1 October 2008 (UTC)

Position of &quot;toxicology&quot; infobox

Are there any strict rules (or even guidelines) governing the position of a template like ?

The article Oxygen toxicity that I'm working on has expanded and I'd like to add more images, but they are related to topics near the top of the article. Since the  box is quite long, it moves all the images down (particularly on wide screens) and disconnects them with their topics. Is there any reason why the  box should not be lower down the page, perhaps even in the References section?

I am asking here in case there's already a consensus that requires the box to be near the top of the page for consistency with other articles. Thanks for any help --RexxS (talk) 09:56, 4 October 2008 (UTC)

 I don't know if there are any guidelines, but I personally prefer the ones at the bottom of the page, like the oxygen toxicity page also already has. The one at the top could easily be merged into the one at the bottom. --WS (talk) 11:09, 4 October 2008 (UTC)

 wants infoboxes at the top.  Editorial judgment is still appropriate.  Have you tried putting some of the images on the left?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:41, 4 October 2008 (UTC)

Thanks - that was a good heads-up! I found this: &quot;Vertical navigational boxes, sometimes called &quot;sidebars&quot;, and horizontal navigational boxes are sometimes placed in the lead, especially when no infobox is present. If an infobox is present, the navigation sidebar may be moved to either the top or bottom of any other section in the article.&quot; As there is an infobox in Oxygen toxicity and the problem is the navbox (even though I called it infobox), it looks like I can move it. Although, I'm also attracted to the idea of some images on the left. Only problem there is when you look at the page in 800x600 resolution. --RexxS (talk) 17:37, 4 October 2008 (UTC)

As far as I know there isn't any official policy preferring right sided or bottom navigation boxes. WP:ACCESS only says they can be in the lead. However they might be problematic especially with regard to accessibility, because they take up large part of the screen on low resolutions, and for people with screenreaders, they put a lot of stuff before the actual article. Most discussions I have seen therefore seem to favour bottom of article navigational boxes. --WS (talk) 22:54, 4 October 2008 (UTC)

Looking at the HTML content of the article at present, the infobox comes first, then the side navbox. The bottom navboxes are almost at the end of the page content, so I concur with WS's view. However, I quite like the comprehensive content of the side 'toxicology' navbox. If the bottom 'poison &amp; toxicology' navbox had the same content, it would be no contest - the bottom box would be my choice. I'm therefore attracted by WS's other suggestion: to merge the content of the side one into the bottom one. But then I would be changing a template in use on other pages - would that cause problems for others? or can I just go ahead and do it? Any advice appreciated and thanks again --RexxS (talk) 00:09, 5 October 2008 (UTC)
Value of Epocrates external links

I'd like to hear some opinions on using [https://online.epocrates.com/home Epocrates] in external links. Me and others have seen several links to this site appearing in external link sections, and the question arises how these should be treated. Epocrates Inc. provides free medical information in a partnership with the BMJ Group.

I think there could be two conclusions:
# This is a useful resource, similar to eMedicine and maybe more so that GPNotebook (both of which are linked from  and have their own templates. Therefore, this should be treated similarly, or at least not be deleted as &quot;spam&quot;.
# This external site provides little extra on top of what a featured Wikipedia article would contain, and should be treated as spam (and maybe a request should be made to add it to the spam blacklist).

I myself am not completely sure, or else I wouldn't ask. A first look reveals that this site contains some interesting features (like images of pills, drug interactions etc.) and a useful organisation which makes me lean towards option nr. 1. --Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 14:05, 4 October 2008 (UTC)

Computer vision syndrome merger to Asthenopia

&quot;medical billing resentment&quot; syndrome, MBR

DIAGNOSIS and CAUSES:
Patients hide painful conditions, (like arthritis pain,) well know danger signs, (like frequent urination,) and chronic conditions, or genetic predispositions, (like incidence of hypertension in progenitors,) and other life-limiting conditions that should be treated, because they have had ruinous prior experience with medical billing procedures.  Persons afflicted with MBR eschew timely treatment and contrive actions detrimental to their personal well being,  As the incidence MBR grows, public health will become endangered.

MBR is thought by some students to originate in the insurance companies selling their financial service as a useful service.  Spreading the risk of potentially catastrophic health care cost to a large population is sold as a useful service.  Historically, however, most peoples interactions with medical billing and insurance companies lead to the conclusion that bureaucracies, public and private, are greedy to collect money, and miserly to dispense treatment.  &quot;What happens to me is never covered!&quot;

While most people want to contribute their fair share to meeting societies health care needs, they feel that they are being held up for lavish pay to insurance executives et cetera.  

As medical finance bureaucracies prosper richly by using elaborate and deceptive financial procedures, resentment festers in both the healthy and afflicted.  As unmitigated resentment lingers endemic, the population suffers apathetic atrophy rather than suffer at the hands of exploiters. 

PRESCRIPTION:
A sick and hurting population calls out, &quot;Prompt and effective reform of all predatory and unethical medical billing practices,now!&quot;  Oversight, regulation, more regulation, socialism, whatever it takes.&quot;

ALSO SEE: Reverse Munchausen syndrome.

Preliminary unscientific studies have verified several cases of MBR, more study is needed

Mitch, it will only be possible to have a Wikipedia article on this topic if you can produce some reliable sources. Much of what you've said makes perfect sense, but you must demonstrate that people hide symptoms from their physicians for overbilling concerns. If this is a problem, I'm sure it has been studied.

 Disagree - Problem is that CAD and IHD whilst usually synonymous, are not invariably so and nor do they precisely mean the same thing even when considereing just elderly patients complaining of a chest pain.
# Kawasaki disease can cause small aneurysms on the coronary arteries of children, but this is not atherosclerosis buildup that usually is the cause of IHD. 
# When considering the more typical adult patient:
#* CAD would IMHO better describe the structural abnormalities that may be present. As CAD article states &quot;most individuals with coronary artery disease show no evidence of disease for decades as the disease progresses before the first onset of symptoms&quot;. Example: a patient being worked-up for a heart murmur (that might eventually prove to be of little importance) might be shown to have advanced coronary artery blockages, yet they have been asymptomatic of any angina, breathlessness etc (i.e. the blockages have not been critical enough to cause ischaemia of the heart on typical activities, or at least not caused symptoms) - the patient has CAD but not IHD (obviously needs assessement as to what prophylactic interventions &amp; measures are needed to prevent symptomatic illness)
#* Whereas IHD is more the clinical persentation of the patient, and as the article sets out may include both symptoms &amp; signs of chest pain or of heart failure. As acute coronary syndrome indicates, not all cases of those with chest pain necessarily have significant (CAD) athersclerosis or thrombus occlusion.
 I agree entirely though that we might expect most lay readers coming to our articles may have prior assumption of the equivalence of the terms. I have no problem therefore agreeing that the articles should be clearer in distinguishing meanings, and also to not over duplicate details. David Ruben  Talk  19:33, 7 October 2008 (UTC)

It's a good start. A photo would be really helpful, to demonstrate what makes a Suzuki frame different from a simple splint. Do you have any freely available photos handy, or do you have access to a Suzuki frame which you could photograph and upload?

Since GPnotebook became a payable service, Arcadian blanked the template. However, it is still on many pages, as I just found it in an empty external links section of Gas gangrene.

Changes to Infobox Symptom

Recently a template-tidier removed the subline of &quot;Classifications and external resources&quot; from , see [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template%3AInfobox_Symptom&amp;diff=244980227&amp;oldid=196304483 edit].

David Ruben  Talk  18:14, 13 October 2008 (UTC)
This might be a good opportunity to merge the two templates, adding a parameter to state what the type was. This could also address some of the recurring concerns at . --Arcadian (talk) 18:35, 13 October 2008 (UTC)
Then what would we call the template -  ? I agree it would removal all disagreement over &quot;disease vs condition vs symptom vs disorder&quot; and &quot;sign vs symptom&quot;... but that &quot;type&quot; parameter will be the next source of disagreement as to what to use as permitted values eg &quot;disease&quot; &amp; &quot;presentation&quot;. David Ruben  Talk  19:13, 13 October 2008 (UTC)
We could use &quot;condition&quot; as the default if no additional parameter was provided, and then hold overrides to the same reliable-sourcing standards we use for the article text. --Arcadian (talk) 00:27, 14 October 2008 (UTC)

Dermatology without any citations

I recently started the  and have been sorting through articles, finding that many do not have any references or citations.  I think the most obvious one is the main Dermatology article, and with such examples, I feel the best way to get a properly referenced article would be to start over completely.  Therefore, my question is this, when is it appropriate to pare down an article back to essentially a stub when there is a lack of in-text citations and start over?  This is what I want to do with the Dermatology article. Kilbad (talk) 20:53, 16 October 2008 (UTC)

I don't know if that would be such a good idea; the article already contains some structure and useful content, I wouldn't throw all that away. I think this would be only appropriate if the structure would be useless, or if a lot of it is how-to and original material. I would instead move section by section, completely rewriting sections where necessary, creating new sections where needed, and removing improper sections.
Does anyone here have a lot of experiences with speciality articles like this? --Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 21:02, 16 October 2008 (UTC)
My advise to Kilbad would be to leave anything that is not obviously wrong unless he fully rewrittes the article. When I writte articles it is much easier to look for refs on content already written than to redo a full article from scratch. At the same time until somebody provides refs is better to have some info than nothing.

Template of photos?

Tomorrow I will be uploading a lot of dermatopathology images, many slides of the same structure but at different views (10x, 40x, 100x).  In these cases, would it be ok to make a template of related photos for inclusion in a page? Also, what are other ways to link related images? Kilbad (talk) 20:53, 16 October 2008 (UTC)
First of all, I hope you are planning to upload these images to Wikimedia Commons. It's an interesting idea to create a template to put one picture on a page, and provide links for different magnifications. Typically, if you upload an image to commons, you can put a link in the &quot;other versions&quot; field, which will list or display any other versions you've made of the same subject. --Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 20:58, 16 October 2008 (UTC)
I am planning on uploading them directly to wikipedia.  Aren't there bots that can transfer them over after they have been uploaded here? Kilbad (talk) 21:18, 16 October 2008 (UTC)
No, it is very important that you upload images directly to Commons. The advantage is that projects in other languages, and projects like Wikibooks, Wikinews etc can use the exact same image without duplication. You probably didn't realise this, but as a contributor to other languages and other projects, I cannot understate how frustrating local uploads are; they are plain selfish. Wikipedia is not a repository of images. There are some scripts which indeed can move images, but they still need human attention to execute them, and admins then need to delete the image locally; all a waste of good editor time.
You'll find that Commons is easy getting used to; creating a login is just as simple. It already contains a lot of histopathology images; try finding the right categories before uploading (Commons has over 3 million files).
You're not the only person who doesn't realise how important this is; I've seen a few long-term contributors who needed trout-smacking for locally uploading files. Let me know if you need any help in uploading the images. --Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 21:26, 16 October 2008 (UTC)
Ok, I understand now.  I will use the commons for my uploads.  Then, once I upload an image, how do I link to it in a wikipedia article? Kilbad (talk) 21:39, 16 October 2008 (UTC)
Use  for example, replacing imagename with the image's name and making sure that the file format (such as JPG, PNG etc) is correct. —Cyclonenim (talk ·  · ) 21:42, 16 October 2008 (UTC)
Using images on commons is exactly the same as if the image would be on Wikipedia. That's the beauty of it. --Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 22:07, 16 October 2008 (UTC)
Steven, agree images then included in articles in the same manner, but I understood not quite the same at time of uploading as fair-use images do not seem permitted on Commons (example the resolution-reduced image of a photo I took of British National Formulary book cover) - did I misunderstand rules at Commons ? David Ruben  Talk  19:26, 17 October 2008 (UTC)
No, you didn't, fair use is the only exception. But Kilbad is not talking about fair use. Commons is the central media repository for free images only, doesn't allow fair use (as most Wikipedia's in other languages don't accept them either). --Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 19:31, 17 October 2008 (UTC)

Hey. Per advice from JFW, I'm changing WikiProject Neurology into a task force in order to give it a bit more life (hopefully!). However, I need to edit the WPMED banner in order to class articles under the task force. I've copied and pasted the code into notepad and edited everything necessary, I just need an admin who is willing to do the copy and pasting back into the template. Any offers? If so, I'll email you the code upon reply. :) Kind regards

—Cyclonenim (talk ·  · ) 09:59, 17 October 2008 (UTC)

Would it be a good idea to create a combined task force of Neurology and neuroscience? The Wikiproject Neurosciences has been death for a long time (I think that no editions for more than a year). The aims and themes of both fields are really close and hopefully combined they will atract more contributors.--Garrondo (talk) 10:18, 17 October 2008 (UTC)

As for , for previous task force additions, I have used  as a sandbox, and then asked at  for an admin to copy the code.

Correct.  If an article is located in , which is a sub-category of , then the article is also within the hierarchy of  and does not also need to be in that category.

On a related note, I am willing and ready to categorize all existing dermatology articles.  However, I am uncertain what the categories and subcategories of dermatology should be.  How should skin diseases be best sub-categorized?  There are many ways all this could be divided, and different texts divide these topics differently.  I have some ideas; however, before I spend a lot of time categorizing, I wanted to get some opinions on how best to categorize the dermatology articles.  Again, once a consensus has been reached, I don't mind doing it, but I want to get an outline of the category structure first. I am looking for specific examples of how your dermatology category tree would look. Kilbad (talk) 20:30, 17 October 2008 (UTC)
Here is my rough draft of how the dermatology categories should be.  This is list has been modified from several texts I have (particularly Lookingbill and Andrews (see my user page)).  I like these categories because they allow a small amount of &quot;cross-categorization&quot; which is good for dermatology.  Also, despite what you may think, each item on this list is a &quot;category&quot; in the field of dermatology.  For example, for those of you not extremely familiar with dermatology, &quot;psoriasis&quot; is a group of diseases, not just one.  Your feedback is greatly appreciated.  Here it goes...

How can on improve on this, or how would you do this differently?  Please, I need feedback before I move forward on this. Kilbad (talk) 21:35, 17 October 2008 (UTC)
It may be best to take this to the Dermatology task force talk page. It's going to take up a lot of space here eventually. —Cyclonenim (talk ·  · ) 21:42, 17 October 2008 (UTC)
I will put future posts there, but I need this to be reviewed by more than just two people, hence why I put it here. Kilbad (talk) 21:45, 17 October 2008 (UTC)
Just wondering, about how many articles do you think will be categorized somewhere within ?  I do not know much about derm diseases, but 52 different subcategories seems like a lot.  I question whether there would be sufficient diseases in each sub-category to warrant its creation.  Even if all 52 categories are needed, there should probably be at least one more level of categorization so that one does not need to scroll through so many categories to find the appropriate topic.  Also, I'm not sure that the anatomy categories should be within the specialty categories (ie should  be within ?).  A similar question is how the specialty and organ categories should be categorized.  Should  be a subcategory of  (as it currently is), or should  be a subcategory of ?  I think that  should be the parent, since Dermatology encompasses (deals with) skin - rather than skin encompassing (dealing with) dermatology.  This is why I think the organ system categories should be separate from the specialty categories.  The exception being (skin) diseases, which is the intersection of the organ (skin) and medicine (dermatology).  Finally, what do you plan to include in &quot;Skin pathophysiology?&quot;  Wouldn't most, if not all pathophysiology-related contents be within ?  --Scott Alter 22:30, 17 October 2008 (UTC)

*There are ~1300 skin diseases which, after forming proper catagories, I will index in the &quot;skin disease&quot; page list, so that is how many will be catagorized
*If sub sub categories are need, if we can agree on the top categories now, sub dividing further will be less cumbersome as there will be smaller groups to subdivide, right?
*I agree that Cat:Derm should fall UNDER Cat:Skin
*Skin pathophysiology will include articles such as (maybe not titled this way exactly) &quot;Epidermal kinetics&quot; about how cells are created and migrate through the epidermis, and how changes in that dynamic lead to certain skin diseases 
So with all that being said, what would you category tree look like? Kilbad (talk) 23:04, 17 October 2008 (UTC)
Rather than classify the items on a single axis, try three axes. On the first, you have the type of object (&quot;pathophysiology&quot;, &quot;anatomy&quot;, &quot;sign&quot;, etc.) On the second, have the primary type of tissue affected (&quot;nails&quot;, &quot;skin&quot;, etc.) On the third, have the cause (&quot;infection&quot;, &quot;congenital&quot;, &quot;neoplasia&quot;, &quot;trauma&quot;, etc.) Then you don't have to create distinct categories for each conceivable combination. --Arcadian (talk) 18:38, 18 October 2008 (UTC)
Thank you for your reply! So would you mind giving me an outline of what your derm category tree would sepcifically look like? Kilbad (talk) 18:55, 18 October 2008 (UTC)
I like how the category tree is progressing.  I still question the need of the &quot;pathophysiology&quot; categories.  Your example, &quot;Epidermal kinetics,&quot; seems more like an article about physiology, that could contain links to articles about the relevant disease processes when something goes wrong.  So I think &quot;physiology&quot; categories would be better (and correspond with , , and ).
Getting to , if 50+ categories are needed to categorize everything appropriately, then so be it.  Personally, I'm a bit overwhelmed with one big category containing subcategories named solely with medical jargon.  A person with no medical knowledge would have no idea where to start.  Because I am not all that familiar with dermatology, I can't really give you any good suggestions for categorization, but Arcadian has provided good advice with using multiple axes.  Thinking about how these diseases should be categorized using layman's terms may lead to a more coherent structure.  I'd start of by renaming &quot;dermatoses&quot; to &quot;skin diseases.&quot;  You could probably create &quot;Dermatitis&quot; as a parent category for &quot;Eczema&quot; and the other dermatitis categories (if they are needed).  Finally, I think some categories should be eliminated because they are too specific.  There do not need to be categories for &quot;Hansen's disease,&quot; &quot;Syphilis,&quot; &quot;Yaws,&quot; &quot;Bejel,&quot; and &quot;Pinta.&quot;  These articles could just fall somewhere within &quot;Infectious diseases of the skin.&quot;  --Scott Alter 20:08, 18 October 2008 (UTC)
I have (1) added cutaneous pharmacology, and (2) removed the &quot;Hansen's disease,&quot; &quot;Syphilis,&quot; &quot;Yaws,&quot; &quot;Bejel,&quot; and &quot;Pinta&quot; categories.  In general, I am personally happy with the list as a starting point, but again, appreciate any feedback!  I would like someones blessing (like Arcadian) before I actually do the categorization.  Also, with regard to renaming terms for lay-persons(sp?), dermatology is linguistically a very precise field, which is one reason I like it so much; however, as such, I do not feel it is appropriate to change terms for lay-people because it creates ambiguity about the topic being covered.  For example, I think it is inappropriate to call the lesions of a pemphigus vulgaris a &quot;blister,&quot; because that term is too vague... what is a blister... is it a bulla, a vesicle, what is it?  I think it is better to use the appropriate term, bulla, and let the reader learn what a bulla is from another article.  So I guess my question is, how much am I to dumb-down the category list above? Kilbad (talk) 20:46, 19 October 2008 (UTC)

Some suggestions: (1) instead of &quot;cutaneous bacterial/viral/... infection&quot;, I'd simply say &quot;bacterial infections of the skin&quot;; (2) are bites and stings not always related to the skin? &quot;bites and stings&quot; seems sufficient per se; (3) don't know what a genodermatosis is, but unless you mean a genetic skin disease, I think the list is as simple as it can get. --Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 20:59, 19 October 2008 (UTC)

(1) and (2) are good points, and I have changed the list to reflect them.  See Genodermatosis for the definition, and I have changed that category to &quot;hereditary skin disorders&quot;.  I have also replaced all instances of the work &quot;dermatoses&quot; with &quot;skin diseases&quot; Kilbad (talk) 21:25, 19 October 2008 (UTC)

When should I be using &quot;of the skin&quot; versus &quot;cutaneous&quot;?  You will notice a mix of those phrases in the list?  Thank you again for the feedback (all of you!). Kilbad (talk) 21:28, 19 October 2008 (UTC)

Do you think we can get a final consensus on this categorization scheme in the next day or two so I can start moving forward with the actual categorization? How would you structure your categories differently? Can you give an example of your scheme? Thanks again! Kilbad (talk) 13:00, 20 October 2008 (UTC)

Many categories have more than 50, but often large categories have no other suitable basis for subdivision (like categories of types of people or places).

Another thing to consider besides which categories to use is how exactly to name the categories.  What I mean is consistency between the categories.  In the current listing, some names are in the format &quot;x diseases of the skin,&quot; while others are &quot;x skin diseases.&quot;  Some categories use &quot;disorders,&quot; while others use &quot;diseases.&quot;  Finally, there is a mixture of location terms, like &quot;subcutaneous,&quot; &quot;cutaneous,&quot; &quot;epidermal,&quot; &quot;dermal,&quot; and &quot;skin.&quot;  Are all of these terms appropriately used?  Are these descriptive location terms redundant or unnecessary (such as &quot;Neurocutaneous skin diseases&quot; and &quot;Cutaneous disturbances of pigmentation&quot;)?.  --Scott Alter 00:06, 23 October 2008 (UTC)

Naming of articles requiring disambiguation

I have noticed that there is no standard way for medicine-related articles that require disambiguation to be named.  For example, we currently have articles like Acute (medicine), Chronic (medical), Patch (dermatology), and Erosion (dermatopathology).  After reading through the Wikipedia guidelines and MOS, the only section relating to the disambiguation words used in parentheses is .  Based on this, I'd think we should use &quot;(medicine)&quot; for all articles needing a disambiguating word.  Using &quot;(medicine)&quot; fits best, as it is a simple, descriptive word and not an adjective.  I do not think we need specialty-specific disambiguating words like dermatology or dermatopathology, unless we need to differentiate two items of the same name within medicine.  If this happens, we could then use the specialty name as a disambiguation word.  Any comments or other suggestions?  Should this recommendation be added somewhere to this WikiProject or to ?  --Scott Alter 04:17, 17 October 2008 (UTC)

An additional word that I think should be accepted as a disambiguation word is &quot;anatomy.&quot;  For example, Nail (as in fingernail) is better off at Nail (anatomy) than &quot;Nail (medicine).&quot;  If I think of any others, I'll add them here for discussion.  What is the next step for adding this to ?  Does it need to discussed or drafted at , or can I just create a new section in MEDMOS (probably a subsection of &quot;Naming conventions,&quot; called &quot;Titles requiring disambiguation&quot;)?  --Scott Alter 21:13, 17 October 2008 (UTC)

As someone who spends a lot of time fixing disambiguations, here's my take.  Have you tried fixing some of these dabs that annoy you, including &quot;what links here&quot;?  If not, try that first, then if you really want to change the rules.  Yes, more orderly naming is more orderly, but at what cost? --Una Smith (talk) 05:06, 21 October 2008 (UTC)

I agree that fixing redirects is a hassle.  However, we do not need to go through all of the existing pages and mass rename them all.  I brought this up because there is currently no guidance as to how to name articles requiring disambiguation.  I'm not changing the rules (since there currently aren't any), rather setting guidelines for any new articles.  Existing articles could be grandfathered in or changed individually as one desires.  --Scott Alter 22:59, 21 October 2008 (UTC)
This proposal amounts to creating a new rule.  Is such a new rule really needed?  If existing disambiguation clusters don't really need to be renamed, why do we need this rule?  How is it not just ? --Una Smith (talk) 17:49, 22 October 2008 (UTC)

Limb terminology - upper/lower or thoracic/pelvic?

Since  has been pretty quiet lately, I figured I'd discuss this here.  Within the category structure, the terminology for differentiation of limbs is not consistently used.  If you look in , there is a mixture of upper/lower with thoracic/pelvic.  I'm leaning toward using thoracic and pelvic, since these terms could be used for other species; but upper and lower are more commonplace.  --Scott Alter 05:22, 18 October 2008 (UTC)

Patient handout or review article

Hi,

In a recent ruling in a  about the lead section of Diabetes mellitus the mediator has said:

The various type should be called &quot;types&quot; and not forms. The reason for this is that this is an encyclopaedia, the reader is what matters, not the editors! We (experts) don't write Wikipedia for our own use, we write it for the layperson. This article must be understandable by the non-expert reader. Experts shouldn't be coming to Wikipedia for sources: frankly it would be professionally weak to do so and no peer reviewer would look kindly on a researcher using a Wikipedia article as &quot;evidence&quot; in any publication of note (indeed at my university, citing Wikipedia is an automatic failure for any piece of work submitted to med-school!). This place is for the high-school student, the worried new patient, the news reporter looking for a quick snippet to include in an article: the layperson. As such, we have to keep it understandable by that audience.


Should Wikipedia articles about medicine (or life sciences in general) be downgraded to a form easily understandable by laypersons? If so there are thousands of articles to be rewritten. Wikipedia is not paper so articles are hyperlinked and readers can refer to other articles for most important points in the text that are not immediately understandable.

What do you think ?

Kpjas (talk) 07:59, 9 October 2008 (UTC)

Well, &quot;patient handout&quot; smells of medical advice, so that may not be the best example.  The articles should be at least as accessible as hospital consent forms: not infantile, but stripped of jargon and making no assumptions that a reader understands more than the basics of anatomy and physiology.  I think it would be appropriate to lay out a &quot;target audience&quot; for the articles, but that idea isn't very popular for wikipedia in general for some odd reason.  If I had to make a decision, I'd say that articles should be written to the level of a nursing student: someone who has a solid grounding in the basic science and the beginnings of an understanding of clinical practice but isn't by any means an expert.  I would say &quot;Member of Congress&quot; but that's US-specific and some of them seem to have problems with the basics of science and technology.  SDY (talk) 12:05, 9 October 2008 (UTC)
See . I agree, neither patient handout or review article are suitable styles to follow. We must .  Don't regard this as &quot;downgrading&quot;. Accessible writing on a complex subject is achievable but takes considerable talent. The language should probably be pitched at the level of a broadsheet newspaper or popular science magazine. Jargon needs to be explained in-article and wikilinks used for the benefit of readers wanting to learn more (i.e., the reader should get the gist of what is being described without having to click away and come back). 
For a few complex but important subject, WP has &quot;Introduction to...&quot; articles. See Introduction to general relativity and General relativity; Introduction to viruses and Virus (though IMO Virus is also highly accessible and a great example to follow). Colin°Talk 12:59, 9 October 2008 (UTC)

I completely agree with Colin. Per , many of our articles should indeed be rewritten. We shouldn't be overly patronising or using kiddy-language, but I think high school level is more appropriate than nursing student-level, which is already too advanced. It's a lot easier talking jargon for most experts; I find it challenging but rewarding to write for the general audience. I recently saw a perfect describing of the situation at : 

Not that this problem is limited to medicine: try learning something about maths or statistics from a Wikipedia article... hopeless indeed. --Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 14:18, 9 October 2008 (UTC)

In the first quote somebody said &quot;we don't write Wikipedia for experts, we write it for laypersons&quot;. That's not strictly true, we write this encyclopaedia for everyone. There is, in reality, no more reason to 'dumb down' language than there is to step it up a gear. Most terms are allowed to stay here (especially if they have an article) but occasionally, for particularly complex words or for words without an article, we can describe the condition/name etc. briefly in brackets. I don't see much of an issue with this method because if and when people don't understand, they can ask at the . —Cyclonenim (talk ·  · ) 16:39, 9 October 2008 (UTC)
I often advocate doing both.  Particularly for &quot;Cause&quot; and &quot;Pathophysiology&quot; sections (which tend to be get technical than, say, &quot;Signs and symptoms&quot;), there's no reason that you can't start with a short, simple internal summary before proceeding to the details of biochemistry.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 19:08, 9 October 2008 (UTC)

Kpjas is referring specifically to a long grumbling edit war perpetrated by an anonymous editor who insisted that very rare monogenic forms of diabetes needed to be mentioned prominently in the intro. This particular issue, for which the MEDCAB was alerted, has little to do with style. However, I totally agree that we need to write articles for everyone. That can be difficult, though. In hypopituitarism (my last major project), the &quot;causes&quot; section looks dreadfully jargonesque: an enumeration of long names that are mostly in Latin. Yet for the professional or for the (relative of a) patient, it is essential that this information is covered.

When I wrote the early drafts of , I thought it reasonable to allow medical articles to have a &quot;gradient of complexity&quot;. Some content simply cannot be brought down to a level that can be grokked by a twelve-year old; this is something we need to accept. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't try.

A lot of medicine has to do with bringing scientific knowledge down to a practical level. &quot;Doctor&quot; in its original meaning is to be translated as &quot;teacher&quot;. A doctor talking to his/her patient about a diagnosis is essentially doing that: explaining that a disease is, what kind of treatment is available, what is known about the prognosis, and how common it is. Much of what we do here follows the same thread. JFW | T@lk 20:25, 9 October 2008 (UTC)

The question of &quot;audience and language&quot; in medical articles in Wikipedia is for the most part settled. (I used patient handout or review article for the sake of the discussion only )Reasonable guidelines are summarised in the MOS, for example  (why did I miss it?)

*Audience → everyone translates to high school student level
*Language → NO JARGON mandatory in the lead, strive for no jargon wherever possible in other sections

Interesting points from the discussion:
* &quot;Introduction to...&quot; articles for subjects with the most technical language 
* internal summaries for the jargonesque sections 
* gradient of complexity

I reviewed lead paragraphs of a few of our medical featured articles and they look very good IMO - language accessible to the general public and unfamiliar terms linked to separate articles (for a comprehensible explanation in their leads).

Finally, a very controversial proposal
* subpages → &quot;For the specialist&quot; or &quot;For patients&quot; for example &quot;/Diabetes mellitus for the specialist&quot; or &quot;/Diabetes mellitus for patients&quot; linked from the main ?

Kpjas (talk) 22:13, 9 October 2008 (UTC)

No, I think I oppose subpages. That sounds like &quot;Barack Obama for Democrats&quot; and &quot;Barack Obama for Republicans&quot;, i.e. it will eventually lead to POV and WEIGHT problems. If absolutely necessary, we could split out topical subpages if there is sufficient content to populate such a subpage (e.g. genetics of diabetes mellitus type 2, a fertile area of intense research). JFW | T@lk 22:20, 9 October 2008 (UTC)
I also oppose subpages.  Basic science articles sometimes benefit from the &quot;Introduction to genetics&quot; approach, but articles about diseases and medical conditions should avoid them.  The problem is indeed due weight.  I'm convinced that an &quot;Introduction to type 2 diabetes&quot; would rapidly degenerate into a patient education webpage, despite the purpose of general education.

Wikipedia is aimed to be the perfect reource for everyone , the target being that one day when you do cite wiki s your source for med school you won't be laughed at. Articles on other subjects aaren't dumbed down. i could barely make it through some of the complex economic theories. Why should medicine be ostracized and branded as &quot;jargony&quot;?. The other day i found a stub on lhermitte duclos disease. how do you explain that to a layperson. you need a certain amount of anatomy to comprehend &quot;hypertrophy of cerebellar folia&quot;. all related terms should be hyperlinked. An encyclopedia is meant for everyone and not for &quot;high school equivalents ony&quot;. People who moan about the hyperlinks should realize that the pleasure in reading an encyclopedia is that when you read up on &quot; seizures&quot; for example and you don't know what a jacksonian march is or what a temporal lobe is you can eep hyperlinking to more and more basic articles and then revert . This way lay people get to flip through many articles to get a complete view of the subject and experts can just look at the advanced stuff.
Drarvindr (talk) 17:29, 22 October 2008 (UTC)
I don't see any reason why Lhermitte-Duclos disease couldn't begin with a plain-language statement that is intelligible to ten year olds, like &quot;LD disease is a very rare kind of brain tumor, but is not considered cancer.&quot;  It can then go into whether or not it's really, truly neoplastic.  We don't need to use professional-level language for every single sentence.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 05:58, 23 October 2008 (UTC)
Perhaps. But then this requires a major overhaul of most medical articles. It is much easier to link jargons to another page explaining the term at &quot;10-yr old&quot; level which most of the articles are doing. The pages are trying to be as thorough as possible without becoming textbooks.You cannot oversimplify things. Before you know it the page on retinoblastoma opens like &quot;It is a  tumor that grows from your retina (rhet-eye-naa)&quot;.I feel that subpages are a bad idea. Some of my patients are already self diagnosing using wikipedia. The medical pages are already &quot;patient education&quot; pages as they stand. they will only get worse if you add subpages.Drarvindr (talk) 16:33, 23 October 2008 (UTC)
I also oppose subpages.  But the fact that writing a good article is somewhat more work than writing for other professionals is not, IMO, a justification for failing to comply with  and .  WhatamIdoing (talk) 17:21, 23 October 2008 (UTC)

GA Review Oxygen toxicity

I think Oxygen toxicity may be close to gaining GA status, but the reviewer would like a citation for &quot;In either case, unless there is a prior history of epilepsy or tests indicate hypoglycemia, a seizure occurring while breathing oxygen at partial pressures greater than 1.4 bar (140 kPa) will be diagnosed as oxygen toxicity by exclusion.&quot; I know that's what happens but I'm at a loss to find a source to back it up. Please, can anybody help? --RexxS (talk) 19:07, 22 October 2008 (UTC)
Did you introduce that content to the article?  If not, you could find who did and ask them for a reliable source.  --Una Smith (talk) 19:20, 22 October 2008 (UTC)
Yes - it was me - I added it after Axl's previous GA review (he was explaining the sections for MOSMED: &quot;Diagnosis&quot;: Presumably in diving it's a diagnosis of exclusion, in conjunction with the history?) - and I'm quite certain that it is the case, as I'm unaware of any diving incidents involving an underwater seizure being attributed to anything other than CNS oxygen toxicity or epilepsy. But I'm not a RS. I guess diagnosis by exclusion is harder than most things to cite. --RexxS (talk) 19:54, 22 October 2008 (UTC)
I suppose you have searched Google Scholar? Anyway, if you don't find a source, then you should realise that although some things have been thought to us and we apply them in daily practice, there are no reliable sources for them. In that case, they shouldn't be mentioned in the article. --Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 20:13, 22 October 2008 (UTC)
 After some digging around, I found [http://www.aafp.org/afp/20010601/2211.html this article]. It indicates that arterial gas embolism (air embolism) can also cause convulsions. Ironically , it is treated with 100% oxygen. Axl ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 21:05, 22 October 2008 (UTC)
Thanks very much for looking, it's appreciated.
*Steven: My searches on Google Scholar only turned up articles when CNS seizure had occurred during HBOT - the diagnosis part was inevitably related to the indication that had lead to the treatment. I'm reluctant to omit mention of diagnosis of CNS toxicity in the article: it clearly is diagnosed, but nobody seems to want to say why! I think I'll use  as the reference :).
*Axl: Although CAGE (cerebral arterial gas embolism) can cause convulsions, among other neurological problems, it occurs as a consequence of decompression, i.e. after a dive. Whereas CNS toxicity will only occur while under pressure - during a dive. That in itself is sufficient to differentiate when making a diagnosis. (What do you call that? history? - excuse the non-medic!). Anyway, AGE is caused by inert gas bubbles, so 100% oxygen is sensible treatment. In fact, it's pretty much the universal first-aid for any diving incident, which is why divers are taught oxygen administration.
 --RexxS (talk) 14:58, 23 October 2008 (UTC)
 Yes, you're right, Rexx. According to the article, arterial gas embolism occurs &quot;Within five minutes of surfacing (&gt; 80 percent) or during ascent&quot; while oxygen toxicity convulsions occur at depth. Axl ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 17:22, 23 October 2008 (UTC)

Charities in external links

This is a subject I've seen many of you struggle with: when to remove external links to charities. I'd really like to learn from others to see which rules you use to judge if a charity should be included. Some food for thought and discussion from my personal  collection:
* Sepsis contains a link to [http://www.survivingsepsis.org Surviving Sepsis Campaign] and [http://www.sepsisforum.org International Sepsis Forum], and Intensive care medicine contains a link to the [http://www.veccs.org Veterinary Emergency And Critical Care Society].
* I removed this beautiful site from testicular cancer: &quot;[http://www.checkyourballs.co.uk/tcancer.php checkyourballs.co.uk] Information and awareness site, created by a survivor&quot;
* When pruning the link farm at foodborne illness, the victims included [http://www.veriprime.org VeriPrime Food Safety Alliance New Farm to Fork Food Safety System], whereas [http://www.foodsafetynetwork.ca/en/ Food Safety Network] remained.
Not perfect examples, but I'd like to hear from your dilemmas! --Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 19:12, 23 October 2008 (UTC)
My 'rule of thumb' would be - our primary responsibility is to keep only valuable and reliable resources that help making articles complete and comprehensive. We must decide for ourselves on case by case basis (sometimes hard indeed) and watch out for COIs. How much the charity and how much the Wikipedia article would benefit from the inclusion of the external link is the pivotal question IMO. Kpjas (talk) 19:53, 23 October 2008 (UTC)
&quot;How much the charity and how much the Wikipedia article would benefit&quot;: I assume you're referring to COI, or do you many that it matters how much the charity itself benefits? --Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 19:56, 23 October 2008 (UTC)
Might sound a bit unfeeling but helping charities gain visibility is not our business - so no to link farms for the publicity's sake. I know, we'll face borderline cases and it'll be hard to say no to one charity and accept a link from another. It matters what the charity's website offers and whether the link is added with community consensus or unilaterally by the charity's PR department. I ask myself if our readers look for or find helpful these links.To me links appearing in the EL section seem to bear a kind of Wikipedia's invisible seal of approval. A test case could be Niemann-Pick disease EL section. Kpjas (talk) 22:15, 23 October 2008 (UTC)
I do a fair bit of this, and here are some of my current rules of thumb:
* I kill all links to chat boards/support groups/discussion/local meetings/etc. because of the  violations.  If a linked website has these &quot;features&quot; plus desirable features, then I strip any mention of the disallowed items from the description.  
* I kill all fundraising links.  Unless real information significantly outweighs the &quot;donate here&quot; and &quot;support the cause&quot; stuff on the linked page, then IMO it's a fundraising page.
* I remove many links based on the size of the organization including:
** links to any charity in large diseases.  There are dozens of truly &quot;major&quot; charities for heart disease, and we can't have dozens of links).  These are the [http://www.heart.org heart.org ] kinds of links:  nice folks, I'm sure, but the home page isn't especially informative.
** links for most moderately common diseases.  If there are more than about four national/large organizations listed there, then that suggests that there are plenty enough groups that we shouldn't be advertising any of them.  
** links to some less common diseases.  My new rule of thumb (still experimental) for rare diseases is that if the disease is rare enough to qualify for the limited charity exception in , then it is rare enough that the article should be rated of Low importance on the WPMED banner according to our assessment guidelines.  As 98% of our articles have at least a preliminary assessment, then it speeds some decisions for me.
* I remove most links that don't have actual, concrete, specific, detailed information on the exact subject of the Wikipedia article on the actual page that the reader sees first.  If the page isn't useful to a student writing a paper for a biology class, then it's not appropriate for Wikipedia.  We are not providing links for the convenience of either professionals or patients.  I keep charity links that provide detailed information irrespective of considerations about their size or disease prevalence.  So [http://www.heart.org heart.org] would go (major disease), but any link to an informative subpage on the same website would not.
**Quick rule of thumb (amazing how often it applies to less common diseases):  If the name of the disease doesn't appear on the linked page, then I delete the link.
Note that I evaluate the actual page that we're linking to, and if it fails, I don't bother digging through the website to see if there might possibly be something that might possibly qualify.
By the way, if you see me &quot;organize&quot; links into &quot;Information&quot; and &quot;Charities&quot; subsections, that's your invitation to delete all the charities.
I don't usually watchlist pages when I weed link farms.  I did for a while, but it just gets overwhelming.  Perhaps one in eight weedings gets reverted, and I've decided that the time I used to spend arguing with determined promoters is usually better directed towards weeding other pages.  The article will come up again, in my list or someone else's; I can weed it again some other day.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 01:36, 24 October 2008 (UTC)</segment>
