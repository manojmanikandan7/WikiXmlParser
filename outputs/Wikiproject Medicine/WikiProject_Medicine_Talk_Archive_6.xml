Noticeboard: if we reformat l|MedProjectNews we can use that for Project news. We have a similar template for community news on Wikinews and it works quite well, anybody can add project news and it can be displayed on several pages. The collaboration dashboard is like a noticeboard for articles. All pages need a reorganisation; I strongly suggest establishing ikipedia:WikiProject Medicine/Proposals to coordinate proposals and split those discussions away from the general talk here.
Article collaboration: I liked the idea of having a page were editors can list 3 to 5 articles they're actively improving and seek help with. I've been spamming mine already (rritable hip, estational diabetes) but I think if we set up a page were everyone can add up to 3 pages where they are working and they want help with, you can find the pages that are currently our top priority.

 Sudden death 

Tagging some articles WPMED, I noticed udden death is a redirect to a disambig page, and the only medical link there is to udden cardiac death.  Wikipedia needs an article on udden death (medicine).  Anyone here care to take a stab at it? --ser:Una Smith|Una Smith (ser talk:Una Smith|talk) 16:02, 26 December 2007 (UTC)

Initially, udden death was about the phenomenon in sport, and I spent a very long time changing the links.
I think the terms &quot;sudden death&quot; and &quot;sudden cardiac death&quot; are used interchangeably. Does anyone think there are other conditions that need mentioning under this header? Otherwise we can just redirect udden death (medicine) to udden cardiac death. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 16:35, 26 December 2007 (UTC)

On alk:Sudden cardiac death there is mention of a list of 15 causes of sudden death other than sudden cardiac death. --ser:Una Smith|Una Smith (ser talk:Una Smith|talk) 18:07, 26 December 2007 (UTC)

I agree with the contributor there (and therefore with you, Una) that we ought to perhaps list diseases that can rapidly lead to death, but that list is actually almost limitless (overwhelming sepsis, visceral perforation, status epilepticus, ruptured aortic aneurysm, etc). Unless a reliable source can be found that lists the most important causes sensibly, I cannot find grounds for an independent article. The alternative would be to mention on udden cardiac death that postmortem examination should be performed to exclude other causes of sudden death, such as the causes mentioned on the talkpage and by myself above. Again, for such an addition a good source is needed. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 22:34, 26 December 2007 (UTC)

This discussion rather proves my point, which is not that we need a list, but that we need an article defining &quot;sudden death&quot; in the medical sense.  (If someone wants to start an exhaustive list, that would be ist of causes of sudden death.)  udden cardiac death really does not suffice.  I am looking for a link to use from causes of sudden death, so that it is not necessary to explain on each linking page that the condition in question is a medical emergency on the order of &quot;Call 911!&quot; or worse. --ser:Una Smith|Una Smith (ser talk:Una Smith|talk) 23:55, 26 December 2007 (UTC)

I think the problem, as JFW has alluded to, is that &quot;sudden death&quot; is not really a medical term outside of the specific instance of udden cardiac death. Surely we can indicate, briefly and pointedly, that a condition requires emergent care and may be rapidly fatal without creating a page defining the term &quot;sudden death&quot; (which in this context is essentially self-explanatory)? ser:MastCell|MastCell ser Talk:MastCell|Talk 04:35, 27 December 2007 (UTC)

That's okay, because Wikipedia is not really a medical encyclopedia.  &quot;Emergent care&quot; isn't defined in Wikipedia, by the way.  And how rapid is &quot;rapidly&quot;?  --ser:Una Smith|Una Smith (ser talk:Una Smith|talk) 04:58, 27 December 2007 (UTC)

Well, you previously defined &quot;rapidly&quot; as &quot;within an hour&quot;. As I said, the list is potentially endless and hard to P:V|verify. I agree that Wikipedia is not a medical encyclopedia, and we should try to avoid giving the impression that it is. At the same time, creating articles with non-standard titles (eeling tired with red blotches on your legs or eadache with vomiting) will do nobody any service.
I stand by my view that listing a few diseases that rapidly progress to death in udden cardiac death would be useful, provided a reasonably accurate source can be found. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 08:01, 27 December 2007 (UTC)

I'll second JFW and MastCell here regarding the usage of sudden death  sudden cardiac death. Una Smith, since you say you don't want to &quot;explain on each linking page that the condition in question is a medical emergency,&quot; maybe edical emergency would be a more directly connected page? ser:Antelan|Anteser:Antelan|lan ser_talk:Antelan|talk 08:25, 27 December 2007 (UTC)

 Ketogenic diet: unwarranted page moves 

I would like some help from project members, and specifically an admin who can undo some unwarranted page moves. ser:OccamzRazor has moved etogenic diet to etogenic diet (epilepsy) and has rewritten some of the latter to reflect his POV. This long-established article is now a dictdef with a couple of newspaper links about cancer. Please see my discussion at ser talk:OccamzRazor#Ketogenic diet. I would like the article moved back (there is nothing of merit at the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ketogenic_diet&amp;oldid=180350618 current version of Ketogenic diet]). I can repair the links and revert some of the recent edits once this is done. Thank you. ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 10:32, 27 December 2007 (UTC)

The move may be reasonable if the page was mainly on the epilepsy diet, but the stub that is now standing it its place is hopeless. It bears noting that the popular (and reasonably effective) Atkins diet is also ketogenic. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 14:30, 27 December 2007 (UTC)
The category &quot;ketogenic diet&quot; may encompass aspects of the Atikins and other low carb diets. The noun &quot;ketogenic diet&quot; is exclusively used as a medical therapy, and its main indication is refractory epilepsy in children.
ikipedia:Naming conventions nutshell: &quot;Generally, article naming should prefer what the greatest number of English speakers would most easily recognize, with a reasonable minimum of ambiguity, while at the same time making linking to those articles easy and second nature.&quot; A Google or PubMed search will confirm that the medical therapy should be the main topic of the etogenic diet article.
My problem is that I believe it requires an admin to move the page (with all its history) back to the proper place. Copy/paste is explicitly discouraged. ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 15:45, 27 December 2007 (UTC)

 Triumph 

I am pleased to report that every article in WikiProject Medicine's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:WikiProject_Medicine_automatically_assessed_articles automatically assessed articles] category has been manually reviewed.  The category is now empty, and I'll be getting back to my [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Unassessed-Class_medicine_articles usual list of unassessed articles] soon.   ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 20:28, 27 December 2007 (UTC)

That is brilliant. Compliments to the reviewers. Perhaps you could report here quickly which important articles are in serious need of improvement? ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 20:54, 27 December 2007 (UTC)

The WPMED Quality vs Importance table shows over 50 articles of Top importance with quality below GA.  Most (all?) of the 50 are listed ikipedia:Version_1.0_Editorial_Team/Medicine_articles_by_quality/1|here. --ser:Una Smith|Una Smith (ser talk:Una Smith|talk) 22:54, 27 December 2007 (UTC)

I think these Top-rated articles are in the most embarrassing state:
* natomy
* iseases of poverty
* nfection
* hysiology
* regnancy test
* nprotected sex

None of them rate above a good start, and unprotected sex is actually a stub -- and not even a good stub, just a plain old didn't-get-finished-with-this stub.  

As for the B-class articles in this category, what they really need is a proper Good Article review.  I didn't rate any article higher than B unless some other project had previously rated it higher than B, so some of the articles doubtless deserve higher quality ratings than they have now.  

It would be great if someone (or several someones) would take a quick look at the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Top-importance_medicine_articles whole list] of Top-rated articles and downgrade anything that seems weird.  I suspect that for any given topic, we haven't always picked the single best article to represent it.  For example, regnancy was only &quot;High&quot; until a few minutes ago, and it might be fair to demote regnancy test to &quot;merely&quot; High.  We might also want to choose either natomy or uman anatomy for the Top rating instead of listing both. 

I have been thinking about the proportion of articles which ought to be considered Top importance.  While some of our current Tops may need to move down the line a bit, I've been thinking that a review of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:High-importance_medicine_articles the High-level articles] is also in order, with an eye to picking things that might be particularly popular with our readers or fundamental to medicine.  We could probably promote 25 or possibly even 50 &quot;High&quot; articles to Top without compromising the utility of the list.

And finally, on the articles I've assessed:  While I've rated articles ikipedia:WikiProject_Medicine/Assessment|according to my understanding of the guidelines, I don't pretend to have provided the One True Assessment™ and will not be offended by (or even notice) changes.  However, if you find anything that's wildly out of line and it seems to have my name on it (or if you just want to be reassured that your opinion is as valuable as anyone else's), then I'd be happy to hear about it on my talk page.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 01:14, 28 December 2007 (UTC)

Thanks for that, WhatamIdoing. nprotected sex needs urgent redirection to afe sex, which provides much more context and deals with the relevant topic comprehensively. I totally agree that natomy, hysiology, athology and articles about the main medical specialties are in need of improvement. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 01:28, 28 December 2007 (UTC)

Quality is probably judged quite accurately but we need to look at priority: I don't think we have our priorities straight, especially if you consider the commonest keywords on search engines are probably diabetes and all conditions related to gynecology (such as aginal infection) and ediatrics. I think we should be more aware of our position on search engines, and were possible article titles should match likely keywords, plus priority should go to popular health searches. --ser:Stevenfruitsmaak|Steven Fruitsmaak (ser_talk:Stevenfruitsmaak|Reply) 01:57, 28 December 2007 (UTC)

I agree.  Could someone build an index to medical articles by priority (=importance)?  That would be somewhat helpful here. --ser:Una Smith|Una Smith (ser talk:Una Smith|talk) 03:29, 28 December 2007 (UTC)

I would be thrilled to have other people involved in restructuring the importance lists.  Do you need something beyond the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Medicine_articles_by_importance main category for Medicine articles by importance]?  If you just want to see a list of what's been rated (or isn't yet rated, which includes 3700 stubs and the 1750 entirely unassessed articles which are on my target list), then the existing category structure is probably what you're looking for.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 05:48, 28 December 2007 (UTC)
The problem with importance categories is that they are not subdivided by quality. :-)  So, for example, to find the one article rated Top and Stub I estimate its relative position in the articles-by-quality index by adding the row totals for FA, A, GA, and B, and dividing by 400.  That gives me a rough idea which index page to look on.  In some cases, it would be helpful to have a parallel index of articles-by-importance. --ser:Una Smith|Una Smith (ser talk:Una Smith|talk) 15:23, 28 December 2007 (UTC)

In theory, [http://tools.wikimedia.de/~daniel/WikiSense/CategoryIntersect.php CatScan] will let you find articles which are in any two categories.  In practice -- some days it works for me, and some days it doesn't.  I think it silently gives up if it can't get a response from WP quickly enough.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 19:30, 28 December 2007 (UTC)

Opinions on importance must be guided by an overarching principle. Is an important article (1) a &quot;big killer&quot;, (2) a popular search term on Google, (3) a common chronic but non-lethal disease, (4) something weird &amp; horrible? I have previously felt that we should have very good articles on cancer, heart disease, stroke etc, but I agree with Steven that most people will be looking for high-quality content on how to treat their acne, stop getting vaginal candidiasis or find something to take them through the day when they've got a headache. With most of us being either medical students or practising doctors, it is easily forgotten that outh ulcers may be more debilitating than community-acquired pneumonia. Perhaps a hierarchy of importance would need to take into account both the popularity of the subject and their impact on health in general. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 08:11, 28 December 2007 (UTC)

You might want to take a look at ikipedia:WikiProject_Medicine/Assessment#Importance_scale|our official importance scale.  Generally your instincts are on target:  Ratings are the intersection between what average, non-medical people want to read about medicine (sex, kids, and the common cold), and what we think average, non-medical people should want to read about medicine (hypertension, heart disease, and the fact that those &quot;whole wheat&quot; fried doughnuts aren't technically a health food).  
My own assessments additionally reflect my POV that
* individual people who impact on modern medicine is smaller than alen's was on pre-modern medicine, 
* organizations whose impact on worldwide medicine is smaller than the FDA's, 
* anatomy that isn't familiar to the average 12 year old, and
* medical signs and terms which are related primarily to a single specialty
are basically unimportant.  (You aren't required to cooperate with my biases, but you might find the official scale interesting.) ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 08:48, 28 December 2007 (UTC)

 erpes zoster again 

The article failed its FAC  and perhaps we should reflect on why we couldn’t get this right. The disease is very well understood, not controversial and not new, yet we still managed to get embroiled in arguments, distracted by trivia and mess up, (me included).  I did not nominate the article but if I had  I would be very disillusioned with Wikipedia today. Yes, the article was flawed, but nothing that could not be fixed. What went wrong? My two  English pennies worth.  We were treading on each others toes, me on Colin’s in particular, because it became too crowded.  Some were clearly learning about the disease whilst editing and not before and, for example,  mistaking  herpes zoster for a virus  when it is a disease.  We  were fiddling with syntax when we should have been checking the references, (where the big  problems were) and we weren’t using the discussion page enough. We were being too bold and, to my amazement,  the nominator never  contributed or questioned  what was happening.  As medics, my view is, (and I know this will make me unpopular), we have an obligation to research a subject that we don’t already know well, before leaping in. I’m not talking about the odd typo of course, we went in, me  more than most, took the article apart and tried to put it back together in a completely chaotic fashion. Ideally, and this is with benefit of hindsight, we should have coordinated our efforts and given each other the space to work. Say, let person A sort out any WP:MOS problems because they are good at it, then ask member B to sort out any problems with the discourse because they are a good critic, then ask person C to approve the clinical stuff and person D to check the virology. Lastly ask anyone known for writing first-rate prose to give it a good polish. I know this might sound complicated but this is how a  team works. I noticed last night that, despite  all our hard work, someone put a clean-up template at the top of the article! Oh my. I might be getting the wrong angle on this, being new to Wikipedia, so I am happy to stand to correction but please don’t shoot the messenger.--ser:GrahamColm|GrahamColmser talk:GrahamColm|Talk 17:55, 28 December 2007 (UTC)
And ... all of those necessary steps could have happened before FAC, with collaboration from the nominator. I'm as disappointed as you are, but for different reasons, which are best understood by looking at the ikipedia:Featured article candidates/Lung cancer|FAC for ung cancer.

Also, I suggest a review of the path taken to FA by olio and utism:  both collaborative, done pre-FAC and successful.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 18:07, 28 December 2007 (UTC)
I knew nothing about erpes zoster being nominated for FAC until it was spotted on the FAC page and brought to our attention here.  The nominator did not ask us for help before or during the FAC, nor told us about the FAC.  I agree that too much writing was and still is being done without reading the sources.  That is a very common fault on Wikipedia.  Editing others' writing, I failed to check sources adequately, but on the other hand it should not be necessary to check sources as completely as required on erpes zoster.  Re team work, a top down team may function in an organized manner, but Wikipedia functions in a bottom up manner.  The dynamics are very different.  In the case of this FAC, I think erpes zoster should have been promptly withdrawn by its nominator or rejected by the FAC committee.

Okay, I get it.  The &quot;consensus&quot; on the FAC page refers to the opinions of those who express an opinion.  Some of the early opinions of support were eventually revised.  Would it be uncool to contact those users and ask them to review their opinion?  I consider the opinions to be strictly personal;  in what sense had erpes zoster &quot;garnered support from the Medicine Project&quot; (sic)? --ser:Una Smith|Una Smith (ser talk:Una Smith|talk) 22:09, 28 December 2007 (UTC)

By the way, I think a clean-up tag on erpes zoster is entirely appropriate, simply to let  readers know that the article is currently unstable.  The clean-up tag is a signal to readers, to recruit those who are interested in helping and send others away.  I am sorry that some editors view the tag as somehow derogatory or a demerit. --ser:Una Smith|Una Smith (ser talk:Una Smith|talk) 21:52, 28 December 2007 (UTC)

Graham, the nominator ser:Orangemarlin|Orangemarlin has been around for three years, and has 10,000 edits under his belt. The nomination failed IMO due to lack of preparation and a misunderstanding of what level of detail and quality is expected at FAC. Don't beat yourself up (or anyone else) that he might be &quot;disillusioned with Wikipedia today&quot; because we failed him. I originally thought, like you, it could be polished at FAC, but it became apparent that the article was so fundamentally flawed (at policy level, not dashes and commas) that I stopped believing it could be fixed in time. Let me also be quite clear that I thought you behaved like a gentleman throughout, only once quite accidentally stepped on my toes. Sure, there was some friction between some editors and the rush didn't help that. I'd like to think we can work together, at a leisurely pace, again.
I fully agree with you about research and I hope I wasn't guilty of making ignorant edits. I actually made very few edits to the article during FAC: some initial work on the refs; a very little copyediting; a revised paragraph on lysine (subsequently dropped, which I'm more than OK about); and a few reverts when I felt a rushed, non-discussed, edit had made the text worse. My preference when reviewing an article that someone else has invested in, is to make only superficial edits and to ask them, the expert, to clarify or improve the text where I see deficiencies. I don't expect all my suggestions to be implemented but was frankly disappointed at the lack of response by the nominator. In effect, Graham and other project members stepped into that gap and did their best. 
This wikiproject should help with the final steps of taking an article to FAC. Some of our project members have free access to the sources used, and the training to understand them. I hope in future those abilities are used to give an article a thorough checkover prior to FAC. Yes, I feel I and others wasted a lot of time polishing prose that ultimately bore no resemblance to the quoted sources. I wish I'd spotted that earlier.
I'm not sure of the necessary for demarcation of roles, though if two people are trying to do the same thing at the same time in a hurry, they'd better be best of pals. It would sure be nice to have your ABCD talents working as a team. I don't quite follow Una's top-down/bottom-up argument. The best FACs I've seen recently involved essentially one hard-working and responsive subject expert who brought the article so far, deeply cared for the subject, and was supplemented by folk trying to help him or her improve it, but being respectful of that investment. I agree with Una that working under &quot;emergency&quot; conditions was stressful and the initial support it received didn't help relieve that pressure.
The key is preparation and patience. ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 21:58, 28 December 2007 (UTC)

 Bulged disc/neck/shoulder pain/no one knows 

My husband has been going to doctors, had an MRI, had X-rays, and they can't figure out what is wrong with his shoulder/neck area.  He is in so much pain, and they can't put their finger on it.  Chiropractor and family doctor haven't figured it out yet.  Any thoughts on what it could be?

Isn't it interesting, though, that a more authoritative, accurate, and neutral representation of the state of the art can be achieved via controlled chaos (Wikipedia), as opposed to Citizendium's approach? Of course, entrusting the Vitamin C article to an editor with a chip on his shoulder about &quot;the costs in terms of suffering and early deaths of the lack of conscience of many scientists in the life sciences&quot;, who was unable to work within the constraints of verifiability, neutrality and collaboration on Wikipedia, probably does not help matters. ser:MastCell|MastCell ser Talk:MastCell|Talk 20:37, 30 December 2007 (UTC)

 Fate of &quot;Unprotected sex&quot; 

The article nprotected sex was until recently just two definitions for the term.  1)Sex without protection from STDs and 2)Sex without protection from pregnancy.  The two different definitions are generally used in entirely different contexts.

Two editors Triumph|here believed the article should be redirected to afe sex and one performed the merge.  In the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Safe_sex&amp;diff=180537557&amp;oldid=180335339 diff of the merge] one sees that sites discussing ertility awareness were used to support the statement &quot;safe sex practices can be used as a form of family planning&quot;.  The editor obviously misunderstood; fertility awareness is commonly used to enable unprotected sex without risk of pregnancy.  Fertility awareness can be used as a method of family planning, but it has nothing to do with safe sex.  It is overwhelmingly used in stable monogamous relationships where not using a condom is generally not considered &quot;unsafe&quot;, thus the preference for the term &quot;unprotected&quot; instead of &quot;unsafe&quot; to refer to the lack of birth control use.

This merge deleted that usage of the term &quot;unprotected sex&quot; from Wikipedia.  I'm also not sure that someone typing &quot;unprotected sex&quot; into Wikipedia is going to be happier arriving at afe sex and not areback (sex).

There seems to be long-term dissatisfaction with &quot;unprotected sex&quot; as an article (see alk:Unprotected sex|its talk page), so I propose two alternatives:
*Make nprotected sex a disambiguation page to bareback (sex), safe sex, and fertility awareness, or
*Make &quot;unprotected sex&quot; a soft redirect to the Wiktionary entry (which doesn't currently exist, but I'm willing to create it if this option is accepted).

I hope this is the correct place to bring this up - it was suggested to me ser talk:Lyrl#Unprotected sex|on my talk page.  Any thoughts on my proposals would be appreciated. ser:Lyrl|Lyrlser talk:Lyrl|Talk     pecial:Contributions/Lyrl|C   16:22, 29 December 2007 (UTC)


Thanks, Lyrl.  I think we all agree that nprotected sex was an unsatisfactory article.  I considered making it a disambig page, but decided the topic would be better addressed within the context of afe sex, which is why I did the merge.  However, in some respects afe sex has a rather limited POV.  On alk:Safe sex I have mentioned some aspects of safe sex that are missing from the article.  The discussion here brings up yet another aspect:

&quot;Fertility awareness can be used as a method of family planning, but it has nothing to do with safe sex.  It is overwhelmingly used in stable monogamous relationships where not using a condom is generally not considered &quot;unsafe&quot;, thus the preference for the term &quot;unprotected&quot; instead of &quot;unsafe&quot; to refer to the lack of birth control use.&quot;

Fertility awareness can be used both to avoid pregnancy and to achieve pregnancy.  Also, if one member of a couple has an STD, then unprotected sex is unsafe sex.  Such a couple might use safe sex practices except when trying to conceive, and use fertility awareness to limit their use of unprotected hence unsafe sex. --ser:Una Smith|Una Smith (ser talk:Una Smith|talk) 16:58, 29 December 2007 (UTC)

Re the dab idea, 1)Sex without protection from STDs and 2)Sex without protection from pregnancy imply the disambig would be:
*Sex without protection from STDs:  contrast to afe sex
*Sex without protection from pregnancy:  contrast to irth control

That is a rather awkward disambig.  --ser:Una Smith|Una Smith (ser talk:Una Smith|talk) 17:17, 29 December 2007 (UTC)

For a disambiguation page, I had more in mind:
Unprotected sex may refer to:
*areback (sex), any type of penetrative sexual act without the use of a condom.
*Sexual activity that is not afe sex.
*In discussions of ertility awareness, sexual intercourse without any use of birth control.

That's an interesting observation about fertility awareness and a discordant couple trying to conceive.  I'm really not sure a citation could be found for that, however, and just us agreeing it's a possible use is P:OR|original research.  I don't believe the &quot;no birth control&quot; definition of unprotected sex fits into the &quot;safe sex&quot; article, so a merge leaves it deleted from Wikipedia.
If you believe the disambiguation page is a bad idea, how about a ikipedia:Soft redirect|soft redirect to Wiktionary? ser:Lyrl|Lyrlser talk:Lyrl|Talk     pecial:Contributions/Lyrl|C   17:20, 30 December 2007 (UTC)

I am on the fence re a disambiguation page, but opposed to a redirect to Wiktionary.  Re HIV discordant couples trying to conceive, [http://womenchildrenhiv.org/wchiv?page=tp-02-01#S3.2X here] is just one of many web citations.   That is why I prefer the merge into afe sex. --ser:Una Smith|Una Smith (ser talk:Una Smith|talk) 20:08, 30 December 2007 (UTC)

Thanks for the link, that's interesting that advice like that is common.  Sad that so many couples have to make such choices.

Back to the merge, though, I have two objections.  First, unprotected sex is most commonly used to mean barebacking.  In this sense, safe sex is the opposite of what most people are looking for when they type &quot;unprotected sex&quot; into Wikipedia.  Second, the &quot;no birth control&quot; usage is commonly used in relationships where sex without a condom is not considered &quot;unsafe&quot;.  I'm just not able to wrap my mind around including a discussion of birth control and pregnancy risk in an article where the stable introduction (prior to your edits) talked only about STDs and ended with the statement, &quot;Although safe sex practices can be used as a form of family planning, the term refers to efforts made to prevent infection rather than conception.&quot;

What are your objections to the disambig and soft redirect options?  You had stated earlier that you thought the disambiguation page would be awkward, did my formatting suggestion address any of that? Are you OK with the three links I included, or do you think one or more should be changed? ser:Lyrl|Lyrlser talk:Lyrl|Talk     pecial:Contributions/Lyrl|C   23:09, 30 December 2007 (UTC)

I just noticed, &quot;fertility awareness is commonly used to enable unprotected sex without risk of pregnancy.&quot; I certainly hope things like this aren't getting into any article on Wikipedia, unless &quot;without risk of pregnancy&quot; is commonly undertood to mean, &quot;with a 20% annual risk of pregnancy.&quot; ser:Antelan|Anteser:Antelan|lan ser_talk:Antelan|talk 23:12, 30 December 2007 (UTC)

With a significantly lower risk than random unprotected intercourse.  If the couple understands and has the motivation to follow the rules, a risk of less than 1% per year.  The actual article goes into the detail of perfect use and typical failure rates, I skipped over those details in this discussion to try to focus attention on my point that safe sex and unprotected sex can be unrelated topics, depending on how the terms are being used. ser:Lyrl|Lyrlser talk:Lyrl|Talk     pecial:Contributions/Lyrl|C   00:29, 31 December 2007 (UTC)

Antelan, could you be conflating fertility awareness with the (rudimentary) rhythm method?  --ser:Una Smith|Una Smith (ser talk:Una Smith|talk) 07:11, 31 December 2007 (UTC)

Probably not.  Problems with instruction (particularly among the self-taught) and compliance (it is not a suitable method for couples without the discipline to maintain accurate records and abstain or use barrier methods for a significant portion of each cycle) result in high pregnancy rates in some populations. I believe 20% was the failure rate found by the U.S. National Survey of Family Growth and cited in the 17th edition of Contraceptive Technology. ser:Lyrl|Lyrlser talk:Lyrl|Talk     pecial:Contributions/Lyrl|C   18:37, 31 December 2007 (UTC)

I object to a soft redirect because, as this discussion illustrates, the meaning of the term &quot;unprotected sex&quot; is complex enough to need explanation here, not in Wiktionary.  I also object to limiting Wikipedia articles to &quot;common&quot; meanings, ignoring other meanings verified in reliable sources.  After some thought about this, I now also object to a disambiguation page.  As alk:Bareback (sex) shows, &quot;bareback&quot; and &quot;unprotected&quot; are not equivalent.  And Lyrl asserts (and I agree) that &quot;unprotected sex&quot; and &quot;unsafe sex&quot; are not equivalent.  Hence, a disambiguation page would not be appropriate. &quot;Unprotected sex&quot; might be unsafe sex, or safe sex, depending on the circumstances.  So now I think &quot;unprotected sex&quot; belongs in a section on afe sex, or on its own page that is not a stub.  To break this impasse, it might help to research the history of the use of these terms.  --ser:Una Smith|Una Smith (ser talk:Una Smith|talk) 07:11, 31 December 2007 (UTC)

Looking at the above discussion, I think disambiguation is exactly what the awkward title nprotected sex should become, and I take back my previous opinion that it should redirect to afe sex. It depends completely on protection from what exactly. From STIs? From pregnancy? From birth defects (if the male is taking finasteride or thalidomide for some reason, or the female is on tuberculosis treatment or warfarin)? We need a short page that disambiguates between those various meanings in a sensible way. I see no problem mentioning barebacking there. If we start a whole new article that simply rehashes all the meanings I've mentions we'll end up with duplication. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 07:36, 31 December 2007 (UTC)

The link to thalidomide confused me - is sex without a condom dangerous for someone whose partner is taking that drug?
I'm not sure the links to specific barrier methods meet the oS:DAB|manual of style guideline &quot;Keep in mind that the primary purpose of the disambiguation page is to help people find the information they want quickly and easily. These pages are not for exploration, but only to help the user navigate to a specific article.&quot;  The current last line might just be dropped from the page?

Totally agree with Antelan that the burden of proof should always be on the party claiming that there is a &quot;controversy&quot;. Everything in medicine can be regarded as a controversy of some form or description. The Rheum Int paper fairly accurately describes current thinking about the enigmatic condition that fibromyalgia is (together with all those related syndromes). Obviously this is controversial, because all conditions that overlap with FM (such as hronic fatigue syndrome, ultiple chemical sensitivity etc etc) are &quot;controversial&quot;. But then the use of antibiotics in bronchitis is &quot;controversial&quot;, or the existence of rugada syndrome. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 21:29, 6 January 2008 (UTC)

 astroenteritis articles cluster 

Re the request for help with otavirus (see ikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine#Rotavirus|above), I notice there is a large cluster of closely related pages with overlapping content:
*otavirus (and possibly others)
*astroenteritis (merge astritis, nteritis, and acterial gastroenteritis?)
*iarrhea
*ral rehydration therapy

orovirus is notable for not having much content overlapping with other pages. --ser:Una Smith|Una Smith 00:37, 1 December 2007 (UTC)

I think astritis and nteritis have individual merits, because there are many causes of each that are unrelated to the clinical syndrome of gastroenteritis (e.g. regional enteritis, atrophic gastritis). acterial gastroenteritis can probably be merged in the GEitis article without loss of information.
The ORS page has individual merits.
iarrhea has at least 100 causes, from cholera to hyperthyroidism and back again to carcinoid and laxative abuse. It can stand on its own merits.
I totally agree that infectious gastroenteritis-related content should all be moved to one article. I'll see if I can lend a hand. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 22:52, 1 December 2007 (UTC)

 Acoustic Neuroma (Vestibular Neuroma): Treatment outcomes 

The Acoustic Neuroma article discusses the two available courses of treatment (microsurgery and radiotherapy), but does not discuss available literature on treatment outcomes. While a surgical procedure is a 'success' if the neuroma is removed, to the patient, post-surgery consequences are extremely important, and are not discussed to any great extent, but should be.

There appears to be conservative bias towards microsurgery in this article. The very high proportion of microsurgery patients that experience post-operative disability, long recovery periods, hearing loss and facial nerve damage, including pain and numbness of facial muscles should be taken into account in recommending treatment, especially since radiosurgery results appear to be improving and post operative complications are few.

Current literature seems to recommend microsurgery in cases where the neuroma is very large in size, growing rapidly or both and threatening imminent injury to the patient -- in that case, radiosurgery is not indicated as it is likely to produce short term post procedure swelling.

However, in many cases, the long recovery period, risk of facial nerve damage and hearing loss can be a very significant factor to most patients, especially if it interferes with future employment or activity. Radiosurgery is an important treatment alternative and may be the only reasonable course of treatment for those with slow growing, relatively small neuromas. ser:Rarkm|Rarkm (ser talk:Rarkm|talk) 15:54, 4 January 2008 (UTC)

Make a list of the things you were confused about, the &quot;oh, now I get it&quot; key details, etc.  To get sources that are not free on the internet, try nterlibrary loan at a public library in your area, or e-mail the corresponding authors.  You can get their e-mails often by following links from PubMed to the journal publisher website, where the article abstract page may reveal the e-mail address.  Sometimes the e-mail address is in the PubMed record and will display if you use one of the more detailed views such as Abstract or Abstract Plus.  Or do a Google search on the first or last author in the author list, and find the author that way.  Explain you want a reprint of the article for Wikipedia.  In my experience, most authors are delighted to help in this way.  If all else fails, let us know what you need and maybe someone here can get you a copy.  --ser:Una Smith|Una Smith (ser talk:Una Smith|talk) 22:02, 11 January 2008 (UTC)

Hi! That article is quite disputed. I would be glad, if somebody could classify it, and if somebody could write some lines about the aura of incompetence around some doctors of medicine (one female psychiatrist told me, that in psychiatry being correct is not essential -- although I would expect that it is essential that a victim of a hate crime gets another treatment than somebody who has imaginative enemies... especially I would think, that it is essential, that the violence doesn't continue in the psychiatric ward... but nobody listened to me...), so that the user can understand, why patients might decide to have severe pain instead of morphine...

A biographical article should not be the place for generalisations about a profession. This rubbish about an &quot;aura of incompetence&quot; is not encyclopedic - this always remains between the practicioner and his regulating body. There are good and bad doctors like there are good and bad rocket scientists, politicians and streetsweeps.
Whichever psychiatrist told you about &quot;being correct&quot;, you seem to have misinterpreted it. The point is not about the treatment people get (which should be equal whatever a person's background), but the level of accuracy that can be achieved in psychiatry. It is well known that several psychiatrists will reach different conclusions in the same patient. But the same phenomenon exists mutatis mutandis in other branches of medicine. Radiologists, pathologists and neurophysiologists will disagree with colleagues over a certain proportion of their cases - because nothing in life is 100% (apart perhaps from tranger than Fiction (film)|death and taxes). ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 20:51, 31 December 2007 (UTC)

................

I hope this helps your starting point.


Medical advice presupposes a professional relationship, between a doctor or qualified health care provider and a willing patient. It is based on the standard ethics of a doctor patient relationship and carries the rights and duties inherent in a relationship esteemed by society as unique amd held at a high level of trust and respect. The greater the burden on the clinician not to violate this trust and not to destroy this unique relationship.
                
Aspects of medical advise have certain pre-requisites such as confidentially between clinician and patient. An a priori   condition to giving medical advise is the examination of the patient with a standard format involving a history, physical examination, review of pertinent studies and tests and records, the ordering of additional studies and tests, if it advances diagnosis and treatment.

The function(s) of medical advice can be broad: To alleviate disease, to prevent disease, to educate patients for wellness and healthy life style, simply to educate the curious, reassure the anxious and above all employing the therapeutic art of listening.

Medical advice in the care of the ill should include a clearly stated diagnosis. Side effects of medications and treatments are discussed and alternatives, risks and benefits of treatment are made clear and transparent.

General information may be given, to either individuals, or groups, as in lectures, internet message boards, newspaper articles and the like. This instance does not create a doctor patient relationship.

The quality of the clinicians decision making, from ordering the appropriate tests, to interpreting the tests, to forming a diagnosis, to recommending treatment are the usual and customary duties of a clinician. When any of these activities cause harm to the patient and if reasonable members of the same profession can be shown to have done the thing differently to avoid harm, then the clinician may, or may not, have breached their duty to their patient and the case is evaluated for deviation from standard of care.ser:Buddydog21|Buddydog21 (ser talk:Buddydog21|talk) 07:09, 14 January 2008 (UTC)

 Alzheimer's disease 

We are having a discussion on the lzheimer's disease page regarding what should be included under a section called Potential Therapies.  Because most potential therapies have failed in this disease, we instituted a local rule that kept the list only to Phase 3 compounds or large-scale clinical trials (e.g., the GEM study for ginkgo has 2800 patients studied for 6 or 7 years).  If you have an opinion about this, please join us on the talk page.  Also, can we move the article up in importance to High or even Top for medicine, given that the burden of the disease in terms of health care costs is on a par with heart disease and cancer. We had a peer review in the fall of 2006, but it may be time to have some new eyes take a look at how it might be moved toward a featured article in English.

I totally agree that a good, reliable article on this common devastating condition is urgently needed. I also agree that its priority should be &quot;high&quot; at the very least. I once had big plans for it, and even retrieved a recent review in Ann Intern Med (MID|12614093) that is available free and could be used to improve the AD article.
While we have never formally discussed this, I have personally always felt that phase III human trials are the absolute edge of what might be notable in terms of experimental/potential therapies. Obviously there are exceptions, especially when there is broad agreement in the literature that a particular intervention is likely to make a major difference. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 22:03, 12 January 2008 (UTC)

 &quot;Notability&quot; for experimental medical treatments 

This comment is a response to the Alzheimer's topic, listed immediately aboe, but may be of more general interest.

An article about Alzheimer's would seem to be urgent.  

I do, however, have very serious misgivings about the proposed rule to consider only Phase 3 treatments and above as &quot;notable.&quot; The logic of this &quot;Phase 3 rule&quot; seems backwards or, at best, incomplete.

* The contention (mentioned on alk:Alzheimer's disease that &quot;most potential therapies have failed in this disease&quot; does not seem like a reason to be less inclusive.  Forgive me for disagreeing, but it means we should be more inclusive.  More readers will be seeking treatment or may be approached for informed consent.  Our role ought to be to supply more information, not less -- or, at least, to redirect readers to sources that are equipped to be more inclusive.  It is not a service to fail to mention things they may be interested in or hear about elsewhere.

* If the obvious therapies have failed in a devastating disease then the community needs to accelerate the pace of development, particularly of innovative approaches.  In practice a main thing hindering this is not lack of possible therapies or lack of evidence of efficacy: it's lack of mindshare.  It's practicality.  A serious difficulty facing investigators is recruiting centers, physicians, and subjects.  If Wikipedia takes the stuffy attitude that we only mention a therapy after it's proven -- and we thereby make an uninformed, non-evidential judgment of its lack of efficacy -- then we make the situation worse.

* As an example of the tendency to make such hasty judgments, look at the wholesale comment on alk:Alzheimer's disease that &quot;there were 3 compounds across 5 trials that did not show positive results (statistically significant primary endpoints) in Phase 3.&quot;  In fact, few Phase 3 trials really have sufficient statistical power (Is 80% power really enough? Was the target effect size chosen as the smallest clinically significant difference, or merely as the observed average in a small-but-lucky pilot?).  Even more, extremely few Phase 3 trials have adequate provision for subgroups and covariates in their primary analyses, and certainly lack power to detect any effect in a subgroup.  As we statisticians try to point out, failure to find an effect may only mean you didn't look hard enough.

* There is essentially no increase in the evidence base for a drug in Phase 3 compared to one in Phase 2.  Contrary to early optimism years ago, when the &quot;Phase&quot; terminology was invented, statisticians do not have special &quot;approximate, quick-and-dirty&quot; sample size tables for Phase 2.  We have to use the same ones as Phase 3 -- and the news from those tables is never optimistic.  Phase 2 trials cannot, in principle, have the sample size or organizational structure to prove efficacy -- except perhaps sometimes via surrogate markers.  In fact, at least one NIH institute, in its Program Announcement for pilot trials, explicitly, emphatically, and repeatedly denigrates proposals for pilots that really are &quot;underpowered, miniature Phase 3 trials.&quot;  Thus, the sad fact is that when a major decision has to be made whether to invest huge resources in launching a Phase 3 trial, the debate is more often about the design structure than about the evidence base, which may be shockingly small.

As an example of evidence, please look at [http://www.icord.org/iccp.html Experimental Treatments for Spinal Cord Injuries], which I happened to be involved in. This records the efforts of a large, international group of senior, mostly academic investigators in a field that resembles Alzheimer's in as far as being a devastating disease where previous trials have been unsuccessful but there are now many new experimental therapies on the horizon.  We were unconstrained by Wikipedia's notions of &quot;notability.&quot;  We merely were a bunch of experts trying to tell the community, as clearly and usefully as we could, what we wanted them to know.  We accepted from the start that we'd need several documents, for different purposes. The result was 
# a 10-page summary and overview,
# a 40-page guide for people with spinal cord injury, their families, friends and caregivers,
# a series of 4 academic papers defining what we thought was the state of the art in trial design -- published in Spinal Cord.

We had 3 principles throughout, all non-negotiable:
* be inclusive
* be informative
* be accurate about science.

Wikipedia Project Medicine might take a similar attitude.  Multiple articles might be needed on any of the major diseases.  We need to either tell people what they need to know or, being an encyclopedia not a textbook, we need to point them to other sources that can tell them.

Whilst appreciating your earnest sentiments, ikipedia:General disclaimer states that we do not give specific advice, and ikipedia:Medical disclaimer states both &quot;WIKIPEDIA DOES NOT GIVE MEDICAL ADVICE&quot; and &quot;Nothing ... should be construed as an attempt to offer or render a medical opinion or otherwise engage in the practice of medicine&quot;. Your noble work, described above, to help formulate real-world consensus advice, by utilising people's expertese to give best guidence upon often incomplete evidence (with all the provisos of using acedemic research, constrained clinical research and then having to manage real patients) is quite different from an encyclopaedia's construction. WP can not itself propose a particular approach as promising (under P:Cite, P:Verify and P:No original research), but only report on a P:RS|reliable source as stating that it seems promising or, at a later date, use a 3rd party source as confirming that in retrospect it did prove promising. As WP itself can not go predicting (unlike the highly considered opinions that your real-world group will have made), it can not be used as a source of information for those (patients, relatives or doctors) at the coal face of making decissions in uncertain or developing-knowledge situations. A drug in development seems, IMHO, rarely to warrent any mention in wikipedia at all:
# claims from the company itself are not independant, and thus reliable, to confirm the claim of a drug being promising
# the researchers opinions in the midst of a trial are generally unreliable until the study is completed, data collated, rates for any unexpected catastrophic side effects duly assessed and the paper having gone through the peer review process of journal publication. For if the trial data is really proving in the midst of a trial to be so overwhlmingly positive, then comments by the researchers begs questions: either the study should be discontinued as having demonstrated sufficient power that further withholding active treatment from the placebo group has become unethical, or the study is continuing because the weight of demonstrated effect is not really that strong yet (and as per previously points, needs to await the report writing and journal publication processes).
# other doctors can not yet have commented on the overall role of the pudative treatment for a particular condition, as it is still undergoing testing.
The exception is where wider medical or general media have commented upon the trial, and notablity is established by that reporting (rather than directly from the trial/trialists). Hence a financial report of say Pizfer's shares soaring on the basis of preliminary results and how the company's future now depend on the success of the drug, probably would be notable. Whereas a small biochem research unit starting work on a drug with only a few patients trialled in local surrounding hospitals and no worldwide media reporting, really fails to rise to the horizon of notability inclusion, and so yes wikipedia is both never going to be a news banner reporting on work in progress, and will always lag (hopefully only slightly) behind real world developments. ser:Davidruben|David Ruben  ser talk:Davidruben|Talk  02:00, 13 January 2008 (UTC)

Some reactions to ser:Davidruben's comments:
* Could you point to anyplace in my remarks where I suggested that Wikipedia under any circumstances should recommend anything? Or even to describe any treatment as &quot;promising?&quot;  My discussion was not about recommending treatments, but about covering them.  Your warnings (even in capital letters) seem misdirected.
* If you look at the context of the discussion, I was replying to a comment suggesting that we limit our coverage.  I contended instead that we should  try to expand coverage.  The discussion was about the degree of coverage, and not about whether or not to recommend.
* The work that I cited does not recommend any treatments, either -- or anything other than that patients and potential subjects should be informed about the availability of evidence and that trials should be scientific.
* My post was time-stamped at 01:02 -- and yours at 02:00. Did you read the sources that I linked to and about which you have given opinions?
* Your attempts at sarcasm and dismissiveness (&quot;earnest sentiments&quot; and &quot;Your noble work&quot;) are not helpful.
* My medical colleagues and friends that I mentioned do &quot;manage real patients&quot; on a day-to-day basis.  Working with spinal cord injury can be especially heartbreaking -- and so we're especially aware of the consequences of our research and publications.
* You attempt to paint me as starry-eyed about the promise of research.  On the contrary, I'm a member of an NIH committee (not speaking here, or ever, officially) whose job it is to evaluate research with a cold eye and help set funding priorities.  I view attempts at research with suspicion.

* I'm advocating the following:
**science (namely, objective reporting of lines of evidence).

Appologies if you took any of above as a warning, certainly not meant to be, but rather discussion where, as editors, we should draw the line on inclusion/exclusion (PS capitalisation not mine but that of the relevant wikipedia disclaimer page). I did indeed have a look at [http://www.nature.com/sc/journal/v45/n3/full/3102010a.html Guidelines for the conduct of clinical trials for spinal cord injury as developed by the ICCP panel: clinical trial design] which seems a particularly well written article (both in content and particularly the ease of reading for a non-statistitian non-expert) - much (most) of it is equaly applicable to research in other conditions. My praise for your real-life work was therefore quite in earnest. What I'm advocating is that as wikipedia is not a directory or merely a collection of facts, so it should not merely list a drug in development just because a phase 3 trial exists (rather that after completion of this process then the inclusion in pharmacopeas and widespread use acts as the relevant notability). ser:Davidruben|David Ruben  ser talk:Davidruben|Talk  03:27, 13 January 2008 (UTC)
Qualification: of course many large or important studies are reported upon before completion and this in itself may make the trial notable, but my initial feeling is to agree with JFW's initial stated reasoning. Whilst I think formulating any formal policy by this wikiproject on trial notability is probably too difficult (each case needing consideration on its own merit and relationship to the disease and community of affected patients), I do feel some general guidence points might usefully be discussed amongst ourselves :-) ser:Davidruben|David Ruben  ser talk:Davidruben|Talk  03:39, 13 January 2008 (UTC)
I've posted a heads-up to T:PHARM, as an area skated around in their past work. ser:Davidruben|David Ruben  ser talk:Davidruben|Talk  04:12, 13 January 2008 (UTC)

I am in favor of giving more information, not less.  I think clinical trials are intrinsically notable and their presence in a registry such as clinicaltrials.gov is more than sufficient to establish notability for literal-minded types.  Clinical trials don't appear in the media unless there is a major positive or negative outcome, which goes far beyond notability.  Few lay readers are able to grasp the more technical details without something like Wikipedia as a guide, and even specialists may have trouble connecting a given trial with published articles about it.  For the sake of all patients who are asked to participate in clinical trials, please let us not hide them under a rug and call it notability. --ser:Una Smith|Una Smith (ser talk:Una Smith|talk) 05:57, 13 January 2008 (UTC)
It seems to me that it would be extremely difficult to write a thoroughly non-speculative segment about clinical trials (P:CRYSTALBALL). I haven't really looked, but off the top of (anyone's) head, is there an example of a well-written, non-speculative piece on a clinical trial that has yet to receive major media coverage? ser:Antelan|Anteser:Antelan|lan ser_talk:Antelan|talk 06:07, 13 January 2008 (UTC)

Thank you for the clarification. I, in turn, apologize if I seemed unnecessarily prickly in response.

You make one point that I totally agree with: &quot;each case needing consideration on its own merit and relationship to the disease and community of affected patients.&quot;  If you are saying that there should be no general policy, but rather an attempt at consensus of editorial judgment for each article (no different, really, from any other kind of Wikipedia article) about the merits of the reliably published evidence -- this being taken to apply to notability and certainly not to any recommendation or endorsement of specific therapies -- then this is essentially all I was arguing for.  My personal opinion would perhaps go a little farther: that completion of a phase 3 trial is neither necessary nor sufficient, and that current inclusion in phase 3 is even less so.

I think we need to remember how widespread clinical trials are.  For example, the Sygen multi-center trial in spinal cord injury (which I was involved in) started while the NASCIS 3 study was still running.  At one point an informal estimate was made that, between the two major trials, the combined tertiary care centers cooperating with them saw about 2/3 of the serious spinal cord injuries in the US and Canada.  Therefore, for any patient meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria, there was perhaps a better than even chance of being offered randomization to possibly an experimental therapy.  Similarly, the reasoning of the more recent ICCP group was that, although, the newer trials are perhaps smaller, there may be so many of them that a large portion of the spinal injury population is likely to be approached for informed consent.  Obviously, such patients are desperate for hope.  For the sake of the present patients, we felt that it was important to provide them with impartial evidence about the state of research worldwide so that they understood their options.  For the sake of research (and of future patients) we thought that transparent dissemination of objective information would improve public response and cooperation.

What I'm trying to say is that I don't think Wikipedia's goals should be that much  different  -- to sift evidence and try to relay it objectively, or to point to other sources.

Again the point is about notability and coverage.  There's a folklore witticism about the fact that banks never lend you money until you're financially sound enough not to need it (or at least it was that way in the old days).  To stretch the point and overemphasize, we don't want to be so conservative that nobody gets information on a treatment from us until it's so well proven and widely adopted that no information is necessary.

One other note.  Since you mention the pharmacology project, I might mention that I offered to help one group there.  I'd be willing to do the same here in Medicine -- with the same caveats.  For me, researching and writing in these areas is work: it's my day job.  Other things being equal, I'd like spend my volunteer, personal time on Wikipedia in other areas: the arts, poetry, novels.  So, I'm not actively seeking projects in medicine or pharmacology -- but I will try not to refuse requests for my expertise -- assuming, of course, that it were in demand.
ser:William P. Coleman|William P. Coleman (ser talk:William P. Coleman|talk) 06:18, 13 January 2008 (UTC)

I think the Phase 3 rule is appropriate for lzheimer's disease.  My primary reason for thinking this is because the article is already enormous (76 kb!  141 separate refs!  15 screenfuls!).  If everything in clinical trials (or even Phase 2) was included, then the article would be unworkably large.  Furthermore, the article would be seriously out of balance, and end up giving undue weight to research.  I wouldn't necessarily apply this rule to all articles, but I think that it's appropriate for this article.  If there is (average-reader-level) demand for a comprehensive review of AD research, then we can create a separate article that focuses on research.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 07:02, 13 January 2008 (UTC)

I think the pharmacology WikiProject will give you roughly the same response, Mr Coleman. The problem with Alzheimer's research is the enormous hype about every positive trial result. Here in the UK we have the Daily Mail, a newspaper strangely obsessed with &quot;cures&quot; for severe or chronic conditions. Every phase I trial result on Alzheimer's becomes a headline here. The important task of an encyclopedia is not to regurgitate these confusing messages (which are often disproved weeks later in other studies), but to identify major trends in research.
There may be good arguments for including more preliminary results, but preferably in context. For instance, we can have a section about attempts to stop myloid beta aggregation or inhibit amma secretase action, and the various compounds being investigated. This is much more helpful than just blasting the poor reader with long lists of substances that may never reach clinical development. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 08:45, 13 January 2008 (UTC)

Thank you for your response.  I don't wish to be argumentative (and I worry that perhaps I am being so).  Please forgive me but, as I said at the beginning of my original comment I don't understand the logic. The existence of widespread misinformation seems like more -- not less -- reason for Wikipedia to include coverage that's accurate and reliable.  Our response to each blast from the Daily Mail need not be verbose. It could be crisp, factual, and short.  If eventually a separate article were needed to hold all the responses, then it would be needed.

I don't read the Daily Mail and don't know how they obtain their fodder.  Normally, well-designed positive studies (in whatever phase) should not often be refutable in other studies (whether a few weeks later or not).  It's inherent in the nature of the concept Type I Error that false positives with p=.05 should only happen about 5% of the time. (Also, as I mentioned earlier, phase 1 and phase 2 studies should not normally be designed for clinical efficacy at all because they would be necessarily under-powered and potentially misleading.) 
* If 100 Alzheimer's studies are completed each year for ineffective treatments, then about 5 of them can be expected to show positive results.  We should be able to refer readers to a single infobox or a general article called, &quot;The commonness of false positives in overly-repeated research,&quot; or some title that's more public-friendly.
* Or, if the Daily Mail's favorite studies have obvious design flaws, then we should be able to dismiss each in a well-chosen sentence or two pointing the flaws out.
* Or, if the Daily Mail is in the habit of hyping studies with non-significant (p&gt;.05) positive trends, then perhaps we need an infobox with a simple list of them, citing the non-significance of their p-value (while cautioning about the possible lack of statistical power). This infobox could be called, &quot;Potential Alzheimer's treatments that might conceivably be effective, but currently are subject to the Daily Mail's tendency to over-interpret random paint splatter and curious cloud formations.&quot;
* On the other hand, if there are only a small number of Alzheimer's studies, if they are well-designed, and if a disproportionate number of them are positive, then we need to consider the possibility that even the Daily Mail is sometimes right.

I wouldn't know which of these is plausible.  I don't know anything about Alzheimer's.  I'm merely a mathematician.  All I know about is numbers and the logically possible ways of interpreting them. ser:William P. Coleman|William P. Coleman (ser talk:William P. Coleman|talk) 13:39, 13 January 2008 (UTC)

I was using the Daily Mail only as a figure of speech, but I get your point: shouldn't we mention all avenues of research presently being pursued, and comment on the methodology. I don't think it is our job to point out flaws in studies, like Una Smith also reminds us below; to do so is flirting with P:NOR|no original research violation.
When I talked about &quot;refutation&quot; in other studies I was not talking about statistical errors at all. In medicine it is very common for different studies, sometimes with exactly the same methodology, to have conflicting outcomes. Furthermore, interventions may work very well in a Petri dish containing ground-up rodent brain, but have little or no effect in humans - or lead to intolerable adverse events. Interventions in phase I or II trials have the odds stacked against them of ever leading to a useful treatment. These are just some of the reasons why we have P:MEDRS, our own medical P:RS|reliable sources guideline. The fact that there are &gt;18000000 articles on PubMed (and many more in unindexed journals) does not mean that all of them have relevance to Wikipedia readers (or even to medical professionals). ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 20:30, 13 January 2008 (UTC)

Information without judicious opinion
It is not our job as WP editors to say whether or not a given clinical trial has merit.  I know it can be hard for a physician (or physician in training :-) to suspend the practice of giving advice.  In the case of a condition such as Alzheimer's disease, or AIDS, where there are many, many trials underway, I think WP can play an important role in grouping these trials according to approach, in explaining their immediate objectives and the scientific reasoning behind their designs, and in reporting their outcomes.

On pina bifida, I wrote a very brief summary of one clinical trial, replacing text added by someone with an apparent interest in recruiting patients for the trial.  It is not a very good example of &quot;just the facts ma'am&quot;, but it is an example.

There is incredible bitterness among many parents of children enrolled in clinical trials, the common theme being that although the parents were informed they did not really understand what they were signing up for.  Their primary sources of information are twofold:  recruiters and other parents on private support groups.  Recruiters have a vested interest.  Support groups often are weak on the crucial technical details and sometimes forbid debate and full exchange of information (which may be mis-labeled as &quot;edical advice&quot;).

Another gap in information that I see often is this:  when a clinical trial is suspended or terminated, there may be no public explanation of why, and patients often do not recognize these steps as red flags.

--ser:Una Smith|Una Smith (ser talk:Una Smith|talk) 17:44, 13 January 2008 (UTC)

You've identified two major problems in clinical research: the quality and &quot;informedness&quot; of informed consent, and the non-publication of negative results or suspended trials. However, the leap seems to be that Wikipedia should try to fix these problems. I don't think that's the role of Wikipedia. We should definitely not be tolerating overt &quot;recruitment&quot; for clinical trials here. On the other hand, we should not be in the business of raising &quot;red flags&quot; or trying to explain a clinical trial more fully than its IRB-approved consent documents do. ser:MastCell|MastCell ser Talk:MastCell|Talk 22:01, 13 January 2008 (UTC)

... which is why we need some general guidelines an which studies are and which ones are not useful/notable without prejudice on the methodology etc. When faced with a multiplicity of research (as in Alzheimer's), a lot of weeding out can be done by selecting phase III (or maximally phase II in extremely promising interventions) trials in journals with a highish impact factor. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 06:08, 14 January 2008 (UTC)

I agree in general. However, some fields are less evidence-based than others (I'm thinking of my own here). Many interventions are adopted based on Phase II (or worse) data, while some Phase III trials fail to have an impact on practice for a variety of reasons. I don't know what the best answer is - I wouldn't want to exclude important studies with a &quot;Phase III&quot; requirement, but we ought to have some formal means of filtering out the dozens of pilot studies which tend to find their way into articles. It might be best to start with standard practice guidelines from major organizations, or Cochrane-type evidence reviews, and work backward to the primary sources used by those expert groups (to avoid potentially idiosyncratic use of the evidence). Of course, not every topic has a Cochrane review available... ser:MastCell|MastCell ser Talk:MastCell|Talk 23:52, 14 January 2008 (UTC)

I think this is a helpdesk-style question, actually. Transplantation is surgical, for starters. Transplantation of individual organs probably comes under the purview of the surgical specialty that deals with those organs normally.

I agree with Antelan that organ transplants tend to be carried out by surgeons already familiar with the organ in question, but generally superspecialised into the transplant of that organ. I think renal transplants, which are common, are carried out by dedicated transplant surgeons.

I don't actually agree with NCurse that all transplant articles should be categorised under immunology. That would clutter the category very much.

From the article (feel free to move or remove):


Sublingual immunotherapy

SLIT has been proposed as an alternative to the subcutaneous route [145]. SLIT has been shown to be effective in both rhinitis and asthmatic patients and to have a good safety profile (no anaphylactic reactions reported) [145, 146]. A recent Cochrane meta-analysis [147] concluded that ‘SLIT is a safe treatment which significantly reduces symptoms and medication requirements in AR. The size of the benefit compared with that of other available therapies, particularly injection immunotherapy, is not clear, having been assessed directly in very few studies. Further research is required concentrating on optimizing allergen dosage and patient selection’.

Recent studies performed in large samples of patients have shown a clear dose effect of tablet-based SLIT in patients with grass pollen-induced rhinoconjunctivitis [148–150]. In one study in which subcutaneous and SLIT for seasonal rhinitis were compared, both were effective compared with placebo, although the study was underpowered to detect differences between treatments [151]. A further recent trial of grass allergen tablets for sublingual use demonstrated a 30–40% improvement in symptom and medication scores and an approximate 50% increase in the responder rate, compared with placebo [152].

I think most of the recent re-classifications are fine, but &quot;pelvic exam&quot; and possibly &quot;self-care&quot; may deserve extra points based on their potential for popularity with normal readers.  I wouldn't object to lowering the ratings on several others:  functional symptom, medical advice, patient education, standards of care.

 PMC links 

I'm slightly confused about how we should be linking article fulltext in references when the fulltext is available free on ubMed Central. My personal practice is not to include the link in the &quot;url=&quot; parameter of l|cite journal but to use the template l|PMC with the PMC article ID (not the PMID) as the article's identifier. What am I meant to be doing? Is there any need for the PMC template at all? ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 22:07, 21 January 2008 (UTC)
I never use l|cite journal so I use l|PMC a lot; I see no need to delete it. I thought PMC had switched all of their IDs to PMID, and the differences had disappeared? --ser:Stevenfruitsmaak|Steven Fruitsmaak (ser_talk:Stevenfruitsmaak|Reply) 22:22, 21 January 2008 (UTC)
I always use PMC when it's available; when the article is available from the journal website or Medscape, I simply add a regular link titled &quot;Free full text&quot;—I never use the url= parameter, though I'm not sure why :) l|PMC does still use the PubMed Central ID, not the article PMID. Changing this would be simply a matter of making the template use [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubmedid=1} 1}] instead of [http://www.pubmedcentral.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pmcentrez&amp;artid=1} 1}], but then all links would have to be updated! ser:Fvasconcellos|Fvasconcellos (ser talk:Fvasconcellos|t·pecial:Contributions/Fvasconcellos|c) 23:12, 21 January 2008 (UTC)

PMC takes PMID codes but still parses them to its own article ID. I think the l|PMC template should continue to use PMC article identifiers preferentially. I was simply wondering whether there was any agreement on where to put the PMC link - in the l|cite journal template or separately. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 07:23, 22 January 2008 (UTC)

 Common cold and toothbrushes? 

Any one have a good source for making the link between the ommon cold and oothbrushes?

I found one article with a PubMed search-- but don't have access to it:
[No authors listed] I'm just getting over a really bad cold. Would it help if I tossed out my old toothbrush and got a new one to avoid reinfecting myself with any cold virus that may be on the brush? Mayo Clin Health Lett. 2001 Jun;19(6):8. MID|11398217.

There is [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/health/thehealthnews.html?in_article_id=999&amp;in_page_id=1797 an article] in the aily Mail.  It quotes one Professor onald Eccles, director of the Common Cold Centre at ardiff University:

FACT: You must change your toothbrush.

Once you are beginning to recover from your cold, throw away your old toothbrush and buy a new one. This will lessen the risk of prolonging the symptoms thanks to the virus living on the old toothbrush.


I tend to think the changing toothbrushes is hooey.  Any thoughts?  
In any case-- it seems like an interesting discussion to add to the oothbrush article. ser:Nephron|Nephron ser_talk:Nephron| T|pecial:Contributions/Nephron|C 01:07, 22 January 2008 (UTC)


Given the state of the immune system during the couple of days after rhinovirus symptoms abate (I assume that viable virus might last a couple of days in reasonably optimal circumstances), I doubt that the small amount of viable virus on a toothbrush is able to cause a clinically significant reinfection in a typically healthy person, but this recommendation is widespread (e.g., see [http://www.osteopathic.org/index.cfm?PageID=you_sorethroat the AOA website]).  

I've always wondered why those recommendations always involve throwing away the toothbrush (and buying a new one) instead of disinfecting it.  Is it just because most people keep their toothbrushes longer than they should anyway, and this makes a good excuse?

Furthermore, with the &quot;Once you are beginning to recover&quot; rules, you could easily throw out a contaminated toothbrush too soon, with the result that the new one will become virus-coated the first time you use it.  

Here's [http://www.cdc.gov/OralHealth/infectioncontrol/factsheets/toothbrushes.htm basic information] on toothbrush hygiene.  There's a sentence here which could be used to contradict the usual advice, but I'm not sure that they're thinking about the common cold.  They may be thinking primarily about cold sores or yeast infections or something like that.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 04:04, 22 January 2008 (UTC)

Yeah, the CDC says: &quot;No published research data documents that brushing with a contaminated toothbrush has led to recontamination of a user’s mouth, oral infections, or other adverse health effects.&quot; As an aside, we should never be using the aily Mail as a source in a medical article. As a wise man once said, the Mail is in the business of classifying every naturally occurring substance as either a cause of, or cure for, cancer. ser:MastCell|MastCell ser Talk:MastCell|Talk 05:25, 22 January 2008 (UTC)

Aggh - Article is in a mess.

However some papers on PubMed use term for any fruit-allergy even where no pollinosis, and some even for non-fruits (raw fish in Japan). The article need radical lead-in definition rewrite, or merger to ood allergy.

The coding looks fine.  From my past experience, it can sometimes take days for articles to be placed in newly added categories from templates.  Making an edit to alk:List of medical schools in the United Kingdom may cause immediate proper placement into the category, though this isn't necessary.

I've manually added FL-Class to the statistics table. See if the WP 1.0 bot will update it for us. As for the protection, I am willing to consider unprotecting it, but on the other hand it is transcluded onto 1000s of pages, and vandalism to templates has historically been a major problem because they tend to be on few people's watchlists. Views invited. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 20:32, 23 January 2008 (UTC)

Unfortunately, the WP 1.0 bot doesn't work that way.  I just re-ran it for this WikiProject, and the FL-Class row you added is now gone.  There has been some discussion about adding the non-standard classes (see ikipedia talk:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Archive 15#List-class), but no decision has been made and the talk has died out for now.  If we want FL-Class articles to be included, we would need to put them in an additional category (which is easy enough to do via l|WPMED).  If the bot recognizes sub-categories (which I doubt it does), another option would be to have at|FL-Class medicine articles as a sub-category of at|List-Class medicine articles.

With regard to protection of high-visibility templates, most of the article assessment templates have become protected in the past few months.  The only rationale I have heard is that they are potential targets of vandalism.  Although these are widely-used templates, they are not in the main namespace and receive little vandalism (of which I have seen none).  If any restrictions were placed on them, I would expect semi-protection and not full-protection.  I used to be somewhat active in maintaining the assessment templates, but now it takes days or weeks to have administrators make changes using l|editprotected.  --ser:Scottalter|Scott Alter 21:39, 23 January 2008 (UTC)

In the U.S., emergency medicine is a recognized specialty, accredited by the American Board of Emergency Medicine.

It's a relatively new specialty but a fairly popular one. ser:MastCell|MastCell ser Talk:MastCell|Talk 18:53, 28 January 2008 (UTC)
Thank You for Your answer. I don't know much about the US- system of accreditation. In our country a speciality can just be accredited by the &quot;chamber of physicians&quot;; so a speciality of a &quot;Board of Surgeons&quot; or  &quot;Board of Emergency medicine&quot; would not officially be recognized, although there are also non-official organisations doing similar. So my questions - is this different in the United states? Who accreditates an official speciality maybe like surgery, internal medicin, urology and so on; also a similar &quot;Board of surgery&quot;? - Maybe this question sounds silly in Your ears, but I'd ask You to answer, cause otherwise, I cannnot compare the education of Your country and ours. We also have the speciality &quot;Emergency medicine&quot; in in many German countries; but it is of less value then surgery or urology; we call those specialities &quot;additional speciality&quot;.

 Coronary stents 

I was updating some info on CABG and PCI today and came across the oronary stent and rug-eluting stent articles.  The DES page appears to have been largely created as a marketing page by one of the device companies - it has since been cleaned up by other users.  The coronary stent page was a stub and did not meet wiki guidelines.  A lot of the information on the DES page should be moved onto the ercutaneous coronary intervention|PCI or coronary stent page.  The DES page should be about the drug-eluting stents themselves; the info on placement and complications should be on the PCI page, the history of stents should be on the coronary stent page.  The credit for the picture of the stent on the DES page is the FDA - the FDA  may not be the originator of the picture - it could be used with permission of Boston Scientific. I have already made some of these changes, but there is still more to be done - more eyes looking at it would be good. ser:Dlodge|Dlodge (ser talk:Dlodge|talk) 23:15, 28 January 2008 (UTC)

I think the readership would be best served if we merged everything into oronary stent (or even ercutaneous coronary intervention). There would be ample space to discuss the bare metal vs drug-eluting stent controversy. We need a place to discuss the rationale for a choice between stents (e.g. it is better to use bare metal stents in situations where anticoagulation for other indications in ongoing, e.g. in trial fibrillation, and 1 year of clopidogrel in addition to warfarin would give an unacceptable bleeding risk). ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 07:13, 29 January 2008 (UTC)

 Raynaud's 

aynaud's phenomenon and aynaud's disease disagree about the proper name for secondary Raynaud's: whether it is Raynaud's phenomenon or Raynaud's syndrome, and if it's the former, what to call the concept that embraces both primary and secondary. I made some lengthy comments on both talk pages, and built a tentative Dab at aynaud's (replacing a worse Rdr).

It is also unclear to me whether Raynaud's is worth 2 or 3 articles: the 3 would be primary, secondary, and an article they would both lk to, stating the aspects they have in common and defining the core distinction.

Oh, yeah: it's probably worth trying to get separate pics where the patients have secondary and primary respectively.

Raynaud's phenomenon may occur in primary and secondary Raynaud's syndrome. I would only refer to primary Raynaud's as &quot;Raynaud's disease&quot;, as all secondary causes are diseases themselves (e.g. scleroderma). I think the whole kaboodle can easily be merged without loss of information. For instance, it is easier to make comparisons (e.g. that secondary Raynaud's is more likely to lead to ulceration and gangrene) and we can discuss the treatments en bloc. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 21:10, 30 January 2008 (UTC)

 Hereditary multiple exostoses 

Forgive me as I'm still getting used to the conventions used here. What I want to suggest is that the line which reads - A person with HME is also more likely to develop a rare form of bone cancer called chondrosarcoma as an adult, be edited to say the same thing but with a rewording of 'more likely'. I say this because it reads at present as though it's more likely that someone with the disorder WILL get bone cancer than NOT - if you see what I mean? I stress the importance of phrasing it such as I have four children who all suffer from the abnormality. When reading it, I wouldn't want them thinking they were 'more likely' to get cancer than not get it which is one way the current form of the sentence can be interpreted (and that would scare the life out of any kid reading it who suffers from the condition). I don't want to go ahead and do it myself as someone has obviously worked hard to get it into its current form. Thanks. ser:OzScot|OzScot (ser talk:OzScot|talk) 02:39, 2 February 2008 (UTC)

 Epinephrine vs Adrenaline (again) 

With no clear consensus (IMHO) in past discussions to use Adrenaline over pinephrine and with P:MEDMOS giving clear guideline to stick with INN, the article recently got moved.

 General housekeeping comments/cleanup 

Hey all. I might have missed this discussion already but I just wanted to ask a few things regarding the recent changes done:
*Currently ikipedia:WikiProject Clinical medicine has a soft redirect onto this page? Wouldn't it make more sense just to use a standard redirect?
*Will there need to be a process where all the clinical medicine templates/userboxes etc get deleted?
*What will happen to the articles already tagged with clinical medicine project templates? Are they already removed or will they automatically be removed upon deleting the template?
*Is ikipedia:WikiProject Clinical medicine/Collaboration and ikipedia:WikiProject Clinical medicine/categorizations still necessary? Should they be moved somewhere onto[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Medicine?
*As how clinical medicine project is done, should something also be done with ikipedia:WikiProject Preclinical Medicine? (And like above, if it does get removed, should all the templates/userboxes/ etc also should be removed? Maybe the Preclinical aspects should be writen up somewhere along the main medicine wikiproject? (And additionally have the talk page archived into this talk page? As is done with clinical wikiproject)
*Should a taskforce (of either preclinical or clinical medicine or both) be implemented as done by other wikiprojects? Or possibly only in the future if it is requested by a number of individuals? 

Sorry if these issues have already been brought up/are fixed/on the process of being fixed.

ClinMed's userbox now (hard) redirects to Template:User WPMed ser:Davidruben|David Ruben  ser talk:Davidruben|Talk  14:19, 28 January 2008 (UTC)

I like the idea of a 'taskforce' approach.  The Philosophy project seems to use that system, so that there's only one template for the large group, but you can specify that this article is supported by the ethics sub-group (for example).  If there were a way to easily replace all the ClinMed tags with a &quot;WPMED (ClinMed taskforce)&quot; tag, I'd support that.  
This might actually be useful for several 'child' projects, actually, especially if there are any dormant ones.  It could also cut down on the stack of WikiProject tags on some talk pages.  (Imagine a hypothetical drug that treats a viral eye infection in several animal species:  that could easily acquire WPMED, Virus, Clin Med, Eye, Pharma, Vet Med, Dog and Cat tags).  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 21:31, 28 January 2008 (UTC)

I second the task force idea for Clinical medicine.  I also would support merging the child projects as task forces.  Looking at ikipedia:WikiProject Council/Directory/Science#Medicine, the projects that would fit within Medicine include ikipedia:WikiProject Clinical medicine|Clinical medicine, ikipedia:WikiProject Preclinical Medicine|Preclinical Medicine, ikipedia:WikiProject Anatomy|Anatomy, ikipedia:WikiProject Dentistry|Dentistry(?), ikipedia:WikiProject First aid|First aid, ikipedia:WikiProject Gastroenterology|Gastroenterology, ikipedia:WikiProject Medical Genetics|Medical Genetics, ikipedia:WikiProject Nephrology|Nephrology, ikipedia:WikiProject Ophthalmology|Ophthalmology, ikipedia:WikiProject Pathology|Pathology, and ikipedia:WikiProject Radiology|Radiology.  Most of these projects appear inactive, but we still need to have discussions in each of their project talk pages for their opinions.  The initial &quot;takeover&quot; could be as simple as moving the child WikiProject pages to sub-pages of ikipedia:WikiProject Medicine.  This would be followed with the talk page banner integration with l|WPMED and changing the verbiage of the new child pages to reflect the status of a task force, rather than a separate WikiProject.  --ser:Scottalter|Scott Alter 23:52, 28 January 2008 (UTC)

Thanks for the reply so far people. Glad to know eventually everything will be sorted out with the clin med tags/userboxes etc. As for the task forces, I am surprised it got a response but I would more than be happy to support them being implemented into the main medicine wikiproject. Have a look at ikipedia:WikiProject Military history for the large number of task forces implemented (far more organized than having 40 diferent sub history wikiprojects), and look here ikipedia:WikiProject Military history/Assessment for how the implementation of task forces is organized to give individual ratings of particular sub-groups (wow the history wikiproject should be featured status :P ). Anyway I have no objections for merging all the projects that you have suggested, I just don't know how active/inactive the projects are apart from pre-clinical (not very active I think) and anatomy (I got a assessment tag set-up but I didn't get around to tagging all the anatomy articles with the tag... No one else seemed to have gotten to doing it either :(, )... However having said that, a wikiprojects talk page and main page is not an indicator of how active the wikiproject is I think? (I.e. people might be working on the 'anatomy' articles by wikifying them, improving them etc with out actually needing to discuss the progress on the talk page... So dunno, I guess more opinions are needed :).

Oh and here is an example of how the 'task forces' are indicared in the assessment tags for the history wikiproject (alk:Battle of Omdurman), just to give you an idea of how the task forces will appear on the assessment tag. Furthermore here is the actual page of a particular task force (ikipedia:WikiProject Military history/African military history task force). So in reality it seemes to just make the whole thing more organized instead of having seperate amounts of wikiprojects. Cheers.ser:Calaka|Calaka (ser talk:Calaka|talk) 03:11, 29 January 2008 (UTC)

CLINMED has for all intents and purposes been absorbed into WPMED. Whatever content remains can be merged here, with redirects to WPMED subpages. I'm not sure if CLINMED should be a taskforce of WPMED, but I can see the logic of groups of editors with a specialist interest becoming members of specific taskforces. We have several small WikiProjects (P:GASTRO, inactive, and P:RENAL, occasionally active) that actually come close to being taskforces of WPMED (or subprojects). There's no one perfect answer here. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 07:13, 29 January 2008 (UTC)
Yeah, perhaps for now maybe it can be left as it is, and in the future if it is demanded by a number of people, then taskforces or whatever can be implemented. The only reason I would think of suggesting those seperate wikiprojects as task forces is that this might give more opportunity for them to be noticed (as I assume this wikiproject would be the most viewed) in comparison to the leser known specialised ones... But then again I guess that wont guarantee increased activity just because they are subgrouped into this main wikiproject instead of being on their own..Hmmm your right JFW, no real correct way of thinking it. Oh well, whatever the case be, I will be for it. Thanks ser:Calaka|Calaka (ser talk:Calaka|talk) 14:07, 29 January 2008 (UTC)

Since CLINMED has been completely absorbed into WPMED, then it should be okay to remove l|CMedWikiProject from talk pages (and replace it with l|WPMED, if not already there).  If there are no objections, I will begin this soon.  --ser:Scottalter|Scott Alter 19:43, 2 February 2008 (UTC)

 WikiProject Preclinical Medicine 
Regarding ikipedia:WikiProject Preclinical Medicine, does anyone here NOT want to merge with them?  That project seems to have been inactive for almost a year now.  As the parent of Preclinical medicine, WPMED should have the responsibility to absorb it if it is inactive and there is no opposition.
Most of their intended scope, stated at ikipedia:WikiProject Preclinical Medicine#Scope, is already covered by other projects:

There are currently 9 articles tagged with their template (l|WPPCM) and an additional 6 articles tagged with their expansion template (l|Medexp).  The scope of the current preclinical medicine project is so narrow that it probably would not even warrant a task force here.  Is there any opposition for a merger?  If not, we can begin discussion at ikipedia talk:WikiProject Preclinical Medicine and see if there is any response.  --ser:Scottalter|Scott Alter 23:49, 2 February 2008 (UTC)

 Mnemonics 

For a little while now I have been removing mnemonics from articles when they are not of the cute pancreatitis|GET SMASHED calibre. I'm sure every medical school has another rude mnemonic for the cranial nerves, and I would be hesitant to accord these any degree of encyclopedicity. Does anyone disagree on this? I'm asking because of [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Whipple%27s_disease&amp;curid=544943&amp;diff=189031849&amp;oldid=188752842 this] edit to hipple's disease. I am not saying that all mnemonics are outlawed, but I would limit this to mnemonics with such a large support base (e.g. GET SMASHED) that P:V|verifiability is the least of their problems. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 16:06, 4 February 2008 (UTC)
I can't see any encyclopaedic purpose. Even the GET SMASHED example is poor. There are no sources for that section and you have to read to the bottom to find out that alcohol and gallstones are the most significant causes in the west. The inventor of such a mnemonics will at times have to pick a less obvious word, to make it fit, or to select a less common cause/sign rather than a more common one simply because the letter isn't available. I'd much rather read some prose that contained the information X: 60%, Y: 30%, Z: 5%, others ... The geographical differences between west and east, or the differences between rich and poor countries is much more interesting to me than some lame mnemonic. The reader doesn't have to sit an oral exam afterwards :-) ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 17:02, 4 February 2008 (UTC)

I agree with Colin. ser:Axl|Axl (ser talk:Axl|talk) 17:09, 4 February 2008 (UTC)

I tend to agree, but I was considering exceptions to a complete ban on mnemonics. My reason for quoting GET SMASHED was because it can be found even in highly authoritative textbooks and very popular handbooks (such as Longmore's OHCM) - this is evidently not the case with most other mnemonics I've been removing.
I will update P:MEDMOS to specifically exclude mnemonics. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 17:37, 4 February 2008 (UTC)

Generally, I'm anti-mnemonic in medical articles.  However, in a few cases, it may be acceptable to include the mnemonic without actually labeling it:  an article &quot;just happens&quot; to list potential signs in the same order as a common crostic.  This might be an acceptable way of including the information for those who will recognize it, without giving it undue weight.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 20:59, 4 February 2008 (UTC)

Hi 90.192.192.131! I suspect JFW's PubMed search only found a fraction of the papers since there's little consistency in naming. This isn't one disorder, hence some authors use &quot;epilepsies&quot; when talking about the group of a dozen different diseases, and one probably wouldn't be diagnosed with PME as it isn't specific. Some authors (e.g., the International League Against Epilepsy) use the term &quot;Progressive myoclonus epilepsies&quot;. For information, some lay-accessible web pages include [http://www.epilepsy.com/epilepsy/epilepsy_promyoclonic Epilepsy.com: Progressive Myoclonic Epilepsies] and [http://www.webmd.com/epilepsy/progressive-myoclonus-epilepsy WebMD: Progressive Myoclonus Epilepsy]. Shorvon's book, &quot;The Treatment of Epilepsy&quot;, says PMEs &quot;account for approximately 1% of cases in referral centres, and are mostly due to inherited metabolic abnormalities.&quot; He goes on to list &quot;itochondrial disease|mitochondrial ncephalopathy|encephalopathies and ipid storage disorder|lipidoses as the most common causes.&quot; That 1% isn't of all epilepsies, but of the most difficult-to-treat epilepsies that get referred to the top hospitals and clinics. If you can get access to Engel's &quot;Epilepsy: A comprehensive textbook&quot;, there's a chapter on it. That book is so big and expensive, I suspect only a university medical library would have it. ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 23:41, 24 January 2008 (UTC)

 Suicidality and Antiepileptic Drugs 

A recent [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Phenytoin&amp;diff=188392104&amp;oldid=185934468 edit] to henytoin inserted news from the FDA of an increased risk of  suicidal thoughts and behaviours in patients taking antiepileptic drugs. The source was [http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080201/ap_on_he_me/epilepsy_drugs yahoo news], but better sources are the [http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2008/NEW01786.html FDA news] and [http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/InfoSheets/HCP/antiepilepticsHCP.htm FDA Information for Healthcare Professionals]. I initially removed this insert since (a) the editor had added it only to phenytoin and (b) the FDA report didn't look at any studies involving phenytoin. The news has been reinserted with a clarification that the FDA expect all antiepileptics to have the same problem. A news item on [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/news/fullstory_60666.html MedlinePlus] has feedback from two experts, one of whom expected it and the other who questioned it.

Now, I'm sure the FDA know what they are doing, but I'd love to know (and read) the research. From a quick search, I've been unable to find the published study behind this. I'm puzzled about the existence of a set of patients with epilepsy who are taking only placebo pills. This generally isn't done as it is unethical. Most drugs are studied as add-ons initially, and later in comparison with a known antiepileptic drug. I'm aware these drugs are also tested on healthy volunteers, but the report specifically mentions patients with epilepsy. So I'm curious about how they reached this conclusion. Any help in this matter would be appreciated.

Assuming this adverse effect is notable, should it be added to all our anticonvulsant drug articles, and how? ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 14:02, 6 February 2008 (UTC)

I found that, but it is just one guy from Moscow. The US FDA study looks like a meta-analysis and would probably require loads of authors. The [http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/InfoSheets/HCP/antiepilepticsHCP.htm FDA Information for Healthcare Professionals] contains the most info. They group the studies by &quot;Trial Indication&quot; and say &quot;the relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher for patients with epilepsy compared to those patients with psychiatric or other disorders&quot; (relative risk being defined &quot;Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients&quot;). I'm puzzled. Sure there are studies that involve placebo pills, but they are taken on-top of existing medication, so nobody in these studies, with epilepsy, is off drugs. Sorry, guys, if this is a bit off-topic, but I'm hoping some Wikidoc has access to the journal that contains this study.

There is almost certainly no published study. The FDA requested this data from the drug manufacturers, who were responsible for going back to their trial databases and assessing the number of suicides (&quot;The individual sponsors of the drugs were responsible for identifying suicidal behavior and suicidal ideation events in their databases based on the instructions provided by FDA.&quot;) In other words, this is unpublished data requested by the FDA for regulatory purposes. Only a portion of data collected by drug companies and submitted to the FDA makes it into publication - see the recent NEJM article for a related example (MID|18199864). There may (probably will) be a publication at some point in the future, but at this point it's raw data belonging to the drug companies, who are likely not in a huge hurry to rush it to publication. The absolute risk suggests that for every 1,000 patients treated with AED's, 2 will experience suicidal ideation as a result of the AED treatment. In terms of completed suicides, there were 4 among 27,863 treated patients. ser:MastCell|MastCell ser Talk:MastCell|Talk 23:21, 6 February 2008 (UTC)

Asthma is a chronic condition, not something that comes and goes. Postviral cough is a poorly explained phenomenon that is, as the page states, probably due to increased sensitivity of nerve endings in the bronchi. In constrast, asthma requires chronic airway inflammation and reversible bronchoconstriction, and patients typically report wheeze as well as cough. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 12:26, 10 February 2008 (UTC)

A previous discussion took place at alk:List of eponymous diseases, which is a footnote of MEDMOS. Reading it again, I like ser:Espoo|Espoo's response to my post. There is no grammatical, politically correct, or logical reason to keep or drop the apostrophe; claiming so is merely spinning the facts to fit one's own preference. Many eponymous disease names are quite divided in their use of the apostrophe. I note that MEDMOS suggests an authority such as ICD to setting naming disputes, and ICD seem to prefer the apostrophe! Looking at ist of eponymous diseases, there is no current consensus on WP to use one form or another. If we, as MED project members, decided among ourselves that the apostrophe should go (say), we'd have to edit a lot of articles and links. I note that &quot;Graves disease&quot; sounds the same with or without the apostrophe, and &quot;grave disease&quot; is something else entirely!

If both forms are of merit and widespread usage, I suggest we go with WP practice for US/US disputes: first usage wins. There is no good reason to change raves disease to raves' disease so the change should not have occurred. I'm aware that it was only recently moved there from raves-Basedow disease. 

I'm essentially saying that MEDMOS shouldn't rule one way or the other, and that &quot;inconsequential naming choices, where both forms are in widespread use, such as the presence of &quot;'s&quot; in an eponymn, should be decided in a similar manner to UK/US naming disputes&quot;?  Thoughts?

 PMC 

I note that PubMed now clearly displays the PMCID code for articles that are available free in PubMed Central. I have corresponded with PMC about this, so perhaps this is the result of that exchange.

Alternatively, I can file a bug report to give PMCID the same &quot;magic&quot; as PMID does at the moment. The problem with the latter option is that people will neglect to cite the full article and instead just write PMCID 1234567.

luten sensitivity turned up on my list of articles to review today.  Something about this cluster of articles (see Template:Gluten sensitivity) doesn't smell quite right to me.  They may have some P:UNDUE issues:  a quick scan leaves you wondering whether every problem in the world is due to eating wheat.  My quack-o-meter tripped when I realized that most of these articles were basically written by a single dedicated editor, with remarkably few familiar names in the history.  

To be fair, the articles reference many reliable sources, and they may be just fine; I just don't feel qualified to judge the big picture here.  If anyone here has an interest in this subject, please consider this to be an invitation to provide some &quot;oversight&quot; to the articles.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 19:52, 25 February 2008 (UTC)

I have resisted hacking into those articles for some time. With the increased recognition of gluten sensitivity it has become fashionable to link every condition to it in some form or description. ser|Pdeitiker obviously knows a lot about the subject but has not been able to frame the content in an accessible way. I agree that enumerating single case reports is not helpful and definitely fails P:WEIGHT. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 22:55, 25 February 2008 (UTC)

 Dysphagia 

alk:Dysphagia could use attention from a wider audience. The issue is whether or not it is possible for a patient to have dysphagia without being aware of it. --ser:Arcadian|Arcadian (ser talk:Arcadian|talk) 04:05, 26 February 2008 (UTC)

Arcadian beat me to the request.  The dysphagia article is quoting a number of medical dictionaries that say dysphagia means &quot;Difficult Swallowing&quot; without saying that it is a symptom.  Gastroenterology and Medical textbooks say that Dysphagia is a symptom.  It has been proposed that wikipedia needs to reflect the diversity of opinion on usage of the term. Alternatively, wikipedia does not need to propagate an error.  Beyond the simple issue of definition, I am interested in reworking the Dysphagia article into an article on Swallowing Disorders, which the Dysphagia article has become, and to add an article on Symptoms of Esophageal Dysfunction (or something like that) where dysphagia, odynophagia, globus, phagophobia, cough, abnormal phonation, salivation, water brash, hiccoughs, heartburn, and other symptoms can be compared and contrasted.  With dysphagia being represented as disordered swallow instead of a symptom the future articles will be quite confused.
Thanks in advance for commenting.  Stephen Holland, M.D. ser:Kd4ttc|Kd4ttc (ser talk:Kd4ttc|talk) 04:35, 26 February 2008 (UTC)

In the UK, the term &quot;dysphagia&quot; is certainly used in situations where the patient has swallowing abnormalities without necessarily being aware of it. This scenario arises most commonly in acute stroke settings. This is not quite the &quot;dysphagia&quot; that I try to elicit when hunting for oesophageal carcinoma or achalasia. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 06:39, 26 February 2008 (UTC)

 Unilateral Intra Venous Therapy 

Follow up / Clarification to previous question posed... 

We would like to gather some thoughts on the use of placing two intravenous lines (IV) unilateral vs placing bilateral intravenous lines for the severely heamodynamically compromised patient.  Currently, in the pre-hospital setting, our training does not provide a clear yes &quot;do it&quot; or no &quot;don't do it&quot; answer. We have searched on the internet but failed to find any definitive or conclusive information.

The areas of discussion sourrounding the topic (Two IV lines on one arm) are as follows:

1. Should you elect to place two intra venous lines unilateral, do you start placing them distal to proximal as per usual, or do you place them from proximal to distal??, as the latter appears to be the sensible choice in this case scenario. Should you however place the 1st IV line distal, you have a chance of compromising the 1st distal IV line if you perform an unsuccessful veni-puncture at a site proximal to the 1st IV line.

2. Does it not make sense to have have the IV lines on one side of the patient as it allows for a less cluttered scene??  You will only need to watch out for one side, with regards to pulling out already successfully placed IV lines, by hooking them etc.  You would also only need one IV stand or holder..  Both the flow controls will be next to each other which will allow for easy management there of, and preventing trying to find the other one.

3. On how many occasions have you taken a patient the to emergency department and the staff complains as you have now left them without any veins to perform their veni-puntures for blood samples.  By performing 2 IV lines unilateral, you will leave the hospital staff an arm with intact veins.

4. Anything else???

 rostate cancer 

The FA article rostate cancer has had changes that leave it substandard for its rating. Specifically, a Diet section was added with writing that fails, at a minimum, the criteria of &quot;well-written&quot;, &quot;neutral&quot;, and &quot;consistently formatted inline citations&quot;. Besides wording issues in the new content, Diet does not use standard referencing, though it does have references listed at the end of the section, which may have balance concerns. I have made changes to patch up some of faults, but proper correction  here extends beyond modest copyediting.   -- ser:Michael Devore|Michael Devore (ser talk:Michael Devore|talk) 01:50, 2 March 2008 (UTC)

I don't understand the question. I didn't add Diet section to the article, but the section is broken and would currently fail the article of FA status if it were submitted in its current state. rostate cancer should be fixed or, failing that, the article needs to go to ikipedia:FAR|Featured article review. I hope it could be fixed through WikiProject Medicine (the project in scope, per alk:Prostate cancer) before taking that step. If the fix should be removal of the section entirely per reliable sources, then that is a decision which could be made by the project team.

 IDS 

Yikes.  Through the ikipedia:Featured article candidates/Rotavirus|Rotavirus FAC, the IDS article just came to my attention.  It passed P:FAC a long time ago, and really needs a P:FAR tuneup.  Lots of uncited text, MoS issues, external link farm, unformatted refs ... probably more.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 20:05, 9 March 2008 (UTC)

Thanks for the note.  I took IDS and IV off my watchlist over a month ago.  There are lots of anti-vandal editors, and endless debates with conspiracy theorists, but not much interest in improving the article.  I suspect that any such effort is going to require an enormous amount of &quot;political management.&quot;  I remember proposing that Wikipedia's main section on HIV transmission actually be in the HIV article, for example, and the article's usual editors thought that was inappropriate -- even though the virus, and not the immune collapse, is what's actually transmitted.  I think I gave up sometime after the long debate about whether women who had anal sex would recognize that they were having anal sex and therefore that the anal sex transmission risk applied to themselves (and not just gay men).  

Perhaps if we want to take this project on, there should be some advance planning over here, or it should be a MCOTW.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 21:11, 9 March 2008 (UTC)

I took an initial shot at the external links. It might help to propose article-specific criteria for external link inclusion, since there are billions of links on HIV/AIDS that satisy the fairly permissive requirements of P:EL. The duplication of material between IV and IDS is also an issue. I'm happy to work on any improvement drive for these articles. There was a temporary spike in IDS reappraisal|AIDS-denialist activity on-wiki a few weeks ago, but we're currently back down to a omeland Security Advisory System|Blue Alert Level, so maybe it's a good time to work on it. ser:MastCell|MastCell ser Talk:MastCell|Talk 04:31, 10 March 2008 (UTC)
My feelings about external links in featured articles are clearly displayed at utism, sperger syndrome and ourette syndrome :-)  If we need a bunch of external links, we're either becoming a support group, an advocacy article, a POV-pushing vehicle, or the text isn't comprehensive.  Everything worth saying should already be said in a featured article, and there should be little need for external content.  And, external content can be solved by just providing the DMOZ link, as in the articles listed above.  Sounds like I'd best not wade into AIDS, but it's really lacking in citations.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 04:35, 10 March 2008 (UTC)
the refs were correct at one time... unfortunately, many denialists and vandals keep messing up the page. Keeping external links off is also a combatitive issue, with 3RR coming into play to keep them down. Holistic medicine, anal sex fetishists and others also contribute to the disruption - with them disagreeing on terminology employed by the scientfic community. One user wanted to list every alternative herbal medicine used in treating AIDS and overextending that section far more than the section pertaining to ART! However, the article has 162 references, and no citation tags at the moment (I have gone back and retagged the references that had been removed). --ser:Grcampbell|Bob (ser talk:Grcampbell|talk) 21:06, 10 March 2008 (UTC)

 &quot;Cortef&quot; is a brand name. The generic name is ydrocortisone. ser:Axl|Axl (ser talk:Axl|talk) 10:13, 8 March 2008 (UTC)
Should it be a simple redirect?  Do we need an article that lists the inactive ingredients for this particular brand?  That's the only thing I saw that's likely to differ from the main drug page.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:25, 8 March 2008 (UTC)
 It should be a simple redirect. The inactive ingredients are irrelevant (i.e. not worthy of entry in an encyclopedia). ser:Axl|Axl (ser talk:Axl|talk) 13:56, 10 March 2008 (UTC)

* MF (therapy) might want a better name.  It sounds like it has more to do with the psychologist's office than with the chemotherapy infusion unit.
There are three related page names:
*CMF (therapy)
*MOPP (medicine)

Presumably we should standardize the titles.  Any preference?  Alternatively, we could declare them to be dicdefs and kill them all.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 04:53, 14 March 2008 (UTC)

You don't have to list new articles unless you need help with something.  Just placing the PMED|class=|importance= template on the article's talk page is enough.

 sychomotor epilepsy 

Can anyone suggest what should be done with this heading?

According to http://www.emedicine.com/NEURO/topic365.htm, &quot;Temporal Lobe Epilepsy&quot; (note that to see this text requires scrolling down the page),

TLE was first recognized in 1881 by John Hughlings Jackson, who described &quot;uncinate fits&quot; seizures arising from the uncal part of temporal lobe and the &quot;dreamy state.&quot; In the 1940s, Gibbs et al introduced the term &quot;psychomotor epilepsy.&quot; The international classification of epileptic seizures (1981) replaced the term psychomotor seizures with complex partial seizures. The ILAE classification of the epilepsies uses the term temporal lobe epilepsy and divides the etiologies into cryptogenic (presumed unidentified etiology), idiopathic (genetic), and symptomatic (cause known, eg, tumor).

Would it be correct to redirect sychomotor epilepsy to omplex partial seizure? If so, would the same also be true of sychomotor seizure, for example as used in the ohn Hughlings Jackson article? -- ser:The Anome|The Anome (ser talk:The Anome|talk) 16:23, 16 March 2008 (UTC)

Better to redirect sychomotor epilepsy to emporal lobe epilepsy and sychomotor seizure to omplex partial seizure.  I assume you are creating redirects in case someone searches for the term, rather than to use those terms in an article? The ohn Hughlings Jackson article has no reason to use the outdated term psychomotor seizure since, as your source points out, it was first used 30 years after his death. What a shame Jackson's article isn't in better shape. It reflects badly on Wikipedia when these medial heroes are neglected. ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 21:53, 16 March 2008 (UTC)

I think the Jackson article is not half bad. It just needs some sources. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 23:01, 16 March 2008 (UTC)
Yes, perhaps I sounded too negative. The lack of sources is what I picked up on. I'm thinking of all the charlatans who end up at AfD where folk spend hours fighting over whether a handful of published papers makes someone notable or not. If they'd spend those hours writing about the folk who shaped medicine.... *sigh* ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 23:45, 16 March 2008 (UTC)
 New page 

I think this page didn't exist until today, hallenge-dechallenge-rechallenge, which I believe is a medical protocol for small subject designs and idiosyncratic responses to medications.  Confirm/delete?  There seems to be support for it in medical literature, [http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=challenge-dechallenge-rechallenge&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=ws], but my familiarity stops at Talking back to prozac.  ser:WLU|WLU (ser talk:WLU|talk) 23:14, 12 March 2008 (UTC)

It has very little to do with Breggin and his antipsychiatry lot. It has to do with, like you said, drug allergy. In tuberculosis treatment, rechallenge after drug-induced hepatitis is used commonly. The stub should be rewritten with a useful source (i.e. not Breggin). ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 00:15, 13 March 2008 (UTC)
Yeah, Breggin was where I read about it about eight to ten years ago and I remember a vivid example from the book.  I'm ashamed.  ser:WLU|WLU (ser talk:WLU|talk) 00:30, 13 March 2008 (UTC)
The page has been re-written to a certain extent to expand beyond the Breggin reference.  However, it's still very much focussed on SSRIs, so if there's any extra info regards other uses of the protocol, feel free to expand or drop them on the talk page and I'll have a go at it.  ser:WLU|WLU (ser talk:WLU|talk) 19:56, 17 March 2008 (UTC)

 verdiagnosis 

Could someone with medical knowledge take a look at verdiagnosis? Today it was completely rewritten by, I believe, someone working in the field (but new to Wikipedia).

 PXE and COI problems 

Could I have a few more pairs of eyes on a series of articles related to seudoxanthoma elasticum? ser|Sfterry (who has the same name as a well-known advocate and researcher on the PXE scene) has created articles about XE International, a charity run by S.F. Terry, and atrick F. Terry (also created by SFT). Now along comes a user called ser|Kinuvian who creates an article haron F. Terry within an hour of Sfterry editing. I am assuming good faith here, but I have previously counselled this user on COI. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 10:00, 6 March 2008 (UTC) ‎

I started de-promotionalizing XE International from the bottom up.  I'd be happy to have someone else take on a section -- nothing like having half a dozen WP editors involved to keep people from thinking it's all just a personal vendetta by JFW instead of a normal application of the usual rules.  I haven't looked at the biographies yet.
I don't want to run off these authors (I wish every such person in the world checked our articles on &quot;their&quot; topic every single day) but I don't think that they have yet fully grasped the idea that Wikipedia is not an extension of their own website.  The organization is &quot;the only hope for many individuals who desperately fear blindness&quot;?  Definitely a line out of the marketing playbook.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:38, 6 March 2008 (UTC)

I completely agree that the Terry's prominent role in the PXE community is perfectly P:V|verifiable, and when I expanded the PXE article itself I was pleased that Sharon found no major problems in my writing. Hopefully my messages will set things straight, but I didn't want to be too heavy-handed without a second opinion from the project. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 20:16, 6 March 2008 (UTC)

Well perhaps there is sock-puppetry going on, but at this point does anyone here care to find out?  For newbies they are behaving extraordinarily well and should be encouraged and gently guided.  --ser:Una Smith|Una Smith (ser talk:Una Smith|talk) 03:46, 19 March 2008 (UTC)
I am sorry I didn't see this sooner.  Those two users got jumped on fast and quit without a fight.  That's selection in action, folks;  chase away cooperative spirits and all we're left is ... uhoh ... us.  --ser:Una Smith|Una Smith (ser talk:Una Smith|talk) 04:00, 19 March 2008 (UTC)

I tried to cooperate for quite a while with ser|Sfterry and she even agreed to upload some images of typical PXE disease manifestations under the GFDL. After I beefed up the PXE article with MEDMOS, citations and stuff Sharon gave her seal of approval. Most of the deletion discussions on the Terry's articles and the PXEI page happened while I wasn't looking and I'm sure, like you said, this could have been handled more gently. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 07:09, 19 March 2008 (UTC)
Yup.  A lot happens while others are not looking.  The trouble is, people who watch a lot of pages tend to become rather irritated and irritable.  Not conducive to warmth and gentleness. --ser:Una Smith|Una Smith (ser talk:Una Smith|talk) 07:31, 19 March 2008 (UTC)

That is exactly why I have stopped using a watchlist. But I'm not sure which user you are referring to with &quot;irritated and irritable&quot;... Nobody was particularly heavy-handed in this particular case. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 10:39, 19 March 2008 (UTC)
That's a very general observation.  Specific to this case, I think the editors who executed the speedy deletes were cranky.  I did not say heavy-handed. --ser:Una Smith|Una Smith (ser talk:Una Smith|talk) 13:52, 19 March 2008 (UTC)

 Appendices 

Apparently the order of appendices (&quot;See also&quot; and &quot;External links&quot; and so forth) was standardized last year.  Most of our longer articles were written before the order was settled.  ser:Betacommand has written a bot that can automatically conform the order (of just the appendices, not the rest of the articles) to what's listed in P:LAY:

* See also
* Notes (or Footnotes)
* References (or combined with Notes into Notes and references)
* Bibliography (or Books or Further reading)
* External links

Would we like to do this for the WPMED articles?  Personally, I'd much prefer that his bot did this for our 12,000+ articles, instead of doing it by hand.  If we can demonstrate a consensus for this, then it sounds like it will be easy enough to get this one-time bot use approved.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 19:19, 11 March 2008 (UTC)
No.  I don't want Betacommand anywhere near articles I work on.  It's not worth risking the errors and disruption just to get the layout right.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 19:20, 11 March 2008 (UTC)
So you don't mind it being done, or being done by a bot, but you think his programming may not be sufficiently robust?  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 19:38, 11 March 2008 (UTC)
 Lots of concerns about Betacommand.  Of course we should do it, and as far as I know all of our recent FAs comply.  I'm just not interested in turning Betacommad loose on articles, and I don't think the upside (compliance with P:GTL) is worth the potential downside of issues I've seen in the past with Betacommand.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 19:40, 11 March 2008 (UTC)
 I support the use of the bot for this purpose. --ser:Arcadian|Arcadian (ser talk:Arcadian|talk) 19:48, 11 March 2008 (UTC)
I agree the work should be done by a bot, no opinion on whether it should be Betacommand's or someone else's.  ser:delldot|delldot ser talk:delldot|talk 22:04, 11 March 2008 (UTC)
I'll feel a lot better about it if Betacommand allows Gimmetrow to examine the code, but if this goes forward and if past experience is a guide, we should be prepared for mistakes and civility issues. Don't say I didn't warn 'ya :-)) ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 22:09, 11 March 2008 (UTC)
I don't know anything about bot programming.  Is it difficult to restrict edits to a certain category, or to do a hundred pages and stop for the rest of the day, and then pick up where you left off the next day?  Something like that would give us time to discover problems.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 23:22, 11 March 2008 (UTC)
It almost certainly could be set up to work like that. We could also have the bot only update articles currently marked with a &quot;stub&quot; tag, until it had proven itself. --ser:Arcadian|Arcadian (ser talk:Arcadian|talk) 03:41, 12 March 2008 (UTC)
 That's a workable idea (but how many stubs have all those sections?)  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 03:43, 12 March 2008 (UTC)

Does anyone else want to express an opinion?  The current idea is to have a bot scan and correct article layout, probably in manageable chunks rather than all at once.  It'd be nice to hear from another half-dozen people, if you're out there.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 04:21, 14 March 2008 (UTC)
 I support (whether by using a bot or such) to organize all the articles so that there is consistency throughout in accordance with the above... I am sure a test of 100 articles can be done to see what bugs occur with the bot doing this and if so, the bot can be modified or maybe someone can go about making the fixes at whatever pages have errors... I am sure there won't be a problem on a majority of the articles. ser:Calaka|Calaka (ser talk:Calaka|talk) 04:45, 21 March 2008 (UTC)
