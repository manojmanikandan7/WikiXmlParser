Chart workshop

There's been some talk at  about making pie charts.  At this time, our options have some limitations, but here's a few options that may interest editors here:

;Single statistic with a simple bar graph:



This is a table that contains two templates, both of which were designed for some other purpose.  It would be better with a border around it, but  isn't working for me today.  (It seems to be a choice between floating right or drawing a border.)



It's not restricted to percentages—you can set it to any real number X out of real number Y—but it is restricted to a single statistic.  Also, the color can be changed to &quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, or any hex value.




As the bar is exactly 100 pixels wide, it's not a good choice for displaying numbers less than 1%.

This template may be useful for articles that you really, really, really want to put an image in, but can't find anything. 


;Beautiful graph—but only visible offwiki



 is a template that uses the Toolserver to produce gorgeous and complex charts.  You take your average data table, and  add an extra line that says:  |+   just before your first data/header column.

The main advantage is that you could paste this line into just about any existing data table, and it would work as soon as you save the page.  There are a bunch of different options beyond pie charts.  Also, the graphs it produces are totally beautiful.

The main disadvantage is that most readers probably won't click the link.  


;Poor man's chart

 is a simple block-oriented chart template.  It assumes that everything must add up to 100% in the end, and fills in any missing amounts with &quot;other&quot;.

Brick chart
|caption = Causes of death
|label1 = Cardiovascular diseases
|value1 = 29.3
|label2 = Infectious and parasitic diseases
|value2 = 23.0
|label3 = Cancer
|value3 = 12.5
|label4 = Respiratory disease
|value4 = 6.5
|label5 = Unintentional injuries
|value5 = 6.2
|label6 = Digestive diseases
|value6 = 3.5


You can label (and optionally choose colors for) each item, and the labels can be wikilinks to relevant articles.  

I'm not certain that it always works correctly:  as I type this, it's showing the blue &quot;cancer&quot; item as much smaller than the yellow &quot;respiratory&quot; item, and it should be the other way around.

If anyone is aware of any other options, please add them.   () 22:48, 5 December 2010 (UTC)

Google documents is a great program for doing this. You enter the data into a spread sheet and it has lots of options for chart creation. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:WikiRRM.jpg This] for example was created with google docs [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 23:39, 5 December 2010 (UTC)



Brick chart
|caption = Causes of death
|label1 = Cardiovascular diseases
|value1 = 29
|label2 = Infectious and parasitic diseases
|value2 = 23
|label3 = Cancer
|value3 = 13
|label4 = Respiratory disease
|value4 = 7
|label5 = Unintentional injuries
|value5 = 6
|label6 = Digestive diseases
|value6 = 4

 Nice work WAID, and very informative. The border works for me using style=&quot;float:right; border:1px solid darkgray;&quot;. The Brick chart wants integers for the |value parameters, so if you round them, it works. -- () 23:47, 5 December 2010 (UTC)


Google also has this thing called fusion tables [http://www.google.com/fusiontables/Home?pli=1] which I have been playing with to generate maps. Here is one on TB for example. You just fill the data into the spread sheet and hit visualize. It does the rest of the work for you. All you need to do is then hit print screen, copy the image in paint, crop it and upload it. If make the spread sheet open and link it when you upload it mistakes can be easily corrected by others.[[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 23:56, 5 December 2010 (UTC)


A new template has been created at . 
Also, there's general information at .  Perhaps that should be expanded to include some of this.  () 03:12, 9 December 2010 (UTC)


 In my opinion, this brick chart is an ugly eyesore. I am unconvinced that its use improves an article beyond that of a simple table. (A pie chart would be much better.) Can anyone show me an article where a brick chart has improved it? [[User:Axl|Axl]] ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 12:20, 18 December 2010 (UTC)

Hi. A request was added at the Proposed Merges project page to move &quot;Stereotaxis&quot; to &quot;Remote Magnetic Navigation&quot;.Move Stereotaxis to Remote Magnetic Navigation since that is is the actual topic of the article. (This requires deletion of a redirect at the intended target page). - It comes under WP:Requested moves really, but since it'd already been posted ...

Propose articles on suicide, mental health in Afghanistan

I'm doing a little work on [[:Category:Health in Afghanistan]], and would like to propose creating Suicide in Afghanistan and Mental health in Afghanistan.  On the first issue, there was a flood of coverage in mid-2010 of female self-immolation, but I'm not seeing much coverage other than that exact topic.  Plus it's hard to screen out everything related to suicide bombing/attacks (outside the scope of my intended article).  Further, there have been some studies by various governments on Afghan mental health after 30yrs of war, and I think it could be an extremely fertile topic, and arguably something that a few editors could push up to GA status relatively quickly.  Thoughts?  Links to recommended resources? Copied from my post at WikiProject Afghanistan.  () 20:10, 21 January 2011 (UTC)

Year 10 English (as used in Australia)

I'm not a doctor, dentist, surgeon or psy-anything.  I don't understand jargon, and don't have the time to go back to Uni to get the relevant (6-year++++) doctorates.  For example, the article on Melanoma is almost useless to anybody not a med student or qualified doctor: so it has no place in a popular encyclopedia like Wikipedia.

Please can all of the articles in this Project be shadowed by a true encyclopedic treatment aimed at lay people: write them in &quot;Year 10 English&quot;, which is considered in Australia to be the minimum acceptable standard of language for High School graduates.  This standard ensures that 90+% of Australians will understand 90+% of everything they read or listen to, without recourse to esoteric lexicons.

(School) &quot;Year 10&quot; in Australia equates broadly to 16 or 17 years of age.  () 08:06, 21 January 2011 (UTC)

There are over 20.000 medical articles that we know, we are volunteers and actually quite few.

You are more than welcome to improve any articles you find hard to understand or make proposals in its talk page. Bests.-- () 08:57, 21 January 2011 (UTC)

We usually aim for the level of a beginning university student rather than year 10.  
Can you tell me what you think the worst part about that article is?  Is there any part that you think is basically understandable and would make a good model?  For example, I thought that the first couple of paragraphs were easily understandable.  Do you think so?   () 16:11, 21 January 2011 (UTC)

In Australia, students would start Uni after graduating Year 12.  Of course, this gives them very little chance to acquire tech-jargon.

The &quot;basically understandable&quot; parts of the Melanoma article are the intro and the subsections &quot;In lay terms&quot; and &quot;Natural History&quot; in the section &quot;Cause&quot;.  The subsection &quot;Genetics&quot; presupposes some technical knowledge appropriate to a first or second year med student, but not really within the reach of a factory hand.

This may give some idea of where I'm coming from:
From [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/national-english-curriculum-what-all-children-will-learn/story-e6frgcjx-1225834607940 The Australian] February 27, 2010:

National English curriculum: what all children will learn

Year nine: Students look at the relationship between texts and the influence of cultural
 perspectives; that language can be multi-layered, allowing varying interpretations. They use a
 variety of clause types to improve their writing, and techniques such as parallel structures 
(&quot;I came, I saw, I conquered&quot;). Students explore the human condition, respond to the big questions
 of life and consider their presentation in literary texts. They identify and explain the choices
 made by authors to achieve a particular purpose, evaluate texts, and experiment with different
 media to create a short visual text accompanied by sound effects.

Year ten: Students look at the history of the English language and how it has evolved. They learn
 to cite works, recognise nuance and indirect opinions and how language is used to distance or
 involve an audience to create apathy or empathy. Their study of literature looks at cultural bias
 in the way an author presents a character, they learn language devices such as rhetorical
 questions, oxymorons, metonymy and satire, and examine the idea of a literary canon.  () 01:35, 23 January 2011 (UTC)

You're right:  Most of Melanoma#Genetics is apparently written for people who already know what it says.  There are a couple of sentences that anyone can understand, but the first paragraph in particular is a problem.  
Additionally, half the sources used in that section are at least ten years old, and so it may be outdated, too.
I don't know much about melanoma, but what would you think of starting off that section with something like:In some cases, melanoma runs in families.  Several different genes have been identified as increasing the risk of developing melanoma.  Some rare genes have a relatively high risk of causing melanoma; some more common genes, such as a gene called MC1R that causes red hair, have a relatively low risk.  Genetic testing can be used to determine whether a person has one of the currently known mutations.
(That's more or less a translation of the first few paragraphs into English.)  Then we can go into the frame shifting and two-gene models and gene names for the people who are either really interested or experts.  What do you think?   () 16:49, 23 January 2011 (UTC)

I think I'm in love...  I like it.  I'll insert that now, with a leetle bit of rearrangement, and at the same time revert a less-than-useful edit to the &quot;In lay terms&quot; subsection.  I must reiterate, I have no medical training at all.  I do have experience in writing manuals though.
We need to be careful here, as there seem to be sundry &quot;helpful trolls&quot; lurking.   () 01:54, 24 January 2011 (UTC)

Cause of melanoma
Anybody know offhand whether melanoma is &quot;always&quot; caused by UV radiation, as someone asserts at  (even for melanoma that starts in some non-skin tissue)?   () 05:01, 25 January 2011 (UTC)
There is no question that UV exposure is a major risk factor for melanoma. However, it is incorrect to say that UV radiation is always implicated in melanoma causation (as an aside, any medical assertion featuring the word always should be presumed false). Specifically, in non-white populations there appears to be little or no link between UV exposure and melanoma incidence (). The question was addressed directly in  (&quot;How much melanoma is caused by sun exposure?&quot;), which estimated that approximately 65% of melanomas worldwide (in 1993) were sunlight-related (noting that this was probably an underestimate).It is well-known that melanomas can arise anywhere you find melanocytes, including areas with little or no sun exposure such as the oral cavity, anorectal tract, the female genitourinary system, and the urinary tract (e.g. , , summarized in  and ). Very rarely, tissues such as the penis and small intestine can also host melanomas (, ). It should be clear from these sites of involvement that not all melanomas are UV-induced, since these areas have little or no UV exposure. Hope that's helpful.   19:06, 25 January 2011 (UTC)
Ummm... The &quot;someone&quot; is probably me.  Having said that, I thank both of you for your efforts.  Can we move/continue this on the Melanoma Talk page please?  I'll outline my evidence chain there.  I would be very interested to see anything proposing an alternate cause of melanoma: both inside and outside Wikipedia there is no credible suggestion that anything other than UV(-B) causes it.

Another look

Several months ago, I asked  that that there was such a thing as short course immune induction therapy. The general conclusion was basically &quot;no one uses this phrase except for one company; this looks like some attempt at spamming&quot;.

Now it's back (same creator as the first time), and it seems to have more references. But I'm absolutely not someone who can judge those references. Opinions?  () 15:30, 24 January 2011 (UTC)

It's probably okay, but I'd personally be happier if the topic were broadened to encompass all of Acquired immune tolerance (see Immune tolerance#Acquired_tolerance) rather than a subsection of acquired immune tolerance.  
Some of the claims need attention.  For example, he brands OKT3 as &quot;the most promising therapy&quot; (in its class), which makes me wonder how it compares to OKT4 (also known for inducing T cell immunity).   () 05:11, 25 January 2011 (UTC)

Psychological/medical sources are usually used to identify serial killers, with the occasional exception of law enforcement. Generally, news sources are not the best sources to use for a topic such as this, per . Yet, the section in question uses news sources and writers. The first source [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Serial_killer&amp;diff=417348425&amp;oldid=417336633 in the section] already inaccurately describes two people as serial killers. The editor who added the section, however, feels that the section should stay because it is &quot;verifiable.&quot; The question is...whether or not this editor's sources should be considered good enough simply because they are &quot;verifiable.&quot; 

Opinions are definitely needed on this matter.  () 02:10, 6 March 2011 (UTC)

In the discussion of valves at the end of this article, the writer states that the valve in the right atrium is the &quot;tricuspid valve&quot; which is correct.
The author then states that the right ventricle valve is the &quot;aortic valve&quot;, this is wrong. He or she then lists the &quot;aortic valve&quot; as being in the left ventricle, which is correct.

A glimpse into &quot;alternative&quot; anatomy

Our physicians here will appreciate this. Take a look at page 2 of [http://www.korenpublications.com/images/products/00000207.pdf this chart] and check out the unique neuroanatomy, especially the neck. You didn't learn all this in med school because it was made up in the 1800s by a man who only had eight years of education, was a grocer and school teacher, and who got his ideas in a spiritualistic seance from a dead doctor.... Also check out why they believe that manipulating a spinal joint segment can treat or cure specific diseases caused by &quot;subluxation effects&quot;.

For example, according to the chart, by cracking the neck they claim to be able to treat or cure deafness and blindness. Another example is their belief that by cracking the coccyx they can treat hemorrhoids, anal itching, migraines, infertility, brain pressure and mental symptoms. By cracking T9 they can treat allergies and hives. By popping T4 they can treat gallbladder problems, jaundice and shingles. By cracking T7 they can treat diabetes, ulcers, and blood disorders.

This chart shows why they think this way. Then consider this is the largest producer of their teaching aids. These are the most used charts in the profession, and this is happening now, in 2011.

Have fun and report back with your results. You may feel like you've been down the rabbit hole with Alice after the experience.  If you think this isn't relevant here, think again. It will help you to understand the minds of some of our editors and that's valuable when dealing with them and their articles, because they may be editing with this mindset and when they use common anatomical terms, they may mean something different than you or I mean. They have their own special version of anatomy, pathology and treatment. By understanding this, communication can be improved and misunderstandings avoided, thus avoiding editorial conflicts. --  () 03:40, 10 March 2011 (UTC)

Question on Lipoblastoma Disambig Page

I'm trying to develop some more breadth of experience, so I've been looking around for various ways to contribute and fill some needs here and there. I saw a page suggesting I could help by checking/rating Unassessed Medical Articles ([[:Category:Unassessed medicine articles]]). In doing so, I saw that Lipoblastoma needed a rating, so I went to check it out.

I discovered that the &quot;article&quot; is currently nothing more than a Disambiguation page with links to (1) Benign lipoblastomatosis, and (2) Myxoid lipoblastoma. This is TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE :-O for the Worlds Greatest Encyclopedia, so I thought I'd just go ahead and create some sort of &quot;real&quot; article on it over the next few days.

Wikipedia Initiative from the American Psychological Society (APS)

Hi, folks.
APS is encouraging its members to help improve psychological pages on WP.

At , the following summary was provided by , and I thought it would be relevant here as well (especially for the neurosciences).
Starting in February, 2011, the [http://www.psychologicalscience.org/ APS website] will include a portal describing the initiative and recruiting volunteers. The plan is that APS members and students will volunteer on the portal and fill out a form to identify their areas of interest and expertise. The portal will then try to match volunteers with needed work on psychology articles, using the  task recommender. It will suggest assessment tasks to APS members who have PhDs in psychology, using the new article feedback tool that the Wikipedia Foundation has developed for this purpose. The recommender will ask graduate students and others to work on particular psychology articles that are important (i.e., have high numbers of page views) and that the  has assessed as C grade or below. These are important psychology articles that aren't good enough yet. The initiative will also host a forum or talk page where APS Wikipedia Initiative volunteers can communicate with each other and members of the Wikipedia community. Finally, the initiative will evaluate the value of different techniques to get psychologists involved in Wikipedia, using both surveys of the volunteers and experiments involving different technqiues.
I would be delighted to see more psychologists becoming involved.  The sexology pages, where I typically edit, are sorely in need of them...try to  you run into!

Input needed at Sexual Compulsives Anonymous

There is a discussion between me and  about the lede sentence for describing that organization (as well as Sex Addicts Anonymous).  The original lede, which Scarpy supports, is:
Sexual Compulsives Anonymous (SCA) is a twelve-step program for recovery from sexual compulsion.[1]
citing the manual written and published by SCA.  I believe that that sentence fails , because the term &quot;sexual compulsion&quot; is widely debated/contested/challenged among experts, and having the above as a lede sentence makes the page assert that that diagnosis is an accepted one, which it is not.  I support this sentence instead:
Sexual Compulsives Anonymous (SCA) is a twelve-step program for people with hypersexuality who identify as sexual compulsives.[1][2]
The term &quot;hypersexuality&quot; is described by multiple sexologists as being 'theory-neutral'; it merely describes the behavior without implying anything about whether the people are compulsive versus addicted versus impulsive, etc.  Scarpy prefers that the lede use the term as used by the SCA members.  We would appreciate more opinions to help us decide what's best.  Cites for the above are on that article's talkpage.

Oy. I've tried to tone down the melatonin section a bit, and added a much-needed tag. I will try to return to it, but I'm not sure I'll have the necessary time this weekend. It will take some work, because the section does contain some (mostly primary) sources, but they are carefully selected and arranged to promote melatonin as a radiation cure, rather than to give a balanced and judicious overview of the topic. In my experience, those sorts of problems are among the hardest to fix. I think we can convey the existing (limited, pre-clinical) evidence on melatonin as a potentially radioprotective agent, but the current text reads like a slick infomercial designed to capitalize on recent events in Japan in order to move merchandise.   16:23, 19 March 2011 (UTC)

I am not sure about how best to of if we should add these mind maps to Wikipedia. My concerns include
#the difficult of verification in that they do not contain references and are I guess at this point 
#this type of content is difficult to properly display as at thumb nail size it is barely visible
#they are difficult to alter and thus improve
#they contain a reference to the person who created it (we do not do this with images that should not here)

I think that they aren't useful or really encyclopedic.  (They're more textbook-y or study-guide-like.)  If I ran across one in an article, I would very likely remove it.   () 21:21, 12 March 2011 (UTC)

They are greatly adequate for wikiuniversity but highly unencyclopedic. Not adequate for wikipedia in my opinion. Forgot to sign:-- () 22:13, 12 March 2011 (UTC)

1. I find them helpful in keeping track of what is in the article. They can be verified using logic if the relations are stated in the article with RS. WikiProject Mathematics uses OR like this. WikiProject Plants just discussed editors drawing pictures for the plant terms articles. Lists and their organizational form are allowed under RS through summing primary sources only. Many encyclopedias have diagrams in them. 
2. Double click on them and they are big and useful to help organize the arricle in the mind.
Kai Lai Chung boasted in his first year doctoral student Probability text, that he managed to write it without a single diagram! Its not as easy to read as if it had a simple diagram. Although WP is not a university, many readers benefit by using it like one.  () 21:50, 12 March 2011 (UTC)

Looks too much like something you'd use to help study for a 2nd year med school exam. Not very encyclopedic in my opinion.  () 21:51, 12 March 2011 (UTC)

They are essentially original research, and should be deleted.  |  22:19, 12 March 2011 (UTC)
 I dont want to argue so much about the issue, as I am so busy, about editing them, it is possible since the original file can be uploaded, the author name can be removed, and references can be added, at last I propose at least adding them to a specialized section for them at the end of the article what do you think?? [[user:madhero88|MaenK.A.]][[user_talk:madhero88|Talk]] 22:48, 12 March 2011 (UTC)

Agree with removal of mind maps as  unless published in a  (with appropriate permissions, citations, etc).  --  () 13:08, 13 March 2011 (UTC)

The majority of readers will not find a lot of use for a mind map created by someone else. Weren't they more intended as a brainstorming/information retention tool anyway?  |  22:57, 12 March 2011 (UTC)
I agree they might be useful for Wiki Books or Wiki versity. [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 00:07, 13 March 2011 (UTC)

 The citation of all these mind maps is present, I created them using information from this [http://www.amazon.co.uk/Clinical-Dermatology-John-C-Hunter/dp/0632059168 book], so the info is cited, and I think that limiting their presence to a section for them wont bother uninterested people, and would benefit interested ones [[user:madhero88|MaenK.A.]][[user_talk:madhero88|Talk]] 17:33, 13 March 2011 (UTC)

I too am concerned they are OR. And if they aren't OR then they are probably breaking someone's copyright (i.e., the book contains mind maps or you have copied the organisation of sections/chapters in the book when creating the mind maps). Essentially, they are one person's thought processes on a subject, and as such highly individual. Another issue is that generally it isn't a good idea to include images on WP that can't be read unless clicked though -- this reduces the value of the page (if printed in a book, they are useless) and limits accessibility to people with vision problems. But more importantly, there's nothing medical about mind maps so if WP were to limit or encourage their use, this conversation should be happening in a wider forum.  ° 20:28, 13 March 2011 (UTC)

It is the reworking of material by the looks of it. While one can copyright the format one cannot copyright the underlying ideas. I agree though with Colin's others concerns.[[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 20:54, 13 March 2011 (UTC)

 This matter has been discussed before:  and . My main concern is the difficulty in editing the image. Colin also makes a good point about OR vs copyright status. [[User:Axl|Axl]] ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 09:58, 14 March 2011 (UTC)

*(1) Is there anyone who could make a mind map generating wiki template, so they could be edited by others? 
*(2) They are no more OR or Synth than the creation of a nest structure in the article outline, perhaps they are even logically equivalent, but visually they may be more easy for readers to process sometimes.  () 16:52, 15 March 2011 (UTC)

A more general discussion regarding mind maps used in nonmedical articles and whether or not they are OR is here[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:No_original_research#Table_of_Contents_structure.2C_Mind_maps].  () 14:18, 17 March 2011 (UTC)
 I Wanted to point that there is a [[:file:Jaundice-types.png|mind map]] showing types of jaundice at the jaundice article, why is it more acceptable than mine?? and by the way, here is a version of a map I created that can be counted like any other graphic used here, take a look [[:commons:file:Rosacea.png]], it is png, and it is sourced, what is the difference between it and this [[:commons:file:Nervous system diagram.png]]?? [[user:madhero88|MaenK.A.]][[user_talk:madhero88|Talk]] 09:28, 23 March 2011 (UTC)
The nervous system diagram is labelling real things. The mind maps are the product of some individual mind's thought processes. I don't find the jaundice mind map useful either, but  is not a valid reason to keep. ° 10:54, 23 March 2011 (UTC)

 This map is not a thought process, it is a summery that corresponds to the text. I used a source to create it, so it contain facts not ideas [[user:madhero88|MaenK.A.]][[user_talk:madhero88|Talk]] 11:19, 23 March 2011 (UTC)

 No answer on this ?? [[user:madhero88|MaenK.A.]][[user_talk:madhero88|Talk]] 18:55, 25 March 2011 (UTC)
 Please check this map , and check the description page, it is sourced, and I linked the original file so every1 can edit it :) [[user:madhero88|MaenK.A.]][[user_talk:madhero88|Talk]] 19:05, 25 March 2011 (UTC)



The jaundice example is not a mind map.  It's a simple diagram of how to categorize types of jaundice (divide into two groups by cause, then sub-divide those...).  
The mind maps just don't seem to be useful to readers.   () 19:43, 25 March 2011 (UTC)

 How do we decide if they are useful?? [[user:madhero88|MaenK.A.]][[user_talk:madhero88|Talk]] 17:56, 27 March 2011 (UTC)

I Solved the problem of editing the map entirely, the maps can be available in SVG format :), what do you think?? [[user:madhero88|MaenK.A.]][[user_talk:madhero88|Talk]] 23:22, 27 March 2011 (UTC)

 We decide if they are useful through &quot;&quot;. That's why James brought up the discussion here. [[User:Axl|Axl]] ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 09:11, 28 March 2011 (UTC)



 It may be obvious to you (Madhero88) how to edit SVG files. However I do not know how to do this; I am sure that many other editors will not know either. [[User:Axl|Axl]] ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 09:15, 28 March 2011 (UTC)

 This applies to all the images here, y is this different?? [[user:madhero88|MaenK.A.]][[user_talk:madhero88|Talk]] 13:53, 28 March 2011 (UTC)
I would consider mindmaps as a representation of text, since they are ostensibly developed from text found in reliable sources.  This requires a large amount of decision-making, including reduction of complex relationships to linear associations, dropping less-important associations, etc.  I suggest that this decision-making is, more or less, , because some of those decisions involving mapping concepts in a way that was not suggested in published sources.  Normally, when we edit text passages in WP, it is fairly easy for editors to collaboratively work toward a representation of reliable sources, sometimes by working through the text line-by-line, to ensure that we avoid synthesis.  In contrast, mindmaps are not amenable to this sort of editing.  Most images do not represent, at a granular level, concepts that span an entire article or set of articles, whereas this is what mindmaps tend to do.  The huge risk of synthesis inherent in making a mindmap is not balanced by ease of editing or support for embedded citation.  --  () 14:46, 28 March 2011 (UTC)

 I'm more concerned that there's just a lack of utility for the article, given that your average joe has no idea what a mind map is or even why it's there.  Given all of the other concerns, it doesn't seem like they're worth the effort, though including them as a link might be meaningful.  Seems more like Wikiversity material, and including an external link there might be a better way to address these.  If they were honestly useful to readers, I'd be much more willing to  for them, but they're really a tool for a  and don't really fit the objectives of an encyclopedia.   () 17:01, 28 March 2011 (UTC)

 We have essentially achieved consensus, and I think it is time to move on.  |  19:23, 28 March 2011 (UTC)
 Sure thank you all for your time and for this great discussion [[user:madhero88|MaenK.A.]][[user_talk:madhero88|Talk]] 00:13, 29 March 2011 (UTC)</segment>
