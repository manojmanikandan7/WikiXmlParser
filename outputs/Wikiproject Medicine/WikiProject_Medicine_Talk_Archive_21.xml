 Models of anatomy 

Hi, Are there any experts here on anatomical models? I am beginning to fix various articles in the omputer generated imagery neighborhood. There is a paragraph there about architectural images, and a paragraph or two about &quot;anatomically correct&quot; models would be nice. I can manage the computer simulation parts, but I am not sure how the technology is used in anatomy. Are anatomically correct models actually used for instruction in medical schools etc.? I guess they are, but conformation from someone in the field will be good. cientific Computing and Imaging Institute includes images of a torso rendered pretty nicely. Is it anatomically correct? I asked because models used in keletal animation are not anatomically correct, and it matters not. But the article irtual patient is waiting in the lounge of the ER room, waiting for medical help, with fellow patients isible Human Project and iving Human Project. Those are not on my immediate path, but it would be nice if someone would give them a facelift of some type. Eventually a good template for uniting these will be nice. And talking of facelifts, acial expression and omputer facial animation also need help. 

I used to have a copy of Gray's book on anatomy (not that I tread it much) but about 2-3 years ago, as I was cleaning things up I threw it away, because anything I needed was on the web. So the future of anatomy is online. Wikipedia articles should probably catchup to that. 

But first things first. Help on a paragraph or two on anatomy in omputer generated imagery will be appreciated. Cheers. ser:History2007|History2007 (ser talk:History2007|talk) 20:56, 8 December 2010 (UTC)

We are all waiting for Frank Netter's atlases to enter the public domain. I think we have another 20-30 years to wait if we are lucky. I hear that the recent medical students are using computers simulations rather than human cadavers to study gross anatomy in some places.. ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) 21:18, 9 December 2010 (UTC)

Well, Netter was a useful name. I did not know about him. Thanks. I will dig up more on that. But while I was waiting in the lounge, I did a few searches and if you look at omputer-generated_imagery#Anatomical_models now, I added a few paragraphs. It seems to me that there are two sperate issues here:

* Generic anatomically correct models. Here is where Netter will win. These can be used in education.
* Patient specific anatomical variations. He can not help there. E.g. the diversity of the shape, diameter and position of the coronary ostia still require patient specific CT scans that no generic model can anticipate. 

So it remains to be seen if an open source approach to plugging together anonymized patient specific models will yield results sooner than Ciba will open up. My guess is that when Cibe realizes that their material has no value they will release it, so time will tell. But if you have other keywords that can help in that section, they will be appreciated. Now let me give you an idea: if you MD-guys start an open source anonymized repository of patient specific models, then that will get things rolling. Is there some type of public database for that? Maybe Wikimedia? Who knows? It will cost nothing. Cheers. ser:History2007|History2007 (ser talk:History2007|talk) 21:37, 9 December 2010 (UTC)

Nearly all students still use Netter's thus the textbook market is good. He was an incredible artist who dedicated his life to this work. He has also done stuff on diseases such as one sees here [http://www.netterimages.com/image/crohn-disease.htm] and [http://www.netterimages.com/image/313.htm]. Here are the variations of coronary arteries you requested [http://www.netterimages.com/image/671.htm]. ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) 22:58, 9 December 2010 (UTC)

 E.g. please see [http://books.google.com/books?id=gMfSmyY-9c0C&amp;pg=PA526&amp;dq=Patient+Specific+Models+for+Minimally+Invasive+Aortic+Valve+Implantation&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Z2IBTaSnIoWU4Aau7NCvBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Patient%20Specific%20Models%20for%20Minimally%20Invasive%20Aortic%20Valve%20Implantation&amp;f=false diagram on page 528] and the discussion just before it. Although the opology and connectivity of the ostia may be similar, the uclidean space|metric structure is not. Years ago I had a 3D model of my heart done (I am fine thanks) and I saw it compared with others with far more problems. I would have let them download it to Wikimedia along with others. So I suggest that Wikimedia be used as a repository for many 3D models of anonymous patients who grant rights. I think 80% of patients will not object. That will then be a very useful resource for all students worldwide. And it will cost nothing. Jim Wales will fund it, without knowing, and it will be &quot;real models&quot;. And no permission is required, as long as the patients sign something. Any MD can start and it can just grow from there. ser:History2007|History2007 (ser talk:History2007|talk) 23:27, 9 December 2010 (UTC)

 Ok, if there are no legal barriers, then we just needs to solve the technical issues. I will take a look at what Wikimedia allows, and  post a few questions for various people. In general, an interactive 3d system would have been ideal, but will probably not work on Wikimedia as is. However, there are piles of animated 3D images floating around that woul dbe just rotating. Please give me a few days to ask questions, then we will see what the best way may be. But to have a 3D image, the input needs to have had 3D capabilities. I have seen hearts on 3D interactive systems, but the 3D software was specific to the workstation. However, a series of snapshots of the rotations can be captured and turned into an animated image. But again, I need to know what the Wikimedia policies are, and I have not looked into that yet. But I will ask. In the mean time, I touched up omputer-generated_imagery#Anatomical_models with Netter, and if see any errors, please correct them. Thanks. ser:History2007|History2007 (ser talk:History2007|talk) 13:47, 10 December 2010 (UTC)

 Yes, that DNA image is a IF file. That is of course one option, but a [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Village_pump#3D_images discussion has started here], and we should wait for more responses and ideas. I think there is interest on Wikimedia, but discussions should continue for more input. Further suggestions can be obtained, but let us wait a day or two for Wikimedia people. We should see what the long term direction of supported Wikimedia items may be and I do not know that yet. However, as of October 25 2010 [http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikitech-l/2010-October/050038.html suggestions were being sought]. I think we should see what the Wikimedia people say, then decide on a strategy. But overall, I have a feeling that if the right format is selected, in the long term these medical images will find their way into Wikimedia, and we should just do it right by conforming to their standards. However, I also think that this application can influence their standards, given that they are still not frozen, and this could be a very useful application. I see some a day when some hospital will donate many images once the project gets going. I will leave people some messages about that too. ser:History2007|History2007 (ser talk:History2007|talk) 18:26, 10 December 2010 (UTC)

I think our discussion on graphic formats for anatomy was just

So this means that we know where the &quot;medical student of the future&quot; will get info, because as the Google people throw money at these projects, the direction will be set, and it will be a case of on't fight the tape|follow the tape.

 Chart workshop 

There's been some talk at P:VPI about making pie charts.  At this time, our options have some limitations, but here's a few options that may interest editors here:

;Single statistic with a simple bar graph:

{| style=&quot;float: right;&quot; width=&quot;104px&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;  
|-
| omposition bar|70|100|hex=red
|-
| 70% of women with breast cancer have no known risk factors
|}

This is a table that contains two templates, both of which were designed for some other purpose.  It would be better with a border around it, but ode|style=&quot;border: 1px solid darkgray&quot; isn't working for me today.  (It seems to be a choice between floating right or drawing a border.)

{| style=&quot;float: right;&quot; width=&quot;104px&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;  
|-
| omposition bar|17|19|hex=blue
|-
| 17 out of 19 new parents need more sleep.
|}

It's not restricted to percentages—you can set it to any real number X out of real number Y—but it is restricted to a single statistic.  Also, the color can be changed to &quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, or any hex value.


{| style=&quot;float: right;&quot; width=&quot;104px&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot;  
|-
| omposition bar|150|10000|hex=green
|-
| 150 out of 10,000 people have this condition.
|}

As the bar is exactly 100 pixels wide, it's not a good choice for displaying numbers less than 1%.

This template may be useful for articles that you really, really, really want to put an image in, but can't find anything. 


;Beautiful graph—but only visible offwiki

{| class=&quot;wikitable sortable&quot; style=&quot;float: right;&quot;
|+ Today's Schedule
! Task !! Hours per Day
|-
|Work || 11
|-
|Eat|| 2
|-
|Sleep || 7
|}

l|Visualizer is a template that uses the Toolserver to produce gorgeous and complex charts.  You take your average data table, and  add an extra line that says:  |+ isualizer|  |chart=pie |link=View graph  just before your first data/header column.

The main advantage is that you could paste this line into just about any existing data table, and it would work as soon as you save the page.  There are a bunch of different options beyond pie charts.  Also, the graphs it produces are totally beautiful.

The main disadvantage is that most readers probably won't click the link.  


;Poor man's chart

l|Brick chart is a simple block-oriented chart template.  It assumes that everything must add up to 100% in the end, and fills in any missing amounts with &quot;other&quot;.

rick chart
|caption = Causes of death
|label1 = ardiovascular diseases
|value1 = 29.3
|label2 = nfectious and arasitic diseases
|value2 = 23.0
|label3 = ancer
|value3 = 12.5
|label4 = espiratory disease
|value4 = 6.5
|label5 = Unintentional injuries
|value5 = 6.2
|label6 = igestive diseases
|value6 = 3.5


You can label (and optionally choose colors for) each item, and the labels can be wikilinks to relevant articles.  

I'm not certain that it always works correctly:  as I type this, it's showing the blue &quot;cancer&quot; item as much smaller than the yellow &quot;respiratory&quot; item, and it should be the other way around.

If anyone is aware of any other options, please add them.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 22:48, 5 December 2010 (UTC)

 Nice work WAID, and very informative. The border works for me using style=&quot;float:right; border:1px solid darkgray;&quot;. The Brick chart wants integers for the |value parameters, so if you round them, it works. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 23:47, 5 December 2010 (UTC)

 Tighter requirements per MEDASSESS 

Per P:MEDASSESS: In general, editors should rely upon high-quality evidence, such as ystematic reviews, rather than lower-quality evidence, such as case reports, or non-evidence, (e.g., conventional wisdom). 

Editors do need to show how the recenty added guidelines are equal to the other sources when there are a lot more higher quality sources presented. According to MEDASSESS, rely upon high-quality evidence, such as systematic reviews, rather than lower-quality evidence. 

* Review of guidelines. ite journal |journal= Ann Intern Med |year=2007 |volume=147 |issue=7 |pages=492–504 |title= Nonpharmacologic therapies for acute and chronic low back pain: a review of the evidence for an American Pain Society/American College of Physicians clinical practice guideline |author= Chou R, Huffman LH; American Pain Society; American College of Physicians |pmid=17909210 |url=http://annals.org/cgi/content/full/147/7/492

* The original guidelines. ite journal |journal= Ann Intern Med |date=  October 2, 2007 |volume=147 |issue=7 |pages=478–91 |title= Diagnosis and treatment of low back pain: a joint clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Pain Society |author= Chou R, Qaseem A, Snow V et al. |pmid=17909209 |url=http://annals.org/cgi/content/full/147/7/478 

There are two similar references being used in the low back pain section. There is a guideline and the review of the guidelines. A [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chiropractic&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=403224497&amp;oldid=403071230 guideline is a lower-quality reference] than the review of the guidelines. The low back pain section is too long and I think it can be shortened a bit. For now, I think it would be better to at least remove the recently added [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chiropractic&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=403224497&amp;oldid=403071230 guideline reccomendations] because it is a weaker source. There is P:WEIGHT| no extra room to use weaker sources when there is a currently two Cochrane reviews and a mix of recent state of the art systematic reviews summarised in low back pain. See alk:Chiropractic#A guideline is a lower quality source according to MEDASSESS. ser:QuackGuru|QuackGuru (ser talk:QuackGuru|talk) 21:31, 21 December 2010 (UTC)

 That principle seems pretty well established. The question should be whether or not the edit linked violates the principle. If I read the diff correctly, it is providing a citation of a more recent but less authoritative source. It is intrinsic to the incrementalist nature of science that recent works are built on old foundations. Just because someone published a top-quality work once, doesn't mean newer, lesser-quality sources should be excluded. ser:LeadSongDog|LeadSongDog ser talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl! 23:28, 21 December 2010 (UTC)

 Guidelines are good sources if they are evidence-based (e.g. most guidelines produced by NICE in the UK follow EBM methodology).

 &quot;The case reports confirm previous reports associating upper spinal manipulation with a range of complications. The most serious problems are vertebral artery dissection as a result of overstretching of the artery during rotational manipulation of the neck. Spinal manipulation was associated with risks such as vascular accidents and nonvascular complications in a number of case series. Case-control studies suggested a causal relationship between upper spinal manipulation and the adverse effect.&quot;

 Sorry to chime in late, but I was only now made aware of this discussion by QG. I am the editor who is disputing QGs proposed removal of the guidelines from the low back pain section at Chiropractic. I hope I am not being too bold in posting a comment in this discussion, as I am relatively new here and trying to learn the 'ropes'.
 The two sources to which QG refers are not at all the same. One is a systematic review carried out by the American Pain Society and the American College of Physicians, the second is a set of guidelines developed jointly by the American Pain Society and the American College of Physicians with regard to the &quot;Diagnosis and treatment of low back pain&quot;. 
 As per MEDASSESS:&quot;In general, editors should rely upon high-quality evidence&quot; As per WP:MEDRS: &quot;A secondary source in medicine summarizes one or more primary or secondary sources, usually to provide an overview of the current understanding of a medical topic, to make recommendations or to combine the results of several studies. Examples include the literature reviews and systematic reviews found in medical journals; specialist professional or academic books; and position statements or medical guidelines published by major health organizations.&quot; 
 The 2007 guidelines were jointly published by two highly reputable American medical bodies. Thus, according to MEDRS, both the review and the guidelines are a secondary source and among the highest type of evidence available. Further, As per WP:MEDASSESS: &quot;Look for reviews published in the last five years or so, preferably in the last two or three years.&quot;. Thus, these 2007 guidelines also fit this requirement. If the section needs to be made shorter, there are two 2006 reviews, which can be removed as they should be covered by the many more recent reviews in the section.
 These guidelines are especially valuable to the section as they put the results of the many reviews into context. Currently the section contains only reviews. The guidelines are the only source putting the results into context for a reader. It would be very unfortunate to lose them until a newer set of guidelines are released by an equally or more reputable medical body.ser:Puhlaa|Puhlaa (ser talk:Puhlaa|talk) 05:54, 22 December 2010 (UTC)

QG, Brangifer was referring to LBP and VAD, which you cited from the 2009 study.  He was not (I believe) commenting on the two 2007 LBP sources.  And just in case there's a question about ACP/APS guidelines, here's the details: &quot;The literature search for this guideline included studies from MEDLINE (1966 through November 2006), the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and EMBASE. The literature search included all English-language articles reporting on randomized, controlled trials of nonpregnant adults (age &gt;18 years) with low back pain (alone or with leg pain) of any duration that evaluated a target medication and reported at least 1 of the following outcomes: back-specific function, generic health status, pain, work disability, or patient satisfaction. The American College of Physicians (ACP) and the American Pain Society (APS) convened a multidisciplinary panel of experts to develop the key questions and scope used to guide the evidence report, review its results, and formulate recommendations. The background papers by Chou and colleagues (15, 16) provide details about the methods used for the systematic evidence review.&quot; In other words, in what way is this not systematic or high-quality per MEDRS? ser:Ocaasi|Ocaasi (ser talk:Ocaasi|talk) 08:42, 22 December 2010 (UTC)

 pinal stenosis 

Could someone who has access to full text of journal sources lend a hand at pinal stenosis?  I initially was only completing missing citation information (the citations are incomplete, do not include PMIDs or journal article titles, see alk:Spinal stenosis#Non-surgical intervention), but as I worked, I found extensive plagiarism and an extreme overreliance of very dated primary sources.  I've removed several instances of plagiarism and am working to convert the citations so they can be checked, but my concern is that if the entire article is plagiarized, my time will be misspent and the article should be blanked as a copyvio.  I don't have access to sources, but the ones I removed were direct copies of article abstracts; could someone who has journal access take a look at the citations at the top of the article that I have completed so far, and let me know if they contain plagiarism?  If not, I'll continue updating the citations; if so, the article should be blanked as a copyvio.  If it's not a copyvio, it nonetheless needs to be updated to include secondary reviews and minimize primary sources, but I can't determine that until I finish converting the citations ... for now, I just need to know if all of the sources, to which I don't have access, are plagiarized.   ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 06:59, 25 December 2010 (UTC)

 Categorization - help requested 

General question:
Is there a guideline with regard to categorization of medical articles?  
I looked at P:MEDMOS... and don't feel that really helped me a lot.

Specific situation:
I recently created horangioma... and then wondered about what would be the best category for it.  I think it would fit in a category called placenta, placental pathology, or (dependent on size) health issues in pregnancy.  There are a slew of placenta-related articles (lacenta previa, lacental abruption, lacental site trophoblastic tumour, horioamnionitis)... and I wonder whether a unifying category is in order. 

Full disclosure:
I put it into placenta twice and it has been reverted twice.

General answer:  There's no general answer.  DERM and PHARM have both done good things, if you're interested in finding models.

I started a discussion last year about expanding the categories section of medmos (at ikipedia talk:Manual of Style (medicine-related articles)/Archive6#Categorization guidelines), but it got sidetracked and never concluded.  Maybe I should just put it in to medmos and see what happens!  In general, I try to categorize disease articles by CD-10 code, which is by organ system.  A category named for a body part/system would only contain articles about anatomical parts of that organ/system, but it may contain a subcategory of disorders effecting that body part/system.  According to ICD-10, the articles you mentioned should be in &quot;(O30–O48) Maternal care related to the fetus and amniotic cavity and possible delivery problems&quot;, which is within Category:Pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium disorders (which is within Category:Diseases and disorders).

(outdent) Oxazepam has a slow onset of action, I have reverted and added a reference. It is mostly used as an anxiolytic or sometimes for alcohol or benzo withdrawal in individuals prone to accumulation of long-acting diazepam and chlordiazepoxide. It has never to my knowledge been marketed or licensed as a ypnotic, perhaps because of it's slower onset of action, but I suppose some doctors may choose to use it off-label for insomnia say in the elderly as it is a &quot;milder&quot; and lower potency benzo.--ser:Literaturegeek|Literaturegeek | ser_talk:Literaturegeek |T@1k? 17:45, 2 January 2011 (UTC)
There seemed to be a lot of research showing that Oxazepam is slow-acting compared to Diazepam but I don't know if that justifies slow in relative or absolute terms.  How fast does something have to be for it to qualify as &quot;fast&quot; or &quot;slow&quot;?  Also, is it going beyond our scope to describe specific indications like 'use drug x for staying asleep but not falling asleep' or is this ok as long as we're just describing common practice or guidelines? ser:Ocaasi|Ocaasi (ser talk:Ocaasi|talk) 08:49, 3 January 2011 (UTC)
It's okay, and even good, to describe typical uses.  Statements like &quot;X is used for Y, but not Z&quot; helps the reader place the drug in a proper context.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 20:08, 3 January 2011 (UTC)

* Same question with and-arm vibration syndrome as well. ---ser:My Core Competency is Competency|My Core Competency is Competency (ser talk:My Core Competency is Competency|talk) 20:05, 3 January 2011 (UTC)
 The second one is easy: an en dash: and–arm vibration syndrome as it stands for and. See P:ENDASH, &quot;1. Disjunction: To stand for and between independent elements&quot;
 The first is not so easy because it's an acronym, and I actually wouldn't expect a dash or hyphen from a lexical perspective. However, your second source uses a hyphen, so my suggestion is to do the same – although I suspect a case could be made for applying the rule I quoted above and using an en dash as it could be considered to stand for and. If you wanted an authoritative answer, the expert is ser:Tony1|Tony1, so you could drop him a line on his talk page.

There are clearly notable things in biochemistry and pharmacology that would probably be a pain to describe to the typical university student, as the typical university student probably doesn't understand organic chemistry. Can't think of any examples right now, but I imagine that there probably are some. ser:NuclearWarfare|NW (ser talk:NuclearWarfare|Talk) 03:49, 18 January 2011 (UTC)

I think there are many areas of medical science that are beyond most bright lay readers abilities to grasp without some serious study, and one could argue that they are encyclopaedic. I suspect, however, they are also probably at the limit of most general medical folks abilities too. Fortunately, most aspects of medicine do not require a planet-sized brain to understand. There doesn't appear to be a big audience here for such science-speciality stuff. In contrast, the maths folk write utterly impenetrable articles (you can't even read the lead sentence) but claim they have an audience for their articles and have consensus support for WP including a &quot;graduate-level maths encyclopaedia&quot; within its scope. ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 08:25, 18 January 2011 (UTC)

I agree. We have an inherent advantage, in that a large part of clinical medicine consists of explaining complex ideas to laypeople (i.e., patients). So there is actually a large, pre-existing body of effort and work on the question of how to clearly and simply communicate medical information, and we can draw on that for our articles. ser:MastCell|MastCell ser Talk:MastCell|Talk 19:31, 18 January 2011 (UTC)

Personally, I find yelodysplasia one of the more challenging concepts to translate into lay terms, because it requires some knowledge of normal and abnormal hematopoiesis.

Colin's response leads me to the reason I asked:  The folks at T:MATH have received yet another complaint about their impenetrable articles and have responded to it with their (sadly) characteristic bad grace (not all of them, of course, but enough to set the tone).  
One of them has begun ikipedia talk:WikiProject Mathematics/FAQ|a FAQ on why maths articles are so opaque, and in it asserts that their inability to explain things to non-experts &quot;is no different from other specialized fields such as law and medicine.&quot; 
While it's true that we have (hundreds, if not thousands) of articles that need to have jargon removed/explanations added/clarity improved, and while it is true that some concepts will require a bit of study, I don't think that there is a single subject within our remit that cannot be largely explained to a typical university student, at least for more than half the content.
Accordingly, I will eventually wander back to T:MATH and object to the inclusion of medicine as an OTHERCRAPEXISTS-type justification for their unwillingness to do the hard work of making at least one sentence in each math-related article accessible to people without graduate degrees in mathematics.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:52, 19 January 2011 (UTC)
I think they have a fundamentally different attitude, as exemplified [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AWikiProject_Mathematics&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=408581050&amp;oldid=408567259 here] (&quot;Wikipedia is used very frequently as a reference by practicing mathematicians. I value that much more than I value the ability of a random 8th grader to read xterior algebra.&quot;) They clearly prioritize the creation of a professional reference over that of a general-readership encyclopedia. And they seem to get away with it - I'm fairly certain we'd be tarred and feathered as &quot;SPOV-pushers&quot; or worse (if there is anything worse) if we suggested anything remotely similar for medical articles.

I would be interested to see this, too.  I have always assumed that such articles exist, because (for example) I don't understand articles like the above-linked yelodysplastic syndrome.

 Have a look at the simple English and German versions of the article, they both do a pretty good job explaining it, our version has quite a lot of room for improvement.

To me the RI article seems crystal clear.  Surely this is some effect of having a different background: When it talks about the frequency of photons emitted from a spin-aligned proton, I have a pretty good idea of what's going on.  Whereas myelosydplastic syndrome is still impenetrable to me; the Simple English version doesn't have nearly as much content, and the German version (as far as I am able to tell) has the same problems as the English one.
For example, the description of the WHO classification gives &quot;Refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia&quot; as a possible type of MDS.  The only word that I understand in that phrase is &quot;with&quot;.  If I scroll back up to the top of the article, I find a definition of dysplasia, but not of any of the other words.  I understand cyto- but not cytopenia or refractory cytopenia; I can guess at unilineage, but I don't know what unilineage dysplasia would mean.
What I suppose I'm really asking is: Do you expect someone without medical school, nursing school, biochemistry, or other similar training to be able to read this article?  What about someone who didn't have such training, but who was willing to look up the other terms (for instance, I looked up ytopenia and now know what it means)?  More generally, what do you think are reasonable prerequisites for your articles?  ser:Ozob|Ozob (ser talk:Ozob|talk) 12:05, 21 January 2011 (UTC)

Ozob, although the name is a technical description, I basically expect the normal people to treat &quot;Refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia&quot; as a roper noun that is as inherently meaningless as if it were called &quot;Foo bar with baz qux&quot; or &quot;Riemannian Penrose inequality&quot; or &quot;Celiac sprue&quot;.  That table (which doesn't really make me happy anyway, and I'm convinced we could do better) is basically just a hrase book for translating the older set of terms into the newer set of terms.  It's probably most useful to patients who are trying to figure out which article on Wikipedia is actually about their own diseases, or why different hematologists use different terms. 
BTW, people interested in mathematics should take a look at the amazing new lead for xterior algebra.  This is the first time I've ever been excited about a math-related article on Wikipedia.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:14, 21 January 2011 (UTC)

 Propose articles on suicide, mental health in Afghanistan 

I'm doing a little work on Category:Health in Afghanistan, and would like to propose creating uicide in Afghanistan and ental health in Afghanistan.  On the first issue, there was a flood of coverage in mid-2010 of female self-immolation, but I'm not seeing much coverage other than that exact topic.  Plus it's hard to screen out everything related to suicide bombing/attacks (outside the scope of my intended article).  Further, there have been some studies by various governments on Afghan mental health after 30yrs of war, and I think it could be an extremely fertile topic, and arguably something that a few editors could push up to GA status relatively quickly.

 Year 10 English (as used in Australia) 

I'm not a doctor, dentist, surgeon or psy-anything.  I don't understand jargon, and don't have the time to go back to Uni to get the relevant (6-year++++) doctorates.  For example, the article on elanoma is almost useless to anybody not a med student or qualified doctor: so it has no place in a popular encyclopedia like Wikipedia.

Please can all of the articles in this Project be shadowed by a true encyclopedic treatment aimed at lay people: write them in &quot;Year 10 English&quot;, which is considered in Australia to be the minimum acceptable standard of language for High School graduates.  This standard ensures that 90+% of Australians will understand 90+% of everything they read or listen to, without recourse to esoteric lexicons.

(School) &quot;Year 10&quot; in Australia equates broadly to 16 or 17 years of age. pecial:Contributions/122.200.166.53|122.200.166.53 (ser talk:122.200.166.53|talk) 08:06, 21 January 2011 (UTC)

In Australia, students would start Uni after graduating Year 12.  Of course, this gives them very little chance to acquire tech-jargon.

The &quot;basically understandable&quot; parts of the Melanoma article are the intro and the subsections &quot;In lay terms&quot; and &quot;Natural History&quot; in the section &quot;Cause&quot;.  The subsection &quot;Genetics&quot; presupposes some technical knowledge appropriate to a first or second year med student, but not really within the reach of a factory hand.

This may give some idea of where I'm coming from:
From [http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/national-english-curriculum-what-all-children-will-learn/story-e6frgcjx-1225834607940 The Australian] February 27, 2010:

National English curriculum: what all children will learn

Year nine: Students look at the relationship between texts and the influence of cultural
 perspectives; that language can be multi-layered, allowing varying interpretations. They use a
 variety of clause types to improve their writing, and techniques such as parallel structures 
(&quot;I came, I saw, I conquered&quot;). Students explore the human condition, respond to the big questions
 of life and consider their presentation in literary texts. They identify and explain the choices
 made by authors to achieve a particular purpose, evaluate texts, and experiment with different
 media to create a short visual text accompanied by sound effects.

Year ten: Students look at the history of the English language and how it has evolved. They learn
 to cite works, recognise nuance and indirect opinions and how language is used to distance or
 involve an audience to create apathy or empathy. Their study of literature looks at cultural bias
 in the way an author presents a character, they learn language devices such as rhetorical
 questions, oxymorons, metonymy and satire, and examine the idea of a literary canon. pecial:Contributions/122.200.166.101|122.200.166.101 (ser talk:122.200.166.101|talk) 01:35, 23 January 2011 (UTC)

You're right:  Most of elanoma#Genetics is apparently written for people who already know what it says.  There are a couple of sentences that anyone can understand, but the first paragraph in particular is a problem.  
Additionally, half the sources used in that section are at least ten years old, and so it may be outdated, too.
I don't know much about melanoma, but what would you think of starting off that section with something like:In some cases, melanoma runs in families.  Several different genes have been identified as increasing the risk of developing melanoma.  Some rare genes have a relatively high risk of causing melanoma; some more common genes, such as a gene called C1R that causes red hair, have a relatively low risk.  enetic testing can be used to determine whether a person has one of the currently known mutations.
(That's more or less a translation of the first few paragraphs into English.)  Then we can go into the frame shifting and two-gene models and gene names for the people who are either really interested or experts.  What do you think?  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:49, 23 January 2011 (UTC)

Cause of melanoma
Anybody know offhand whether melanoma is &quot;always&quot; caused by UV radiation, as someone asserts at alk:Melanoma (even for melanoma that starts in some non-skin tissue)?  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 05:01, 25 January 2011 (UTC)
There is no question that UV exposure is a major risk factor for melanoma. However, it is incorrect to say that UV radiation is always implicated in melanoma causation (as an aside, any medical assertion featuring the word always should be presumed false). Specifically, in non-white populations there appears to be little or no link between UV exposure and melanoma incidence (MID|15837865). The question was addressed directly in MID|8161879 (&quot;How much melanoma is caused by sun exposure?&quot;), which estimated that approximately 65% of melanomas worldwide (in 1993) were sunlight-related (noting that this was probably an underestimate).It is well-known that melanomas can arise anywhere you find melanocytes, including areas with little or no sun exposure such as the oral cavity, anorectal tract, the female genitourinary system, and the urinary tract (e.g. MID|2033125, MID|19071254, summarized in MID|9781962 and MID|9869521). Very rarely, tissues such as the penis and small intestine can also host melanomas (MID|17656225, MID|19410196). It should be clear from these sites of involvement that not all melanomas are UV-induced, since these areas have little or no UV exposure. Hope that's helpful. ser:MastCell|MastCell ser Talk:MastCell|Talk 19:06, 25 January 2011 (UTC)

The New York Times is running an article on it today[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/23/health/policy/23drug.html?], and there seems to have been talk about this earlier as well[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/40556447/ns/health-health_care/][http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6B66ZG20101207].

Given the current political climate, obtaining funding for a new Center seems a bit dicey, but I agree we should have an article. We should probably also note that the ational Center for Research Resources is going to be axed (or at least demoted from &quot;Center&quot; status at NIH) to make room, since the number of Centers is capped. ser:MastCell|MastCell ser Talk:MastCell|Talk 18:22, 24 January 2011 (UTC)

 Another look 

Several months ago, I asked ikipedia talk:WikiProject Medicine/Archive 20#Short Course Immune_Induction|if anyone here could verify that that there was such a thing as hort course immune induction therapy. The general conclusion was basically &quot;no one uses this phrase except for one company; this looks like some attempt at spamming&quot;.

Now it's back (same creator as the first time), and it seems to have more references. But I'm absolutely not someone who can judge those references. Opinions? ser:DragonflySixtyseven|DS (ser talk:DragonflySixtyseven|talk) 15:30, 24 January 2011 (UTC)

It's probably okay, but I'd personally be happier if the topic were broadened to encompass all of cquired immune tolerance (see mmune tolerance#Acquired_tolerance) rather than a subsection of acquired immune tolerance.  
Some of the claims need attention.  For example, he brands KT3 as &quot;the most promising therapy&quot; (in its class), which makes me wonder how it compares to KT4 (also known for inducing T cell immunity).  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 05:11, 25 January 2011 (UTC)

Are we allowed to &quot;move stuff here&quot;? See ikipedia:Plagiarism and ikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia. The &quot;Copying from other Wikimedia Projects&quot; section seems useful (even though that isn't a Wikimedia project, it has a similar licence I think). It is rather complex and I suspect it would be far better to look at what they've done and use it as a suggestion for how we might improve an article. Of course, moving images and other media is likely to be more straightforward as attribution can still be given easily. I must admit, any page I've looked at on their site was no better than a very old Wikipedia page.
They have a different focus (to provide health advice to either doctors or patients). I'd be very upset if this project saw professional readers as the target audience.

 This is the first time that I have looked at WikiDoc. They state &quot;[http://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Help:Get_Started_Here%21 WikiDoc ... is an online community where anyone can contribute to and edit the world's largest free living textbook of medicine.]&quot; As opposed to Wikipedia, which is a free online (general) encyclopedia. WikiDoc uses &quot;Editors-in-Chief&quot; to monitor articles. Wikipedia does not have a formal monitoring system. WikiDoc is not specifically for healthcare professionals, as far as I can tell. I don't see any advantage of it over Wikipedia's medical content. There are other medical wikis that are specifically for healthcare professionals, and I can see how some readers might prefer to read that over Wikipedia's content. However WikiDoc's role is no different to Wikipedia's role.

 The reasons I would rather edit Wikipedia than WikiDoc: Wikipedia's scope is so much greater. The number of contributors and readers is vast. The &quot;impact factor&quot; of Wikipedia's top/high importance articles exceeds that of journal articles and textbooks. And we have a friendly community of like-minded editors. :-) ser:Axl|Axl ¤ ser talk:Axl|[Talk] 10:09, 28 January 2011 (UTC)

 To answer Ocaasi's question: the ultimate goal for our articles is to make them &quot;Featured articles&quot;. Have a look at ikipedia:WikiProject_Medicine#Featured_articles|the list. Browse through a few and decide for yourself whether they are too technical. The editors of the articles know their readership and write accordingly. In addition, there are checks in the GAC and FAC processes.

 Heat intolerance 

I'm contemplating an article on eat intolerance, to coordinate with old intolerance.  My initial scan of sources has found them unfortunately fragmented.  There's heat intolerance from the perspective of multiple sclerosis, and heat intolerance as a sign of thyrotoxicosis, and heat intolerance due to anticholinergics, and heat intolerance due to various skin disorders causing impaired sweating, and heat intolerance apparently with some (unspecified, but serious, perhaps end-stage) cardiac problems—but never just heat intolerance, one big, organized, unified medical sign.

So for those of you who might know something (anything!) about this:  MS and thyroid disorders seem to do heat intolerance with a (slightly) raised core body temperature.  MS patients make a particular point of the difficulty that a 0.5–1.0 degree difference in body temperature makes to them, and a slightly elevated temperature seems plausible, even inevitable, with an overactive thyroid.  Do the other forms of heat intolerance also feature a raised body temperature?

If so, then the distinguishing feature from eat stroke appears to be the chronic nature of heat intolerance, and perhaps the lower ambient temperatures at which it appears.  (Some individuals have asserted the appearance of symptoms at lk:WikiProject_Medicine&amp;action=scal oom temperature.)

Also, I'd like to get a sentence in about medically necessary air conditioning (something that I heard about, of all places, in some income tax paperwork).  My search for sources has been unsuccessful:  I can demonstrate that the US offers a tax break for buying an air conditioner if you have duly procured a prescription for air conditioning from a physician to treat a specific medical condition, but no information at all about the circumstances under which a physician would prescribe air conditioning.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 05:54, 4 February 2011 (UTC)
 Moving &quot;x cell carcinoma&quot; to &quot;x-cell carcinoma&quot;

I ser_talk:Kwamikagami#Moving_.22x_cell_carcinoma.22_to_.22x-cell_carcinoma.22|have pointed out to him that the medical literature does not support his actions. I am bringing the discussion here to achieve a consensus. ser:Axl|Axl ¤ ser talk:Axl|[Talk] 10:49, 5 February 2011 (UTC)

Actually, the lit does support this. Punctuation varies widely, with hyphens tending to be dropped the more familiar a term is to the intended audience, but retained the less familiar it may be. We are a basic reference work, not a medical journal, and we cannot assume that our readers will be familiar with the technical jargon in our articles. One of the more common complaints of WP is that our articles are inaccessible, and logical/full hyphenation is a small step in addressing that. For example, a naive reader will read &quot;small cell carcinomas&quot; as being small carcinomas of the cells. (I can hardly help reading it that way myself, even though I know better; I still do a double take when I see it unexpectedly.) For this reason, medical references use hyphenation to a greater degree than journals do, both because exact terminology may be expected (you can always drop the hyphenation if you don't like it, but you may not be comfortable adding it in where missing), and because they're accessed by students who may be new to the material and may be confused by a lack of full, logical punctuation. 

For example, Current diagnosis and treatment in neurology (Brust 2006:396) has as a section header nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor–induced myopathy. Without proper hyphenation, that would be nearly impenetrable to the uninitiated; with hyphenation (and an en-dash), the reader at least can begin to parse it. 

This isn't really a P:COMMONNAME issue, since we're not talking about distinct names, but a choice of punctuation, and it is relevant to P:Make technical articles understandable. In fact, even at COMMONNAME they state, 
The ideal title for an article will also satisfy the other criteria outlined above; ambiguous or inaccurate names for the article subject, as determined by reliable sources, are often avoided even though they may be more frequently used by reliable sources.
&quot;Small cell carcinoma&quot; is grammatically inaccurate, since it indicates that small and cell modify carcinoma independently, where in fact small modifies cell rather than carcinoma. In spoken English the difference is conveyed through prosody; in writing, it is conveyed through hyphenation: small-cell carcinoma. — ser:Kwamikagami|kwami (ser talk:Kwamikagami|talk) 11:17, 5 February 2011 (UTC)
While I disagree strongly with some of Kwami's typographically related page moves, here, I have to agree with his action. It especially matters when people outside a highly specialised area read text that contains these compound units. Such readers are not used to seeing these items every day, and you can't expect them to know first-off exactly which words should be paired in them.As an aside, I see above &quot;nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor–induced myopathy&quot;. Oh puhlease, let's take no notice of the crappy English they let through in some research journals nowadays—even the highly ranked ones: myopathy induced by nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors, thanks very much. ser:Tony1|Tony ser talk:Tony1|(talk) 15:22, 5 February 2011 (UTC)

First, what really matters is what our sources are doing, not what the typical English grammar teacher might guess is the right answer in a given case.  In the case of small cell carcinoma, [http://www.progenetix.net/cgi-bin/pgSubsetindexLoader.cgi?subIDsearch=I80413 ICD-0] rejected the hyphen.  The [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/cgi/mesh/2011/MB_cgi?mode=&amp;index=17114&amp;field=all&amp;HM=&amp;II=&amp;PA=&amp;form=&amp;input= MeSH term] is &quot;carcinoma, small cell&quot;—no hyphen.  More than 80% of books in my search rejected the hyphen.  More than half of medical journals reject the hyphen.  Consequently, we, too, should reject the hyphen, regardless of what the &quot;right&quot; answer is.  
And the opposite is true for non-small-cell carcinoma:  There, nearly all of the sources use (two) hyphens.  We should follow those sources, too, for that disease. 
One thing to keep in mind is that something that looks like it's an adjective is not necessarily an adjective.  Many of these names are essentially proper nouns, and so typical conventions for common nouns and adjectives aren't relevant.  A erkel cell, for example, is a specific thing, and is not to be hyphenated when it is used to describe another thing—exactly like you would never hyphenate other two-word proper nouns, e.g., it's a ord Mustang car, not a Ford-Mustang car. 
Finally, massive changes in the face of opposition is inappropriate.  Editors should look for consensus at each individual article, rather than imposing their personal preferences (or the preferences of sources in a completely unrelated field, especially when those sources make no claim that the rule is, or even should be, universally applied to technical terms) by moving pages in the face of opposition. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:47, 5 February 2011 (UTC)

&quot;More than half of medical journals reject the hyphen. Consequently, we, too, should reject the hyphen.&quot; 
I disagree. With such variation in professional usage, it is clear that the hyphenated forms are not incorrect. They are, however, much easier for the naive reader. The arguments about proper nouns are also off the mark: that's not what we're dealing with here, or medical journals would not hyphenate at all. 
We need to consider our readers, not just editors who already know the subject matter. — ser:Kwamikagami|kwami (ser talk:Kwamikagami|talk) 02:00, 6 February 2011 (UTC)

And from Doc James's objection that 'they don't look good' on my talk page,
&quot;Looking good&quot; is not the point: a huge number of reliable sources use logical hyphenation, and this helps our readers. These terms are difficult to read without hyphenation unless you are already familiar with the subject, and we need to assume that our readers are not familiar with it. Even COMMONNAME states that when several names are in use by RSs, we need to consider clarity and precision, not just percentages.
— ser:Kwamikagami|kwami (ser talk:Kwamikagami|talk) 02:04, 6 February 2011 (UTC)

How about we just do what the clear majority of sources do, determined case by case?
&quot;Logical&quot; hyphenation will not help the average person, who (unlike me) finds nothing &quot;logical&quot; about it at all, and will instead find Wikipedia diverging from the choices made by a majority of sources.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 03:07, 6 February 2011 (UTC)

I think that basically all of these except NSCC need to be reverted.  Most are grammatically correct—several wrongly identify the noun, resulting in Ford-Mustang–like improper hyphenations—but they simply aren't used by the sources.  &quot;Spindle-cell squamous-cell carcinoma&quot;, for example, turns up in less than 2% of medical journal articles on the subject.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 03:20, 6 February 2011 (UTC)

Agree that we should revert these. We should be reflective of the scientific literature not trying to do our own thing. ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) 05:01, 6 February 2011 (UTC)

If I misidentified the noun (no example given), that illustrates that these are not clear as written. Some arguably make little difference, but IMO it is definitely important to hyphenate &quot;small-cell&quot; and &quot;large-cell&quot;: it's common that way in the lit, and it is very easy to misparse a small cell carcinoma as being analogous to a small lung tumour. It's only obvious what is meant if you are already familiar with the concept. 
If you insist on using ambiguous wording because most journals written for specialists take that route, I think the least we can do is provide both punctuations in the lede: A spindle cell squamous cell carcinoma, or spindle-cell squamous-cell carcinoma, is ... Once the reader has the correct syntax in their head, it won't matter which convention we use for the rest of the article. Is that an acceptable compromise? — ser:Kwamikagami|kwami (ser talk:Kwamikagami|talk) 06:35, 6 February 2011 (UTC)
Well yes. Please tell me there's not a certain specialist arrogance afoot here, that says &quot;FU&quot; to anyone but the experts. As I've pointed out above, people outside a field (and even those in cognate disciplines) are faced with greater difficult through unfamiliarity in parsing these gobbledygook multiple items. Just because ignorant (more likely &quot;put it in if it's good science, we haven't got time nowadays to make the language professional&quot;) journals let through horrors doesn't mean that WP should go against its own style guides, and more to the point, the rulings of so many authorities out there. Our readership is likely to be significantly wider than that for arcane, stuck-up high-impact-factor journals. If you want to go against the style guides here, you'll have to put a more cogent case than that. ser:Tony1|Tony ser talk:Tony1|(talk) 07:10, 6 February 2011 (UTC)
If you look at the history of the OED it attempts to reflect real world language usage not impose &quot;proper&quot; English from above.

Sure, and in cases like these they would indicate both. But they're recording usage rather than actually generating it as we are.

Yes, and let's remember that WP is not a dictionary. It is read on monitors and by people all over the world, of all varieties of English, and of many second-language backgrounds; it addresses a generalist audience more than medical specialty publications. ser:Tony1|Tony ser talk:Tony1|(talk) 08:42, 6 February 2011 (UTC)
Kwami, that's the point.  We are not &quot;generating usage&quot;.  We are supposed to be reflecting the usage of our sources, not P:OR|making it up ourselves.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 07:03, 7 February 2011 (UTC)
We're not making anything up. These forms are used in the lit, in the case of 'small-cell' by anywhere from a quarter to two thirds, depending on the database. We follow sources, sure, but we follow the sources that are the most accurate and will be clearest to our audience. We don't follow inaccurate or obscure jargon just because it's more common among those comfortable in the jargon. — ser:Kwamikagami|kwami (ser talk:Kwamikagami|talk) 12:14, 7 February 2011 (UTC)
kwami, selective use of statistics in an argument is poor show. The &quot;two thirds&quot; you mention is the result of getting lucky with your first page of Google results: the numbers drop off if you persist. And we agree that &quot;small-cell&quot; is an anomaly in the stats. For all the other carcinomas, there's effectively no support in the literature for the hyphenated form. Anyway, this disussion is now happening in two places, and arguably the MP:MED style guide is the better place for it... ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 12:38, 7 February 2011 (UTC)

For Kwami, who asked for a specific example above:  asal cell is not a cell that happens to be basal; it's a thing in its own right.  It should not be hyphenated any more than erkel cell.  
I'm going to revert all of the basal cell moves, as they are both grammatically wrong (due to a perfectly understandable misinterpretation of the name) and not used by ~98% of sources.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:47, 7 February 2011 (UTC)

I've commented out the ones that I moved back to their grammatically correct, consensus-supported, source-preferred names.  asal-cell carcinoma requires attention from an admin.
Perhaps someone else would like to look up the current usage for the others.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:55, 7 February 2011 (UTC)

WhatamIdoing, [basal cell] is a unit, not two separate attributives, so grammatically it should be hyphenated. That is not a misreading: it doesn't matter what the relationship is between 'basal' and 'cell', the point is that it's a compound attributive of 'carcinoma'. Without the hyphen, we're saying that it's the carcinoma which is basal, or else that a basal cell carcinoma is a suptype of 'cell carcinoma'. The same with Merkel: it's not a Merkel's [cell carcinoma], but a [Merkel cell] carcinoma. I overlooked that one. — ser:Kwamikagami|kwami (ser talk:Kwamikagami|talk) 20:48, 7 February 2011 (UTC)
I will not speak to what is grammatically correct, but i have rarely, if ever, seen basal or Merkel cell carcinoma hyphenated.  I could be wrong. but i would challenge you to find many articles in the JAAD or Archives of Dermatology that use this convention and, even if you can, I strongly doubt they would constitue the majority of cases.  I think we should be following the common name principle for article titles in these cases. ---ser:My Core Competency is Competency|My Core Competency is Competency (ser talk:My Core Competency is Competency|talk) 15:34, 8 February 2011 (UTC)

To give some background, most of the info in the &quot;comparison&quot; article was originally in the articles llopathic medicine and steopathic medicine in the United States, but the amount of information gathered overburdened both those articles. A third article comparing the two was created as something of a compromise.  There is a great deal of published material and commentary on the comparison topic.  I agree that the article is not the strongest article on WP, but with some TLC it could be much better.

 Pharma policy 

Do we have a guideline or policy regarding how pharma companies/employees should edit entries about specific pharma products? ser:NCurse|NCurse  ser talk:NCurse|work 09:20, 18 February 2011 (UTC)
Absolutely.  Our P:COI guideline directly addresses this, P:NPOV of course, and the P:NOSHARE policy is relevant.  Those link to others that are germane as well.  -- ser:Scray|Scray (ser talk:Scray|talk) 14:38, 18 February 2011 (UTC)

We haven't written anything more specific.  There was a conversation about this a while ago.  Here's what I remember from it:

Disclosure of COI is not required by any Wikipedia policy.  
* Some editors have voluntarily chosen to disclose a conflict of interest by including their employers' names in their account names, e.g., [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ASearch&amp;redirs=1&amp;search=user%3A+%2C+gsk&amp;fulltext=Search&amp;ns0=1 all these folks from GlaxoSmithKline].  More self-identify on their user pages.
* Self-identification is a two-edged sword:  You get points from most users for being honest, but a few will use it to harrass editors.  See, e.g., ser:James Cantor, a world-class expert on pedophilia, who has been chastised by a handful of (minority-view-holding) editors for not re-re-re-re-disclosing his &quot;conflict of interest&quot; every single time he edits certain pages.
* Corporate IP addresses are highly traceable.  An employee editing from the office should assume that s/he's hung a big sign on the edit saying &quot;I'm part of a pharmaceutical conspiracy&quot;.
* Some employers require disclosure, and a few believe it illegal for their employees to edit these pages.  (I believe the idea runs like this:  We are legally required to say only X about this product; if we change the Wikipedia page, we are legally required to say only X on the Wikipedia page; if the page says anything beyond X, then we're in violation of the law.)  So employees and contractors should check with their employers.

Wikipedia does not prohibit people in the pharmaceutical industry from editing articles.  P:PAID failed.  However, there are strategies that reduce conflict:
* Vandalism = bad.  As far as we're concerned, anyone is welcome to fix it, even people who work for a pharmaceutical company.
* Correct serious errors, but leave the fine points to others.
* Propose sources and improvements on the talk pages.
* Read P:MEDRS, especially the bits about not paying too much attention to single studies.
* Read P:MEDMOS, especially the bits about not providing medical advice, instructions to patients, or dosage information.
* Remember that Wikipedia is not a patient guide or drug formulary.  Employees might be in a unique position to provide background and historical information, which we very much want.  We'd love for every page about a drug to contain some information about its regulatory status around the world, its development, its manufacturing process, and its commercial history (e.g., which companies have worked on it and what its annual sales are).
* Come here or to T:PHARM to get help.

Hope this helps, ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 22:47, 18 February 2011 (UTC)
 It certainly does help, WAID. Is there any chance we could give this a more permanent home than the talk page archives? I was thinking of an essay, P:MEDCOI, that could be worked up into a guideline as part of P:COI, so that those who need the specific information can find it easily in future. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 23:11, 18 February 2011 (UTC)

Sure, we could do that.  I think it might be good to expand the other usual issues:  being a healthcare professional, academic expert, or a patient does not mean that you have a COI (although you might be biased).  It might be fun to include some of ser:WLU/Pharmanoia|the pharmanoia material, too.  What do you think?  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 19:29, 19 February 2011 (UTC)

We would first need to eliminate the &quot;double edged sword&quot; POV: The example given was first written up on COI/N as &quot;MarionTheLibrarian&quot;[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest/Noticeboard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=221272519#MarionTheLibrarian].  The pattern of self-promotion was the problem, not the login.  To avoid a fruitless tangent, I think it would be best to simply remove the bullet point.

We should stress that Wikipedia policies apply equally to all Wikipedia editors.  However, having audience-specific guides for what policies new editors should be particularly aware of couldn't hurt.

Getting back onto the topic of placement, is there a location where its target audience (pharma industry editors) would find it easily?  (If they needed to search for it, they might find it only after wading through a number of the specific policies.  This would reduce the value of the guide.) ser:Bittergrey|BitterGrey (ser talk:Bittergrey|talk) 19:56, 19 February 2011 (UTC)

ImperfectlyInformed, the dif about the EL was just to convey WhatamIdoing's documented prejudice here.  My main issue is with the tabular form, which implies that there is a caste system within Wikipedia where some policies only apply to lesser editors like you and me: That pharma employees don't really need to cite sources, while patients should busy themselves with vandalism cleanup. My quickly-reverted edit changed this table to three lists, with all Wikipedia policies applying to everyone equally.  This is a matter of substance.  

Of course, if no other editors get involved, Wikipedia content will be determined by the one who is willing to the be least civil and take the most liberties with Wikipedia policy. ser:Bittergrey|BitterGrey (ser talk:Bittergrey|talk) 05:43, 20 February 2011 (UTC)

I don't think you have accessed the right forum if you have a problem with WhatamIdoing. This thread is about COI disclosure in medical content, not about individual behaviour. WhatamIdoing is one of our most hardworking editors, so you are very unlikely to be getting a helpful hand.

Could we focus on the content being discussed today?  I realize that most here are more familiar with WhatamIdoing than with me, which means my odds of getting neutral input are slim.  What I'm doing might seem laughable.  I'm not paid by a pharma or medical interest, so those hoping to ignore me while advocating their position and goals have called me an advocate.  Per WhatamIdoing's table, a good edit for an advocate will be &quot;Adding sourced information about social movements and effects&quot; (e.g. making edits to the Oprah article) and to avoid &quot;Promoting tiny minority viewpoints.&quot;   Per WhatamIdoing's table, matters of substance (editing information about a product, the profession, health issues, or treatments) are reserved for those who can profit from it, expert or not, referenced or not.  

I'm hoping to preserve the neutrality of Wikipedia, with Wikipedia policies applying to everyone equally.  I accept that there is a caste system in practice in Wikipedia, but I do not think it should be reinforced.  I can see how this effort might seem laughable. ser:Bittergrey|BitterGrey (ser talk:Bittergrey|talk) 15:00, 20 February 2011 (UTC)
Bittergrey, the tone of your edits here is off-putting (IMHO) but I think you do have valid concerns.

Thanks Scray.  I responded to ImperfectlyInformed's comment above in hopes of keeping the discussion that I started there from getting diverted onto some procedural tangent.  WhatamIdoing has yet to respond to any of my attempts at discussion on this topic.  Perhaps JFW is correct in that everyone supports WhatamIdoing loyally, to the point of dismissing the possibility that he might have been uncivil as laughable (&quot;roll of my chair laughing&quot; to be exact).

 Wikipedia medical content 

It seems to me it is time for a policy governing medical claims in Wikipedia articles. Particularly, I'd like the right to delete any claim about the safety, efficacy or strength of evidence for a health intervention that is not supported by a P:MEDRS source, with exemption from 3RR sanctions, along the lines of BLP violations. I believe our present stance, allowing dubious claims to stand during drawn-out AfD or talk page discussion, is reckless. If I've missed something, if this is explicitly covered elsewhere, please point me to it. --ser:Anthonyhcole|Anthonyhcole (ser talk:Anthonyhcole|talk) 05:28, 22 February 2011 (UTC)

I completely support this. We should also state clearly when a particular use of a drug is off-label or in the absence of good evidence.
I also think that we need to tighten up on claims of adverse events and side-effects that lack a reliable source. We have a lot of drug articles that are stuffed to the brim with anecdotal reports from unhappy users, often with the flimsiest of sources. I am actually amazed that drug companies have (on the whole) not mobilised people to tidy up articles about their products. They would find themselves supported by policies if they did. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 07:08, 22 February 2011 (UTC)

 Regarding &quot;off-label&quot; use I am deleting such notices very often. Exactly because they suggest absence of evidence. A large number of off-label applications are for orphan diseases. If you look around for which conditions there are &quot;FDA-approved&quot; treatments I would not be surprised to find that there is not a single FDA approved treatment for something like 99.9% of all known conditions - and not all of them are rare. Another problem with off-label and FDA-approved tags is that they tend to be very US centered.

 As of side effects they are in constant need of cleaning but I would object if they were cleaned up to the level of nothing-saying patient handout leaflets. ser:Richiez|Richiez (ser talk:Richiez|talk) 12:04, 22 February 2011 (UTC)

P:BLP is a big policy that took a long time to draft, with input from loads of people. MEDRS and this project is comparatively tiny. BLP is built on top of WP:V, NPOV and NOR as well as US law. If you want a medical policy, it needs to be built on top of existing policies, not on top of a guideline.
As far as the speedy 3RR-exempt removal of material goes, this applies to areas of limited scope and fairly straightforward judgement. It is fairly easy to justify the play-it-safe censorship of contentious remarks about a living person (WP could be sued, people get hurt by the comments).
The scope of this proposal (all medical safety and efficacy claims) is huge. Does this include preventative (eat your greens, avoid a high-fat diet) as well as curative medicine? 
The judement calls required are far more complex than simply: is this contentious; is about a living person; is the source reliable. I don't see how such complex judgements could be made excempt from 3RR edit warring.
ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 15:54, 22 February 2011 (UTC)

I don't think this is a good idea.  We've got people right now who are using this attitude to justify gutting AltMed articles because they have personally judged the sources to be inappropriate.  For example, PPdd has recently deleted sourced material solely because the source wasn't in English.  (PPdd, do take a minute to read the policy P:NONENG, okay?)  
In most cases, the material is a simple description of what the practitioners believe—the critical distinction between &quot;Herbalists use this for the common cold&quot; and &quot;This is a safe and effective treatment for the common cold.&quot;  I am not currently seeing signs that all of our editors have the necessary judgment to follow a policy like this.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:08, 22 February 2011 (UTC)

I agree that there's a distinction between &quot;people use it for this&quot; and &quot;it works.&quot;  I also agree with AHC that &quot;it works&quot; should always at least have a n tag.  I don't think that this requires a P:CREEP|separate policy, our standard requirement for P:V|verifiability handles it just fine, as claims of effectiveness are likely to be challenged.  ser:SDY|SDY (ser talk:SDY|talk) 16:22, 22 February 2011 (UTC)

 Phantom ICD disorders again

There is MID|7781117 but it does not say literally &quot;fibrosclerosis of breast&quot;. No other source in or outside PubMed comes even close to this, at least I could not find it. There is no &quot;fibroslerosis of breast&quot;. Instead there is a whole range of findings called sclerosing adenosis etc. Many of those are suspected to be indicative of premalignant changes and as such they are usually differentiated with great care and of course not all of them fit into fibrocystic conditions at all (eg sclerosing adenosis in complex fibroadenoma). Simplifying all those conditions to &quot;fibrosclerosis of breast&quot; and lump it together as a subclass of fibrocystic condition would be a classification disaster in my opinion.

 Please Review Edits to Diabetes Template Page 

I recently tried to add glycated albumin as another blood test for diabetes on emplate:Diabetes...My edit was promptly reverted. I'm not sure what the reason was, but I have found several reference laboratories that provide this test for doctors (listed below). I think that it is fully appropriate to add lycated albumin to the list.

A page on lycated protein should probably be created where this among others is discussed.[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20724796] ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) 22:46, 1 March 2011 (UTC)

Not the best source but this says GP is the same as fructosamine [http://www.labtestsonline.org/understanding/analytes/fructosamine/glance.html] ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) 23:02, 1 March 2011 (UTC)

I have also come across similar descriptions online, and I believe that they are misleading. Fructosamine is a general term used to refer to numerous serum proteins that have undergone glycation (Glycated Serum Proteins or GSP). While glycated albumin (GA) is a major component (80%) of what is referred to as “fructosamine,” GA is only one of the many glycated proteins that are measured in the fructosamine assay. Specific assays for glycated albumin do actually exist: Exocell manufactures an ELISA kit (Glycaben) and the labs listed above offer affinity column chromatography tests (and other formats) for clinical use. 

There is a substantial amount of literature that shows that GA is directly involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes complications and that a specific GA assay is clinically beneficial for diabetes monitoring [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21153482], especially in patients with red blood cell abnormalities [http://www.nature.com/ki/journal/v73/n9/abs/ki200825a.html],[http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/33/3/509.long]. Considering all this, I think it would be appropriate to clearly differentiate fructosamine from glycated albumin (I'm working right now on writing an article for Glycated Albumin, which inaccurately redirects to Fructosamine). ser:Jymorale|Jymorale (ser talk:Jymorale|talk) 01:34, 2 March 2011 (UTC)

So GA is a type of fructosamine. May be this should be added as a subsection in the fructosamine article than split off into its own article when large enough. ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) 03:47, 2 March 2011 (UTC)

Hmmm...adding GA to the fructosamine article is a great idea, since it is a type of fructosamine (FA). But I think I just realized what's causing the confusion here. The contents in the ructosamine article (except for the 3 lines of intro) are specific to the fructosamine assay, not the fructosamine molecules. Perhaps it would be best if the fructosamine page was renamed to &quot;Fructosamine Assay&quot; or maybe even split it into two articles: &quot;Fructosamine&quot; and &quot;Fructosamine Assay&quot;. Adding GA to the page as it is now would probably mislead readers to believe that the GA and FA assays are one and the same. ser:Jymorale|Jymorale (ser talk:Jymorale|talk) 19:48, 2 March 2011 (UTC)

Just because it is current written primarily about an assay does not mean that it should not be rewritten to be about the molecule which IMO it should.ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) 19:52, 2 March 2011 (UTC)
I think that one article is likely to be better.  The article could then split the sections into Chemistry and Assays (or something like that).  I think the primary advantage of putting it all on one page is that it would be easier for the reader to figure out that the test is not the molecule.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 20:43, 2 March 2011 (UTC)

I agree with both of you. The ructosamine article should be reorganized so these differences are clear. GA can then be listed as a type of fructosamine, and then link out to the full article when it is available. Thanks for all the feedback! Going back to the original purpose of this post though... Since GA is a stand-alone blood test for diabetes, I think it appropriate to list it on the emplate:diabetes page. This is a separate issue from the details about the contents of the individual articles. ser:Jymorale|Jymorale (ser talk:Jymorale|talk) 21:16, 2 March 2011 (UTC)

 alk:Serial killer#African American serial killers 

Psychological/medical sources are usually used to identify serial killers, with the occasional exception of law enforcement. Generally, news sources are not the best sources to use for a topic such as this, per ikipedia:Identifying reliable sources#News organizations. Yet, the section in question uses news sources and writers. The first source [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Serial_killer&amp;diff=417348425&amp;oldid=417336633 in the section] already inaccurately describes two people as serial killers. The editor who added the section, however, feels that the section should stay because it is &quot;verifiable.&quot; The question is...whether or not this editor's sources should be considered good enough simply because they are &quot;verifiable.&quot; 

Opinions are definitely needed on this matter. ser:Flyer22|Flyer22 (ser talk:Flyer22|talk) 02:10, 6 March 2011 (UTC)

 Pending changes 

I know some of you have expressed interest in P:Pending changes, so I thought I'd mention here that there's a huge RFC at ikipedia:Pending changes/Request for Comment February 2011 that you might be interested in.  

For those who don't know anything about it:  

Unlike P:Semiprotection, which completely prevents IPs and brand-new accounts from editing articles, Pending changes lets a new editor change the article.  However, the changes aren't shown to the world (e.g., your favorite web search engine or other readers) unless and until some trusted user has looked at it and determined that it's not vandalism or libel.  

Pages needing review can be seen at pecial:PendingChanges, and also on your watchlist.  You become a &quot;reviewer&quot; by asking for it at ikipedia:Requests for permissions/Reviewer.  I expect that &gt;90% of the people watching this page would be accepted.

The author then states that the right ventricle valve is the &quot;aortic valve&quot;, this is wrong. He or she then lists the &quot;aortic valve&quot; as being in the left ventricle, which is correct.

Our physicians here will appreciate this. Take a look at page 2 of [http://www.korenpublications.com/images/products/00000207.pdf this chart] and check out the unique neuroanatomy, especially the neck. You didn't learn all this in med school because it was made up in the 1800s by aniel David Palmer|a man who only had eight years of education, was a grocer and school teacher, and who got his ideas in a spiritualistic seance from a dead doctor.... Also check out why they believe that manipulating a spinal joint segment can treat or cure specific diseases caused by ertebral subluxation|&quot;subluxation effects&quot;.

For example, according to the chart, by cracking the neck they claim to be able to treat or cure deafness and blindness. Another example is their belief that by cracking the coccyx they can treat hemorrhoids, anal itching, migraines, infertility, brain pressure and mental symptoms. By cracking T9 they can treat allergies and hives. By popping T4 they can treat gallbladder problems, jaundice and shingles. By cracking T7 they can treat diabetes, ulcers, and blood disorders.

This chart shows why they think this way. Then consider this is the largest producer of their teaching aids. These are the most used charts in the profession, and this is happening now, in 2011.

I'm trying to develop some more breadth of experience, so I've been looking around for various ways to contribute and fill some needs here and there.

In doing so, I saw that ipoblastoma needed a rating, so I went to check it out.

I discovered that the &quot;article&quot; is currently nothing more than a Disambiguation page with links to (1) Benign lipoblastomatosis, and (2) Myxoid lipoblastoma. This is TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE :-O for the Worlds Greatest Encyclopedia, so I thought I'd just go ahead and create some sort of &quot;real&quot; article on it over the next few days.

We're trying to decide whether, based on our sources' description of CPCs' religious affiliation, personnel, and behavior (detailed in a paragraph in the article for your easy consumption) it is best to describe them as &quot;Christian,&quot; &quot;run by Christians,&quot; or &quot;affiliated with a Christian organization.&quot; Thanks! ser:Roscelese|Roscelese (ser talk:Roscelese|talk ⋅ pecial:Contributions/Roscelese|contribs) 02:32, 13 March 2011 (UTC)

 Wikipedia Initiative from the merican Psychological Society (APS) 

Hi, folks.
APS is encouraging its members to help improve psychological pages on WP.  
http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/publications/observer/2010/december-10/anyone-can-edit-wikipedia-have-you.html
http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/publications/observer/2010/september-10/there-is-something-very-important-going-on-here-and-i-want-to-be-a-part-of-it.html
http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/publications/observer/2011/february-11/harnessing-the-power-of-wikipedia-for-scientific-psychology-a-call-to-action.html
At T:PSY, the following summary was provided by ser:Robertekraut, and I thought it would be relevant here as well (especially for the neurosciences).
Starting in February, 2011, the [http://www.psychologicalscience.org/ APS website] will include a portal describing the initiative and recruiting volunteers. The plan is that APS members and students will volunteer on the portal and fill out a form to identify their areas of interest and expertise. The portal will then try to match volunteers with needed work on psychology articles, using the ser:SuggestBot|SuggestBot task recommender. It will suggest assessment tasks to APS members who have PhDs in psychology, using the new article feedback tool that the ikipedia Foundation has developed for this purpose. The recommender will ask graduate students and others to work on particular psychology articles that are important (i.e., have high numbers of page views) and that the ikipedia:WikiProject_Psychology has assessed as C grade or below. These are important psychology articles that aren't good enough yet. The initiative will also host a forum or talk page where APS Wikipedia Initiative volunteers can communicate with each other and members of the Wikipedia community. Finally, the initiative will evaluate the value of different techniques to get psychologists involved in Wikipedia, using both surveys of the volunteers and experiments involving different technqiues.
I would be delighted to see more psychologists becoming involved.  The exology pages, where I typically edit, are sorely in need of them...try to P:newbie|help out any new folk you run into!

 Input needed at exual Compulsives Anonymous 

There is a discussion between me and ser:Scarpy about the lede sentence for describing that organization (as well as ex Addicts Anonymous).  The original lede, which Scarpy supports, is:
Sexual Compulsives Anonymous (SCA) is a twelve-step program for recovery from sexual compulsion.[1]
citing the manual written and published by SCA.  I believe that that sentence fails P:NPOV, because the term &quot;sexual compulsion&quot; is widely debated/contested/challenged among experts, and having the above as a lede sentence makes the page assert that that diagnosis is an accepted one, which it is not.  I support this sentence instead:
Sexual Compulsives Anonymous (SCA) is a twelve-step program for people with hypersexuality who identify as sexual compulsives.[1][2]
The term &quot;hypersexuality&quot; is described by multiple sexologists as being 'theory-neutral'; it merely describes the behavior without implying anything about whether the people are compulsive versus addicted versus impulsive, etc.  Scarpy prefers that the lede use the term as used by the SCA members.  We would appreciate more opinions to help us decide what's best.  Cites for the above are on that article's talkpage.

Oy. I've tried to tone down the melatonin section a bit, and added a much-needed tag. I will try to return to it, but I'm not sure I'll have the necessary time this weekend. It will take some work, because the section does contain some (mostly primary) sources, but they are carefully selected and arranged to promote melatonin as a radiation cure, rather than to give a balanced and judicious overview of the topic. In my experience, those sorts of problems are among the hardest to fix. I think we can convey the existing (limited, pre-clinical) evidence on melatonin as a potentially radioprotective agent, but the current text reads like a slick infomercial designed to capitalize on recent events in Japan in order to move merchandise. ser:MastCell|MastCell ser Talk:MastCell|Talk 16:23, 19 March 2011 (UTC)

1. I find them helpful in keeping track of what is in the article. They can be verified using logic if the relations are stated in the article with RS. WikiProject Mathematics uses OR like this.

 The citation of all these mind maps is present, I created them using information from this [http://www.amazon.co.uk/Clinical-Dermatology-John-C-Hunter/dp/0632059168 book], so the info is cited, and I think that limiting their presence to a section for them wont bother uninterested people, and would benefit interested ones ser:madhero88|MaenK.A.ser_talk:madhero88|Talk 17:33, 13 March 2011 (UTC)

I too am concerned they are OR. And if they aren't OR then they are probably breaking someone's copyright (i.e., the book contains mind maps or you have copied the organisation of sections/chapters in the book when creating the mind maps). Essentially, they are one person's thought processes on a subject, and as such highly individual. Another issue is that generally it isn't a good idea to include images on WP that can't be read unless clicked though -- this reduces the value of the page (if printed in a book, they are useless) and limits accessibility to people with vision problems. But more importantly, there's nothing medical about mind maps so if WP were to limit or encourage their use, this conversation should be happening in a wider forum.  ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 20:28, 13 March 2011 (UTC)

I would consider mindmaps as a representation of text, since they are ostensibly developed from text found in reliable sources.  This requires a large amount of decision-making, including reduction of complex relationships to linear associations, dropping less-important associations, etc.  I suggest that this decision-making is, more or less, P:SYNTH|synthesis, because some of those decisions involving mapping concepts in a way that was not suggested in published sources.  Normally, when we edit text passages in WP, it is fairly easy for editors to collaboratively work toward a representation of reliable sources, sometimes by working through the text line-by-line, to ensure that we avoid synthesis.  In contrast, mindmaps are not amenable to this sort of editing.  Most images do not represent, at a granular level, concepts that span an entire article or set of articles, whereas this is what mindmaps tend to do.  The huge risk of synthesis inherent in making a mindmap is not balanced by ease of editing or support for embedded citation.  -- ser:Scray|Scray (ser talk:Scray|talk) 14:46, 28 March 2011 (UTC)

 I'm more concerned that there's just a lack of utility for the article, given that your average joe has no idea what a mind map is or even why it's there.  Given all of the other concerns, it doesn't seem like they're worth the effort, though including them as a link might be meaningful.  Seems more like Wikiversity material, and including an external link there might be a better way to address these.  If they were honestly useful to readers, I'd be much more willing to P:IAR|bend for them, but they're really a tool for a P:NOTTEXTBOOK|textbook and don't really fit the objectives of an encyclopedia.  ser:SDY|SDY (ser talk:SDY|talk) 17:01, 28 March 2011 (UTC)
