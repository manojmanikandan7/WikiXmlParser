This research presentation might interest some of you:  youtu.be/VR5JwqyVGSk?t=1614   (Yes, you're going to have to copy that.

Or this link [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR5JwqyVGSk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1614] Doc James (talk ·  · ) 18:28, 21 September 2017 (UTC)
Most of this is about scientists reading Wikipedia articles but not citing it.  
Two quick details that will interest editors: 
* Journals with below-median impact factors are more likely to plagiarize Wikipedia's text (but it's still very uncommon).
* Citing a scientific paper in Wikipedia does not seem to change the rate at which it's cited in the literature.  (So REFSPAM is a waste of time.)  WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:50, 21 September 2017 (UTC)
**Citing a scientific paper (or any other source, particularly if it's online) on Wikipedia does have a measurable effect on the number of readers of whatever's being cited, even if people don't go on to cite it elsewhere. (Whether this is through people directly following links from the reference section, or through links on Wikipedia being used by PageRank to push the source higher up search results, I leave as an exercise for someone who actually gets paid to investigate these things.) The spammers can rest easy in their beds. ‑ Iridescent 20:44, 21 September 2017 (UTC)
** Refspam is unfortunately not a waste of time for some folks trying to get a job, to get tenure, or to stroke their ego (Look--I'm cited in Wikipedia. I'm somebody!). See, for instance, people taking this seriously in [https://wlv.openrepository.com/wlv/bitstream/2436/609614/1/WikipediaCitations+(2).pdf Are Wikipedia Citations Important Evidence of the Impact of Scholarly Articles and Books?]. --Mark viking (talk) 20:54, 21 September 2017 (UTC)
***Two things:  First, that's what this research project found, so if you think they're they're wrong, then  can put you in touch with the researcher, and you can figure out what the data says.  Second, when you reply to a discussion with mixed list formatting, it's  followed by .  The beginning of your line needs to exactly match whatever comes before it.  Following ::* with :::* is always wrong.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 00:33, 22 September 2017 (UTC)
***: Did I say something to offend you? If so, it was not intended and please accept my apologies. I never said the study or your assertions were wrong. I think both studies probably have some truth to them. Even if WP citations don't alter literature citation rates, some people consider WP citations themselves as an adjunct to literature citations and a useful proxy for the educational or societal impact of an academic's research for the purposes of hiring, tenure, etc. Thanks for trying to fix my formatting typo, but what I intended was ::*:, as my reply was not semantically part of a bulleted list. --Mark viking (talk) 22:41, 22 September 2017 (UTC)

There is a discussion going on at WT:NOT [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_Not_a_Laboratory now] about setting up a NOTLABORATORY policy.  There is also a discussion at VPM [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_(miscellaneous)#A_science_experiment_run_on_Wikipedia_without_notification here].

These people abused their editing privileges and wasted a bunch of volunteer time, while we tried to figure out what was going on with the content they were creating.
The scientists and whoever they had doing the grunt work never talked to us.  People at the WMF apparently knew about this, and didn't say anything to us. 
Ugly shitting on the editing community and on this project all around. Jytdog (talk) 18:55, 5 October 2017 (UTC)
 Thank you for the links. I confess to not understanding the extent of the problem before reading those. Abusing AfC editors without consent is unethical, in addition to being a big waste of time. Some of the stats articles submitted were of poor quality. I'd say this deserves letters to the Pittsburgh and MIT IRBs. Maybe WMF, too. --Mark viking (talk) 19:57, 5 October 2017 (UTC)
How is following the directions in the Article Wizard, to create missing articles on highly technical scientific subjects, &quot;Abusing AfC editors&quot;?
I see a lot of emotion here (and a lot of semi-automated messages on that talk page), and I understand that the articles weren't perfect (some far from it, but what should we expect from brand-new editors?), but I don't see anything that looks like abusing AfC.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 21:36, 5 October 2017 (UTC)
Well open your eyes. Here I will paste what I put at VPM -- there was:

a) the tremendous waste of the editing community's time trying to figure out what was going on, and its time dealing with the articles (many of which were poor, and were uploaded multiple times)

b) the blowing off of the editing community by the people running the experiment.   I checked [https://tools.wmflabs.org/xtools-ec/?user=Carolineneil&amp;project=en.wikipedia.org the edit count] for , and they used a talk page exactly once back in November 2015, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AWikiProject_Chemistry&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=689984776&amp;oldid=689974697 here] at WT:CHEM, and they wrote   That is the definition of NOTHERE not to mention arrogant as hell.  If they would have taken a different approach, a bunch of the time of the editing community would not have been wasted, and their contribs would have been more productive.  (the whole section that snippet is from, is [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Chemistry/Archive_37#More_suspect_articles_by_same_editor here])

c) that per [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=802855602 this note] from User:Dario (WMF) which includes  --  the WMF was indeed aware of this.  What Dario wrote in that note is pretty different from Carolineneil wrote, but .. whatever.   Whatever was said in those &quot;extensive discussions&quot; didn't translate to any kind of respect for the editing community's time and work, nor any effort to get prior consensus, and Dario didn't communicate the information to the editing community either. 

What happened is frankly stupid and completely avoidable (and in my view, another expression of WMF staffers' apparent lack of understanding of the work the editing community does maintaining content and of the importance of consensus here).   I am hopeful that the effort to establish  will succeed, but we also need to communicate clearly to WMF what it should do with this kinds of requests, and what they should do with information they have about people's intentions.  (It kills me that the people doing the experiment tried to reach out to what they thought was someone &quot;here&quot; but it took two years, three ANIs, and the paper being published for the editing community to finally understand on its own what had been happening.  I don't know what &quot;appropriate spaces&quot; Dario advised them to post in , but we didn't know about it. Jytdog (talk) 22:10, 5 October 2017 (UTC)
Did we need to know about it?
Really.  Please think about that for a minute.  Someone who actually knows something about chemistry wrote some articles.  Sure, some of them had problems.  Some of them were things that we'd have merged to larger topics (maybe because 99.99% of know less about chemistry than the person writing the article).  But still:  an actual content expert wrote non-promotional articles about chemistry.  We don't see that very often.  So why didn't we welcome them with open arms?  Why was our instinct &quot;What kind of scam this?!&quot; instead of &quot;Finally, some chemist figured out where the 'Edit' button is on Wikipedia?&quot; 
IMO we wasted a lot of time &quot;trying to figure out what was going on&quot; solely because that's what some editors personally choose to do with their  time.  I can't find it in me to blame a subject-matter expert for our cynicism and suspicion.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 22:38, 5 October 2017 (UTC)
The three ANI threads were generated because everyday editors were not aware of the experiment and weird shit was happening, and the person implementing it wasn't given enough training to understand that dealing with other editors isn't optional.   Issues get raised because weird shit is happening, not vice versa. I am done responding to you on this. Jytdog (talk) 22:50, 5 October 2017 (UTC)
 The real tragedy is that much potentially useful content was written by subject experts and lost because the subject experts had almost no skills in Wikipedia editing. I find it astonishing that Dario Taraborelli didn't direct them to WikiProject Chemistry, or to any experienced Wikipedia editor who could spend some time teaching them how to use talk pages and explaining that editing Wikipedia is a holistic process requiring more than just subject expertise. What a shame. --RexxS (talk) 22:58, 5 October 2017 (UTC)
I agree with you:  It's a shame that we were given content on missing chemistry subjects, and we're rejecting it, deleting it, and even demonizing subject-matter experts who tried to fill the gaps in the encyclopedia.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:28, 6 October 2017 (UTC)
 It wasn't just chemistry; there was a parallel set of articles developed on econometrics that they abandoned part-way through. Sadly, I don't see any alternative to rejecting and deleting contributions and criticising contributors when they simply fail to take any steps to familiarise themselves with the context in which they intend to do their research. It's like folks going into a foreign country to do some work and expecting the culture and conventions to fit their preconceptions, then wondering why they end up being deported. --RexxS (talk) 18:50, 6 October 2017 (UTC)

 Yes, we did need to know about it. Two reasons: (1) Articles were posted under false pretenses using a fake account. Academic projects don't get a free pass for violating TOS. (2) AfC is a collaborative process. AfC editors donate their time to help out new editors learn WP editing and get up to speed. That teaching process is two-way. This project subverted that by using AfC editors as some sort of fire and forget, Mehanical Turk QC process to give a &quot;mainspace&quot;rubber stamp to their articles. No wants to put effort into reviewing and teaching, only to be completely ignored. It was clear abuse of AfC editors under false pretenses. --Mark viking (talk) 23:03, 5 October 2017 (UTC)
I don't think that I can agree that writing an article about advanced chemistry and posting it under your real names is posting &quot;under false pretenses using a fake account&quot;.  They should have used separate accounts because of our  policy (which almost nobody knows about except us highly experienced editors), but &quot;User:Carolineneil&quot; can't be considered a fake name when the people operating it are actually named Caroline and Neil.   WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:12, 6 October 2017 (UTC)

Break
 Hey folks, I'm Halfak (WMF), but I'm wearing my volunteer hat right now because supporting other researchers like Carolineneil is not something I do in a staff capacity.  I had to use my email archive to jog my memory of what happened here.  I was hardly involved.  Based on those emails, it seems Dario was even less involved.  These researchers were acting entirely independently of the WMF Research Team and contrary to the advice I'd supplied in my volunteer time.  
 At any given moment in time, I'm advising 5-10 research projects taking place around Wikipedia/Wikidata/etc.  I did talk to Caroline and Neil about their study.  I requested them to publicly describe their project and goals.  They produced  and then did not respond to any of the concerns raised on the talk page.  I repeatedly requested that they respond to these concerns via email and to follow the advice of editors at AFC who were strongly advising them to slow down.  Once they stopped emailing me requesting that I solve their problems for them, I lost track of the project.  I'm surprised to now find that they had been continuing their activities and not responding to warnings.  I think that blocking the researchers was the right call and I regret that had not happened sooner.  At the time, I suppose it seemed to me that Wikipedia's quality control system was tracking their activities and supplying the right warnings (which usually lead to a block if the behavior doesn't stop) so I saw no cause to raise a parallel alarm.  Honestly I expect that researchers will generally stop before they cause such an obvious problem.
 Process-wise, I have no authority over independent researchers, but I have been pushing for a more formalized process for approving research projects on-wiki.  Usually I meet resistance from people who feel that the proposed processes are too restrictive and those who think they aren't enough (like Jytdog).  Regretfully, these two groups don't work out their differences and I don't have the time or energy to fight both sides.  See , , and  for examples of my past efforts on English Wikipedia (usually researchers are most disruptive in their recruitment strategies -- everyone wants to ask the top editors why they edit for some reason).  Because these process proposals have failed, I've largely just been trying to advise researchers when they show up.  Happily, many Wikipedians know me for doing this work, so researchers often get routed to me.  Roughly here's what I suggest researchers do: (1) talk to me and let me shoot down things that obviously won't work, (2) create a project description page on meta (using  -- note the focus on ethics, policies, and data privacy), and then (3) reach out to the communities that will be affected (e.g. AfC would have been a good one here) and don't proceed without either consensus or indifference WRT the proposed activities.  In my experience, this almost always proceeds just fine.  So I've given up on formal review processed for studies.  But, Jytdog, if you wanted to pick that effort back up, I'd support you!  In the meantime, I'm always looking for help reviewing and raising potential issues WRT researchers' proposed projects.  I'd be very happy to have a hand with that.
 In the end, I agree with WhatamIdoing.  These researchers were not doing anything that was obviously harmful to the encyclopedia. Their primary mistake is not engaging with editors in the process of their work.  I regret that this was the case, but it doesn't seem like much damage was done here.  After all, if more damage were being done, I'm sure they would have been blocked sooner. --EpochFail (talk • ) 23:07, 5 October 2017 (UTC)
 Thanks for your reply and for providing all that background!  I've watchlisted those.  I do view volunteer hours wasted as a bad thing; those hours are gone and are not coming back.  The frustrating thing here is that there is no place where User:Carolineneil connected what she (if it was a woman and one person) connected their account to the project posted at meta.  Even if you had given notice of the proposed project at WT:CHEM, they couldn't have connected what the account was doing to the &quot;experiment&quot;. Not good.  At minimum the relevant project should be notified of what is happening so they can object.  I don't know if that is processed-to-death  Jytdog (talk) 23:39, 5 October 2017 (UTC)
I cannot view the hours spent reviewing new articles on academic subjects as &quot;wasted&quot;.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:12, 6 October 2017 (UTC)
I know that you cannot see the problem here. Jytdog (talk) 17:30, 6 October 2017 (UTC)
  I am with WAID but I am also becoming increasingly disillusioned with ref spam, in no small part because of the reproducibility crisis in biomedical sciences.  One can learn a lot by reading self serving primary sources and tracking down good secondary to replace the primary sources, but this is more often than not a futile effort that rapidly leads to editor burnout.  What I feel is lacking is a pithy explanation that will immediately be understood by researchers and does not rely on references to arcane Wikipedia policy.  is a good start, but IMHO, it is too general.  We need something specifically targeted towards researchers that is really pithy that starts with something like:  Boghog (talk) 19:18, 6 October 2017 (UTC)

Ethics guidelines
If experimenting on Wikipedia (not just using data from Wikipedia) is currently allowed, should we have ethics guidelines? Something along the lines of:
* In order not to violate community rules or norms, become an editor and learn the culture of the community before starting.
* Consult with and gain the consent of the community before beginning. Wikimedia employees are analogous to civil servants; consulting with them is not equivalent to consulting with the community.
* Methodology that interferes with the main goals of the encyclopedia is unlikely to get consent. Please avoid interfering with the work of others, including by wasting volunteer time.
* Here is a catalogue of past mistakes to avoid.

Dear all,

I tried to mention on the &quot;Cancer immunotherapy&quot; page the inventors and cite their early 1989 paper for the development of CAT-T cells, scFv, and Anticancer CAR-T cells.

User Jytdog removed my add arguing promotional abuse policy.

He says that showing these persons worked on field X on date Y doesn't means they were the first to do it. Thats ok, but I can not do nothing to prove they were the first. All the CAR-T community recognize them as the inventors and there is no earlyer publication about it.

I don't know how should we proceed.

Welcome to Wikipedia, .  You may be interested in , which was written for scientists to explain some of the weirdness here.  One of the quirks about sourcing a Wikipedia article is that, unlike most journals, we actually don't want to &quot;credit&quot; the first authors/papers by citing those papers directly.  A recent review article is always considered &quot;better&quot; than the original paper.  So, for example, if you go through the list of articles that cite this article and find a review article such as , and if that review article (which I haven't read) happens to say that this was the first paper, then you're set, and it's just a matter of swapping out the citation.  But if there aren't any sources (including textbooks; it doesn't have to be just peer-reviewed journal articles) that actually say something like &quot;the first&quot;, then it's harder.  I believe that some editors have actually resorted to begging their scientific friends to please write down the things that &quot;all the community recognize&quot; in their next papers, just to get past the occasional dispute like this.

Almost funny, Universal blood
I'm not sure if I'm understanding this correctly: 
*&quot;Experienced on rabbits, Gernez recommends to use a spray on toddlers. Volunteers for a strongest human specie depend on parents, corporations and institutions.&quot; 
This can't possibly be true. Barbara (WVS) ✐  13:50, 27 October 2017 (UTC)
Ya, that seems like something that needs a root and branch rewriting if we want to keep it at all, as it is it seems to mish-mash some slightly different concepts. And none of the sources seem MEDRS compliant. Jo-Jo Eumerus (talk, ) 15:01, 27 October 2017 (UTC)

Yep, that entire article is problematic. The parts that are reality-based are mostly too poorly described to be comprehensible; the parts referring to Andre Gernez are just...wrong.  See also André Gernez, incidentally, which presents some cancer-curing nonsense along with misunderstood/misrepresented/missing sources and should be drastically edited. TenOfAllTrades(talk) 15:21, 27 October 2017 (UTC)
 I'm not understanding the article at all. Is there any science hiding in the confusing text, or is this some clearly pseudoscientific nonsense? Natureium (talk) 15:24, 27 October 2017 (UTC)
There is a bit of science there (&quot;universal blood donors&quot; and &quot;the problem of making blood that can be transfused to anyone without the problems of immunological incompatibility&quot;) but it's buried deep. Jo-Jo Eumerus (talk, ) 15:33, 27 October 2017 (UTC)
 Redirected to Blood type#Universal donors and universal recipients which explains the concept of &quot;O negative&quot; without all the woo. There's theoretically a viable article to be written about the concept of synthetic blood, or converting existing blood to O negative so it can be used more widely, but this gibberish wasn't it. ‑ Iridescent 15:35, 27 October 2017 (UTC)

(ec) There's a couple of different flavors of &quot;universal blood&quot; that the article tries (more or less badly) to describe.  One involves various strategies to modify normal human blood to prevent it from provoking an immune response when given to an ABO-type mismatched recipient.  This so-called &quot;universal&quot; blood is normal blood that has been processed to either remove or render inaccessible the A and B surface antigens.  (Another approach is to generate blood cells from scratch, entirely in vitro, by growing and differentiating stem cells in the lab.)  There's a bit of overlap with the scope of blood substitute. 
The other, quackier flavor is the first paragraph, which is a total mess.  I think what they're trying to suggest is that using a suitable magic spray (applied during infancy) one can train one's immune system to tolerate non-ABO-matched blood (and improve rates of organ transplant success, and reduce allergies, and so forth); the recipient of this treatment will have &quot;universal blood&quot; that is compatible with everything.  Ahem.  As near as I can tell, this is based on a misunderstanding, mispresentation, or wildly unwarranted speculation rooted in the fact that infants often tolerate non-ABO-matched transplant organs with little rejection.  (Loosely speaking, the immature immune system hasn't nailed down the self/non-self distinction very firmly.)
I'd say the first category of stuff is broadly worth covering.  We need to be watchful for overoptimisitc, promotional biotech assertions about how these blood products are revolutionary and just around the corner, though.  The second category is just junk.  There is plenty that's worth writing about how the early immune system adapts to foreign tissue, or how adult immune responses might be modulated by early exposure to antigens—but there's nothing here that will help accomplish that.  In both cases, it's possible that all the material would be better presented in the context of another existing article.  TenOfAllTrades(talk) 16:07, 27 October 2017 (UTC)

Sedentary lifestyle article

Any thoughts on [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sedentary_lifestyle&amp;diff=807259354&amp;oldid=801598481 this edit] by ? Maybe 3trist is a ? Flyer22 Reborn (talk) 01:59, 27 October 2017 (UTC)
Large amounts of the added content are off topic. It has the look of cut&amp;paste from a term paper or may be plagiarized. I reverted the edit and asked 3trist to visit the Talk page to make a case for adding it to the article . --Zefr (talk) 03:44, 27 October 2017 (UTC)
Assuming that it wasn't copy-pasted from elsewhere, it appeared essay-like with too much repetition.  It otherwise was pretty good.  There were some brand names mentioned which might have appeared promotional, but it was then followed by no conclusive evidence mentions, etc.  If it's not plagiarism and is to be restored, it should probably be shortened.  —PaleoNeonate – 16:07, 27 October 2017 (UTC)

 I agree with the sentiments above, but I'd like us to address this question: &quot;Is the version of the article after 3trist's edit an improvement on what was before?&quot; Because, barring a copyvio, we usually benefit more by cleaning up and copyediting these sort of contributions than simply rejecting them.

Synonyms

Is &quot;low-trauma fracture&quot; always a synonym for pathologic fracture?  Could a redirect between these two terms be accurate?  Are there any medical dictionaries that MEDRS might be able to recommend?  -- (talk) 01:21, 15 October 2017 (UTC)
I don't think it's the same thing.  You might be interested in  or  (lists non-osteoporosis causes, including drugs, which do not appear to be considered pathologic fractures).  [https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/article/44/1/138/1784820/Does-a-patient-focused-approach-increase This 2005 piece] provides a definition:  &quot;Low-trauma fracture was defined as a fracture resulting from a fall from a standing position or lower.&quot;  The definition suggests that it can't be considered a synonym of pathologic fractures, as there's always going to be the odd case of bad luck/landing badly.  Toddlers sometimes break their collar bones by rolling out of bed, and that's likely to count as &quot;from a standing position or lower&quot; and unlikely to be associated with any disease process.
I'm not absolutely certain how a stress fracture fits into this system, but it can suddenly go from a minor hairline problem to a complete break – and if that happens in one of the bones that you use for standing, then falling down would not be an unreasonable outcome.  Which reminds me of a view of hip fractures that I heard decades ago from an EMT:  when you find an elderly woman on the ground, and her hip is broken, it's hard to tell whether she fell down and broke her hip, or if her hip broke, so she fell down.
 is also interesting:  obesity has long been considered to protect against osteoporosis (the assumed cause of pathologic fractures unless another process is known), but it may be more accurate to say that obese women break their upper arms rather than their wrists.  The cause(s) seemed to be unknown, but I assume that &quot;because when you have that much weight land on your 80-year-old humerus, it might crack even if the bone seemed just fine until then&quot; is among the causes being considered.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 06:11, 15 October 2017 (UTC)

Thank you for your detailed response.  I've also come across &quot;fragility fractures&quot; in my readings, apparently discussing similar concepts which does redirect to pathological fractures, so I wasn't sure.  The last thing I want to do is to create a synonym where none exists.  I'll have to have a read - maybe low-trauma fractures should be mentioned at Bone fracture.  -- (talk) 07:07, 15 October 2017 (UTC)

  Self-induced abortion and Medical abortion articles

 The articles now seem to have been restored to an earlier state, which is a mixed blessing.

I've left a note on her talk page and hopefully she'll take it more slowly and use the talk page to discuss more.

Hi . The problem is that genuine editors who point out serious content issues and impersonation (a ToU violation) on Wikipdia get blocked by corrupt Wikipedia admins like  for doing so [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMalluMalleus&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=806681844&amp;oldid=806327897 diff]. I wonder why Drmies did not ping you or inform the MEDRES board with this information that (LPSingh) is impersonating as 'Lakshmi Singh ' a student of Seth GS Medical College, Mumbai (India). In India abortion is treated as induced miscarriage (a criminal offence punishable with upto 7 years imprisonment) unless done to save the life of the woman and carried out under the treatment of a registered medical practitioner. Since a formal complaint to Govt of India has already been made in this matter consequent to the action of your administrator Drmies [https://pgportal.gov.in/ViewStatus.aspx Grievance portal of India : Complaint no.DHLTH/E/2017/06808] it remains to be seen if Wikipedia takes corrective steps.  (talk) 02:32, 28 October 2017 (UTC)
Someone makes legal threats and they get blocked. Drmies block is policy. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 02:38, 28 October 2017 (UTC)
Someone reporting a specific violation of WMF ToU and that somebody else apparently intends to sue WMF over it is not making a legal threat. The issue here is whether Drmies pinged you with this report where you are specifically named as potentially involved. BTW what steps are you taking to independently verify if LPSingh is a student of Seth GS Medical College as she claims ? 
Additionally, the reporter is a Checkuser verified [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sockpuppet_investigations/Singora/Archive sockpuppet of indeffed user Singora]. . (talk) 03:18, 28 October 2017 (UTC)
 You're talking complete bollocks. There's no violation of ToU. Who is user:LPSingh impersonating? Nobody. No editor is required to use their real name, but at least LPSingh isn't an anonymous coward like you. Have the courage to log in with your registered username, if it isn't already blocked. Your characterisation of Drmies is a clear personal attack and your IP probably need to be blocked to prevent further attacks. Nobody should be digging into other editor's personal lives, so nobody will be taking any steps to verify any personal information. It's not germane to the user's edits and your attempt to pry and doxx is certainly worthy of a block. --RexxS (talk) 03:37, 28 October 2017 (UTC)
 The  has claimed on the account's user page to be &quot;Lakshmi Singh&quot; a student of Seth GS Medixcal College, Mumbai (India). Yet her edits were those of a seasoned shill for big time pharma promoting a certain abortion regimen. The Dean of Seth GS Medical Colleg Mumbai has already confirmed (incl. to WMF Legal) that they have no such student as Lakshmi Singh, and that even if LPSingh turns out to be their student (under an alias) they do not approve of his/her actions since it is illegal and criminal under Indian law. Why is the name of Seth GS college (the #1 medical college of Mumbai) being invoked to sanctify these promotions for self-induced abortion in India at the instance of a Dutch NGO financed by HIVOS ? Seth GS Medical College has already complained to WMF Legal's Eileen H. about this episode / impersonation. Furthermore, if dangerous medical information (by a supposedly educational US registered charitable Foundation) is being published by unverifed, non-peer reviewed, anonymous people it is all the more reason for the Indian Govt. to block this website. 
 For the benefit of uninvolved editors of this project, I am summarising the Indian law on this. If  is actually a student of Seth GS Medical College (India), then she will very likely be expelled for her editing here. Or, as is more likely, LPSingh turns out to be a  impersonating ([https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1041696/ which under India law includes fictional / imaginary characters]) as a qualified [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ALPSingh&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=805651398&amp;oldid=805650677 medical professional/abortion specialist/student of OB.Gyn] etc, she is additionally punishable under section 66-D of the Information Technology Act for cheating by impersonating by using computer resource. Lastly, the tiny standard 'disclaimer' at the foot of each article means doodly squat under Indian law.  (talk) 03:51, 28 October 2017 (UTC)
 Let me see if I can get this past your inability to comprehend English: It doesn't matter who User:LPSingh claims to be. I claim to be a 65 million year-old dinosaur who survived the K-T extinction. So what? Her edits were nothing like a seasoned pharma shill – and believe me, I've seen plenty of those. Anybody looking at her edits will see that they are far more like those of a student attempting to write an essay on a topic in which they are interested. It doesn't matter what the Dean of some Indian college allegedly disapproves of; their opinion has less weight here even than yours. You're wrong on another point: the Indian government is not going to block Wikipedia on the say-so of the paranoid imaginings of some deranged stalker.
 If any uninvolved editors ever read this – which I doubt – they should understand that this is Wikipedia, not Mumbai, and Indian law has no jurisdiction here. Naturally, nobody here actually gives a shit about your warped opinion of the standard disclaimer. Hope that's clear enough this time, even for you. --RexxS (talk) 17:04, 29 October 2017 (UTC)

Queen's University Student Editing: Update

Dr. Murray posted here about a month ago about the student editing initiative at Queen's University.
Starting tomorrow (Oct 31st) the students will be adding their suggested content to the talk pages of the articles. 

I will flag all 16 articles on this talk page once the content is posted, and if anyone is interested in commenting or contributing, your expertise would be greatly appreciated.

Summary: 16 student groups will have a list of suggested changes to 16 Wikipedia articles. They will not be editing the actual article until November 15th, but are being instructed to follow the talk page and participate in the discussion. 
Note: The students will practice inserting citations using the PMID tool (in their sandboxes) before editing the talk page. 

If you have any suggestions on other ways that I can ensure this process is smooth and productive, I appreciate all feedback.

Thank you!

It's just a bare complaint about the quality of the journals being cited.  I haven't looked, and the IP doesn't specify, so I don't know whether it indicates real problems, or merely a mistaken belief that a niche journal will have the same  as a general journal.

I've blanked and turned it back into a redirect to hyperthermia therapy (which could also use a bit of love and attention).  The entire contents of oncothermia were copy-pasted by anons from the website of a company called Oncotherm, almost certainly with a promotional intent and totally undisclosed conflict of interest.

Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing

A few years back when noticing the first article I wondered if it wasn't fringe promotion.  Today it was added to the pseudoscience category which reminded me of it.  More eyes welcome, —PaleoNeonate – 16:50, 5 November 2017 (UTC)

It's now CSD tagged, but since it's PTSD related:  —PaleoNeonate – 04:54, 7 November 2017 (UTC)
At this point in the history of the treatment, the criticisms emphasized in the recent editing in both articles are fringy. This is a relatively recent change in how EMDR is viewed, and I wouldn't be surprised if the perceptions swung again after more research is published. While I've not kept up with all the discussions and editing, I believe all the substantial criticisms were published outside MEDRS date requirements, so those criticisms should be treated as minority viewpoints. --Ronz (talk) 17:21, 7 November 2017 (UTC)
yes true, sometimes perceptions swing again--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 17:49, 7 November 2017 (UTC)
Surely the categorisation as pseudoscience is inconsistent with endorsement by WHO, NICE, SAMHSA, and the other organisations listed at EMDR#Position_statements?

Addiction suppression

This article was created today.  

Is anyone willing to go through this article and do a + check?  Whatever is left following a reference check should be merged into Addiction#Research. I'd be fine with doing the merger, but I don't really feel like checking the references for MEDRS and WP:V at the moment. Seppi333 (Insert 2¢) 21:45, 31 October 2017 (UTC)
Edit: Nevermind, it's been nominated for deletion due to copyright infringement. Seppi333 (Insert 2¢) 23:32, 31 October 2017 (UTC)
This ref does not even mention the topic in question.[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763415001190?via%3Dihub] Doc James (talk ·  · ) 01:35, 1 November 2017 (UTC)
The source it is copied from is under an open license.
But the references do not say the things they are attached too. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 01:39, 1 November 2017 (UTC)
 If the articles used images that were CC-BY-SA-4.0 from the source, that would be okay. But, the text of a CC-BY-SA-4.0-copyrighted source can't be published under CC-BY-SA-3.0 if it's reproduced verbatim because CC-BY-SA-4.0 requires that the republication be licensed under CC-BY-SA-4.0. That's required by the share-alike (SA) portion of the license: [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/ &quot;ShareAlike — If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.&quot;]. All Wikipedia articles are published under CC-BY-SA-3.0, so, despite the fact that the 3.0 and 4.0 licenses having almost the same licensing terms, the non-compliance with the SA clause in that license technically is copyright infringement. That's why it was nominated for deletion for copyright infringement. Seppi333 (Insert 2¢) 01:48, 1 November 2017 (UTC)
We are moving to CC BY SA 4.0 soon. The article should be deleted because it is poorly referenced not because of copyright issues. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 01:51, 1 November 2017 (UTC)
Fair enough.  I haven't looked at the references, but it'd probably be deleted faster for copyvio than for lack of notability as an independent article. Seppi333 (Insert 2¢) 01:56, 1 November 2017 (UTC)
It is bad regardless. This route will keep it deleted longer as when WP goes CC BY SA 4.0 than the copyright reason will follow away. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 02:00, 1 November 2017 (UTC)
  The table shows CC-BY-SA 4.0 as not compatible with CC-BY-SA 3.0. However the associated footnote states &quot;&quot; The licence is backwards compatible for images, but not for text???  How much are we paying these people? --RexxS (talk) 21:46, 1 November 2017 (UTC)
The reason it's fine for images but not text is that images can be published under a 4.0 license on Wikimedia Commons as well as on Wikipedia, but, as per the [https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use/en#7._Licensing_of_Content the WMF's terms of use], all text on WP is licensed under 3.0 by default. Also, the 4.0 license is forwards compatible with the 3.0 license, but not backwards compatible; so, text published under 3.0 can be published under 4.0, but not vice versa. See https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-considerations/compatible-licenses for further information about this. Seppi333 (Insert 2¢) 01:43, 2 November 2017 (UTC)
 So the situation is that images published under a CC-BY-SA 4.0 licence on another website (e.g. Commons) are ok to include in a Wikipedia article, but text that's published under a CC-BY-SA 4.0 licence on another website is not ok to include in a Wikipedia article. Got it. Is it just me that thinks that there a teeny little bit of contradiction there? --RexxS (talk) 03:22, 2 November 2017 (UTC)
Yup that is why I would not delete it based on copyright. That copyright rule is silly. There are better reasons to delete. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 10:24, 2 November 2017 (UTC)

I don't know how commonly the  is viewed by readers, but we really need to revise/update the summaries of most of the portal's selected articles; one of those is randomly selected and transcluded onto the portal page each time the portal is viewed or the portal page is refreshed.  E.g.,  and  are examples of very noticeable problems in two of our &quot;selected article&quot; summaries. Seppi333 (Insert 2¢) 10:01, 14 November 2017 (UTC)
FWIW, we should probably only include featured medical articles on the portal page.  All the existing selected article summaries could be deleted and replaced with the &quot;&quot; (TFA) excerpt/summary for each featured medical article that appeared on the main page. The TFA summaries could be copy/pasted directly into the selected article sub-pages since the formatting/style of a TFA summary is exactly the same as a portal's &quot;selected article&quot; summary. Seppi333 (Insert 2¢) 10:10, 14 November 2017 (UTC)
On the question of popularity:  &quot;Not popular&quot; looks like a reasonable interpretation.  It's averaging 127 page views per day.  For comparison, article #1000 at  gets more than ten times that number of page views each day.  Overall, I think that portals have outlived their usefulness.
On the question of what to include:  FAs and GAs is probably reasonable and a fairly typical cutoff.  We could probably expand/update the list of DYKs as well.  Also, it's not just WPMED's articles; it should include things from other healthcare fields, such as dentistry and pharmacology.  So updates should check those as well.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:20, 14 November 2017 (UTC)
