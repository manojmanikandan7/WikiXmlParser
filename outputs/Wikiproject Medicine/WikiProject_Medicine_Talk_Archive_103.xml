This research presentation might interest some of you:  youtu.be/VR5JwqyVGSk?t=1614   (Yes, you're going to have to copy that.

Or this link [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR5JwqyVGSk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1614] Doc James (talk ·  · ) 18:28, 21 September 2017 (UTC)
Most of this is about scientists reading Wikipedia articles but not citing it.  
Two quick details that will interest editors: 
* Journals with below-median impact factors are more likely to plagiarize Wikipedia's text (but it's still very uncommon).
* Citing a scientific paper in Wikipedia does not seem to change the rate at which it's cited in the literature.  (So REFSPAM is a waste of time.)  WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:50, 21 September 2017 (UTC)
**Citing a scientific paper (or any other source, particularly if it's online) on Wikipedia does have a measurable effect on the number of readers of whatever's being cited, even if people don't go on to cite it elsewhere. (Whether this is through people directly following links from the reference section, or through links on Wikipedia being used by PageRank to push the source higher up search results, I leave as an exercise for someone who actually gets paid to investigate these things.) The spammers can rest easy in their beds. ‑ Iridescent 20:44, 21 September 2017 (UTC)
** Refspam is unfortunately not a waste of time for some folks trying to get a job, to get tenure, or to stroke their ego (Look--I'm cited in Wikipedia. I'm somebody!). See, for instance, people taking this seriously in [https://wlv.openrepository.com/wlv/bitstream/2436/609614/1/WikipediaCitations+(2).pdf Are Wikipedia Citations Important Evidence of the Impact of Scholarly Articles and Books?]. --Mark viking (talk) 20:54, 21 September 2017 (UTC)
***Two things:  First, that's what this research project found, so if you think they're they're wrong, then  can put you in touch with the researcher, and you can figure out what the data says.  Second, when you reply to a discussion with mixed list formatting, it's  followed by .  The beginning of your line needs to exactly match whatever comes before it.  Following ::* with :::* is always wrong.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 00:33, 22 September 2017 (UTC)
***: Did I say something to offend you? If so, it was not intended and please accept my apologies. I never said the study or your assertions were wrong. I think both studies probably have some truth to them. Even if WP citations don't alter literature citation rates, some people consider WP citations themselves as an adjunct to literature citations and a useful proxy for the educational or societal impact of an academic's research for the purposes of hiring, tenure, etc. Thanks for trying to fix my formatting typo, but what I intended was ::*:, as my reply was not semantically part of a bulleted list. --Mark viking (talk) 22:41, 22 September 2017 (UTC)

There is a discussion going on at WT:NOT [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_Not_a_Laboratory now] about setting up a NOTLABORATORY policy.  There is also a discussion at VPM [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_(miscellaneous)#A_science_experiment_run_on_Wikipedia_without_notification here].

These people abused their editing privileges and wasted a bunch of volunteer time, while we tried to figure out what was going on with the content they were creating.
The scientists and whoever they had doing the grunt work never talked to us.  People at the WMF apparently knew about this, and didn't say anything to us. 
Ugly shitting on the editing community and on this project all around. Jytdog (talk) 18:55, 5 October 2017 (UTC)
 Thank you for the links. I confess to not understanding the extent of the problem before reading those. Abusing AfC editors without consent is unethical, in addition to being a big waste of time. Some of the stats articles submitted were of poor quality. I'd say this deserves letters to the Pittsburgh and MIT IRBs. Maybe WMF, too. --Mark viking (talk) 19:57, 5 October 2017 (UTC)
How is following the directions in the Article Wizard, to create missing articles on highly technical scientific subjects, &quot;Abusing AfC editors&quot;?
I see a lot of emotion here (and a lot of semi-automated messages on that talk page), and I understand that the articles weren't perfect (some far from it, but what should we expect from brand-new editors?), but I don't see anything that looks like abusing AfC.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 21:36, 5 October 2017 (UTC)
Well open your eyes. Here I will paste what I put at VPM -- there was:

a) the tremendous waste of the editing community's time trying to figure out what was going on, and its time dealing with the articles (many of which were poor, and were uploaded multiple times)

b) the blowing off of the editing community by the people running the experiment.   I checked [https://tools.wmflabs.org/xtools-ec/?user=Carolineneil&amp;project=en.wikipedia.org the edit count] for , and they used a talk page exactly once back in November 2015, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AWikiProject_Chemistry&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=689984776&amp;oldid=689974697 here] at WT:CHEM, and they wrote   That is the definition of NOTHERE not to mention arrogant as hell.  If they would have taken a different approach, a bunch of the time of the editing community would not have been wasted, and their contribs would have been more productive.  (the whole section that snippet is from, is [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Chemistry/Archive_37#More_suspect_articles_by_same_editor here])

c) that per [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=802855602 this note] from User:Dario (WMF) which includes  --  the WMF was indeed aware of this.  What Dario wrote in that note is pretty different from Carolineneil wrote, but .. whatever.   Whatever was said in those &quot;extensive discussions&quot; didn't translate to any kind of respect for the editing community's time and work, nor any effort to get prior consensus, and Dario didn't communicate the information to the editing community either. 

What happened is frankly stupid and completely avoidable (and in my view, another expression of WMF staffers' apparent lack of understanding of the work the editing community does maintaining content and of the importance of consensus here).   I am hopeful that the effort to establish  will succeed, but we also need to communicate clearly to WMF what it should do with this kinds of requests, and what they should do with information they have about people's intentions.  (It kills me that the people doing the experiment tried to reach out to what they thought was someone &quot;here&quot; but it took two years, three ANIs, and the paper being published for the editing community to finally understand on its own what had been happening.  I don't know what &quot;appropriate spaces&quot; Dario advised them to post in , but we didn't know about it. Jytdog (talk) 22:10, 5 October 2017 (UTC)
Did we need to know about it?
Really.  Please think about that for a minute.  Someone who actually knows something about chemistry wrote some articles.  Sure, some of them had problems.  Some of them were things that we'd have merged to larger topics (maybe because 99.99% of know less about chemistry than the person writing the article).  But still:  an actual content expert wrote non-promotional articles about chemistry.  We don't see that very often.  So why didn't we welcome them with open arms?  Why was our instinct &quot;What kind of scam this?!&quot; instead of &quot;Finally, some chemist figured out where the 'Edit' button is on Wikipedia?&quot; 
IMO we wasted a lot of time &quot;trying to figure out what was going on&quot; solely because that's what some editors personally choose to do with their  time.  I can't find it in me to blame a subject-matter expert for our cynicism and suspicion.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 22:38, 5 October 2017 (UTC)
The three ANI threads were generated because everyday editors were not aware of the experiment and weird shit was happening, and the person implementing it wasn't given enough training to understand that dealing with other editors isn't optional.   Issues get raised because weird shit is happening, not vice versa. I am done responding to you on this. Jytdog (talk) 22:50, 5 October 2017 (UTC)
 The real tragedy is that much potentially useful content was written by subject experts and lost because the subject experts had almost no skills in Wikipedia editing. I find it astonishing that Dario Taraborelli didn't direct them to WikiProject Chemistry, or to any experienced Wikipedia editor who could spend some time teaching them how to use talk pages and explaining that editing Wikipedia is a holistic process requiring more than just subject expertise. What a shame. --RexxS (talk) 22:58, 5 October 2017 (UTC)
I agree with you:  It's a shame that we were given content on missing chemistry subjects, and we're rejecting it, deleting it, and even demonizing subject-matter experts who tried to fill the gaps in the encyclopedia.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:28, 6 October 2017 (UTC)
 It wasn't just chemistry; there was a parallel set of articles developed on econometrics that they abandoned part-way through. Sadly, I don't see any alternative to rejecting and deleting contributions and criticising contributors when they simply fail to take any steps to familiarise themselves with the context in which they intend to do their research. It's like folks going into a foreign country to do some work and expecting the culture and conventions to fit their preconceptions, then wondering why they end up being deported. --RexxS (talk) 18:50, 6 October 2017 (UTC)

 Yes, we did need to know about it. Two reasons: (1) Articles were posted under false pretenses using a fake account. Academic projects don't get a free pass for violating TOS. (2) AfC is a collaborative process. AfC editors donate their time to help out new editors learn WP editing and get up to speed. That teaching process is two-way. This project subverted that by using AfC editors as some sort of fire and forget, Mehanical Turk QC process to give a &quot;mainspace&quot;rubber stamp to their articles. No wants to put effort into reviewing and teaching, only to be completely ignored. It was clear abuse of AfC editors under false pretenses. --Mark viking (talk) 23:03, 5 October 2017 (UTC)
I don't think that I can agree that writing an article about advanced chemistry and posting it under your real names is posting &quot;under false pretenses using a fake account&quot;.  They should have used separate accounts because of our  policy (which almost nobody knows about except us highly experienced editors), but &quot;User:Carolineneil&quot; can't be considered a fake name when the people operating it are actually named Caroline and Neil.   WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:12, 6 October 2017 (UTC)

Break
 Hey folks, I'm Halfak (WMF), but I'm wearing my volunteer hat right now because supporting other researchers like Carolineneil is not something I do in a staff capacity.  I had to use my email archive to jog my memory of what happened here.  I was hardly involved.  Based on those emails, it seems Dario was even less involved.  These researchers were acting entirely independently of the WMF Research Team and contrary to the advice I'd supplied in my volunteer time.  
 At any given moment in time, I'm advising 5-10 research projects taking place around Wikipedia/Wikidata/etc.  I did talk to Caroline and Neil about their study.  I requested them to publicly describe their project and goals.  They produced  and then did not respond to any of the concerns raised on the talk page.  I repeatedly requested that they respond to these concerns via email and to follow the advice of editors at AFC who were strongly advising them to slow down.  Once they stopped emailing me requesting that I solve their problems for them, I lost track of the project.  I'm surprised to now find that they had been continuing their activities and not responding to warnings.  I think that blocking the researchers was the right call and I regret that had not happened sooner.  At the time, I suppose it seemed to me that Wikipedia's quality control system was tracking their activities and supplying the right warnings (which usually lead to a block if the behavior doesn't stop) so I saw no cause to raise a parallel alarm.  Honestly I expect that researchers will generally stop before they cause such an obvious problem.
 Process-wise, I have no authority over independent researchers, but I have been pushing for a more formalized process for approving research projects on-wiki.  Usually I meet resistance from people who feel that the proposed processes are too restrictive and those who think they aren't enough (like Jytdog).  Regretfully, these two groups don't work out their differences and I don't have the time or energy to fight both sides.  See , , and  for examples of my past efforts on English Wikipedia (usually researchers are most disruptive in their recruitment strategies -- everyone wants to ask the top editors why they edit for some reason).  Because these process proposals have failed, I've largely just been trying to advise researchers when they show up.  Happily, many Wikipedians know me for doing this work, so researchers often get routed to me.  Roughly here's what I suggest researchers do: (1) talk to me and let me shoot down things that obviously won't work, (2) create a project description page on meta (using  -- note the focus on ethics, policies, and data privacy), and then (3) reach out to the communities that will be affected (e.g. AfC would have been a good one here) and don't proceed without either consensus or indifference WRT the proposed activities.  In my experience, this almost always proceeds just fine.  So I've given up on formal review processed for studies.  But, Jytdog, if you wanted to pick that effort back up, I'd support you!  In the meantime, I'm always looking for help reviewing and raising potential issues WRT researchers' proposed projects.  I'd be very happy to have a hand with that.
 In the end, I agree with WhatamIdoing.  These researchers were not doing anything that was obviously harmful to the encyclopedia. Their primary mistake is not engaging with editors in the process of their work.  I regret that this was the case, but it doesn't seem like much damage was done here.  After all, if more damage were being done, I'm sure they would have been blocked sooner. --EpochFail (talk • ) 23:07, 5 October 2017 (UTC)
 Thanks for your reply and for providing all that background!  I've watchlisted those.  I do view volunteer hours wasted as a bad thing; those hours are gone and are not coming back.  The frustrating thing here is that there is no place where User:Carolineneil connected what she (if it was a woman and one person) connected their account to the project posted at meta.  Even if you had given notice of the proposed project at WT:CHEM, they couldn't have connected what the account was doing to the &quot;experiment&quot;. Not good.  At minimum the relevant project should be notified of what is happening so they can object.  I don't know if that is processed-to-death  Jytdog (talk) 23:39, 5 October 2017 (UTC)
I cannot view the hours spent reviewing new articles on academic subjects as &quot;wasted&quot;.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:12, 6 October 2017 (UTC)
I know that you cannot see the problem here. Jytdog (talk) 17:30, 6 October 2017 (UTC)
  I am with WAID but I am also becoming increasingly disillusioned with ref spam, in no small part because of the reproducibility crisis in biomedical sciences.  One can learn a lot by reading self serving primary sources and tracking down good secondary to replace the primary sources, but this is more often than not a futile effort that rapidly leads to editor burnout.  What I feel is lacking is a pithy explanation that will immediately be understood by researchers and does not rely on references to arcane Wikipedia policy.  is a good start, but IMHO, it is too general.  We need something specifically targeted towards researchers that is really pithy that starts with something like:  Boghog (talk) 19:18, 6 October 2017 (UTC)

Ethics guidelines
If experimenting on Wikipedia (not just using data from Wikipedia) is currently allowed, should we have ethics guidelines? Something along the lines of:
* In order not to violate community rules or norms, become an editor and learn the culture of the community before starting.
* Consult with and gain the consent of the community before beginning. Wikimedia employees are analogous to civil servants; consulting with them is not equivalent to consulting with the community.
* Methodology that interferes with the main goals of the encyclopedia is unlikely to get consent. Please avoid interfering with the work of others, including by wasting volunteer time.
* Here is a catalogue of past mistakes to avoid.

User Jytdog removed my add arguing promotional abuse policy.

He says that showing these persons worked on field X on date Y doesn't means they were the first to do it. Thats ok, but I can not do nothing to prove they were the first. All the CAR-T community recognize them as the inventors and there is no earlyer publication about it.

Welcome to Wikipedia, .  You may be interested in , which was written for scientists to explain some of the weirdness here.  One of the quirks about sourcing a Wikipedia article is that, unlike most journals, we actually don't want to &quot;credit&quot; the first authors/papers by citing those papers directly.  A recent review article is always considered &quot;better&quot; than the original paper.  So, for example, if you go through the list of articles that cite this article and find a review article such as , and if that review article (which I haven't read) happens to say that this was the first paper, then you're set, and it's just a matter of swapping out the citation.  But if there aren't any sources (including textbooks; it doesn't have to be just peer-reviewed journal articles) that actually say something like &quot;the first&quot;, then it's harder.  I believe that some editors have actually resorted to begging their scientific friends to please write down the things that &quot;all the community recognize&quot; in their next papers, just to get past the occasional dispute like this.

Circumcision prevalence map

This map, used on the circumcision page, gives prevalence categories of 0-20%, 20-80%, and 80-100%. That middle 20-80% is kinda useless and conceals the fact, for example, its prevalence in the US, at 75%, is far higher than in Canada at 30%. Could someone good at maps update it so there are shadings for 20-40%, 40-60%, and 60-80%? This would make the map more useful, and less misleading.

Thoughts about tone

I read this interesting story recently: 

This part stood out to me as having particular relevance to Wikipedia editors:

She found the evidence she needed to jump most easily in Trick or Treatment. “What Ernst and Singh were able to do so beautifully was provide information that felt nonjudgmental,” Hermes says. “I didn’t feel like I was being put down for having used naturopathy or having been a naturopath.”

“Everything I had read prior to Trick or Treatment about naturopathy from a critic’s perspective was written in such a way that it was impossible for me to digest the information,” she says. “As soon as I read the word ‘quack’ or ‘pseudoscience’ I couldn’t get anything from the article.”

The book’s matter-of-fact approach to debunking naturopathy influenced Hermes’s thinking on naturopathy.


I know that some editors here are motivated by the idea of debunking pseudoscience and other forms of stupid.  I'm with you.  But I think our zealousness for the cause of evidence and science sometimes makes us less effective at actually educating readers.  We sometimes stray away from an encyclopedic, matter-of-fact approach to subjects, and instead start preaching to the choir – because, as Hermes says, only the choir is going to listen once we've passed a certain point.  The article stops being about educating readers, and starts being about signalling to other true believers that we, too, are right-thinking science believers who deeply despise whatever nonsense is being passed around this week.  Any source is good enough, as long as it lets me label this nonsense with certain words or phrases that lets the other right-thinking believers in Science know that I'm one of them.  No source can possibly be good enough to justify mentioning this traditional remedy, because I don't want anyone to even know that it exists (which is kind of scary, when you think about how many healthcare workers rely on Wikipedia for finding out what their patients have been doing).

Ernst and Singh's book never uses the word pseudoscience, and uses the word pseudoscientific only twice: 
* &quot;Sometimes the explanations in alternative medicine contain pseudo-scientific jargon, such as a London-based healing clinic which uses phrases such as 'the client's electromagnetic circuitry' and 'defragmentate the body'. This jargon may be impressive to a non-specialist, but it is scientifically meaningless.&quot; 
* &quot;On closer inspection, those with a scientific background can easily see their pseudo-scientific nature (i.e. the jargon is gobbledygook).&quot;

Their use of &quot;quacks&quot; is more frequent (but still less than once per 20 pages), but they tend to attribute it to others rather than claiming it as their own opinion:  &quot;The split between straights and mixers soon became bitter, with straights accusing mixers of betraying the chiropractic movement, and mixers accusing straights of being quacks&quot; or &quot;This chapter will look at the evidence and reveal whether homeopathy is a medical marvel or whether the critics are correct when they label it a quack medicine.&quot;

We know that these authors are both expert sources on the subject of alternative medicine, and both firmly opposed to nonsense, but they found a way to communicate that information without relying on words that prevented their audience from dismissing their information as merely the work of biased haters.  Their approach seems to have worked spectacularly well.

Keeping the goal of educating readers in mind – that's why Wikipedia exists – I'm thinking that scientifically minded people are not necessarily the most important part of our audience, and that people who are favorably disposed towards these subjects might be.  If we want to educate them, rather than annoy them (and maybe trigger the backfire effect), maybe we need to think about emulating Ernst and Singh by adopting a less judgmental tone.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 21:55, 14 October 2017 (UTC)
yes WAID good point--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 23:01, 14 October 2017 (UTC)
Yes, but without any examples I think it's a non-problem here - so far as I recall, Wikipedia never straight out asserts something is &quot;quackery&quot; but might mention that's how it has been viewed (and even this causes a shit storm with the woo defenders). I like the way E&amp;S can be forthright saying e.g. that detox &quot;is a scam&quot;. More of that plain speaking would be good here. Ernst is of course generally loathed by the alt-med types he debunks - just read his site comments to see that - but as Upton Sinclair said, &quot;It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it!&quot; Alexbrn (talk) 03:12, 15 October 2017 (UTC)
Quackery is linked in more than 600 articles.  Pseudoscience is linked in more than 1,700 articles, including, since you asked for an example the third sentence of Acupuncture.  To give you an idea of an alternative approach, Singh and Ernst describe acupuncture in that book as &quot;A potentially valuable technique&quot; before very gently leading the reader, over about 40 pages, to the conclusion that acupuncture, though based on a &quot;deeply flawed&quot; idea of chi and meridians, is best described as a strong placebo, although it might have some small benefit for a few people with pain and nausea.  I'm thinking:  If Ernst and Singh decline to use the word pseudoscience to describe acupuncture, do you really think that we really need to be using that word in the third sentence?  Or, more generally, to use those words in more than two thousand articles?
As for your favorite Sinclair quotation, I don't think that any of the regulars here has a salary that depends upon believing in pseudoscience or quackery.  It's also my experience that Sinclair knew something about holding his audience's attention long enough to convince them of the rightness of his views, which appears to be (a) what Ernst and Singh managed to do and (b) what we're frequently failing to do on this point.  
Consider what Hermes said:  when she looked for evidence-based sources about naturopathy, she was unable to get past the insulting language of &quot;pseudoscience&quot; and &quot;quackery&quot; to see what the sources said.  That would have applied to the Wikipedia article on her former profession, too, since it begins:  .  She would have stopped reading right there, at the first sentence, and written Wikipedia off as a biased, worthless source.  We know that she's not the only person sympathetic to ineffective treatments who feels this way.  Is that the outcome that we want?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 05:24, 15 October 2017 (UTC)
Trick or Treatment is an amazing book. Interesting bit was that Singh was sued for libel over it. This is why Wikipedia could never survive in the UK, Canada, or Australia. The US still has stronger freedom of speech than many other countries. Agree homeopathy is alt med first and pseudoscience second so that can go a little later. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 06:24, 15 October 2017 (UTC)
(I believe Singh was actually sued for what he wrote in a Guardian column shortly after publication of Trick or Treatment.  See British Chiropractic Association v Singh.  Agree that it's an awesome book, though. Adrian J. Hunter(talk•) 06:53, 15 October 2017 (UTC) )

*  requires us to be up-front about the pseudoscientific aspect of pseudoscientific topics, so suggesting we downplay that as a kind of missionary tactic to win converts round stands policy on its head. That said, there is prominent and over-prominent: our homeopathy and acupuncture articles get it right IMO; but cramming &quot;pseudoscientific&quot; into the first few words of an article over-eggs it. Alexbrn (talk) 18:21, 15 October 2017 (UTC)
**Not downplay, just I am not sure the most key fact about every pseudoscientific idea is that it is pseudoscience. Sometimes it should go later in the lead rather than the first sentence.

***Agreed: the designation should be prominent, but not over-prominent. Alexbrn (talk) 13:09, 16 October 2017 (UTC)
* I would just like to answer to the following: : my impression is that no matter how decorated and gentle we would say it, some proponents or COI editors would still regularly try to remove or question the information since Wikipedia is not a printed book they can't alter... another aspect is that a lead should be short yet still reflect the article content (including such important points), since articles are not large books.  —PaleoNeonate – 20:07, 15 October 2017 (UTC)
** Sure, but do we have to use these specific words to do that?  Couldn't we sometimes accurately communicate the important facts with a more dispassionate tone, like &quot;The theoretical basis is a dream the founder had after eating a bowl of chili in 1967&quot; or &quot;Despite the claims of the manufacturer, independent research indicates that it is an expensive placebo&quot; rather than &quot;This is pseudoscience&quot;?

*****I think that policy is being over-interpreted.  Maybe we should change the policy to say that we shouldn't say &quot;pseudoscience&quot; when we mean &quot;bad science&quot;, for example, even if some blog writers (and we're often relying on them for the more obscure subjects) confuse the two concepts.  Maybe we should change the policy to say &quot;If you're writing about Time Machine, then label it as pseudoscience, because that's DUE weight, but if a majority of critics use other language, then use the language that most critics use.&quot;  Or even, &quot;You can 'clearly describe' something as pseudoscience without using that exact word, and you can 'clearly describe' something as pseudoscience without using that word anywhere in the lead, and, in fact, you should do that whenever the main point of the article is 'he made a billion dollars by marketing a product' instead of 'here's a scientific-sounding concept'.&quot;  WhatamIdoing (talk) 15:17, 16 October 2017 (UTC)

Fad diet
Related point:  We should probably think about Fad diet as another potentially problematic set of 'fighting words'.  I see that Low-carb diet is listed as an example on that page.  Classifying that as a &quot;fad diet&quot; with no proven benefits would doubtless surprise the many healthcare providers who routinely recommend it to Type 1 diabetics, for whom a low-carb (or even somewhat-lower-carb) diet results is widely agreed to provide significant improvements in control, and as an option that benefits most Type 2 diabetics.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 15:28, 16 October 2017 (UTC)
Perhaps a contextualized entry (&quot;low carb diet is often a fad diet, except in the case of diabetes&quot; yadda yadda) might help? Akin to Arago hotspot's list although that one does not deal with medicine. Jo-Jo Eumerus (talk, ) 15:40, 16 October 2017 (UTC)
Yes indeed. What WAID neglected to mention was that in the Low-carbohydrate diet we say &quot;Used for weight loss, low-carbohydrate diets are classified as fad diets&quot; [my bold] and the &quot;with no proven benefit&quot; is pure invention. Alexbrn (talk) 16:39, 16 October 2017 (UTC)
I think that &quot;no proven benefits&quot; is a fair summary of the lead sentence for Fad diet, which defines it as any diet that makes &quot;promises of weight loss or other health advantages such as longer life without backing by solid science&quot;.  If we've got proven benefits (whether weight loss or other health advantages), then it's not a &quot;fad diet&quot; according to the definition given in the lead of the article.  The Fad diet article lists low-carb diets as a fad diet without any qualification, despite the linked article indicating that both weight loss [for anyone who follows it, although not necessarily more weight loss than other people get on other calorie-cutting diets] and scientifically proven health advantages [for some people, e.g., Type 1 diabetics] are reasonably expected outcomes for people who follow the diet.    
I'm thinking that the Fad diet article needs some attention, and perhaps a more workable definition that &quot;A fad diet is any diet that promises weight loss&quot; and then contradicts itself by listings diets that actually do result in weight loss (i.e., by cutting calories).  I'm also thinking that for all of the other diet-related articles, we might want to be a little slower to slap a derogatory label on it.  It's important to explain specific problems (e.g., the candy bar diet is obviously unhealthful, even if you lose weight on it; low-carb diets can cause higher total cholesterol).  WhatamIdoing (talk) 03:44, 17 October 2017 (UTC)
One of the many issues with fad diets is that they don't result in sustained weight loss or sustained health.  People like Marion Nestle are very consistent in discussing this.  If you haven't read it  is very good too. Jytdog (talk) 03:59, 17 October 2017 (UTC)
It's my impression that no temporary dietary change, regardless of whether that diet is the latest celebrity fad, or a &quot;healthy balanced diet&quot;, or the diet recommended for patients who have undergone bariatric surgery, produces sustained weight loss.  Bariatric surgery is renowned for long-term weight success, but that's due to surgery plus lifelong, highly restrictive dietary changes and exercise, not a one-time permanent cure.  People who get the surgery and skip the diet and exercise don't lose much weight, and many more follow the care plan, lose the weight, and then gain it right back when they stop the diet.  The fact that weight regain happens when you stop following a weight loss diet doesn't make it a fad diet.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 03:37, 18 October 2017 (UTC)

Roxy, I don't think that it could be classified until more information is known.  Also, malpractice ought to be on your list.  I assume, for example, that identifying dangerous situations such as compression fractures is considered normal standard of care for chiropractors.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 03:56, 17 October 2017 (UTC)
 ... which brings us back full circle to Edzard Ernst, who has commented on the incident: &quot;In my view, nobody should have this treatment and certainly not elderly people&quot; (he's quoted in the Daily Mail so I won't link it). Chiropractic is known quackery, based on pseudoscientific concepts, and is known to carry certain risks. Alexbrn (talk) 09:28, 17 October 2017 (UTC)
diet content is one of the places where we get the most fierce advocacy, both devotees and people shilling them.  all of these are just geldmacherei and almost none have real evidence. the healthy diet that mainstream nutritionists and medical bodies describe is not that complicated and these various diets are only decent to the extent they fall in line with the healthy diet anyway. Jytdog (talk) 18:46, 16 October 2017 (UTC)
I don't think that slapping a &quot;fad diet&quot; label on all of these articles is really helping that situation, though.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 03:56, 17 October 2017 (UTC)
We should be nice and clear about categorizing fad diets as such, and explain in more detail why they're dodgy; it's not an either/or. The NHS provide a lot of useful lay-oriented source material for this e.g.[http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/loseweight/Pages/how-to-diet.aspx] (Add: and on reviewing this I see we weren't being clear that the Dukan Diet is a fad diet: now fixed!) Alexbrn (talk) 08:03, 17 October 2017 (UTC)
I've been thinking about this, and I think we've seriously over-medicalized the fad diet/crash diet.  According to the lead (re-written a year or two by some WPMEDders to totally change its meaning), a fad diet is any diet not proven by science to cause permanent weight loss or other health benefits.  Now, presumably deliberate weight gain (e.g., body builders who want to bulk up) is being classified as a &quot;health benefit&quot;, even though it isn't really, but I still think that definition is missing the whole point.  AFAICT from mainstream media, fad diets exist so that you (well, not 80% of you, because most of you here are male) can find out on Monday that your ex-boyfriend will be bringing his new girlfriend to a party on Saturday, and you can temporarily lose just enough weight to fit into your little black dress or feel more confident.  It really has nothing to do with long-term weight loss; it is all about temporary loss.  In that sense, it really doesn't matter if the weight loss is purely water (especially if your dress doesn't fit because of Premenstrual water retention) or that it'll all be gained back next week.  The point is a short-term perceived benefit through a starvation diet.  Nobody actually expects to spend the rest of her life on the cabbage soup diet.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:01, 24 October 2017 (UTC)
A temporary diet, that is? Jo-Jo Eumerus (talk, ) 16:14, 24 October 2017 (UTC)
As temporary as any other fad, I think.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:45, 24 October 2017 (UTC)
WAID, I see you've made Crash diet [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Crash_diet&amp;action=history into] a redirect to Fad diet, which is probably for the best. However, no, fad dieting is definitely not &quot;as temporary&quot; as other fads. The specific brand of magic being touted changes often, but the line of magicians stretches to the horizon, each bearing the answer everyone's been waiting for all these years. With entire industries (fashion, diet foods, diet books, private gymns, personal trainers, rapid workout machines, social media, etc.) all busy bringing their persuasive efforts to monetize the yo-yo cycle, that line isn't going away any time soon. &quot;Buy my products: you'll lose weight/feel better/look better/impress your lover(s) ... Oh, the weight's back? You must have developed tolerance, try this one instead.... Aww, you've gained even more? You should read about the ice-cream diet...&quot; The con never ends.LeadSongDog come howl! 20:17, 24 October 2017 (UTC)
Sure, the list of fads never ends, no matter whether you're talking about diets, toys, gadgets, clothes, or anything else.  But switching from one fad (diet/toy/gadget) to the next fad (diet/toy/gadget) to the next fad (diet/toy/gadget) is the opposite of one thing that you stick to for life.  Each of the fad diets is expected to be temporary.
I've put some representative definitions of fad diet up at .  Most of them talk use language like &quot;short-term quick fixes&quot; or &quot;very restrictive diet with few foods or an unusual combination of foods for a short period of time&quot; or &quot;Fad diets are really low calorie diets&quot;.  I didn't find any that said things like &quot;any diet with bad science behind it is a fad diet&quot;.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:18, 25 October 2017 (UTC)

infobox medical condition (new) October 2017

I am not digging this new template.  It draws the addition of unsourced edits and in my view is just more work.  We already summarize everything in the lead, and now we have to summarize in a second place and maintain that as well.   

What is the advantage of this new infobox, with all this detail? Jytdog (talk) 16:42, 22 October 2017 (UTC)
I have not found the effort to be much greater than keeping unsourced details out of the lead or body of the article. 
It is point form human understandable details. IMO it is better than what we had their before. The change has been discussed over many years (you can find this in the archives).
An additional effort will be to move the items to Wikidata eventually so that such point for info can more easily be created in other languages. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 16:51, 22 October 2017 (UTC)
Am aware of prior discussion and i should not have asked so generally about the advantages.  In my experience these are a pain in the butt, actually living with them now. I am interested to hear how others are experiencing them with regard to maintenance. Jytdog (talk) 17:14, 22 October 2017 (UTC)
In what way? Doc James (talk ·  · ) 18:21, 22 October 2017 (UTC)
The fields become new areas of contestation like at Schizophrenia and Naegleriasis.  We end up taking up our time dealing with arguments over this completely redundant summary. There is so much work to do already. Jytdog (talk) 19:18, 22 October 2017 (UTC)
I am pushing to keep these properly referenced. I plan to get around to updating Naegleriasis eventually. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 18:54, 23 October 2017 (UTC)
The only conversation about the infobox at  suggests that part of the problem is that one parameter says &quot;similar conditions&quot; but links to &quot;differential diagnosis&quot;.  Substance abuse is a perfectly reasonable differential diagnosis, but &quot;I accidentally took too many of my properly prescribed drugs and ended up with an unlucky reaction that looks like schizophrenia&quot; (to name one innocent example covered by substance-induced psychosis) is not the same thing as &quot;my brain doesn't have typical wiring&quot;. 
IMO we need to decide whether we mean &quot;medical conditions that are actually related to this one&quot; or &quot;medical conditions with similar symptoms, even if there's no connection at all between the diseases&quot;, and then fix the label to match whatever we decided.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 19:11, 23 October 2017 (UTC)
It used to say &quot;differential diagnosis&quot;. Someone than requested it be simplified to &quot;similar conditions&quot; so I simplified it. Happy to re open this discussion if people have other wording they think would be better. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 19:30, 23 October 2017 (UTC)
First, if you aren't sure what Jytdog is talking about, then see .
In my experience, there's very little need to summarize in a &quot;second place&quot;, because the ones that I encounter don't seem to use the Wikidata option at all (e.g., Arthritis, Autism, Cretinism, Down syndrome, Leukemia, Major depressive disorder...).  WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:19, 22 October 2017 (UTC)
What do you mean by &quot;use the Wikidata option at all&quot;? Wikidata does not contain this information. Wikipedia contains the information. The plan is to use WP to add to WD not the other way around. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 18:20, 22 October 2017 (UTC)
I assume that Jytdog's complaint (i.e., &quot;now we have to summarize in a second place and maintain that as well&quot;) is related to the presence of the [Edit on Wikidata] button rather than the presence of, e.g.,  in the wikitext for the Arthritis article.  Perhaps I'm wrong.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 19:14, 22 October 2017 (UTC)
We have no plans to use Wikidata to any greater extent within this template. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 18:55, 23 October 2017 (UTC)
 your assumption is incorrect.  My concern is plainly said - namely the redundancy.  The real work is building and maintaining high quality, well-sourced content in the body of the article (there is SO MUCH work to do there).  There is then subsequent work to summarize the body in the LEAD.  Now we have additional subsidiary work to summarize in a second place, in a different more pixelated way, and now we get new arguments about that summary, as well as people coming by and just dumping shit in there (probably because infoboxes in so many articles contain unsourced &quot;claims&quot;).   I am not seeing the value for the time that this new infobox takes to maintain much less populate in the first place. Jytdog (talk) 19:33, 23 October 2017 (UTC)
*See a summary of previous discussion at . In my opinion, setting good rules for the infoboxes is one of WikiProject Medicine's more significant and controversial challenges. I think there are powerful arguments in support and in opposition to changes. I feel that both support and opposition should make compromises. It is difficult for me to say who should compromise what. Jytdog started this conversation thread, so I will confirm their concern and criticism that the use of Wikidata in infoboxes does impair quality control, increase risk of vandalism, disrupt the established review process, create a power vacuum where uncertain players can gain control of article content, and make an uncertain future for traditional Wikipedia editing. The most certain opinion that I can add to the situation is that I feel that the conversation is becoming complex and that eventually I think we need a list of pros / cons / costs / benefits and some drawn boundaries about what can change experimentally, permanently, or not at all. It is difficult to enter this conversation in a haphazard way. Choosing to change, choosing to not change, or avoiding the choice seem like all the possible options and none of those seem entirely attractive to me.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 17:20, 23 October 2017 (UTC)
Before I will support any further usage of WD within WP I require the ability to watchlist ****ONLY**** the items used within WP. For all the pro WD folks this ****DOES NOT MEAN**** the ability to watchlist the entire property (yes yes I know this already exists but it overruns my watchlist with stuff I do not care about and thus is useless to me). I have been requesting this for years and I continue to wait.
I however do not think this is the concern that Jyt is raising. I think his issue is simple having a brief summary to add to all the other stuff we need to keep an eye on. The new box has been rolled out to more than 500 articles, all of which I keep an eye on and issues have only occurred in a couple. That I would say is a low level of issues.

Almost funny, Universal blood
I'm not sure if I'm understanding this correctly:

This can't possibly be true. Barbara (WVS) ✐  13:50, 27 October 2017 (UTC)

Yep, that entire article is problematic. The parts that are reality-based are mostly too poorly described to be comprehensible; the parts referring to Andre Gernez are just...wrong.

There is a bit of science there (&quot;universal blood donors&quot; and &quot;the problem of making blood that can be transfused to anyone without the problems of immunological incompatibility&quot;) but it's buried deep. Jo-Jo Eumerus (talk, ) 15:33, 27 October 2017 (UTC)
 Redirected to Blood type#Universal donors and universal recipients which explains the concept of &quot;O negative&quot; without all the woo. There's theoretically a viable article to be written about the concept of synthetic blood, or converting existing blood to O negative so it can be used more widely, but this gibberish wasn't it. ‑ Iridescent 15:35, 27 October 2017 (UTC)

(ec) There's a couple of different flavors of &quot;universal blood&quot; that the article tries (more or less badly) to describe.  One involves various strategies to modify normal human blood to prevent it from provoking an immune response when given to an ABO-type mismatched recipient.  This so-called &quot;universal&quot; blood is normal blood that has been processed to either remove or render inaccessible the A and B surface antigens.  (Another approach is to generate blood cells from scratch, entirely in vitro, by growing and differentiating stem cells in the lab.)  There's a bit of overlap with the scope of blood substitute. 
The other, quackier flavor is the first paragraph, which is a total mess.  I think what they're trying to suggest is that using a suitable magic spray (applied during infancy) one can train one's immune system to tolerate non-ABO-matched blood (and improve rates of organ transplant success, and reduce allergies, and so forth); the recipient of this treatment will have &quot;universal blood&quot; that is compatible with everything.  Ahem.  As near as I can tell, this is based on a misunderstanding, mispresentation, or wildly unwarranted speculation rooted in the fact that infants often tolerate non-ABO-matched transplant organs with little rejection.  (Loosely speaking, the immature immune system hasn't nailed down the self/non-self distinction very firmly.)
I'd say the first category of stuff is broadly worth covering.  We need to be watchful for overoptimisitc, promotional biotech assertions about how these blood products are revolutionary and just around the corner, though.  The second category is just junk.  There is plenty that's worth writing about how the early immune system adapts to foreign tissue, or how adult immune responses might be modulated by early exposure to antigens—but there's nothing here that will help accomplish that.  In both cases, it's possible that all the material would be better presented in the context of another existing article.  TenOfAllTrades(talk) 16:07, 27 October 2017 (UTC)

Large amounts of the added content are off topic. It has the look of cut&amp;paste from a term paper or may be plagiarized. I reverted the edit and asked 3trist to visit the Talk page to make a case for adding it to the article . --Zefr (talk) 03:44, 27 October 2017 (UTC)
Assuming that it wasn't copy-pasted from elsewhere, it appeared essay-like with too much repetition.  It otherwise was pretty good.  There were some brand names mentioned which might have appeared promotional, but it was then followed by no conclusive evidence mentions, etc.  If it's not plagiarism and is to be restored, it should probably be shortened.  —PaleoNeonate – 16:07, 27 October 2017 (UTC)

 I agree with the sentiments above, but I'd like us to address this question: &quot;Is the version of the article after 3trist's edit an improvement on what was before?&quot; Because, barring a copyvio, we usually benefit more by cleaning up and copyediting these sort of contributions than simply rejecting them. Having something to work with is surely better than having nothing, particularly in an article that has had no substantial content added (and kept) since 5 May 2012. --RexxS (talk) 22:40, 27 October 2017 (UTC)
 Post script:  has very helpfully engaged with  at . Kudos to 3trist for going to the talk page, and for Zefr for being so helpful. This is how we'll create our next generation of medical editors. Hopefully some more of us will keep an eye on the article. --RexxS (talk) 22:58, 27 October 2017 (UTC)
There is no copyvio, according to an admin, but the edit by 3trist was an excerpt from a class assignment, as described in the Talk discussion. I requested a trimmed-down version that is more on-topic for &quot;lifestyle&quot; as opposed to workplace behavior which was 80% of the edit. There are few solid MEDRS sources for this topic. --Zefr (talk) 23:08, 27 October 2017 (UTC)

Synonyms

Is &quot;low-trauma fracture&quot; always a synonym for pathologic fracture?  Could a redirect between these two terms be accurate?  Are there any medical dictionaries that MEDRS might be able to recommend?  -- (talk) 01:21, 15 October 2017 (UTC)
I don't think it's the same thing.  You might be interested in  or  (lists non-osteoporosis causes, including drugs, which do not appear to be considered pathologic fractures).  [https://academic.oup.com/rheumatology/article/44/1/138/1784820/Does-a-patient-focused-approach-increase This 2005 piece] provides a definition:  &quot;Low-trauma fracture was defined as a fracture resulting from a fall from a standing position or lower.&quot;  The definition suggests that it can't be considered a synonym of pathologic fractures, as there's always going to be the odd case of bad luck/landing badly.  Toddlers sometimes break their collar bones by rolling out of bed, and that's likely to count as &quot;from a standing position or lower&quot; and unlikely to be associated with any disease process.
I'm not absolutely certain how a stress fracture fits into this system, but it can suddenly go from a minor hairline problem to a complete break – and if that happens in one of the bones that you use for standing, then falling down would not be an unreasonable outcome.  Which reminds me of a view of hip fractures that I heard decades ago from an EMT:  when you find an elderly woman on the ground, and her hip is broken, it's hard to tell whether she fell down and broke her hip, or if her hip broke, so she fell down.
 is also interesting:  obesity has long been considered to protect against osteoporosis (the assumed cause of pathologic fractures unless another process is known), but it may be more accurate to say that obese women break their upper arms rather than their wrists.  The cause(s) seemed to be unknown, but I assume that &quot;because when you have that much weight land on your 80-year-old humerus, it might crack even if the bone seemed just fine until then&quot; is among the causes being considered.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 06:11, 15 October 2017 (UTC)

Thank you for your detailed response.  I've also come across &quot;fragility fractures&quot; in my readings, apparently discussing similar concepts which does redirect to pathological fractures, so I wasn't sure.  The last thing I want to do is to create a synonym where none exists.  I'll have to have a read - maybe low-trauma fractures should be mentioned at Bone fracture.  -- (talk) 07:07, 15 October 2017 (UTC)

Hello, a source called Pizzo  is used 10 times in Water fluoridation and its usage has been discussed on the talk page .

  Self-induced abortion and Medical abortion articles

Eyes are needed at  and . Socking and poor sourcing has been going at these articles. See, for example, .  is now involved, and Jim1138 has been handling all of this by his lonesome. Flyer22 Reborn (talk) 23:07, 25 October 2017 (UTC)

And [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Medical_abortion&amp;diff=806654124&amp;oldid=804682622 here] we have  calling LPSingh a sock when ModiBhakt786 is also clearly a sock. Just a big mess. Flyer22 Reborn (talk) 23:14, 25 October 2017 (UTC)

 The articles now seem to have been restored to an earlier state, which is a mixed blessing. I think that  has made the mistake of trying to do too much in too short a time, but seems genuinely interested in improving the topics (even if I wouldn't necessarily agree with her emphasis at each point). I've left a note on her talk page and hopefully she'll take it more slowly and use the talk page to discuss more. Obviously the more editors who can find time to engage on those articles, the more chance they will be updated and improved. --RexxS (talk) 00:48, 26 October 2017 (UTC)

Hi . The problem is that genuine editors who point out serious content issues and impersonation (a ToU violation) on Wikipdia get blocked by corrupt Wikipedia admins like  for doing so [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMalluMalleus&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=806681844&amp;oldid=806327897 diff]. I wonder why Drmies did not ping you or inform the MEDRES board with this information that (LPSingh) is impersonating as 'Lakshmi Singh ' a student of Seth GS Medical College, Mumbai (India). In India abortion is treated as induced miscarriage (a criminal offence punishable with upto 7 years imprisonment) unless done to save the life of the woman and carried out under the treatment of a registered medical practitioner. Since a formal complaint to Govt of India has already been made in this matter consequent to the action of your administrator Drmies [https://pgportal.gov.in/ViewStatus.aspx Grievance portal of India : Complaint no.DHLTH/E/2017/06808] it remains to be seen if Wikipedia takes corrective steps.  (talk) 02:32, 28 October 2017 (UTC)
Someone makes legal threats and they get blocked. Drmies block is policy. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 02:38, 28 October 2017 (UTC)
Someone reporting a specific violation of WMF ToU and that somebody else apparently intends to sue WMF over it is not making a legal threat. The issue here is whether Drmies pinged you with this report where you are specifically named as potentially involved. BTW what steps are you taking to independently verify if LPSingh is a student of Seth GS Medical College as she claims ? 
Additionally, the reporter is a Checkuser verified [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sockpuppet_investigations/Singora/Archive sockpuppet of indeffed user Singora]. . (talk) 03:18, 28 October 2017 (UTC)
 You're talking complete bollocks. There's no violation of ToU. Who is user:LPSingh impersonating? Nobody. No editor is required to use their real name, but at least LPSingh isn't an anonymous coward like you. Have the courage to log in with your registered username, if it isn't already blocked. Your characterisation of Drmies is a clear personal attack and your IP probably need to be blocked to prevent further attacks. Nobody should be digging into other editor's personal lives, so nobody will be taking any steps to verify any personal information. It's not germane to the user's edits and your attempt to pry and doxx is certainly worthy of a block. --RexxS (talk) 03:37, 28 October 2017 (UTC)
 The  has claimed on the account's user page to be &quot;Lakshmi Singh&quot; a student of Seth GS Medixcal College, Mumbai (India). Yet her edits were those of a seasoned shill for big time pharma promoting a certain abortion regimen. The Dean of Seth GS Medical Colleg Mumbai has already confirmed (incl. to WMF Legal) that they have no such student as Lakshmi Singh, and that even if LPSingh turns out to be their student (under an alias) they do not approve of his/her actions since it is illegal and criminal under Indian law. Why is the name of Seth GS college (the #1 medical college of Mumbai) being invoked to sanctify these promotions for self-induced abortion in India at the instance of a Dutch NGO financed by HIVOS ? Seth GS Medical College has already complained to WMF Legal's Eileen H. about this episode / impersonation. Furthermore, if dangerous medical information (by a supposedly educational US registered charitable Foundation) is being published by unverifed, non-peer reviewed, anonymous people it is all the more reason for the Indian Govt. to block this website. 
 For the benefit of uninvolved editors of this project, I am summarising the Indian law on this. If  is actually a student of Seth GS Medical College (India), then she will very likely be expelled for her editing here. Or, as is more likely, LPSingh turns out to be a  impersonating ([https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1041696/ which under India law includes fictional / imaginary characters]) as a qualified [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ALPSingh&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=805651398&amp;oldid=805650677 medical professional/abortion specialist/student of OB.Gyn] etc, she is additionally punishable under section 66-D of the Information Technology Act for cheating by impersonating by using computer resource. Lastly, the tiny standard 'disclaimer' at the foot of each article means doodly squat under Indian law.  (talk) 03:51, 28 October 2017 (UTC)
 Let me see if I can get this past your inability to comprehend English: It doesn't matter who User:LPSingh claims to be. I claim to be a 65 million year-old dinosaur who survived the K-T extinction. So what? Her edits were nothing like a seasoned pharma shill – and believe me, I've seen plenty of those. Anybody looking at her edits will see that they are far more like those of a student attempting to write an essay on a topic in which they are interested. It doesn't matter what the Dean of some Indian college allegedly disapproves of; their opinion has less weight here even than yours. You're wrong on another point: the Indian government is not going to block Wikipedia on the say-so of the paranoid imaginings of some deranged stalker.
 If any uninvolved editors ever read this – which I doubt – they should understand that this is Wikipedia, not Mumbai, and Indian law has no jurisdiction here. Naturally, nobody here actually gives a shit about your warped opinion of the standard disclaimer. Hope that's clear enough this time, even for you. --RexxS (talk) 17:04, 29 October 2017 (UTC)

Since I've cited the second edition of this textbook at least once in many of the neuroscience, psychology, and pharmacology articles that I've edited on Wikipedia (e.g.,  – 85 of the 88 page results in the article and template namespaces contain citations to the 2nd edition that I added), I think I should probably update the text with the newer edition.

Queen's University Student Editing: Update

Dr. Murray posted here about a month ago about the student editing initiative at Queen's University.
Starting tomorrow (Oct 31st) the students will be adding their suggested content to the talk pages of the articles. 

I will flag all 16 articles on this talk page once the content is posted, and if anyone is interested in commenting or contributing, your expertise would be greatly appreciated.

Summary: 16 student groups will have a list of suggested changes to 16 Wikipedia articles. They will not be editing the actual article until November 15th, but are being instructed to follow the talk page and participate in the discussion. 
Note: The students will practice inserting citations using the PMID tool (in their sandboxes) before editing the talk page. 

If you have any suggestions on other ways that I can ensure this process is smooth and productive, I appreciate all feedback.

Thank you!

I'm pretty sure the instruction  ought to read . Perhaps they might be directed to monitor both talk pages, as you can't be sure where other editors will leave feedback.

It's just a bare complaint about the quality of the journals being cited.

Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing

A few years back when noticing the first article I wondered if it wasn't fringe promotion.  Today it was added to the pseudoscience category which reminded me of it.  More eyes welcome, —PaleoNeonate – 16:50, 5 November 2017 (UTC)

It's now CSD tagged, but since it's PTSD related:  —PaleoNeonate – 04:54, 7 November 2017 (UTC)
At this point in the history of the treatment, the criticisms emphasized in the recent editing in both articles are fringy. This is a relatively recent change in how EMDR is viewed, and I wouldn't be surprised if the perceptions swung again after more research is published. While I've not kept up with all the discussions and editing, I believe all the substantial criticisms were published outside MEDRS date requirements, so those criticisms should be treated as minority viewpoints. --Ronz (talk) 17:21, 7 November 2017 (UTC)
yes true, sometimes perceptions swing again--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 17:49, 7 November 2017 (UTC)
Surely the categorisation as pseudoscience is inconsistent with endorsement by WHO, NICE, SAMHSA, and the other organisations listed at EMDR#Position_statements?

This article was created today.  

Is anyone willing to go through this article and do a + check?  Whatever is left following a reference check should be merged into Addiction#Research. I'd be fine with doing the merger, but I don't really feel like checking the references for MEDRS and WP:V at the moment. Seppi333 (Insert 2¢) 21:45, 31 October 2017 (UTC)
Edit: Nevermind, it's been nominated for deletion due to copyright infringement. Seppi333 (Insert 2¢) 23:32, 31 October 2017 (UTC)
This ref does not even mention the topic in question.[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763415001190?via%3Dihub] Doc James (talk ·  · ) 01:35, 1 November 2017 (UTC)
The source it is copied from is under an open license.
But the references do not say the things they are attached too. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 01:39, 1 November 2017 (UTC)
 If the articles used images that were CC-BY-SA-4.0 from the source, that would be okay. But, the text of a CC-BY-SA-4.0-copyrighted source can't be published under CC-BY-SA-3.0 if it's reproduced verbatim because CC-BY-SA-4.0 requires that the republication be licensed under CC-BY-SA-4.0. That's required by the share-alike (SA) portion of the license: [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/ &quot;ShareAlike — If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.&quot;]. All Wikipedia articles are published under CC-BY-SA-3.0, so, despite the fact that the 3.0 and 4.0 licenses having almost the same licensing terms, the non-compliance with the SA clause in that license technically is copyright infringement. That's why it was nominated for deletion for copyright infringement. Seppi333 (Insert 2¢) 01:48, 1 November 2017 (UTC)
We are moving to CC BY SA 4.0 soon. The article should be deleted because it is poorly referenced not because of copyright issues. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 01:51, 1 November 2017 (UTC)
Fair enough.  I haven't looked at the references, but it'd probably be deleted faster for copyvio than for lack of notability as an independent article. Seppi333 (Insert 2¢) 01:56, 1 November 2017 (UTC)
It is bad regardless. This route will keep it deleted longer as when WP goes CC BY SA 4.0 than the copyright reason will follow away. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 02:00, 1 November 2017 (UTC)
  The table shows CC-BY-SA 4.0 as not compatible with CC-BY-SA 3.0. However the associated footnote states &quot;&quot; The licence is backwards compatible for images, but not for text???  How much are we paying these people? --RexxS (talk) 21:46, 1 November 2017 (UTC)
The reason it's fine for images but not text is that images can be published under a 4.0 license on Wikimedia Commons as well as on Wikipedia, but, as per the [https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use/en#7._Licensing_of_Content the WMF's terms of use], all text on WP is licensed under 3.0 by default. Also, the 4.0 license is forwards compatible with the 3.0 license, but not backwards compatible; so, text published under 3.0 can be published under 4.0, but not vice versa. See https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-considerations/compatible-licenses for further information about this. Seppi333 (Insert 2¢) 01:43, 2 November 2017 (UTC)
 So the situation is that images published under a CC-BY-SA 4.0 licence on another website (e.g. Commons) are ok to include in a Wikipedia article, but text that's published under a CC-BY-SA 4.0 licence on another website is not ok to include in a Wikipedia article. Got it. Is it just me that thinks that there a teeny little bit of contradiction there? --RexxS (talk) 03:22, 2 November 2017 (UTC)

I don't know how commonly the  is viewed by readers, but we really need to revise/update the summaries of most of the portal's selected articles; one of those is randomly selected and transcluded onto the portal page each time the portal is viewed or the portal page is refreshed.  E.g.,  and  are examples of very noticeable problems in two of our &quot;selected article&quot; summaries. Seppi333 (Insert 2¢) 10:01, 14 November 2017 (UTC)
FWIW, we should probably only include featured medical articles on the portal page.  All the existing selected article summaries could be deleted and replaced with the &quot;&quot; (TFA) excerpt/summary for each featured medical article that appeared on the main page. The TFA summaries could be copy/pasted directly into the selected article sub-pages since the formatting/style of a TFA summary is exactly the same as a portal's &quot;selected article&quot; summary. Seppi333 (Insert 2¢) 10:10, 14 November 2017 (UTC)
On the question of popularity:  &quot;Not popular&quot; looks like a reasonable interpretation.  It's averaging 127 page views per day.  For comparison, article #1000 at  gets more than ten times that number of page views each day.  Overall, I think that portals have outlived their usefulness.
On the question of what to include:  FAs and GAs is probably reasonable and a fairly typical cutoff.  We could probably expand/update the list of DYKs as well.  Also, it's not just WPMED's articles; it should include things from other healthcare fields, such as dentistry and pharmacology.  So updates should check those as well.
