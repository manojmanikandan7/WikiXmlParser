 Antibiotic chart 

I'm wondering how useful people find this. It is a list of the most common antibiotics (albeit in Sweden, but most of them are common elsewhere as well), and the most common bacterial infections — showing which antibiotics work for which infections. I like it because it helps you use narrow antibiotics.
ser:CFCF/test/8
It isn't finished — ideally it would include some simple icons for no use in children, cardiac toxicity etc., basically the most important points of consideration for each antibiotic.
I've used a simpler version quite a lot in my clinical practice, and it saves time because you can go directly to look up the dosage of a certain antibiotic.
It's based off the Swedish: [http://www.lul.se/Global/Extran%C3%A4t/V%C3%A5rdgivare/Strama/AB%20bakteriekort%20final%20jan%202014.pdf] — (so it might not be accurate with regards to resistance percentages in other countries), but I think this is a good start.

If people are interested I may take to creating one for harder to treat infections such as VRE, MRSA, ESBL, Acinetobacter, (possibly Tuberculosis and MDRTB, XDRTB, TDR-TB) etc... This is the type of thing that I would be willing to collaborate on to publish in the Wikiversity Journal of Medicine as well (if we find any good way to cram in references in the tables).

Thanks in advance for any comments and suggestions!Also, if you don't really get what it is, or find something is difficult to understand in the chart, please ask and I will try to clarify.ser:CFCF|Carl Fredrikser talk:CFCF| 💌 pecial:EmailUser/CFCF|📧 14:19, 29 September 2016 (UTC)

@|CFCF fantastic work. Any where we can centralise discussion on this now and in the future to provide corrections/feedback other than the med page? Skiming through some small things - trimethoprim missing an &quot;H&quot;; ceftriaxone should be PO &amp; IV, and I was under the impression most e faecalis is sensitive to it? I am wondering if it is better to separate vancomycin PO and IV given PO form has such limited oral absorption and so is mainly used for treatment of c diff?

And not to overwhelm you but I can't see the colouring for the severity of side-effects? And trimethoprim should be marked as teratogenic. --ser:LT910001|Tom (LT) (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 23:18, 30 September 2016 (UTC)
|LT910001 — I'm very much willing to work on this if I know people will find it useful. However it is not finished, and there are currently lots of warnings missing (I intend on populating these fields soon, and the ear icon is sort of difficult because its hard to find an image that isn't just thin lines), — but I very much welcome any critique because it's difficult to get everything working at once (and I'm not overwhelmed). 
Concerning ceftriaxone — it isn't licensed for PO use in Europe or the US and fass.se or drugs.org do not list it in PO form. Does Australia have a different drug administration that I could link to as a reference? If I have time I will try to give references for all the susceptibility data — right now it's just sourced from a clinical guidance document that doesn't give it's own respective sources (but however passes MEDRS). 
For Vancomycin — absolutely, that wasn't something I had thought of. However I'm thinking I'd like to add a field of what % is absorbed when given orally and that it might fit better in a different chart (I'll have to think about it). ser:CFCF|Carl Fredrikser talk:CFCF| 💌 pecial:EmailUser/CFCF|📧 10:27, 1 October 2016 (UTC)
On a side note |Bluerasberry, |Daniel Mietchen, &amp; |Tobias1984 — would it be possible to introduce all this data into Wikidata (especially MIC and resistance profiles) — to automate the creation of this type of table?

Systematic reviews are not inherently more reliable than narrative reviews.  They each have their strengths and weaknesses.  For example, if all else is equal, a systematic review might be better for a purely quantitative statement (&quot;98% Oxygen saturation has better survival than 90%&quot;) but worse for a qualitative question (&quot;Patients quit this drug because they hate the side effects&quot;).  NB that &quot;all else&quot; is rarely equal, and that the best practice is usually citing multiple sources of multiple types (especially if decent examples of the different types of sources disagree with each other).  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 04:10, 30 October 2016 (UTC)
&quot;All else&quot; can quite impossibly be equal because the systematic review takes into account far more sources, and a better selection — even for statements such as patients hating the side-effects. That said, a systematic review would not try to answer that unless it was part of or at least related to its original question. A systematic review is only better in so far it answers its specified question, and that it summarizes the conclusions from a large number of sources. I'd like to see a case where a systematic review strongly supports a statement that it didn't set out to find an answer to — otherwise we should be pretty clear that the systematic review is a stronger source nearly all the time. ser:CFCF|Carl Fredrikser talk:CFCF| 💌 pecial:EmailUser/CFCF|📧 08:41, 30 October 2016 (UTC)
You are assuming that the systematic review found any sources that met its criteria,[https://www.researchgate.net/post/What_is_the_minimum_number_of_studies_to_be_included_in_a_systematic_review] that it came to a conclusion, and overall that it was well-performed.  You're also assuming that the Wikipedia editor is using the review only for its official conclusions (e.g., rather than an emphatic statement in a background section).  I agree with you – but only to the extent that those assumptions are true in a given case.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 19:20, 30 October 2016 (UTC)
One can tackle qualitative questions systematically. The problem with narrative reviews is that they can be too biased in what material they include: that's true regardless of whether they're covering quant or qual work. Good narrative reviews can pick out answers and issues that systematic reviews have failed to consider, and there are flaws in modern systematic review approaches, but narrative reviews are also much more prone to bias. ser:Bondegezou|Bondegezou (ser talk:Bondegezou|talk) 20:55, 30 October 2016 (UTC)

 There is always a tradeoff between the amount of information displayed and the clarity and simplicity of the display. Some want less clutter, some want more information.

Where's the consensus for that 'smart' idea? In my ~9 years here, I've seen plenty of icons/notes indicating non-free content over the years, but this useless clutter indicating free content has only shown up recently.

I'm just getting around to reading these RfCs, and I'm having trouble understanding your preference, Rexx. My naive default preference would be to use a symbol to flag the free stuff and leave the non-free stuff alone, as a way of giving a little extra boost of visual prominence to OA sources. (If anything I'd separate stuff as &quot;compatibly licensed&quot; or &quot;free to reuse&quot;, &quot;free to read but otherwise restricted&quot;, and &quot;other&quot;.) ser:Opabinia regalis|Opabinia regalis (ser talk:Opabinia regalis|talk) 22:16, 1 November 2016 (UTC)
 eply to | Opabinia regalis It's simply this: I'm considering the average reader who might be interested enough to follow a link to get more information. How do they benefit from a link being identified as free content? They don't. They are just going to click on it and read the content as anyone would expect when following any hyperlink. However, if we don't mark up, for example, a 'subscription-required' link, then the reader follows the link expecting to be able to read more and is faced with a paywall message. That's not what we want to happen, so we should be using indicators to mark those links - there's a very clear benefit in warning readers that the content is going to require subscription. Consequently, I believe that only marking links to restricted contentndand doing so consistently, whether it's via doi, bare url or whateverndbrings the most benefit to our readers. I know it's nice to give a boost to OA sources, but I suspect most of our readers won't find that as important as not wasting their time, especially if they are on slow or metered connections. Cheers --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 22:32, 1 November 2016 (UTC)
 Fair enough - I suppose that what you expect the reader's default expectation to be will depend on the topic area. I wouldn't expect people to be blind-clicking on scientific journal references and then getting disappointed when they find a paywall. But that sounds like an argument for using indicators for both free and non-free content. The position I can't get my head around is labeling the non-free stuff but leaving the free stuff unmarked, which both reduces the visual prominence of the best links and confuses readers who don't have &quot;free to read&quot; as their default expectation. ser:Opabinia regalis|Opabinia regalis (ser talk:Opabinia regalis|talk) 22:52, 1 November 2016 (UTC)

This was posted to [https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/libraries the Wikipedia and Libraries mailing list]. The author requested comment there in that list. I linked that thread to this online discussion because I thought this community here might have its own discussion, as the paper is about WikiProject Medicine. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 14:08, 20 October 2016 (UTC)
comments on reading level required for our articles are interesting.
ull quote|1=The readability of Wikipedia articles has continued to be unsatisfactory according to the yardstick of consumer health best practices. ...The article on Parkinson’s Disease can be considered to be the epitome of what the project seeks to accomplish....However, according to a recent assessment of the reading level of this article, a high narrative complexity had the potential to alienate readers and make them refer to substandard, simplified sources.The reading level of this particular article was calculated to substantially exceed the NIH’s recommended 7th grade readability level with almost any assessment tool that was used. A number of other studies have the same findings both for particular disciplines and for the encyclopedia as a whole. Nora Hutchinson’s article is fairly representative of this research in its finding that Wikipedia’s reading level was significantly higher than that of WebMD,  the Mayo Clinic’s website, and a number of other diagnosis-specific sites.
something we should keep in mind per P:NOTJOURNAL: &quot;A Wikipedia article should not be presented on the assumption that the reader is well-versed in the topic's field. Introductory language in the lead (and also maybe the initial sections) of the article should be written in plain terms and concepts that can be understood by any literate reader of Wikipedia without any knowledge in the given field before advancing to more detailed explanations of the topic. While wikilinks should be provided for advanced terms and concepts in that field, articles should be written on the assumption that the reader will not or cannot follow these links, instead attempting to infer their meaning from the text.&quot;ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 14:19, 20 October 2016 (UTC)
ing|Jytdog We have an unexplored offer from Content Rules / Translators without Borders, which is a partner at P:TTF.
A major problem with imple English Wikipedia is endless squabbling over what constitutes &quot;Simple English&quot;. There are a range of standards, like oice of Americas style, asic English, any ontrolled vocabulary, or anyone else's promoted manual of style. Some people want 4th grade reading levels while others say 8th grade is fine, but also, no definition is accepted. I do not know how to sort this, but Content Rules has offered to donate a dictionary of medical terms to Wikimedia projects if some things could be negotiated. The dictionary has recommendations for word replacements for general use, and comes with a medical writing guide. Maybe a guide like this is or is not appropriate for either English or Simple English Wikipedia, but at least it is a freely licensed plausibly reputable guide for producing accessible medical content and it is more of a starting point than we have now. I would not want to dictate how anyone has to write, but if anyone wants suggestions of what to consider, a plain-language guide to medical writing from this partner might be useful.
Their guide includes a database dictionary and some writing suggestions. Part of what it would take for them to share it is having a plan to present it which preserves its integrity. They would not want it migrated into Wikimedia projects if it kept their brand on it and it was remixed into chaos, but it also is not easily accessible on their website. A middleground could be bringing parts of it here and linking to their database. More conversation would be necessary and so far this online community does not have point people who can negotiate exchanges like this.
Without a manual of style somewhere I am not sure how to promote standards in Wikipedia's medical content. It is difficult to adopt any standard. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 15:40, 20 October 2016 (UTC)

I have received training from Content Rules regarding simplification and they have done some degree of simplification for us through me. Simplification is very controversial within our community. Attempting to simply often results in a barrage of personal attacks and thus I would not be willing to ask people from Content Rules to become directly involved.

I agree with James that we should not ask any institutional partner to get involved in onwiki policy discussions. Having anyone propose a manual of style would be controversial. Still, without enforcing anything, I wish that we could offer a manual of style if anyone choose to use one. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 19:46, 20 October 2016 (UTC)
There are discussions about changing Wiktionary into a structured database.  It's possible that some of the ideas behind that would be useful for this.  Also, if you don't want it on a typical project, then it's possible that it could be posted at utreach:, alongside some other resources for educators and GLAM professionals.  Wikidata, of course, imports a lot of things, but they're not exactly a dictionary.

 Roche images - PD-L1 testing 

Hello everyone,

I had some back and forth with people at Roche about open content and how the lack of information is a barrier to better care and them selling more drugs and the companion diagnostic tests. 

Exciting is that I managed to convince them that it is in their interest to provide information to us. Today they uploaded images related to D-L1 testing which is used to predict response to D-L1 inhibitors.

*comment it seems to me that such an act would require notice on many pages and fairly extensive discussion - you're talking about erasing a lot of editors' work, with unclear benefit. I've been surprised by how many pages are devoted to focused things, but I also see the benefit of having them when there is notability based on verifiable coverage in reliable sources. It seems that many phobias satisfy those criteria - so I don't support this proposal as it stands, but I also think that the proposal is improperly positioned. The pages should be considered on their merits. — ser:soupvector|soupvector (ser_talk:soupvector|talk) 05:03, 6 November 2016 (UTC)
Looking at ones like this yctophobia, not sure why there is the &quot;And Obama&quot; but it is basically a dictionary definition. This one echanophobia has zero refs and is one line. Small stub smophobia. This one is basically unreferenced rigophobia

I agree that many of those phobia articles should be merged, but you said &quot;about 120&quot; and I don't see how anyone could assess your proposal without knowing which ones. I guess you're just asking about whether others share the sense that these should be merged, and I would agree that there are many that should be merged (but the devil is in the details). — ser:soupvector|soupvector (ser_talk:soupvector|talk) 21:54, 6 November 2016 (UTC)
*Comment—like soupvector, I'm hesitant about giving this the all-out green-light, even though I support it in principle.
It seems like a lot of work for very questionable benefit. People are obsessed about having phobias for all manner of nonsense—if we merge them we'll have hell each time someone reads about their pet phobia in a newspaper and decides its article should be restored on Wikipedia. Then again we already do, because people add wonky references to the articles already. 
So it boils down to whether you think its worth spending time (and energy debating with shills about) on — and if you had any cut-off point in mind? E.g. merging everything that is stub-class, or everything that has less than 3 independent sources etc. etc.?

give opinion(gave mine)--ser:Ozzie10aaaa|Ozzie10aaaa (ser talk:Ozzie10aaaa|talk) 12:00, 10 November 2016 (UTC)

Last year, I believe that they had over 100 ideas proposed; so far, we have 77 proposals at m:2016 Community Wishlist Survey, and there's still 10 days to go.  For those who participated last year, I thought I'd highlight a few things that might help you get what you want.  
First, this is the &quot;make proposals and discuss ideas&quot; phase.  The goal for this stage is to collect proposals, merge duplicates, and make sure that the proposals are specific enough that people know what they're voting on.  You don't want to have a proposal that says (to give an irrelevant example) &quot;Improve citations&quot; with lots of support, but half the voters meant &quot;improve it by requiring the use of citation templates&quot; and the other half meant &quot;improve it by deleting the citation templates&quot;.  Discussion and questions are particularly important at this stage, so that a clear description can be put before voters.  This is true whether you think you're likely to support a proposal or not.  (In fact, if you think that a proposal is a bad idea, then you might want to join that discussion to make sure that the problems are clear to everyone.)  It is also particularly helpful if you identify how a proposal will affect other projects.  By sheer size, the English Wikipedia could outvote any other project.  But it's important for the overall movement's health to step outside of the mindset that the English Wikipedia is the only important project, or that what works here will work everywhere.  So if you've got experience with any other project, please add your thoughts about how a proposal will affect other wikis.  
Second, the voting stage, which starts on 28 November, is expected to use pproval voting.  You will be able to vote in favor of as many things as you want – but not until then.  
Votes (and also !votes) on wiki have some problems, such as people being more likely to read and answer the first item than the last.  (With luck, they'll decide to change the order of items on the page every now and again, but I wouldn't count on it.)  Also, many local rules, such as the ones at the English Wikipedia that prohibit unfair canvassing, don't apply, so it may feel doubly strange to many editors here (and very familiar to editors at most other projects).  But it's a straight vote, and you're welcome to beg your friends to vote for your proposal.  The 10 most popular ideas will be addressed by the team during the next fiscal year (NB:  &quot;addressed&quot; and &quot;implemented&quot; are not the same.  If a truly bad idea wins the vote, then it will likely be &quot;addressed&quot; with a note explaining that they won't do it, and perhaps making some related counter-proposals).  
So:  How to win?  The most important thing you can do to help your favorite proposals is to make sure that the description is clear and complete, that questions about it have been asked and answered, and that the proposal has been copyedited so that it can be easily understood by non-technical contributors and people who don't speak English natively.  The next most important thing you can do is to mark your calendar for 28 November, to make sure that you vote for your favorite proposals.

I mean that almost the only sources that even bother to mention that aspect, much less to discuss it, are advocacy sources (defined loosely here as sources trying to change people's choices, not merely sources that have a POV).  See, e.g., the long list of medical dictionaries such as Dorlands that I posted to the article's talk page just now.  Go read them all.

I have looked at the problem - and was speaking of the polar positions on that topic when I made my comment. I'm familiar with chiropractic, and not a fan, generally (but there are areas where studies have supported some aspects of the discipline). The could be said of many areas of &quot;modern&quot; medicine - we still have much to learn, and should not be dismissive when there is some evidence of benefit. — ser:soupvector|soupvector (ser_talk:soupvector|talk) 01:23, 10 November 2016 (UTC)
Just as one example, from a review article published in the New England Journal of Medicine 6 months ago (MID|27144851): &quot;q|A randomized trial of chiropractic manipulation for subacute or chronic “back-related leg pain” (without confirmation of nerve-root compression on MRI) showed that manipulation was more effective than home exercise with respect to pain relief at 12 weeks (by a mean 1-point decrease on a pain-intensity scale on which scores ranged from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating greater severity of pain) but not at 1 year.35 In addition, a randomized trial involving patients who had acute sciatica with MRI-confirmed disk protrusion showed that at 6 months, significantly more patients who underwent chiropractic manipulation had an absence of pain than did those who underwent sham manipulation (55% vs. 20%).36 Neurologic complications in the lumbar spine, including worsened disk herniation or the cauda equina syndrome, have been reported anecdotally, but they appear to be extremely rare.35-37&quot; My point is that the current scientific consensus is not exclusively negative - it's more complicated than that. — ser:soupvector|soupvector (ser_talk:soupvector|talk) 01:45, 10 November 2016 (UTC)
 eply to |soupvector Yes, we can all find single primary studies that document some evidence of efficacy. But the only secondary sources that look broadly at the literature (e.g. Cochrane reviews) show no evidence of effectiveness beyond being no worse than most other attempts at fixing chronic lower back pain. And that's well documented already in the article. Nobody's trying to deny chiropractic's claim to being a legitimate component of alternate medicine, but I'm sick of the POV-pushers who try to pretend that that underlying theory that drives chiropractic - &quot;ertebral subluxations - is anything other than complete woo-woo and should be accurately labelled as pseudoscience. If our article simply defines chiropractic as alt med and nothing else, then it is whitewashing the majority of practitioners and chiropractic associations who subscribe to the pseudoscientific nonsense. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 03:08, 10 November 2016 (UTC)
I cited a high-quality source - I think you trivialize a NEJM review by responding &quot;..we can all find single primary studies...&quot;. I agree there are &quot;woo woo&quot; beliefs underlying chiropractic - but what you and I think doesn't matter. We are here to represent high-quality sources, and there is a significant perspective that supports some aspects of chiropractic as being comparable in efficacy to some mainstream medical practices (and I'm a mainstream medical practitioner). — ser:soupvector|soupvector (ser_talk:soupvector|talk) 03:55, 10 November 2016 (UTC)
The cited review article essentially says &quot;these two primary studies reported statistically significant results favouring chiropractic&quot;.  But – tellingly – the &quot;Conclusions and recommendations&quot; section says nothing about chiropractic.  You say above &quot;the current scientific consensus is not exclusively negative&quot;, but this source does not support that claim.  Apparently after reviewing the primary literature, the authors of this review found insufficient evidence to recommend chiopractic or make any claim about its efficacy. And this was a review about back pain... ser:Adrian J. Hunter|Adrian J. Hunter(ser talk:Adrian J. Hunter|talk•pecial:contributions/Adrian J. Hunter|contribs) 06:41, 10 November 2016 (UTC)

&quot;I think you trivialize a NEJM review by responding &quot;..we can all find single primary studies...&quot;&quot; - No, RexxS is exactly right. tatistical significance as a criterion has the big weakness of being false-positive 5% of the time when there is no effect, and primary studies often omit basic safety measures against certain sources of error because the researchers do not know any better. Anybody who looks for positive results for any arbitrary nonsense will find it as long as the subject has been scientifically researched at all. Examples: omeopathy, strology, ater witching. Because of that and other reasons, Wikipedia prefers secondary sources (e.g. Cochrane reviews) that summarize the results of primary sources, taking quality into account. --ser:Hob Gadling|Hob Gadling (ser talk:Hob Gadling|talk) 10:13, 10 November 2016 (UTC)

It is easy to ignore an aspect of reality, such as the poor evidence base of chiropractic and the poor connection between chiropractic and reality, by defining all the sources that mention that aspect as &quot;advocacy&quot;. This is a common ploy of defenders of all sorts of pseudoscience who try to paint themselves as &quot;neutral&quot;. They also often use reasoning that can easily be turned around and used in the opposite direction with equal justification. When you are removing the word &quot;pseudoscientific&quot;, aren't you P:RIGHTGREATWRONGSing? --ser:Hob Gadling|Hob Gadling (ser talk:Hob Gadling|talk) 10:36, 9 November 2016 (UTC)
No, when we make the word pseudoscience (and its variants) appear &quot;only&quot; six times in the article, rather than seven times including the very first sentence, we're following the P:DUE weight.  Why?  Because very, very few of the sources about chiropractic think that &quot;pseudoscience&quot; is the first thing to say about the subject. 
I've just followed RexxS's advice to see what scholar.google.com says – only, I search about the subject of this article, i.e., &quot;chiropractic&quot;, not &quot;chiropractic pseudoscience&quot;.  I clicked every single item on the first page (my default search length is probably longer than yours).  Zero hits included the word pseudoscience in any form.  Now – perhaps your results will be different.  Perhaps you will have access to a paywalled paper that I didn't, or perhaps Google will remove the two deadlinks from their search results by the time you do it.  
But we could look at it another way, too:  RexxS reports 612 Ghits on the subject of pseudoscience in chiropractic.  I got 151,000 Ghits on chiropractic.  That means that approximately 1 in 250 sources about chiropractic mention pseudoscience.  IMO, when merely 0.4% of sources mention an aspect of a subject, then that aspect probably doesn't belong in the very first sentence of an article.  If that seems unreasonable, then consider this:  1 in 21 (twenty-one; more than a full magnitude more frequent) current news articles mention rape in connection with Donald Trump.  But the first sentence in that article isn't, and shouldn't be, &quot;Donald Trump is a rapist, American businessman, and politician&quot;.  That's the logical conclusion from learning that it is not mentioned in 96% (or 99.6%) of articles on the subject.   ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:07, 10 November 2016 (UTC)
Not sure that that is a correct metric. Not all things on Google Scholar have the same P:WEIGHT, and not all items will discuss whether it's pseudoscience or use that word, either. ser:Jo-Jo Eumerus|Jo-Jo Eumerus (ser talk:Jo-Jo Eumerus|talk, pecial:CentralAuth/Jo-Jo Eumerus|contributions) 16:36, 10 November 2016 (UTC)
I think it's a reasonable metric for determining whether something is the single most important fact about a subject, and it's passed the few simple tests I've run:  &quot;Charles Manson&quot; is associated with murder, &quot;George Washington&quot; is heavily associated with the presidency, Saskatchewan is very strongly associated with Canada, mammals are associated with milk and being vetebrates, and somewhat associated with hair, etc.  All of this is exactly what you'd expect, and exactly in line with the opening lines of the Wikipedia articles on those subjects.
I'm open to more suggestions, though; it'd certainly be better to have multiple such metrics.  In any given case, any single metric might be misleading or incomplete.  So far, though, I've tried two metrics (what professional medical dictionaries say plus what Google Scholar associates with this subject), and both of them indicate that the pseudoscientific problems with chiropractic are not the single most important fact.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:27, 10 November 2016 (UTC)

I also count only four &quot;pseudos*&quot;, two in the introduction and two in the body, not counting categories, banners, sources, and &quot;See also&quot;. The &quot;See also&quot; can go, and the rest seems to be necessary, since they explain which part of chiropractic is pseudoscientific. I don't think that any of the WP rules states that the incidence of each word within an article has to correlate with the incidence of the same word in scholar.google.com.

(Also, I'm counting the two instances of pseudomedicine in my six.)  I've not seen anyone say that pseudoscience shouldn't be mentioned, or even that it shouldn't be mentioned clearly and relatively prominently.

 No, WAID, by your logic hiropractic shouldn't use the appellation lternate medicine in the first sentence either. But it does.

With regard to the first sentence, it should define the profession in a way that reflects high-quality sources. P:MEDRS says that guidelines from International medical and scientific organizations represent some of the highest quality sources available. The chiropractic profession has been [http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/traditional/Chiro-Guidelines.pdf defined by the World Health Organization], in the glossary of it’s Guidelines on Training and Safety: &quot;Chiropractic - A health care profession concerned with the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disorders of the neuromusculoskeletal system and the effects of these disorders on general health. There is an emphasis on manual techniques, including joint adjustment and/or manipulation, with a particular focus on subluxations.”
Not sure if it is helpful, but the idea of whether to label ‘chiropractic’ as pseudoscience or to label the ‘some of the ideas espoused by chiropractors’ as pseudoscience has been discussed before [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Chiropractic/Archive_32#Pseudoscience.3F here in 2011]. pecial:Contributions/2001:56A:75B7:9B00:FC52:6CE8:6010:FF27|2001:56A:75B7:9B00:FC52:6CE8:6010:FF27 (ser talk:2001:56A:75B7:9B00:FC52:6CE8:6010:FF27|talk) 03:39, 11 November 2016 (UTC)

At the reliable sources noticeboard it has been suggested that [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard#Is_the_source_reliable_enough_for_the_claim.3F the source is reliable for the claim]; however, there is still disagreement at the relevant talk page over whether MEDRS should be applied to exclude the source.

What an educational program does, or doesn't, teach, is not a biomedical claim.  It's a social claim (=what happens in a society, because of laws, etc.).  Therefore, MEDRS doesn't apply.  Or, more precisely, the MEDPOP section that says even a decent newspaper article is plenty good enough for such claims, applies.  See also P:Biomedical information#What is not biomedical information? on &quot;Training&quot;, and consider what the minimum standard for a similar statement in another field would be, e.g., &quot;99% of Canadian medical schools offer at least one class on nutrition&quot;.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 20:46, 10 November 2016 (UTC)

I checked one diff (so keep in mind that n=1 for my comments), and I think that we may be reacting a little too strongly.  That diff blanked an entire section with an edit summary claiming that it was &quot;unsourced&quot; (it contained five sources, e.g., to the review MID|17716101) and had other problems.  But the bigger problem is that we had a section on Mental symptoms (e.g., people with chronic stress can have symptoms similar to depression), and now we don't even have a complete sentence on mental health effects – which is particularly weird for a subject that is all about &quot;the response to emotional pressure suffered for a prolonged period of time&quot;, to quote the first sentence!
Rather than blanking imperfect but basically accurate (AFAICT) information, maybe we should try helping them find better sources or re-phrasing things to be more precise.  I think that collaborative editing will get us a better article than blanking sections.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:08, 13 November 2016 (UTC)
What you are saying here would have credibility to me, if you were actually helping to manage student editing  - and when I say manage, I mean stick with it to ensure that what is left when they are done is not a badly thought out, skewed-WEIGHTed, badly sourced, badly written ... thing.  Your response is too typical of the WMF and Ed Program which seems to value &quot;the chance for new editors&quot; above everything else and ignores - ignores -  the quality of WP content.  I recognize the potential value of these school programs but they are terribly managed and too many of our articles have been left mangled by students.    But I would love for you to show me how it is done. To &quot;collaborate&quot; with students who come here to get assignments done, don't listen to feedback and edit war bad content into WP.

 Massviews tool improved 

Hello WikiProject Medicine! The oollabs:massviews|Massviews tool, which is used to import pages and get their pageviews, is now twice as fast and supports processing of up to 10,000 pages. That's still not enough to process all Medicine articles, but you should be able to do most (all?) of the different classifications. For instance, you could get the most-viewed pages of the [https://tools.wmflabs.org/massviews/?platform=all-access&amp;agent=user&amp;source=category&amp;target=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FCategory%3AHigh-importance_medicine_articles&amp;range=latest-20&amp;subjectpage=1&amp;sort=views&amp;direction=1&amp;view=list high-importance medicine articles]. To run queries like this, provide the full URL to the category in the Massviews tool, and select &quot;Use subject page instead of talk page&quot; (since Category:High-importance medicine articles shows talk pages). You can of course select any arbitrary date range, or click on the date range field to reveal the date picker, and some shortcuts like &quot;last month&quot; are available.

 This would not have been a problem if the split was done the way I originally proposed and for which there was a developing consensus.  But no, we have to first perform an experiment to determine which is the primary topic.  Three observations. First, for the last 16 years, before the article was hijacked by Doc James two months ago without consensus (WP:MED über alles), it was clear what the primary subject was (the natural hormone).  Second, the majority of wiki links are to the natural hormone, not the drug. Third, it is also clear from vast majority of foreign language testosterone articles that the primary subject is the natural hormone.  ser:Boghog|Boghog (ser talk:Boghog|talk) 19:04, 12 November 2016 (UTC)
|Boghog What made it clear that the primary subject was the non-medical use? I did not agree to this experiment being done in lots of articles, only one, but I still think that it seems reasonable that if an article has a lot more traffic than the others then it should be primary. Do you disagree with that premise and think, for example, that incoming links should be a determining factor? Do we need to clarify some part of WP:PRIMARY? I would like your support for a clearly-stated system and beyond that consensus from everyone. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 22:24, 12 November 2016 (UTC)
|Bluerasberry What made clear that the primary subject of estosterone for the first 16 years of its existence is that drug or medication wasn't not even mentioned in the first paragraph of the lead whereas hormone was. Drug/medication was only added to the first paragraph in the last two months. Per P:PRIMARYTOPIC, two major aspects should be considered, usage and  long-term significance. Both the historical record of the English testosterone article and the focus of the vast majority of the foreign language Wikipedia articles on the hormone argue that the primary topic is the hormone.  Until relatively recently, testosterone has not been widely prescribed as a drug.  Per P:PRIMARYTOPIC, arguments based on recent widespread notability and prominence are less persuasive. Judging notability based on incoming wiki links is fairly useless since there a number of bloated navboxes can could easily skew the results one way or the other and many times, it is debatable which link is most appropriate. Page views are useful since they directly measures usage. The most persuasive argument for hormone over drug is that hormone is the more fundamental concept. To understand why testosterone is a drug, one needs to first understand that it is a hormone. ser:Boghog|Boghog (ser talk:Boghog|talk) 23:17, 12 November 2016 (UTC)
Some responses -
*I have no particular respect for the quality of Wikipedia's older content so I will not defend it from change. If it was a certain way for a long time I will not take that alone as evidence of consensus or support, because so few people actually edit. I am comfortable saying that Wikipedia's content is poor quality as compared to the ideal we want. I am not afraid of changes, especially when they come with discussion, and I think this current discussion is appropriate to have.
*I agree that incoming wiki links from infoboxes navboxes is no indicator of importance.
*We have agreement that pageviews are important. I expect that you also would be interested to see which article gets more views from a disambig page, whether hormone or medicine. If I were to draw a line, I would suggest that if there are multiple topics and one gets 80% of the views, then definitely it should be primary. I am not sure if you would draw a line or where, but perhaps sorting that detail could wait. Perhaps incoming traffic should not be the only factor.
*I am not sure how much Wikipedia should emphasize historical science when another concept seems more popular for a few years. I am prepared to say that if a new concept like a drug is much more studied than an older fundamental concept like a hormone of the same name, then I would be fine with the drug taking precedence in Wikipedia, but also I do not think that the conversation around this is developed and I am open to hearing suggestions for how this works and what exceptions, if any, there should be. Different people have different concepts of &quot;recent&quot;, with some thinking that means 1, 5, 15, 30, or 50 years. Personally, I would say that a concept that has gotten 80% of traffic every month for about 3 years is beyond being recent. I am expecting that medical testosterone has been in this position for 5+ years, but we neither have data to confirm this nor do we have any rule that says &quot;80% for 3 years&quot; is a valid determinant.
I am not sure what the rule should be but I think there should be a rule because there must be several hundred similar cases. I do not know how to resolve this discussion, but I would propose &quot;80% for 3 years&quot; as a starting point, and then ask what more you or anyone else might want. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 18:22, 14 November 2016 (UTC)

*I fixed 5 of them, but then the list went down (service not available). For the ones I examined, they were pretty consistently referring to the hormone, but I cannot say that it was a statistically-valid sample. I decided not to change a couple where the page would need to be refactored to tease out the distinction between the endogenous hormone and the drug (e.g. a Tour de France article referring to a high level of estosterone in an athlete's sample, for a substance on the UCI banned list - in this case, the assay was for the hormone, but the banned substance is the drug). — ser:soupvector|soupvector (ser_talk:soupvector|talk) 19:35, 12 November 2016 (UTC)

 PMID magic links 

Hey all, 

It looks like PMID magic links are going away – well, losing their magic.  &quot;PMID 12345678&quot; will just be plain text.  

It looks like the new format for PMIDs is an interwiki link:  &quot;mid:12345678&quot; for mid:12345678.  You can add a label just link any other link; it could look like mid:12345678|MID|12345678 or mid:12345678|that paper or mid:12345678|whatever you want.

RFC and ISBN magic links will also be changing.  The formats are listed as &quot;alternatives&quot; (they work now) at mw:Help:Magic links.  

This change is being made for technical reasons.  The technical RFC, with some information about the rationale, is here:  mw:Requests for comment/Future of magic links.  Most of our links are in citation templates, which will be fixed centrally, and all of this can be fixed by bot or P:AWB, but it'd be a good idea to keep an eye out for these changes.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 22:34, 15 November 2016 (UTC)

 My thoughts are much the same. PMIDs have never really come up except in citation templates, so I don't think I'll miss the magic link functionality that much. ser:James Hare (NIOSH)|James Hare (NIOSH) (ser talk:James Hare (NIOSH)|talk) 04:06, 16 November 2016 (UTC)

 Where can we register our objections to this proposed change? ser:Boghog|Boghog (ser talk:Boghog|talk) 04:49, 16 November 2016 (UTC)
The talk page associated with this:  mw:Requests for comment/Future of magic links. They apparently do RfCs diffferently on wikimedia. ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 05:04, 16 November 2016 (UTC)
Very differently.  Technical RFCs can last longer, their subjects are different, the main discussions are held in real-time, and they almost always (in the end) result in a firm decision that gets implemented by the people involved in the discussion.  Speaking purely as a volunteer, I'd say that &quot;registering your objections&quot; would be a waste of time.  (Also, if anyone decides to post anyway, remember that they block people over perceived rudeness much more freely in the technical spaces.)  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 07:27, 16 November 2016 (UTC)
This is not true, please don't spread FUD like this again. ser:Legoktm|Legoktm (ser talk:Legoktm|talk) 04:22, 17 November 2016 (UTC)
So the RfC is actually fake.   This again is why people who work on content get frustrated with how the technical people work.  That is a messed up system. ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 07:50, 16 November 2016 (UTC)

* oh there is a category: Category:Pages using PMID magic links ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 05:07, 16 November 2016 (UTC)
Well you can still make a PMID link in talk with brackets MID:12345678 renders as MID:12345678. Talk pages are the only places I would ever use the magic links in the past I think? I can't think of a reason I would use one on a regular page... ser:Ajpolino|Ajpolino (ser talk:Ajpolino|talk) 05:23, 16 November 2016 (UTC) 
Just an added note, for refs which use the &quot;magic links&quot; because they don't use templated &quot;cite journal&quot; refs, I'm sure a bot will convert the old PMID 12345678 to the new MID:12345678. So this shouldn't require any extra work on our part, except to add the brackets in the future. ser:Ajpolino|Ajpolino (ser talk:Ajpolino|talk) 05:27, 16 November 2016 (UTC)
 So this proposed change will not apply to the rendering of ara|pmid in l|cite journal? ser:Boghog|Boghog (ser talk:Boghog|talk) 05:33, 16 November 2016 (UTC)
 And l|pmid, etc.? ser:Boghog|Boghog (ser talk:Boghog|talk) 05:36, 16 November 2016 (UTC)
Any templates that rely upon the magic link will need to be updated, if they haven't already been.  But l|pmid doesn't use it anyway, and I'd be surprised if l|cite journal did (and if it does, it'd be an easy fix).  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 07:27, 16 November 2016 (UTC)
yes ser:Ajpolino I can read.  The point is that this is more work for editors to communicate with one another.  What is the benefit to editors?  This seems driven by some coders desire for elegance in the code. I don't give a rats ass about that.  I just know the result is that I will have yet another template I have to type perfectly to make work.  ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 06:13, 16 November 2016 (UTC)
For the (apparently) few of us who used the magic links, I recommend just typing &quot;mid:12345678&quot; instead of using a template.  I don't think it'll be a noticeable amount of extra typing for me, although of course reasonable people could disagree on this point.   ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 07:27, 16 November 2016 (UTC)
Or just use MID|123456778. But yes, bots could fix anything that would break. Even old discussions. ser:Headbomb|Headbomb {ser talk:Headbomb|talk / pecial:Contributions/Headbomb|contribs / P:PHYS|physics / P:WBOOKS|books} 12:02, 16 November 2016 (UTC)

(unindent) Yes, what ser:Headbomb|Headbomb says. Magic links were added before ediaWiki existed. They were added before the notion of templates and transclusion existed in MediaWiki. Making the parser guess at whether a user intended for there to be a link leads to bugs and unexpected behavior. Explicit markup is better and these days considered a lot more standard. That is, ISBN, PMID, and RFC magic links are by far the exceptions and not the rule. ser:Jytdog|Jytdog: I absolutely agree that there's no rush here and that we don't need to break anything unnecessarily. The deprecation process hasn't even formally begun, as far as I'm aware, it's still just moving forward slowly with notes and heads-up like this. (In some ways, this note was perhaps a bit premature or phrased in a way that makes it seem a bit premature.) Speaking broadly, the harsh reality is that wiki markup has evolved in ways that will likely require some substantial changes. Wiki markup's flexibility and free-form nature has made it wild in places; when trying to replicate and pin down its behavior, we've seen the need to make adjustments, such as cutting obscure (mis-)features such as magic linking, in order to make the overall system more sane and predictable and less buggy. If there are strong reasons we must keep magic links around, you should absolutely raise these points on MediaWiki.org or in Phabricator or here (ser:Legoktm|Legoktm and others are very responsive) so that we can plan and adjust accordingly. :-)  --ser:MZMcBride|MZMcBride (ser talk:MZMcBride|talk) 04:58, 17 November 2016 (UTC)

a bad process
So I am looking at the fake RfC [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Requests_for_comment/Future_of_magic_links here].  At the upper right there is grey box that says &quot;Tracked in Phabricator Task T145604&quot;.

If you click on the link at Task T145604 you arrive [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T145604 here].  

If you look there it says:
The RFC proposes three steps:

*Disable the magic link functionality by default for the MediaWiki 1.28 release, and mark it as deprecated. (approved in [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/E287 E287])
*Deprecate magic links on Wikimedia wikis (e.g. Wikipedia), providing alternatives for this functionality and tools to aid the migration. We agreed to start building these tools in [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/E287 E287].
*Disable magic links functionality a year or so after the MediaWiki 1.28 release (in time for the next MediaWiki LTS release)

Look at [https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/E287 E287].  That is a &quot;meeting&quot; to which five people were apparently invited and twelve &quot;people&quot; (two appear to be bots?) participated.   And it was &quot;decided&quot; to disable the functionality.

That is a bad process. ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 09:49, 16 November 2016 (UTC)
This process is designed for developers to participate in. Just because you don't agree with it doesn't make it a bad process. pecial:Contributions/2607:FEA8:2CA0:251:158D:8228:F3B9:7303|2607:FEA8:2CA0:251:158D:8228:F3B9:7303 (ser talk:2607:FEA8:2CA0:251:158D:8228:F3B9:7303|talk) 11:58, 16 November 2016 (UTC)
I don't understand why you think that the RFC process is &quot;fake&quot;.  What does that mean to you? 
As for &quot;only&quot; five people being invited, the invitation to the Phab calendar item has very little to do with actual invitations.  The seven-person committee in charge of MediaWiki's architecture is invited en masse on the Phab calendar item, but they reply individually, so your &quot;five&quot; invitees is actually ten humans.  But that's just the invitation to the Phab calendar item, which anyone can sign up for.  If you want your name in that list, then just click on &quot;Join this event&quot; in the box on the right-hand side.  This is a standing weekly meeting, and you are welcome to attend if you're interested in the topic for that week.  
The normal invitations are issued outside of Phab.  Technical RFCs are always posted publicly in Phabricator (on a designated, public board) and announced in e-mail (minimum of the general-interest mailing list for MediaWiki software), and typically on wiki as well (automatically listed in a central page).  Every one of those posts constitutes an invitation to the public to participate in the decision, whether during the regular weekly IRC meeting or elsewhere.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:05, 16 November 2016 (UTC)
I do not think it is a significant issue. There is a simple work around. ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk · pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 18:52, 16 November 2016 (UTC)
of course it isn't a huge deal.  this was just one of the only things about the platform we work on that was gratuitously, wonderfully, easy.   it was aptly named.  and now going away because a few developers huddled and found it inelegant.  so yeah, i protest and yeah i know it is pointless.  this is just yet another bump on the ugly tumor that is developer/editor relations here. ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 10:41, 17 November 2016 (UTC)

 I've spent far too many years developing software, so I have some natural sympathy with the devs wanting to rationalise how MediaWiki works (although I'd never admit that to them). But I will remind them that the work that they do is for the benefit of readers and editors, not to massage their own foibles. Anyway, I can see a real practical upside to the changes: When referring to an article in talk pages, other editors sometimes use a pubmed id, while I usually use the form &quot;author year&quot; but there's no quick way to make that linkable if its available via pubmed. I have to link via a url like this: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27751598 Rothberg 2016] - a few of those in one post and the wikitext becomes clogged and unreadable. Optionally I can use a Magic Link: Rothberg 2016 (PMID 27751598), but that's much longer when displayed than I wanted, and again doesn't scale well. The new system will allow me to write mid:27751598|Rothberg 2016 which gives mid:27751598|Rothberg 2016. The ability to pipe a pmid link is a nice improvement, in my humble opinion. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 19:22, 17 November 2016 (UTC)
