Gone are they days when teachers tell students not to use Wikipedia — now the Chinese government feels it needs to issue an official statement when they think we're wrong. Fascinating… Carl Fredrik 💌  12:54, 18 January 2017 (UTC)

Google Translate suggests that this is really just a news piece about that &quot;Acupuncture Now&quot; guy's petition to have the word &quot;pseudoscience&quot; removed from Acupuncture.  I didn't see anything in there that suggested the Chinese government was making an official statement about the article.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 17:09, 18 January 2017 (UTC)

I think what WAID is saying is this is just them writing a story about the &quot;protest&quot; of our content by a group of Chinese medicine practitioners in California.

Copyright at the World Health Organization


Rumour has it that the WHO is moving in house publications to a CC BY SA NC license. IMO moving to a non free, non open license is a very big mistake with long term negative implications for global health. I am looking at starting a change.org petition to increase awareness about this issue. Wondering others thoughts and if people have experience around these petitions? Looking at many of the petitions and they are fairly long. Thinking about something beginning along the lines of:



Doc James (talk ·  · ) 17:44, 20 January 2017 (UTC)

* Isn't the current license &quot;all rights reserved&quot;?  In that case, permitting free use for non-commercial purposes constitutes a significant improvement.
* CC-BY-SA-NC is not generally considered a non-free or non-open license (it's more commonly understood as &quot;partly free&quot;).  The only practical difference between that license and the one we use at Wikipedia is that people wouldn't be allowed to sell copies (e.g., all of those books that compile Wikipedia's contents and try to sell them on Amazon).  People could still use it, share it, and modify it.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 19:27, 20 January 2017 (UTC)
A slight improvement maybe but not a clear improvement. NC is not well defined and thus it is a very poor license. They can and should do better. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 19:46, 20 January 2017 (UTC)
*Support speaking up Creative Commons [https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/freeworks/ says that NC is a non-free license]. Open access as a concept was defined in 2001 and confirmed twice thereafter in the Budapest, Bethesda, and Belin statements. Those 3 B statements all agree that &quot;open access&quot; content must be available for remixing, and all exclude content with non-commercial restrictions as not open access.
If WHO wishes to use non-free, non-open, non-open access licensing, then that is their choice. However, if they choose a non-free license, then I object to them saying that it is free. There is no ambiguity about free and non-free. The Wikipedia community has standing as stewards of free content to inform them of the difference between free and non-free if they need that.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 22:54, 20 January 2017 (UTC)
That page describes the CC licenses as ranging along a continuum from &quot;more open&quot; vs &quot;less open&quot; in the lead graphic, which I think is a reasonable approach.  It may be convenient for certain purposes to draw a line between the &quot;barely free enough to be 'free' (according to my values)&quot; and &quot;slightly too restricted to count as 'free' (according to my values)&quot;, but I think that there is value in remembering that it's a continuum rather than an all-or-nothing state.
Also, the concept for that particular page is based on one organization's definition of licenses.  That page cites their wiki as its source.  Even that organization [http://freedomdefined.org/FAQ#Aren.27t_you_pretty_arrogant_for_wanting_to_decide_for_everyone_what.27s_free.3F agrees that other people might have different views] on what constitutes the essential points for a free license.  Their definition is aimed at &quot;cultural works&quot;, e.g., artwork and software.  I'm not convinced that the WHO's publications are cultural works; they're certainly not the kind of things mentioned in that org's examples.  (I might be more inclined to wonder why the WHO is trying to restrict commercial use, but is willing to accept all derivatives – including derivatives that say exactly the opposite of the original, but still attribute WHO for the content – but that's a bit off-topic.)  WhatamIdoing (talk) 02:37, 21 January 2017 (UTC)
*support speaking up as well per Blue Rasberry--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 23:11, 20 January 2017 (UTC)
*Comment Speaking strictly in my volunteer capacity (just in case that is not clear), I like the idea of a petition, but would STRONGLY encourage people NOT to use Change.org. There is a long history of privacy abuses from them, and many organizations I have worked with or for over the years have banned use of them by their staffs and consultants. There are other tools available from organizations like MoveOn.org that have a privacy stance more aligned with our movement's. Basically, Change.org is a for profit entity and they very much behave that way when it comes to you helping them collect thousands of emails. All of that said, I can offer from my own experience that petitions done well do help. That said, what are you going to do with all those signatures and all those emails becomes a reasonable question from people less familiar with this type of process. :) --Varnent (talk)() 02:58, 21 January 2017 (UTC)

 has expertise in copyrights. 
* I'd be in support of speaking up. Not sure a petition — or what petition platform if any — would be best for that. Perhaps something like a well-crafted and well-publicized blog post could be more effective? Some years ago, I co-wrote a paper on the effects of -NC licenses on sharing biodiversity information (the central section is [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3234435/#__sec4title here]), and while outdated in some respects (e.g. at the time, CC licenses 4.0 were still under discussion), I think the effects that -NC licenses have on sharing have not changed much since, and while we had focused on biodiversity, most of the arguments should hold in medical contexts as well. -- Daniel Mietchen (talk)  06:37, 21 January 2017 (UTC)
*I'm happy to be part of any petition or other effort to try and get them to reconsider. I've read your paper  — and I've recommended it to others because it encapsulates the issues well. It might be high time for a look into these issues on a more general basis. We could always try drafting a letter to the WHO bulletin, and maybe following that up with a paper on the effect of different CC-licences. Carl Fredrik 💌  16:39, 21 January 2017 (UTC)

After a second look I've cleared out some copyvio and removed some unsourced content. The disease is rare enough to not exist on Orphanet, so I don't think we'll get much further as expanding the article. If someone is willing there may be some more information at GERD or on Pubmed.

However the image used at the article is questionable. I'm not able to verify it, or know anyone who could. I'm unsure whether to include it, even though we allow some degree of  in images. Linked here:

For encyclopedic purposes, what matters is that it &quot;looks like&quot; these are kids with this condition.  A completely fake image that &quot;looks like&quot; someone with the condition would still be educational.  But we care about privacy issues, too, and for that purpose, it'd be nice to have more information.  Given the rarity of the condition, if there's a non-profit group for this specific condition, or even a support group on Facebook about this condition, then it might be possible to confirm this.

Notable cases — Hyperthropic cardiomyopathy

I've just been advised about this language when  removed (and then re-removed after being reverted) the entire list of notable cases from Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a sourced list that has been in the article for years. I find this particularly troubling in this case because the disease is known to the public at large mainly because of such notable cases, especially (though not exclusively) cases of sports figures whose lives, or careers, have been ended by the disease.  Removing this sourced content substantially diminishes the encyclopedic value of the article for many readers.  Alternatively, I could contemplate moving the sourced items in the list to a separate article as is suggested in the last paragraph of , but wholesale elimination would do no one a favor here. --Arxiloxos (talk) 18:14, 23 January 2017 (UTC)

On horses and barn doors

I've been thinking about our article on Cancer.  It's probably obvious that, if you got a melanoma diagnosis yesterday, that putting on sunscreen tomorrow isn't going to cure the cancer.  But people in the field do see people try all sorts of similar things.  Not only does the melanoma patient start using sunscreen and wearing hats (twenty years too late), but the people who blame their diagnosis on diet (a typical response among at least Americans, even for cancers that have little connection to diet) will go on unprocessed-organic-vegetable-juice-cleanse kind of diet.  People decide that quitting tobacco will cure lung cancer, that removing mercury-containing dental fillings will cure colon cancer, and all of these other things.

Now, I get the motivation:  People are trying to create a measure of control, and at the point of diagnosis, one of the few things that they have control over is what they put in their mouths (whether that be food, alcoholic beverages, or cigarettes).  I assume that their oncologists are advising them about the things that actually matter (e.g., most breast cancer patients should stop taking estrogen-containing hormones).

But I think it would be educational and appropriate to call out this kind of irrational reaction and the fallacy of assuming that actions which are useful for preventing cancer are helpful for curing cancer.

My problem:  How would you source that?  I don't expect to be able to find a systematic review on the pointlessness of trying to use sunscreen to cure melanoma.  Also, is it true in all cases?  Maybe if your alcohol consumption triggered liver cancer (and if you correctly identified that as the cause), then laying off the sauce would prolong your life, even if removing alcohol from your diet doesn't directly kill the existing cancer cells.

What do you think?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 05:42, 23 January 2017 (UTC)

On sources, there probably aren't systematic reviews on the subject, but I would imagine there are physcology related articles out there that comment at least in part on the topic of how people mentally process cancer diagnoses. If anyone has some aptitude in that field to ferret out such a source (my really quick lit search didn't shout anything obvious), it would be worth adding.

You often end up with a field effect as well as those with the cancer often have a generic predisposition. 
So if you have had a melanoma removed. Using sunscreen going forwards would likely be beneficial. 
The question is being studied for the HPV vaccine and cervical cancer. I think the data for that is unclear right now. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 02:18, 25 January 2017 (UTC)
Axl, that's why I'm asking this question here.  Thanks for that link, which reports things like doubling survival time (e.g., from 14 months for smokers to 28 months for non-smokers). 
James, using sunscreen going forwards is going to prevent new skin cancers.  It's not going to cure the old one (which may not be removable).  HPV's another interesting case, because the vaccine could be considered a form of anti-cancer immunotherapy.  Thanks for thinking of that and sharing it.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 08:40, 25 January 2017 (UTC)
There is a large health psychology literature that is relevant here. As above, there's probably not many systematic reviews, but MEDRS allows us to go beyond systematic reviews in this context.
There are many lifestyle changes that do improve prognosis, like stopping smoking (as above), exercise (systematic reviews include: Lahart IM, Metsios GS, Nevill AM, Carmichael AR. Physical activity, risk of death and recurrence in breast cancer survivors: A systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiological studies. Acta Oncol. 2015;54(5):635-654; Schmid D, Leitzmann MF. Association between physical activity and mortality among breast cancer and colorectal cancer survivors: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Annals of Oncology. 2014;25(7):1293-1311) and dietary changes.
But there are also many things cancer patients do that do not have any benefit (see [https://www.mja.com.au/journal/1996/165/10/patterns-alternative-medicine-use-cancer-patients here] and [http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199906033402206#t=article here]).
[http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02895166 This] is a useful review. [http://ascopubs.org/doi/abs/10.1200/JCO.2002.20.4.1017 This] is also good, saying most diagnosed with breast cancer make dietary changes, but mostly those dietary changes are good.

Since the image in question is basically a traced copy of a diagram produced by the CDC (copying some of the CDC's inaccuracies, such as the wrong trachea:bronchi lengths, and adding a few inaccuracies that are both inapparent to non-healthcare folks and probably easy to correct, such as the right and left bronchial trees being exact mirror images), I think it's going to be hard to convince Commons to delete it.

Hunter(talk•) 04:24, 14 January 2017 (UTC)

Hi, I don't belong to this WikiProject but writing here to say thanks to  for taking time to replace all appearances of the inaccurate image with the correct one, because images should be accurate first, and pretty (as in smooth or vectorized) comes second. However,  and overwriting of the SVG with a raster were not something I would be willing to let pass, and I've reverted them. (Rather, first, talk directly to the admin who closed it to appeal the decision. Also, if the better version is a raster, then upload it independently as a raster, not as a bad SVG!) To answer your question, Adrian, SVG is a vector format. It's like trying to draw in PowerPoint, rather than painting in Photoshop. SVGs consist of multiple objects independent from each other, and the object can be a raster graphic if you want it to (though not recommended). CFCF's overwrite consisted of a SVG file that has a huge raster object that covers the whole canvas. That is a terrible way to make SVG (defeats the whole purpose) and also a terrible . 朝彦 | Asahiko (talk) 05:32, 15 January 2017 (UTC)
 — I'm so tired of the stupidity of commons. This image should have been deleted and there is no reason to keep it — yet a bizarre overturn of a nearly 20 to 1 consensus was made. I overwrote the image with the raster because it is damaging to keep this image on commons. There is a similar concept to  on commons, and by reverting the overwritten file you are being disruptive. Carl Fredrik 💌  10:29, 15 January 2017 (UTC)
 It is my understanding that my actions were well within project rules. If you need to raise a complaint, I ask that you also respect the rules in doing so, and refrain from actions such as reverting an admin DR closure or performing actions that violate guidelines. --朝彦 | Asahiko (talk) 11:33, 15 January 2017 (UTC)
Policy is never an excuse to prohibit actions that help the encyclopedia. This is the very spirit of , and it trumps guidelines in being one of the 5 central pillars. Neither do we run a bureaucracy, and unless you had a reason beyond following policy to revert my actions it was incorrect. Policy is never to be applied for its own sake, only when it may result in helping the project — this is a clear case of misuse of policy. Carl Fredrik 💌  11:49, 15 January 2017 (UTC)
 The images were replaced with the more accurate JPEG, and since the image no longer appears in the main namespace i.e. the encyclopedia proper, the rules are not in the way of your improving the encyclopedia. This is not the right occasion to bring out IAR. 朝彦 | Asahiko (talk) 12:03, 15 January 2017 (UTC)
4th deletion nomination
*
I have for a fourth time nominated this image for deletion. I implore all previous commenters to comment on the discussion page, pinging all those who commented here: , , , , , , . If I missed anyone it was unintentional, and I appreciate if others ping them as well.

This image is dangerous because it is reused over and over again despite the clear notices of inaccuracy. The Commons administrators are in clear violation of their own  policy. Putting it on the image-blacklist on en-wiki will do nothing to stop it from being used on other Wikipedias. Carl Fredrik 💌  10:37, 15 January 2017 (UTC)

Rather than endlessly debate this one image, I think it would be more productive to address the root of the problem, which is that the culture and policies at Commons are overly tolerant of inaccuracy.   made a valiant attempt [https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Commons:Deletion_requests/File:Diagrama_de_los_pulmones.svg&amp;diff=228519001&amp;oldid=228515686 here] to argue that policy supports the deletion of inaccurate images, but this is apparently not how Commons admins interpret policy.  Perhaps we could start a proposal at  that  should make it clear that that very inaccurate images cannot be useful for an educational purpose.  Adrian J. Hunter(talk•) 13:13, 15 January 2017 (UTC)
Adrian, I fixed (added a prefix) to two of your links to Commons so that it works. Also thanks for proposing a step in the constructive direction. 朝彦 | Asahiko (talk) 13:23, 15 January 2017 (UTC) 



I just don't think you all are understanding the EDUSE policy.  Here's the most relevant section:

A media file that is in use on one of the other projects of the Wikimedia Foundation is considered automatically to be useful for an educational purpose, as is a file in use for some operational reason such as within a template or the like. Such a file is not liable to deletion simply because it may be of poor quality: if it is in use, that is enough.


You're jumping up and down saying &quot;it's poor quality!  it's poor quality!  it's poor quality!&quot;  And they keep telling you:  Their policy directly says to completely ignore quality in these cases.  As Adrian says, you would have to first get the policy changed, to say that inaccurate images aren't useful (except for all the times that they are, e.g., at photo manipulation and Wikiversity, etc.).  WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:55, 15 January 2017 (UTC)
This isn't a viable interpretation of policy. The only current use is on archaic pages for the 2008 picture of the year competition. If we go by this reading any image can be kept as long as there is any use on any project, even userspace usage. This flies in the face of other policies, and opens for people uploading thousands of images of their genitals which won't be deleted as long as they're on a userpage somewhere. This is inane. This shouldn't demands a change in policy, just a sane interpretation of it. Carl Fredrik 💌  18:23, 15 January 2017 (UTC)
Userspace usage is explicitly excluded as EDUSE at .
I guess it comes down to what we mean by &quot;poor quality&quot;.  I can understand that images that are in use should not be deleted just because the focus is slightly out, or the lighting is not quite right, or the subject is looking away from the camera; such images aren't actively harmful.  But to me, an inaccurate image should be a far greater concern in a project that aims to be educational.  Commons policy needs to explicitly distinguish inaccurate images from those that are simply suboptimal. Adrian J. Hunter(talk•) 18:47, 15 January 2017 (UTC)
Also, I don't know what Commons' usual policy is about &quot;gaming&quot;  by first blanking all the uses, and then declaring that it should be deleted because it's not used.  It might be a problem; it might be standard and accepted behavior.  I just don't know what their view is on that subject.  Here, you'd probably have someone screaming at you (e.g., exactly what happens when someone does that for ).  I suppose that we're going to find out.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 00:59, 16 January 2017 (UTC)
It's hardly gaming, and  I suggest you read the previous very lengthy deletion discussion before casting aspersions. Carl Fredrik 💌  08:15, 16 January 2017 (UTC)
&quot;Gaming&quot; is exactly what we call this behavior here, when someone removes templates from use and then nominates the template for deletion on the grounds that it's not being used.  As I said, I have no idea whether Commons feels the same about this behavior.  They have very different goals and standards. 
I have already read the (three) previous deletion discussions.  You may have noticed, for example, that I've left three comments in the deletion discussions so far.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 17:31, 16 January 2017 (UTC)
I don't think there was any deliberate gaming.  I was the one who replaced the images, whereas it was CFCF (Carl Fredrik) who renominated the image for deletion, and he didn't mention that the image was no longer in use in his deletion nomination.  I don't think he was even aware I'd replaced the images when he made the nomination, hence my ping to him near the end of the section above. Adrian J. Hunter(talk•) 02:10, 17 January 2017 (UTC)

 — feel free to change it yourself. Ranking is not rocket-surgery, the worst that will happen is that someone will change it back to B (though likely they wont). Classification is more or less used to keep track of which articles need work, and you're as good a judge of that as any of us. Probably far better than most of us seeing if you have a doctorate in psychology. (I'm not aware of any active psychiatrists here, and even if we had any the article is about psychology.)

Thanks from a patient - message from OTRS

At   a reader writes, &quot;The most helpful article was from wikimedia, after reading the diagnosis table I realised I had (medical condition). I went to the hospital, listed the symptoms and I was admitted on the spot...&quot;

I cannot say that this is typical but these kinds of messages do come in to OTRS with some regularity. OTRS is a way to send messages to Wikipedia by email. A problem with it is that emails are copyrighted and OTRS is confidential by default, so many people who wish to share information with a group (like Wikipedia's medical editors, in this case) often do not get the message just because it is uncertain whether the message can be shared.

I wanted to share the fact of this here to raise the issue that people use Wikipedia in all kinds of ways, and they get all kinds of results (no idea about good or bad), and that many communication channels which seem to have messages for WikiProjects do not actually connect and sometimes drop the communication exchange without making the conversation connection. In this case, I just thanked the reader for their comment and told them I would pass the information along.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 16:41, 1 February 2017 (UTC)

 It went to &quot;info-en&quot;. Anyone can write to &quot;info@wikimedia.org&quot; and have their language sorted, but individual languages are supposed to promote &quot;info-en@wikimedia.org&quot;. Most people with OTRS access for a Wikipedia get this info queue for their language. In that queue volunteers may subdivide tasks by sorting letters. A letter without a request, like this one, may go into the &quot;courtesy&quot; queue. So the answer is either &quot;info-en&quot; or &quot;courtesy&quot;, but I forgot which.

Bot glitch replaced descriptions at Wikidata

ProteinBoxBot has been providing a simple description (&quot;Human disease&quot;) for many diseases on Wikidata.  Unfortunately, due to an unintentional coding issue, it's been over-writing human-created descriptions.  This was reported last week and immediately fixed.  Please feel to replace any descriptions you've written there.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 08:12, 23 January 2017 (UTC)
that is one destructive bot - same one that did the &quot;drugs used to treat&quot; fiasco.  I gave up watching wikidata. Jytdog (talk) 09:19, 23 January 2017 (UTC)
Who's in charge of running that bot? If it keeps breaking things we ought to get a group to vet all its actions before it is allowed to run any scripts. Carl Fredrik 💌  09:28, 23 January 2017 (UTC)
The owners are presumably listed on the bot's talk page.  
(As I recall, the &quot;drugs used to treat&quot; information turned out to be both accurate and sourced – just not what we want [e.g., listing individual drugs used to manage symptoms rather than the main categories of curative treatments.)  WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:46, 23 January 2017 (UTC)
Your memory is both short and dead wrong.  You already forgot all the shit from CHEMBL that was added both to drug article and to disease articles?   There is no such things as  &quot;alternative facts&quot; and a  hit on a screen is not a  &quot;drug used to treat&quot; in the real world.   Jytdog (talk) 15:16, 24 January 2017 (UTC)
 They were certainly sourced, but that's an interesting new use of the word &quot;accurate&quot; that I hadn't come across before (as Arthur Dent would put it). It included all sorts of results, including things like people taking statins long term to lower cholesterol had statistically slightly better outcomes if they developed pneumonia. That was sufficient for the source to conclude that statins are used to &quot;treat&quot; pneumonia. &quot;Treat&quot;? really? That's like Humpty Dumpty saying &quot;When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean – neither more nor less.&quot; --RexxS (talk) 17:18, 23 January 2017 (UTC)
This is  or here, . These are our friends from Gene Wiki. Most wiki edits in the health sciences to most wiki articles in the health sciences on English Wikipedia have been made by this group - 200k on enwp and 5 million in Wikidata. The future of Wikipedia might include an automated component. I agree that everything from bots has to be right.
I am sure the team would welcome any criticism, and also welcome better policy development to guide them on what is and is not appropriate. It is not tolerable to have bots make poor edits but I also am not ready to make calls against software development without some attempts at mutual understanding. The Gene Wiki people are easy enough to reach by phone, video chat, email, on-wiki, etc.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 15:02, 24 January 2017 (UTC)
I have given up on engaging Wikidata for now.  People can unilaterally change essential things like field definitions (see [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property_talk:P703 here] for example -- there is no process involved, and no process to discuss.. and no sense of database design and thinking through how fields fit together in ways that facilitate useful queries.  That is insane.  Not to mention people running amok with bots. 
Databases are not like articles; everything is much more binary - the database as a whole is valid and based on good design and careful processes, or it isn't.  If it isn't, you cannot trust what comes out of it - it is &quot;garbage out&quot;.   The more work people do adding garbage mixed with valid information and changing field definitions willy-nilly, the multiple-more work people have to do later to find the garbage and remove it. The problem is getting worse every day.  (I have dealt with building databases and the painstaking work of cleaning data.  The cleaning is tedious and painstaking, and the more data there is, the longer it takes and the harder it is maintain focus and quality in the data-cleaning effort itself).  I will probably resist any effort to integrate WD more with WP:MED content until that project is way more mature.  Jytdog (talk) 15:50, 24 January 2017 (UTC)
 I agree with your descriptions of the problems. What you say is correct. I understand why you would resist and I think that your opposition is useful. We can accept nothing but good contributions and bot contributions have to meet quality standards, which they often do not.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 17:02, 24 January 2017 (UTC)

Hello folks, speaking for the ProteinBoxBot team here. Let me provide a bit of context and history.  Since ~2007, our team has been keeping the infoboxes on pages for human genes/proteins up to date.  For many years, we have been making those edits using our  account.  Our bot synced data from many source databases, and populated infoboxes here on Wikipedia using .  When Wikidata transclusion became possible, we made plans to convert our bot so that gene/protein data would be written to wikidata, and the relevant content would be queried from there.  This was not a trivial change.  We spent months (or more) tweaking the data model on Wikidata so that our imported data would properly represented.  Once we were confident in the result (and only then), we reimplemented our gene/protein template as  -- same presentation, but using data drawn from wikidata.  This conversion was done in stages (completed ~ May 2016), and everything was announced and coordinated with .

In addition to adding gene/protein data to Wikidata, we are also interested in adding content related to human diseases and drugs.  (This data has value for us even outside of its potential use on WP.)  We have been importing data from commonly used sources in the biomedical research community.  This process is still ongoing, and as for gene/protein data, it's also not a trivial process.  The data modeling and the bot coding are both continually getting better, and we always appreciate input from both the WD and WP community on how to improve things.  However, we have never made any claims about being fully confident enough for them to appear in templates like  or .  If we ever did want to propose using wikidata as a resource, we would certain to coordinate with  and/or .  Bottom line, we fully support the important oversight role that the wikiprojects play, and fully support applying a very critical eye to transcluding wikidata content.  We take no offense if the verdict is that wikidata content is not mature enough yet, but we also ask not to be &quot;blamed&quot; anytime people outside of our team use wikidata content without consulting us or the relevant wikiproject.  Cheers, Andrew Su (talk) 18:20, 24 January 2017 (UTC)
Thanks . I really appreciate that among all the teams and projects which have been invited to Wikipedia to collaborate, you and the Gene Wiki team have been among the few to actually try to learn the terms of the Wikipedia community, and make constructive contributions, and be available for conversation over the years, and thoughtfully and directly respond to criticism. Gene Wiki has been a model collaboration with Wikipedia dating back to 2008 when practically no one else had much faith in Wikipedia or what we are attempting here. I appreciate your continued interest, innovation, and will to be open to conversation.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 18:43, 24 January 2017 (UTC)

The only downside I can see is that it might be hard to tease out the therapies that work only for one kind of CP.  Thoughts, please?  , , all?  -- (talk) 11:42, 6 February 2017 (UTC)
The Management section of the main article is probably too large currently so I agree with your proposal to merge to the subarticle and repurpose it as a more general management article. Matthew Ferguson (talk) 19:57, 6 February 2017 (UTC)

For the last couple of months, the first sentence of Alternative medicine has amounted to &quot;AltMed is anything that's not truly scientific medicine&quot;.

It looks like the gynecomastia claim has been partially restored, but with an elderly (1993) source.  http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/18/8/2133.long is one of the few relatively recent reviews to discuss this, and it seems that gynecomastia is accepted as a known side effect (mind the gap between 'accepted' and 'actually has good evidence behind it').

Chronic stress - what is it?

Is chronic stress a sort of quasi-condition, and we should treat it like that per MEDMOS and have signs/symptoms, pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, epidemiology, etc?

Or is it a physiological state - just an extension in time of stress (biology)?

Am asking b/c popular press discussing health definitely treats like it is a condition and there is a bunch of biomedical literature that comes darn close, but as far as I know this is not defined in DSM or ICD (which does have, however [http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2016/en#/Z56.3 Stressful work schedule] under occupational things)

It seems like it is becoming something, kind of like lipid levels themselves became something to manage.  But with chronic stress there are no well defined biomarkers as far as I know. 

Went through a bunch of crap in the fall with a class trying to edit Chronic stress and treating it like a disease, which has led me to ponder this.

What kind of beast is this? Jytdog (talk) 19:20, 7 February 2017 (UTC)
[http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/understanding-chronic-stress.aspx]--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 02:56, 8 February 2017 (UTC)
Perhaps it's more about long-term psychological stress than long-term biological stress. 
I'm thinking about how people talk about this concept.  You never hear someone describing a pleasant, voluntary activity that is hard on the body, such as dancing, as &quot;chronic stress&quot; – even though it's physically stressful to the point that some professional dancers end up with significant disabilities.  But you do hear people talking about the &quot;chronic stress&quot; of caring for a disabled person, even when that care requires no extra physical effort.  You could be a thousand miles away from Grandma and still experience chronic stress from trying to coordinate her care from a distance.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 05:03, 8 February 2017 (UTC)
i think part of why people find the &quot;chronic stress&quot; paradigm so compelling is that it grounds consequences of long-term negative emotional stuff in the body in a very science-y way and makes psychological stress into physical &quot;poison&quot; that effects all kinds of body systems (overactive HPA axis and the harms and all that). The alt-med, the mindfulness people, and bodywork people talk about this all the time.  
I've seen the [[http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/understanding-chronic-stress.aspx APA link] that Ozzie provided and it discusses &quot;chronic stress&quot; like it is a condition: &quot;Research has shown that chronic stress can be treated with appropriate interventions such as lifestyle and behavior change, therapy, and in some situations, medication&quot;  But again, no DSM or ICD code that i can find.  hm Jytdog (talk) 18:10, 8 February 2017 (UTC)

PR Newswire
IMO it is time to simply remove all links to PR Newswire. They are a re-publisher of press releases and are a good marker of spam / paid editing. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 02:48, 9 February 2017 (UTC)
I'll step up and say that there are times when I use that source for content about the history of a drug or a company when I have good refs for some early step and some later step but none for an intermediate step in the story; in other words with good reason.  a whole passage sourced solely to press releases is not acceptable under a bunch of policies and guidelines. Jytdog (talk) 02:59, 9 February 2017 (UTC)
The content and distribution targets of PR Newswire are organized, composed and paid by the private sponsor, or in other words, the 'news' becomes a self-published advertisement. I'd agree with removing its links per  and , especially for WP medical topics. Should it also be abolished from Talk pages? I don't think [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hypertension#New_treatment_possibility_if_results_confirmed.3F_.28Press_release.29 this,] for example, serves any useful purpose for the Hypertension article. --Zefr (talk) 03:12, 9 February 2017 (UTC)

I assume that you're using &quot;reality&quot; to mean &quot;scientific facts&quot;.  &quot;We hired X person&quot; is also reality – and a reality that will be very desirable news from the POV of X's landlord.  ;-)  WhatamIdoing (talk) 22:43, 9 February 2017 (UTC)
No.  We should not systematically remove these links.  They're press releases;  is perfectly valid for some statements.  You should no more systematically remove press releases (written by a company's publicity department) than should should systematically remove websites (written by that same publicity department).  Self-published sources are perfectly reliable sources for some (limited) purposes.  Those purposes include factual statements about an organization's size, staff members, finances, and some types of legal and political actions (e.g., a quotation from the CEO about why they filed a lawsuit).  If you'd accept the organization's own blog, website, SEC filings, annual report, or other publications for a given statement, then you should accept their press releases (and vice versa).  WhatamIdoing (talk) 22:43, 9 February 2017 (UTC)
[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aobiome-launches-phase-2-clinical-trial-using-novel-bacterial-platform-for-treatment-of-hypertension-300379483.html This is the PR Newswire release] that initiated this discussion and displays why such a source is not , but rather is , as it is just the beginning of a Phase II trial. The release contains misleading, early-stage information, such as its drug candidate can &quot;repopulate the microbiome with ammonia oxidizing bacteria to lower blood pressure&quot; and &quot;anti-inflammatory properties of our bacterial platform&quot; – results which have not been proven yet and are the objective of the trial series – so should be seen as promotional news only and non-compliant with MEDRS. --Zefr (talk) 22:55, 9 February 2017 (UTC)
Yes that was a fine revert with the tools we already have - of course that should have been reverted!  WAID, that is the kind of thing i (sloppily) referred to with &quot;reality&quot;. :)  You are right that deals and hiring people are real. Jytdog (talk) 23:53, 9 February 2017 (UTC)
Zefr, that is a perfectly fine source for some very limited purposes, most significantly including statements like &quot;In December 2016, the company announced that it would conduct a Phase 2 clinical trial of its live bacteria product (B244) for the treatment of hypertension&quot; and &quot;the company reported in December 2016 that it completed a two-week study of its live bacteria product for acne&quot;.
If it weren't for SYNTH, we could also use it as a source to say that the company is buzzword compliant.  ;-)  WhatamIdoing (talk) 17:24, 10 February 2017 (UTC)

My concerns is just because someone has published a lot of press releases about themselves or their company does not make them notable. I guess I should say press releases including those published by Newswire cannot be used to show notability and if that is ALL the refs present the article should be deleted. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 03:23, 10 February 2017 (UTC)
I agree, which is why press releases are #1 in the list of stuff that doesn't count towards notability at .  They are also called out, by name, as non-proof of notability in the . 
Because of , your test for deletion doesn't work.  If some newbie cites press releases, advertisements, and the company's website, but could have cited The Wall Street Journal and The Times, then the business is still notable.  But if regional news attention doesn't exist, then of course it's not notable.  (Anyone working in this area will want to note that  specifically limits the use of 'hometown' newspapers, because the biggest employers in any small town will always be discussed in the local newspaper.)

 I looked it over and the prose looks clean of explicitly promotional material.

These company sources could be removed without harming the article. --Mark viking (talk) 20:06, 2 February 2017 (UTC)

 Thank you for bringing this up here, and I would appreciate some scientific/medical editors looking at this. Sorry if I got the procedure wrong. The citations I looked at seemed to be to either be unreachable by easy means, some were only tangentially connected to the subject, and some downright dubious (I deleted off a citation to a very questionable 1969 experiment on just one child, a 7 year child with severe learning disabilities in an orphanage).

MEDRS source?

 and I disagree on whether [http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic this] should be considered a MEDRS source for biomedical content about dietary supplements and nutrients.  Thoughts? Jytdog (talk) 03:21, 11 February 2017 (UTC)
Looks like these are review articles. I guess my question is, are they considered peer reviewed and &quot;independent&quot; as per MEDRS. Here is a quote pasted from the Oregonstate website: &quot;For each article, Ph.D. nutrition scientists critically review and synthesize basic, clinical, and epidemiological studies in the peer-reviewed literature and provide references throughout. Each article is then additionally reviewed by an expert in the field; the names of the authors and reviewers are listed at the bottom of each article. This multiple review process minimizes bias and presents objective information.&quot; http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/about JenOttawa (talk) 03:45, 11 February 2017 (UTC)
On the garlic article, for example, I see that the PhD's are all from the same institute, and the expert from the field is a research director at https://www.niim.com.au/ I am not familiar enough with these institutes to contribute any more. Will follow with interest. Thanks. JenOttawa (talk) 03:50, 11 February 2017 (UTC)
Is this the only source that presents this information?  Do we have any reason to believe that other sources contradict it? 
If there's no good reason to worry about the actual content, then arguing over the exact source that gets cited in the article may not be the best use of anyone's time.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:43, 11 February 2017 (UTC)
It is very hard to find consistently reliable sources about health effects for this kind of thing like nutrients, vitamins, etc. For pete's sake. Jytdog (talk) 18:19, 11 February 2017 (UTC)
The highest standard of MEDRS explained within  pertaining to individual nutrients and dietary antioxidants is from the US Institute of Medicine (IOM) which employs a multi-expert panel of US and Canadian academics to write the Dietary Reference Intakes, [https://www.nap.edu/read/9810/chapter/1#xvi dietary antioxidants here.] Of note concerning this discussion about phytochemicals vs. true dietary antioxidants (only vitamins A-C-E) and the role of the Linus Pauling Institute (LPI) at Oregon State University, [http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/dietary-factors/phytochemicals example systematic review on phytochemicals here,] is that LPI faculty member and vitamin E expert, [http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/faculty-staff/maret-traber Dr. Maret Traber,] is on the IOM panel. Rather than WP users having to navigate the comprehensive reviews on nutrients by IOM, the LPI reviews seem considerably more consumer-friendly, yet are sufficiently rigorous for MEDRS to me. --Zefr (talk) 18:48, 11 February 2017 (UTC)
My assessment is that these reviews are MEDRS-compatible but not all that authoritative.  If information in published review papers contradicts them, it should trump them.  It is particularly worth noting that Linus Pauling was notorious for fringe views concerning nutrition, so an institute named after him should be scrutinized closely. Looie496 (talk) 15:08, 12 February 2017 (UTC)
 in my view the site (and you can compare [http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/vitamins/vitamin-E LPI's Vitamin E article] to [http://umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/supplement/vitamin-e UMD's Vitamin E article] to see what i mean here)
* provides reviews of the literature on dietary supplements, phytochemicals, etc that are kept up to date (the IOM ref linked above is from 2000)
* has summaries that are generally science-based (little to no explicit woo) and usually assign WEIGHT as we would (e.g for essential nutrients, deficiencies are generally discussed first); organized like a WP article with LEAD and body
* is online/open access
* is well cited with in-line refs. 
* is written in language that is a bit science heavy (managed with hyperlinks to definitions, however)
* however the summaries they write are pretty in-bubble (coming from the place: &quot;there is something useful here and with more research we will find it!&quot;), surprisingly downplay risks, and sometimes overemphasize core woo principles..  For instance in the LEAD of the LPI Vitamin E article
** the 2nd bullet is about antioxidant-ness, and the 3rd bullet is deficiency, which is backwards and woo-oriented (the UMD site handles this better, actually, giving much more WEIGHT to deficiency)
** the 5th bullet says &quot;Randomized controlled trials investigating primary and/or secondary prevention of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and cataracts, do not currently support a preventative effect of supplemental α-tocopherol&quot;  which fails to mention the two large prospective clinical trials that found Vitamin E supplementation increases the risk of cancer instead of preventing it.  Those trials are discussed down in the body, but the lack of mention in the lead is very disappointing.  The UMD article also doesn't discuss the risks, but is much more woo about the &quot;possibility&quot; of cancer prevention saying only &quot;Antioxidants may provide protection against serious diseases including heart disease and cancer&quot; -- not discussing the lack of good evidence for that to date much less the risks.  
* both the LPI and UMD sites are more like edited books that a peer-reviewed journal.  Neither are &quot;major medical/scientific bodies&quot; as we usually consider them.   Not great with respect to our normal MEDRS analysis.  A bit like Science-based Medicine in that regard, but tending over on the woo/quackademic medicine side (UMD farther than LPI)
for me the LPI is better, but not much better than UMD.   Both are very &quot;in-bubble&quot; (saying that more rigorously, are invested in the hypothesis that there is &quot;something&quot; there in these natural products/alt med) , UMD moreso than LPI. Jytdog (talk) 20:02, 12 February 2017 (UTC)

If you question a woo-pushing source and the other editor insists on keeping using it, what will you possibly be able to say to them that will not contradict the position you are taking here?  Please be patient and let's get a sense of the WP:MED consensus on this. Jytdog (talk) 23:09, 12 February 2017 (UTC)
For those of us watching the phytochemical and nutrient literature for sourcing in WP articles, you summarized it yourself yesterday: &quot;It is very hard to find consistently reliable sources about health effects for this kind of thing like nutrients, vitamins, etc.&quot; We are unlikely to find peer-assessed journal reviews or meta-analyses on individual non-nutrient phytochemicals (their organ and cellular fates in vivo cannot be defined). Likely for the same reason, government bodies like the IOM/FDA or EFSA do not publish guidance documents on phytochemicals except to regulate what cannot be stated on food labels. We are left with food science groups at universities like LPI, UMD or [http://nutrition.ucdavis.edu/info/ UC-Davis] publishing discussions of nutrients and phytochemicals. Among them, LPI is the most extensive I know for covering relevant literature and maintaining neutrality within limits of interpretation we would see in any secondary review article. So far, we have 5 discussants in this thread, with no dissents against using the LPI sites. That is reasonable agreement per . --Zefr (talk) 23:33, 12 February 2017 (UTC)
No one has explicitly endorsed this either.  Again you are acting just like a woo-pushing editor would do. Please be patient. It will be a happy thing if we can get explicit consensus to use this widely (and if we don't, then we shouldn't) Jytdog (talk) 23:42, 12 February 2017 (UTC)
I feel that it is better to air on the side of caution when inserting information into wikipedia. If there is a risk that the source may be biased, I feel it would be better to not insert this information until a more reliable source is found. I would not feel comfortable using this site in my edits, from what I have read so far and from Jytdog's observations re &quot;invested in the hypothesis&quot;.JenOttawa (talk) 03:13, 13 February 2017 (UTC)
Well, Linus Pauling was interested in the hypothesis that mega-dosing Vitamin C had health benefits, but he's been dead for more than 20 years.  I don't know whether his POV has adherents among any of the current researchers there.
From the diff posted above, it appears that much of the material being inserted says things like there's no evidence that phytochemical supplements prevents cancer or do anything else useful.  I kind of doubt that anybody's worried about that kind of content.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 04:12, 13 February 2017 (UTC)

 The first thing I did was look at the site's coverage of vitamin C, and despite its connections to Pauling and his well known hypotheses, I found it agreeably neutral in its treatment of the many issues. In general, it seems to present  issues rather baldly, but provides the sources it examines related to them. I can't say that the conclusions it reaches would stand the test of using MEDRS-sourcing, because it rather uncritically (IMHO) endorses conclusions of primary studies, without seeming to apply any critical analysis of those sources – which is what I would expect a good secondary source to do. Without the rationale for why it accepts particular studies, we are left with the authority of its contributors and its editorial policies to give us confidence in its conclusions, and I don't think that is going to be good enough in every case. My view would be that it's fine for uncontroversial statements (but then other MEDRS-sources are likely to be available), and especially for the &quot;Further reading&quot; section of articles, where it could serve as a tertiary source by giving editors leads to other relevant sources. Disclaimer: I take 500 mg of vitamin C as a daily supplement, so you may have to take my views with a pinch of salt (or at least with a pinch of calcium ascorbate) --RexxS (talk) 18:07, 13 February 2017 (UTC)

Parkinson's disease BMJ review

A while ago, I asked BMJ to provide reviewers for Parkinson's disease, which they did.

Article class&amp;importance rating

Hi,

I just noticed the large backlog of &gt;1000 unrated medical articles. I realise that it's largely busywork (most of them will turn out to be low importance stub/start articles), however it is still pretty useful to have them categorised. I've started going through some of the genetics and biochem-related ones.

*A few are spam in need of nominating for deletion. 
*Nearly all the rest are of low importance.
Still good for us to review them all. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 15:24, 16 February 2017 (UTC)
Also thinking that well medications that are or once were in medical us should be within the scope of WPMED, those that were never used clinically should not (they should be just WP PHARM). Others thoughts? Doc James (talk ·  · ) 03:21, 17 February 2017 (UTC)
yes, agree those articles would do better as WP PHARM(pharmacology)--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 11:17, 17 February 2017 (UTC) 
With respect to medical journals happy to have them just in . Others thoughts? Doc James (talk ·  · ) 06:22, 17 February 2017 (UTC)
well, journals are (IMO) an important part of medicine(especially research) therefore I would think it best to be WP MED and .  --Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 11:23, 17 February 2017 (UTC)
Anatomy is an important part of medicine as are hospitals yet we simply have both of those in another WP. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 10:33, 18 February 2017 (UTC)
in any event about 95% of &quot;stubs&quot;[https://tools.wmflabs.org/enwp10/cgi-bin/list2.fcgi??sorta=Importance&amp;importance=Unknown-Class&amp;projecta=Medicine&amp;limit=250&amp;run=yes&amp;quality=Stub-Class&amp;sortb=Quality&amp;&amp;offset=1] (that is left) is either journals or the above mentioned medications, we'll either have to purge them or otherwise--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 14:22, 18 February 2017 (UTC)
Anyway to force an update of the list[https://tools.wmflabs.org/enwp10/cgi-bin/list2.fcgi?run=yes&amp;projecta=Medicine&amp;importance=Unknown-Class]  so that the new changes are reflected? Doc James (talk ·  · ) 12:45, 19 February 2017 (UTC)
Found it[http://tools.wmflabs.org/enwp10/cgi-bin/update.fcgi] Doc James (talk ·  · ) 15:30, 19 February 2017 (UTC)
great(I think we're making progress, stubs is almost finished)--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 15:32, 19 February 2017 (UTC)
Purging journals is a bad idea. Medical-editors are best equipped to deal with issues related to medical journals, and should clearly be notified if deletion discussions (or similar) are brought up. If you want to improve those to start or above level, we have a good guide at . Headbomb {talk /  /  / } 20:15, 19 February 2017 (UTC)
Good point . Have adjusted [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AWikiProject_Medicine%2FAssessment&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=766426322&amp;oldid=766402063 here]. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 03:51, 20 February 2017 (UTC)
