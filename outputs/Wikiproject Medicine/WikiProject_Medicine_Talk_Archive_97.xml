I wanted to share two recent publications from schools in NYC which have had student programs to develop medical information on Wikipedia.

*From , see  shown as a poster to the right. This student-led Wikipedia club has hosted meetings several times a year since 2014 as described at .
*From  we have [https://tclibraryblog.wordpress.com/2017/04/26/touro-pt-students-share-health-information-worldwide-in-wikipedia-edithathon/#more-5152 a narrative] about a [https://outreachdashboard.wmflabs.org/courses/Touro_College/physical_therapy/home class project to develop articles on physical therapy].

I wish to especially point to Salubrious Toxin at Mount Sinai, who gave essential guidance to the Wikimedia chapter in New York about how to better serve student groups at universities and also about how Wikipedians in general can support projects for medical students and physicians to contribute to Wikipedia.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 18:55, 26 April 2017 (UTC)
Lane do you think any of them would be interested in speaking about this work briefly at Wikimania? 
The claim in the poster is that most medical editors are not health care providers. Both research by myself and Nusa show that about half of medical editors ARE health care providers. 
I disagree that the makeup of our editors means our content is of variable quality. Our content is of variable quality because our editor numbers are few and the amount of content we work on is so great. 
Cool to see such high editor retention after a month. Would be interesting to look at retention after 6 months and a year. Best Doc James (talk ·  · ) 19:20, 26 April 2017 (UTC)
They may be counting a different group, but even if you're looking at the same dataset, if ~49% of medical editors are healthcare professionals, then both statements are true:  &quot;most aren't&quot; and &quot;about half are&quot;.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 19:53, 26 April 2017 (UTC)
Thanks both of you. This poster is not robust research. Perhaps it is not phrased to be correct. While I will not say that it is presenting established facts I also do not recognize any part of it as an obvious mistake or misconception.
I do not know what the reality is about the source of most edits. James, in your research, I thought you interviewed highly active Wikipedia editors of medical content and found that they were health care professionals. The poster tells that most editors of the medical content are not medical professionals, and I am not aware of any research which gives insight into this. Do highly active editors make the majority of Wikipedia edits to Wikipedia's medical content? I think by the &quot;recent changes in medicine feed&quot; that we get about 1000 edits/day to medical articles. At a glance, I cannot confirm that most of these edits come from highly active users or users who identify as health professionals. Can you remind me what your research says?
Re: &quot;the makeup of our editors means our content is of variable quality&quot; I do not know how to find the truth, but in this poster, there is an interesting graph showing &quot;bytes removed&quot;. This particular team found value in removing text from Wikipedia articles, and speculated that professionals would be comfortable deleting content while non-professionals are more likely add cruft and tolerate it staying in the article. The thought was that nonprofessionals add less important content over time which needs to be periodically pruned to essentials by professionals. It is just a theory but it seemed plausible to me. I am not aware of any other group reporting &quot;bytes removed&quot; as an outcome.
I want people to come to Wikimania. In NYC we are organizing a train from here to Montreal with room for 60 people. Either by train or on their own, we are doing whatever we can to encourage and assist people in getting to Wikimania.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 20:22, 26 April 2017 (UTC)
So in 2013 85% of the core medical editors had a college degree. 50.4% were from the healthcare field.[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4376174/]

This group made 185,529 edits out of a total of 1.1 million medical edits that year.
We calculated bytes removed during the first few rounds of the UCSF class. Could need to dig for that data. My concern is that the popular press often emphasizes that WP is written by non experts. That is often not the case (even though it sometimes is). Doc James (talk ·  · ) 04:57, 27 April 2017 (UTC)
Even if 50.4% of (the minority of) editors surveyed have ever held a healthcare job (what the question asked), that doesn't prove that we're experts.  That question would have included a friend of mine who worked as an assistant at a nursing home when she was 18 years old.  Even among the physicians and physician–researchers who edit, none of them are experts in everything.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 15:31, 27 April 2017 (UTC)
Perhaps we should consider what kind of data we need to describe the editing community, then consider whether we can get that data. It sounds like we know that 20% of edits to medical content in 2013 came from a community where 50% of people were healthcare professionals. I do not know what information we have about the other 80% of edits.
Part of the reason for sorting data could be for framing the conversation into understandable talking points. When students say &quot;non experts edit Wikipedia&quot;, that could be interpreted to mean that students can edit and make a difference for their expert connections, or it could be taken as criticism. In this case I think it was a positive statement but perhaps we could develop a recommended way to phrase it.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 15:41, 27 April 2017 (UTC)
That reminds me:  have you talked to , who studies Wikipedia editors?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 15:55, 27 April 2017 (UTC)
If you change &quot;most&quot; to &quot;many&quot; my concern would be address. We do not have solid evidence that &quot;most editors are not medical professionals&quot;. WAID the content in the poster does not say &quot;expert&quot;. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 17:05, 27 April 2017 (UTC)

Using WikiProject Medicine for Internal Medicine residents scholarly activity

I am new to Wikipedia as an instructor responsible for facilitating the scholarly activity curriculum for an internal medicine residency program.  Several residents would like to get involved by editing a WikiProject Medicine topic to meet one of the scholarly activity requirements.  As adult learners, I want them to be able to pick a topic of interest to them and contribute the most to the community.

I see management as more long term and less curative
While treatment is more curative and generally shorter term
But both mean more or less the same and are frequently used interchangeably. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 22:55, 2 May 2017 (UTC)
There are multiple ways to understand those words.  For example, &quot;managing your blood sugar&quot; is the most important way of &quot;treating Type 2 diabetes&quot;.  There's also an idea that you manage symptoms and treat diseases, or that you &quot;manage&quot; a disease when the interventions are largely ineffective, but &quot;treat&quot; the disease when they work for most patients.  None of it's official jargon with a One True™ Usage.
The specific question at this article seems to be whether every single word related to treatment should be excised from the article and replaced by the word management, or whether it should be the other way around.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 01:58, 3 May 2017 (UTC)

Opposite of PRN?

Does anyone know whether there's a medical term for (more or less) the opposite of PRN, i.e. when a a medicine is supposed to be taken daily (whether the patient feels they need it that day or not)? --Philologia (talk) 17:37, 29 April 2017 (UTC)

OD is once daily; QD is once daily in the Latin tradition (quaque die); BID is twice daily; TID is three times a day; QID – sometimes confusingly shortened to QD – is four times daily.  In vet med, SID (semel in die) is used for once daily.  Note that you shouldn't really use any of these, because they're impossible for normal people to understand and have created serious medical errors on occasion (especially when handwritten).  You especially shouldn't use OD, because that has other meanings (like &quot;overdose&quot; and &quot;right eye&quot;).  WhatamIdoing (talk) 17:43, 29 April 2017 (UTC)
Opposite of &quot;as needed&quot; is &quot;scheduled&quot;. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 19:13, 29 April 2017 (UTC) 
When I look at a prescription bottle, is there any real difference between &quot;take one tablet daily&quot; and &quot;take one tablet daily as directed&quot;? (Both medicines were prescribed by the same M.D., I always discuss any new prescriptions with my doctor, and, not being an idiot, I always do whatever I am &quot;directed&quot; to do.) --Guy Macon (talk) 20:09, 1 May 2017 (UTC)
- fair question. The difference is &quot;take one tablet once a day as needed&quot; versus &quot;take one table once a day&quot; The two you mention are typically the same. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 17:38, 2 May 2017 (UTC)
The &quot;as directed&quot; language sounds like you should take one tablet daily and additionally follow some other directions (e.g., &quot;take one tablet daily until X happens&quot;).  WhatamIdoing (talk) 20:28, 2 May 2017 (UTC)

Thanks for all these replies! I've just tried to clarify the significance of &quot;scheduled&quot; as an antonym in the article. As a non-medical expert, it helps me understand PRN better. --Philologia (talk) 23:01, 5 May 2017 (UTC)

Please help with Eddie Eagle good article effort

You are invited to help close a  effort at Eddie Eagle, a pediatric gun injury prevention program.

In December 2016 an editor warred to:

* delete -compliant sources and their summarizations from the article (, , )
* delete the project template from the article talk page  (, )

See also  from 12 April 2017 (, ). 

More recently on the verge of a good article nomination the same editor has returned to:

* again revert reliable sources and their summarizations from the article, including -compliant sources and noteworthy points of view 
* again delete the project template from the article talk page  
* delete an image from the article 
* delete the talk page comments of others  
* attempt to undermine a  request (, )

These recent edits are very clearly not improvements to the encyclopedia. Additional participation may be necessary to salvage good article recognition for this editorial effort. Please help. Thank you!  (talk) 15:07, 24 April 2017 (UTC)
The article is very much based on primary sources. People should be using secondary source per . 
The image was non-free and therefore needed to be removed per policy. What was listed as &quot;review articles&quot; were not reviews but primary sources.
Can you list the MEDRS compliant sources that were deleted? Doc James (talk ·  · ) 16:50, 24 April 2017 (UTC)

 Thank you for your collaboration. MEDRS compliant sources removed or summarization curtailed:

In 1992 the Committee on Injury and Poison Prevention of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) adopted a position critical of the program, discouraged its use, cited the lack of evidence demonstrating efficacy, and recommended an absence of guns from children's homes, or trigger locks or gun safes, as more effective alternatives. The AAP renewed its recommendations in 2000 and 2012.
Jackman et. al (2001) wrote in Pediatrics that although the Eddie Eagle program &quot;has been promoted heavily, it never has been evaluated formally to prove that it works. If gun safety education gives parents a sense of complacency without fundamentally altering child behavior, then it might do more harm than good.&quot;
A 2002 survey article by Hardy published in the journal The Future of Children in a special issue on the topic of &quot;Children, Youth, and Gun Violence&quot; identified the Eddie Eagle program as &quot;perhaps the most popular&quot; gun avoidance program for prekindergarten through the sixth grade but said the program &quot;does not give children a reason for avoiding guns (such as that guns are dangerous)&quot; and that &quot;The NRA offers no empirical evidence that its approach is effective.&quot;
Himle et. al (2004), in the Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, wrote &quot;...few investigations have evaluated the effectiveness of programs designed to teach children appropriate safety skills to use when they find a firearm. The few investigations that have been conducted have shown existing programs to be ineffective...&quot;
A 2004 survey of the literature and critical review of prevention strategies for unintended firearms injuries to children in the journal Education and Treatment of Children concluded &quot;existing child-based firearm-safety programs do not reduce children's injury risk...Although knowledge of what one should do may be valuable, research suggests that knowledge of skills often does not correspond with actual behavior.&quot;
Glatt (2005) in the Journal of Pediatric Nursing wrote of the Eddie Eagle program &quot;The NRA believes that it can be effective by teaching children the simple, straightforward message to stop, do not touch, leave the area, and tell an adult when confronted by the presence of a firearm...This is an unrealistic expectation based on the cognitive abilities of children in this age group.&quot;


The image is the book cover of the program workbook, Eddie Eagle Kids' Activity Booklet, Pre-K and Kindergarten edition.  The use of this image in this article is policy-compliant; the image was reviewed and accepted with a use rationale for use in article Eddie Eagle.

I removed it primarily because this is how admins have been dealing with edits made by this IP , , .  Also this topic would fall under HughD's current topic bans (above and beyond the edit block).  I also would argue it is a big stretch to include a public education plan in project medicine.  The program is a social/education program, not a medical program.  I don't think we put other public safety programs such as swimming pool safety, bike safety, or driving safety programs into project medicine. (edit: I see Automobile safety includes project medicine - added by HughD during an edit war shortly before his block)  Gun safety does not include project medicine. Springee (talk) 19:02, 25 April 2017 (UTC)
Do we have a SPI on HughD and these IPs? 
I am happy with the adding of gun violence prevention programs to WPMED. Same applies to swimming pool safety as both of these drowning and guns, are major causes of deaths. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 19:18, 25 April 2017 (UTC)

  - SPI is at  -  is not mentioned among them, but it looks likely.
 The problem is,  that the majority of sources that establish the notability of the programme focus on the controversy over its effectiveness, or lack thereof, in helping children learn. Those sort of issues are very much within the purview of WikiProject Med. You may feel that WPMED ought to limit itself to articles on diseases and drugs, but the editors who make up the WikiProject don't agree with you – for example, the sixth most popular medical article of the last week was Project MKUltra, not a traditional med article, but sufficiently in-scope to be tagged; just as Eddie Eagle is. it's not your place to decide on behalf of WPMED what is in its scope. While I sympathise with your intentions in combating disruption, I fear you may be losing sight of what improves the encyclopedia. For example, in your [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eddie_Eagle&amp;diff=776566987&amp;oldid=776277528 most recent revert] at that article, you removed: (1) an  that had a perfectly acceptable non-free use rationale; and (2) a [http://www.economist.com/node/457168 link to online content] for a news source, as well as other sourced content. The other sourced content may be debatable in terms of its value, but nobody is going to agree with you that removing the only image from the article and deleting a convenience link to an source that is also available online is improving the article. Please have another think about the impact your editing is having on articles. I've also removed your collapsing of the contribution from 52.201.205.110 here because I object to the title text that you used.  a policy, not a label for editors, and you're getting close to a personal attack in making those kind of statements merely on suspicion. --RexxS (talk) 19:43, 25 April 2017 (UTC)
MEDRS might be applied to this article in a very limited way, such as for sources which state if the program is effective or not, and even then this is not really the type of content that MEDRS is supposed to cover as it's not a medical intervention or anything like that. All other content in the article shouldn't need MEDRS compliant sources imo. Matthew Ferguson (talk) 17:37, 26 April 2017 (UTC)
I agree with you.  It's a health-related topic (so it interests people here and should be tagged for the group to track the article), but whether six year olds will reliably follow instructions presented during a one-time school lesson is not  by any reasonable definition of those words (so MEDRS is not exactly relevant).

IMO, for anatomy articles it is more appropriate to have the human anatomy topic as the sub article, and a more general physiology type article as the main article. For pathology, depends if the topic is more related to humans or other animals.  agree with you, an encyclopaedia should have encyclopaedic coverage, not partial coverage. Matthew Ferguson (talk) 17:37, 27 April 2017 (UTC)
This is what we currently do with brain and human brain. I think for anatomy articles this is a sensible suggestion. Whichever direction we go, we need to standardize. Sizeofint (talk) 00:18, 28 April 2017 (UTC)
Why do we need to standardize?  Why don't we consider the individual subject, and then decide to split the brain-related articles (they're large), but keep, say, gallbladder merged together?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 01:51, 28 April 2017 (UTC)
We need to standardise so that we don't have to check every time we make a link about exactly where it goes. Personally I think we should standardise on Urinary bladder (human) for humans and Urinary bladder (anatomy) for the general sense. We can then argue independently over which of those should be a redirect to the  and . Stuartyeates (talk) 02:49, 28 April 2017 (UTC)
If it's all in the same article, then you don't need to check anything.  We could additionally create redirects to a standardized naming system, and then we could write good articles and you still wouldn't ever need to check:  if everything's in one place, then both redirects point to the same page, and if it's been split, then each points to the most relevant article.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 05:27, 28 April 2017 (UTC)
Yes, there is no problem if there is one article. However, I think many participants here are interested in the case in which there are multiple articles on a topic. The standardized naming system is precisely what we're interested in. Sizeofint (talk) 05:58, 28 April 2017 (UTC)
WhatamIdoing: when you say  If it's all in the same article, then you don't need to check anything. you appear to be missing the point that a maintenance bot has no way or automatically determining whether it's all in the same article. If there were standardised redirects, that would be possible. Stuartyeates (talk) 09:46, 28 April 2017 (UTC)
Do we actually have a maintenance bot that is capable of determining whether a given link in an article ought to refer to a general anatomical object or specifically a human one?  (I've got nothing against creating lots of redirects; however, I strongly oppose splitting one decent article about anatomy into two incomplete ones, just to segregate human anatomy from everything-else anatomy.)  WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:24, 28 April 2017 (UTC)
  is absolutely right. Readers first. Editors second. Bots a distant third, until they manage to vote to alter it.

Docusate Sodium

As an engineer who sometimes attempts to improve medical articles, I would like some advice.

I was looking at our Docusate article, and comparing it with what is available in local drug stores in Southern California. Around here, only Docusate Sodium is available OTC. Yet the article leads with &quot;Docusate, also known as docusate salts or dioctyl sulfosuccinate&quot;, followed closely with &quot;It typically comes in the form of a sodium, calcium, or potassium salts&quot;. Yet the reference given[https://www.drugs.com/monograph/docusate-salts.html] lists one example of Docusate Calcium and twenty five examples of Docusate Sodium. Should we change the lead to reflect the most common name, or are different forms of docusate popular in different parts of the world?

The reason I was looking at the page was to find out how much dietary sodium is in a 100 mg Docusate Sodium dose. This ref[https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=33586efa-a589-49d7-8913-9d4503bfbe1f] says 6mg. This is usefyul information for peoplem on low-salt diets. Would it be appropriate to add this to the article?  --Guy Macon (talk) 18:13, 9 May 2017 (UTC)
The various salts are equivalent, absent data to the contrary, and I would avoid over-specifying if not useful. A low-sodium diet would be about 2000 mg per day, so 6 mg is not relevant to a low-sodium diet (it's a round-off error for any other food). — soupvector (talk) 18:58, 9 May 2017 (UTC)
You might be able to use https://books.google.com/books?id=N_YoDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA746&amp;lpg=PA746&amp;dq=%22docusate+sodium%22+%22clinically+insignificant%22 to support a sentence that the amount is &quot;clinically insignificant&quot;.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 20:51, 9 May 2017 (UTC)

Agree newer versus older adds little and trimmed Doc James (talk ·  · ) 02:30, 6 May 2017 (UTC)
Your edit unfortunately made it sound like all antidepressants have this effect, which is not true.
Shelley, do you happen to know offhand whether the &quot;newer&quot; antidepressants include any category other than SSRIs?  If not, then we could re-write this as &quot;SSRI antidepressants&quot; or &quot;SSRIs (a type of antidepressant drug)&quot; or something like that.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 06:07, 6 May 2017 (UTC)
 As far as I know, the &quot;newer&quot; category includes all antidepressants from the introduction of fluoxetine to present—SSRIs, SNRIs (e.g., venlafaxine), maybe other small classes of drugs. There's a bit of information at Antidepressant#History, but not necessarily enough to be helpful. I agree the &quot;newer&quot; vs. &quot;older&quot; terminology is frustratingly vague. There's a roughly equivalent MeSH term, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/68018687 Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation], also defined as antidepressants that aren't MAOIs or TCAs. —Shelley V.

What is and is not a medical article?

When is and isn't an organ—in whole or part—a medical article? For example, urinary bladder, above, is a medical article. However insular cortex apparently isn't. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Insular_cortex&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=780087663&amp;oldid=780037872 This reasoning] was recently used to justify primary sources in that article.)I assumed insular cortex—about the human insular cortex—would be a medical article. (A no-brainer!) If not, shouldn't sections discussing function and particularly clinical conditions follow MEDRS?If so, I believe MEDRS are available to preserve most of the article, and this should be attempted. —  02:13, 13 May 2017 (UTC)
MEDRS applies to medical claims regarding of whether or not an article is tagged as part of WPMED. We do not include urinary bladder as part of WPMED yet we are still happy to have discuss regarding it here. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 05:26, 13 May 2017 (UTC)

Functional neurological symptom disorder

Functional neurological symptom disorder has been listed at  since 4 April. Before I spend much more time looking through the rather messy history, would you medical experts care to comment on whether there is in fact such a condition, or if it should simply be a redirect to Conversion disorder? The page was created by an editor who's clearly here to advocate for it (or against it, I don't know) – see FND Hope. Justlettersandnumbers (talk) 09:41, 13 May 2017 (UTC)

Indeed. No mention of &quot;Functional neurological symptom disorder&quot; in the abstract; what about in the full text? Justlettersandnumbers (talk) 13:14, 13 May 2017 (UTC)
Functional neurological disorder is diagnosable under DSM-V and in the soon to be released ICD-11, so there should be a standalone article for this disorder. DSM-V states that a functional neurological disorder can occur independently from a psychological stressor, and thus independent of conversion disorder. Therefore, the article should not be redirected to conversion disorder. It is, it seems, a tricky disorder to diagnose, having to differentiate between conversion disorder, factitious disorder and functional neurological dysfunction unrelated to psychological factors or comorbid with, but not triggered by, psychological conditions, etc. Thankfully I am not a neurologist! :-)--Literaturegeek | T@1k? 13:19, 13 May 2017 (UTC)

Infobox update April 2017

I have been working to update our infoboxes to human useful date. This is an idea proposed by  a few years ago. I have done a couple of hundred articles so far. And the plan is to do around a thousand before getting a bot to transfer the info to Wikidata so other languages can benefit. The EN WP data however will stay on EN WP. Every item gets / needs a high quality reference.

The question is can I get the first part which is [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anthrax&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=776866412&amp;oldid=775304806 this] done by bot? Ie have a bot makes this change to all articles which use the . The numerical data is moved to the external links section. Amir will do the bot work, we just need community consensus first.

Support
*looks good on Dyslexia(therefore support)--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 20:20, 23 April 2017 (UTC)
* OK. Jytdog (talk) 00:11, 24 April 2017 (UTC)
*  This change involves a complicated set of issues which the Wikimedia community has found challenging to discuss in the past. In a section below &quot;Previous discussion of medical infoboxes&quot; I tried to list what I thought were some relevant related discussions. An element of this current proposal which has been rejected in the past is the move of the library cataloging information from the top of the article to the bottom. Although this idea has been rejected multiple times, it is a recurring proposal which has had some supporters. The idea of putting consumer information in an infobox in the lead has been made multiple times also, and rejected in the past. Things are a little different in this proposal because there has been more discussion over the years about what sort of information is and is not appropriate to present, and in this present proposal, some controversial early ideas are not present to derail the discussion. Also, the idea of pulling data from Wikidata is abandoned, and instead all information in this box is planned to be managed on English Wikipedia with citations. Based on previous conversations, the biggest opposition which I perceive to this is the standing opposition to making researchers and scientists go to the bottom of the Wikipedia article to get links that they want. However, I do not join that opposition, because I favor serving the general reader who is the majority user and feel that researchers are power users who can learn to get the same information at the bottom of the article without being unduly burdened. I support the use of the bot to move the current infoboxes to the bottom of each article, and to present this English-Wikipedia managed new variation of an infobox. I participate in this discussion because I think this is one of the more influential innovations which WikiProject Medicine can try to improve the quality of its content and make content more accessible to more people.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 21:18, 27 April 2017 (UTC)

*Support - Definitely a good step, as  has so eloquently explained above. E.g. a Wikipedia Zero user deserves more useful and potentially life-saving information at his fingertips. A researcher can scroll down to the bottom of the page and get cataloging data. There's no critical rush in what he's doing.--Saintfevrier (talk) 23:43, 3 May 2017 (UTC)

Oppose

Discussion
While I strongly support the move to a more useful infobox, I'm not entirely sure what the purpose of this bot is. I'm guessing it is useful, but for the sake of those who don't know what the end-goal is: what specifically do you intend to do?
*Will the bot clear or copy the content of the infoboxes moving that information to a  at the bottom of the articles?
There is a difference between clearing and copying. Copying may make the work much easier in the future if we wish to fully migrate, while still preserving functionality for now. Clearing however may end us up with entirely useless infoboxes for now, risking them being deleted.

The other question is what you mean that infobox statements need sources. This is very often overlooked, and I would actually like to suggest we force sources into the infobox. This has been done before on other language Wikipedias, but the idea is to create a field for each statement so that you fill in:

mortality rate =
mortality rate source =

and if the source isn't entered the rate isn't included. This could potentially solve lots of problems, and would also make it easy to handle sources in the infobox, for example by forcing them into a group source so they don't cause clutter. It maybe very profitable to introduce such a source-requirement at the same time as we migrate to new infoboxes, which is why I'd like to take it a little slower. 
Best, Carl Fredrik talk 23:09, 23 April 2017 (UTC)
* The bot would just convert the old infobox to the new one, right?  And the adding of sourced content would be done subsequently by editors, right? Jytdog (talk) 23:15, 23 April 2017 (UTC)
**Per Jytdog, yes. It just converts and editors need to fill it in. 
**[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anthrax&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=776866412&amp;oldid=775304806 THIS] is what the bot will do.
**I am not a big fan of a separate line for sources. Sources should simple go after the statement in question. We just as a community need to remove unreffed stuff from infoboxes / add a ref if it is missing as we do for other areas of an article.
**Doc James (talk ·  · ) 00:08, 24 April 2017 (UTC)
**# On the bot:  Copying stuff from an infobox at the top an article and into a box at the bottom of the article is easy, and that's all that's done there.  I think people may be confused by all of the new parameters like .  So to clarify, the bot's not filling in those new parameters.  It's keeping things like name and image, and adding blank parameters for things like .  This is actually a feasible task, and it should be (very) easy to skip any articles that would otherwise end up with an empty infobox at the top if the links are moved.
**# Using a separate parameter for the source would make it easy to automatically check for the absence of sources.  If if  used, then you could make  display either the source or automatically add a  tag or display an error message. I'm not sure what the larger community thinks about adding sources in infoboxes.  The idea has always been that almost nothing should go in the infobox unless it's already in the article, and sourced in the article (making sources in the infobox be superfluous).  WhatamIdoing (talk) 17:02, 24 April 2017 (UTC)
***Thank WAID. With respect to source. A good portion of our readers / editors want every line referenced. The same argument that nothing in the lead should not be referenced in the body just leads to the lead being fill with  tags. If we are going to move this information to WD it needs references. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 17:19, 24 April 2017 (UTC)
*I prefer the old infobox, but this is only because I prefer that the ICD-10, etc. be linked in the infobox and I don't think readers are likely to look for it in the External links section. Also, the cause(s), treatment(s), etc. of/for a disease or disorder can be complicated and/or disputed, and listing them in the infobox can subsequently prove to be problematic. I worry about the new infobox leading to  and edit wars. But I'll get used to the new infobox. Flyer22 Reborn (talk) 03:51, 25 April 2017 (UTC)
** I think it'll take some time for everyone to get used to it.  For example, things like  shouldn't be used unless it's clear and simple (e.g., HIV causes AIDS), but it'll take a while to get the message out that this isn't a good spot to fill in hundreds of suspected causes in the Cancer article.   Would you be more satisfied with having all of it in one long infobox?  Infoboxes for chemicals are unusually long, with a bunch of codes stuff in the end, and that doesn't really seem to bother people much.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 05:24, 25 April 2017 (UTC)
You mean the ICD-10 stuff, etc. in one long infobox? I wouldn't mind that. And, yeah, your cancer infobox example is something to be worried about, but that article is well-watched. The articles that are not well-watched are the ones I'm more concerned about. Flyer22 Reborn (talk) 12:33, 25 April 2017 (UTC)
For cause of cancer in the infobox we say &quot;Tobacco, obesity, poor diet, lack of physical activity, excessive alcohol, certain infections&quot;. I am thinking we should keep it to the top half dozen only. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 18:54, 25 April 2017 (UTC)

Previous discussion of medical infoboxes
I think that the core of this proposal is moving the library cataloging information from the lead of the article to the bottom, and to fill the space left behind with information for the general consumer.

Proposals which were similar to this one have been both well discussed and controversial in the past. Personally, I would characterize past discussions as being progressive for change and protective of current practice from different perspectives and because it seemed like any one change for one group of stakeholders would also cause several changes affecting other groups. Because memories fade and because I think it is useful to try to track some history of discussion, I linking to some past related discussions which led to this one. These discussions could be useful for anyone joining the conversation and who wants to know what other things the wiki community has discussed or tried. Other people would have their own memories and perspectives of past conversations and I probably missed linking to some. These ones that I am featuring here are ones that I either found in search or remembered.
#&quot;&quot;, November 2011 in WikiProject Medicine.  argues that infoboxes should not contain classifying numbers and instead should have consumer information.
#&quot;&quot;, June 2014 in WikiProject Medicine.  proposes to remove library cataloging information from the infobox in the lead. This is much like the current proposal. It got opposition at the time. 
#&quot;&quot;, June 2014 at WikiProject Medicine. Diptanshu.D proposes to add a link out to a particular website in the infobox, and the WikiProject Medicine community reflects on what kinds of sources are appropriate for linking in the lead of an article. This discussion is relevant to this one because it demonstrates the context of taking for granted that Wikipedia should prioritize linking out in an infobox in the lead, which is the practice being questioned in this discussion.
#&quot;&quot;, November 2014 at WikiProject Medicine. A representative of an external organization  asks about adding external links to their health content to the infobox. There is more discussion about the purpose of an infobox, including whether it should have cataloging links at all. 
#&quot;&quot;, January 2015 at .  says, &quot;It is completely unencyclopedic. It just has a bunch of codes and links.&quot; 
#&quot;, January 2015 at . Doc James starts  this response to that other January 2015 talk on this page. Here there are a range of opinions about what an infobox should be.
#&quot;&quot;, February 2015 at . I, , make a similar proposal to what is being discussed now.
#&quot;&quot;, June 2015 at WikiProject Medicine. It seemed to controversial to start with medical conditions, so instead, I proposed starting with drug infoboxes.
#&quot;&quot;, August 2015 at .  proposes that drug infoboxes have consumer information rather than cataloging data.
#&quot;&quot; November 2015 at Gout.  presents an infobox which pulls data from Wikidata.
#&quot;,&quot; in-person meeting at the United States National Archives in November 2015. 5-10 WikiProject Medicine contributors joined this meeting. One of the major outcomes was that  from  and  demonstrated how English Wikipedia infoboxes can be populated with Wikidata information, as happened in the Gene Wiki project for Wikipedia articles about genes. 
#&quot;&quot;, December 2015 at . Here I propose something like what is here, except also assume that calling data from Wikidata would be less controversial. I was wrong about Wikidata being the less controversial way forward.
#&quot;&quot;, December 2016 at WikiProject Medicine. Doc James tries a new way of pulling Wikidata information to post in English Wikipedia infoboxes. There were problems.

Printed on paper, all of this discussion and the examples cited in these discussions might be the equivalent of 200 paper pages of content. It is a lot to digest. If others remember more or other previous relevant conversation then please share. Wikipedia is not well-equipped to manage a conversation of this sort which has happened in multiple forums over a period of years. I am guessing that not fewer than 50 users have commented in these discussions, and almost every comment is a substantial statement by a highly knowledgeable user.

Goat Yoga

Makes a categorical claim for health benefits based on a Yoga journal. I removed it but it was restored. Doug Weller talk 15:50, 5 May 2017 (UTC)
 Actually at Goat Yoga – even that's wrong. Seems that an axe has been taken to the synth and unsubstantiated claims, but might be worth keeping an eye on for a while. --RexxS (talk) 21:20, 5 May 2017 (UTC)
The &quot;categorical claim for health benefits&quot; appears to be that yoga (in general) is a form of physical exercise.  Do you actually believe that yoga doesn't have any demonstrated &quot;health benefits, from increasing flexibility to reducing stress&quot; (a line you removed as unreliable)?  I'm pretty sure that the mainstream medical POV is that yoga does have these benefits.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 22:13, 5 May 2017 (UTC)
 You might want to ask Alexbrn, as Doug hasn't edited the article. Nevertheless, I'd hazard a guess that making claims about health benefits of yoga really ought to be sourced to something better than http://www.yogajournal.com/article/health/count-yoga-38-ways-yoga-keeps-fit/ - wouldn't you agree? (If you think that source is reliable enough, perhaps we can start an article on Rex Schneider, based on [http://www.metropolis2.co.uk/demo/rex.htm this].) --RexxS (talk) 23:15, 5 May 2017 (UTC)
Sure, a stronger source could have been added in the two-sentence-long
Health Benefits
section [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Goat_Yoga&amp;diff=778807128&amp;oldid=778799759 that Doug blanked] (six hours before Alex's first edit), but Wikipedia doesn't get better through wholesale blanking of factual content just because someone didn't put &quot;the right&quot; kind of source behind it on the first try.  (The other source in that section was the US CDC, which I believe is still listed by name in MEDRS as a generally desirable secondary source.)  We use tags like , , and several others when we think that some otherwise acceptable content would benefit from a stronger source. 
(One of the problems with blanking relatively restrained content, such as , is that the absence of any information sometimes prompts people to put in something – and half the time, to put in something worse.)  WhatamIdoing (talk) 06:00, 6 May 2017 (UTC)

 But the problem with focusing your criticism on the removal of each sentence independently is that you miss the real problem: the juxtaposition of a crap source saying &quot;Yoga is good for you&quot; with a decent source saying &quot;Petting animals is good for you&quot;, thus begging the conclusion &quot;Doing yoga while petting goats must be very good for you.&quot; It's implicit SYNTH and it has no place in the article. If goat yoga really has health benefits, then we might expect a reliable secondary source to have noted that. Otherwise, the whole article is just an advert for a single company who is trying to promote an unproven medical technique. Do we have a tag for ? --RexxS (talk) 12:40, 6 May 2017 (UTC)
There is lots of mainstream news coverage. I not sure why we continue to call it the &quot;news&quot; though. Meh, as long as there are no health claims I guess we can document its existence.  Doc James (talk ·  · ) 14:28, 6 May 2017 (UTC)
Thanks to  for clarifying the problem with using a reliable source on pets and health. And although yoga probably has health benefits, does that really apply to all forms of Yoga? I don't know. In any case, the health benefits of Yoga are still unclear, see Yoga#Exercise and health applications and Yoga as exercise. If those main articles don't state &quot;Yoga practice has many proven health benefits...&quot; I'm not at all convinced this one should say that. Doug Weller talk 16:29, 6 May 2017 (UTC)

 Merge it into Yoga#With other animals?   --RexxS (talk) 21:17, 6 May 2017 (UTC)

The article says that there are (so far) two of these businesses (unrelated).  Furthermore, they're not &quot;trying to promote an unproven medical technique&quot;:  they're trying to get people to pay for yoga classes, which are not &quot;medical techniques&quot;.  It is an unfortunate truth that  makes such subjects notable if they can cobble together two news articles, at least one of which isn't their local newspaper.
Doug, I think that the main article may be outdated and perhaps a little overly detailed (e.g., listing levels of evidence for individual conditions) in the way that suggests the existence of a long history of true believers fighting with true skeptics.  I glanced through a few recent reviews last week, which say things such as practicing yoga (but not necessarily expensive yoga classes) is not only efficacious for reducing pain in people with chronic back pain, but also cost-effective.  It's a very common recommendation in the &quot;you all should get some exercise&quot; advice.  When the NICE guideline for low back pain was updated a few months ago, they named yoga as an example of what people with low back pain should be doing as first-line treatment.[https://www.nice.org.uk/news/article/nice-publishes-updated-advice-on-treating-low-back-pain]  The NICE guideline on multiple sclerosis recommends yoga for MS-related fatigue.[https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg186/chapter/1-Recommendations]  If the main article isn't leaving you with the overall impression that yoga (at least as practiced in Western countries) is a form of physical exercise, and that, like many other forms of physical exercise, it has many health benefits, then the main article probably needs to be re-written. 
(Disclaimer:  I've never done yoga.  So let me say this a different way:  all the sources say that it's exercise, and whenever I walk past a yoga studio, it looks like exercise to me.  If someone here has personal experience and can assure me that it's much more like lying in a hammock with a good book and a bowl of strawberries, then perhaps I'd consider doing a little OR for the cause.  But until then, I'm just going to assume that the sources are correct on that point.  ;-)  WhatamIdoing (talk) 00:10, 8 May 2017 (UTC)
 The problem with chronic lower back pain is that nothing is really effective in the long run, but lots of things can yield an improvement (even chiropractic). I do a little yoga every so often when I'm feeling creaky and stiff – the combination of stretching, tensing, breathing and focusing the mind seem to work well for me (anecdotally of course). I doubt that anybody would not consider it physical exercise, but I guess it would be relatively unusual to see it recommended for improving health in the same way that something like swimming is. You can burn 500+ calories an hour swimming, but yoga probably burns only around half of that. I wonder if anybody has patented &quot;swimming yoga&quot; yet? --RexxS (talk) 16:46, 8 May 2017 (UTC)
It appears that it's called &quot;Aqua Yoga&quot; instead of &quot;Swimming Yoga&quot;. 
I don't believe that burning a significant number calories is (strictly speaking) a necessary component for all health-improving exercises.  Perhaps that explains why yoga seems to be so widely recommended.  It may not be &quot;the best&quot; but you don't need &quot;the best&quot; to get health benefits (especially compared to the alternative of doing nothing).

FDA Approved?
I did a few little edits on the Levomefolic acid article (). In the process I tried to determine if levomefolic acid (L-methylfolate) has been approved by the FDA as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder. According to [https://www.drugs.com/dosage/l-methylfolate.html drugs.com]: &quot;L-methylfolate (in the 7.5 mg or 15 mg strength marketed as Deplin tablets) is approved by the FDA for the distinct nutritional requirements of individuals who have suboptimal L-methylfolate levels in the cerebrospinal fluid, plasma, and/or red blood cells and have major depressive disorder (MDD) with particular emphasis as adjunctive support for individuals who are on an antidepressant.&quot; However, I did not find it listed on either of the two FDA databases the agency [https://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/Transparency/Basics/ucm194955.htm recommends], [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/default.cfm Drugs@FDA] and [http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ob/default.cfm the FDA &quot;Orange Book&quot;]. I searched for 'levomefolic' and 'L-methylfolate' and 'Deplin'. I did not add anything to the article about FDA approval. Did I miss anything? Thanks! - Mark P.S.

Pulmonary volutrauma

Is there a real difference between Pulmonary volutrauma and Pulmonary barotrauma? If so, what is the real difference? If not, should Pulmonary volutrauma be merged into another article with redirect? • • • Peter (Southwood) (talk): 10:48, 15 May 2017 (UTC)
[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/296625-overview]...Other manifestations....termed volutrauma, atelectotrauma, and biotrauma.... reflect the major pathophysiologic....[of] injury.--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 15:39, 15 May 2017 (UTC)
Read that. Can't see that it explains a real difference. As I see it: Lung barotrauma - injury resulting from excessive over-pressure in lungs relative to ambient, causing expansion of gas in lungs to over-stress lung tissue so that it tears (by tension or possibly shear stress) Lung volutrauma - injury resulting from excessive stretching of lung tissues in tension or possibly shear stress. The increased volume being caused by a pressure excess inside the lungs compared with the ambient pressure. To me these are just two ways of saying the same thing. Cheers, • • • Peter (Southwood) (talk): 20:07, 15 May 2017 (UTC)
 To put it slightly differently: In both barotrauma and volutrauma there is necessarily an excessive volume caused by excessive pressure. Take the pressure away and the volume reverts automatically, the two are inseparable, causatively linked. • • • Peter (Southwood) (talk): 20:13, 15 May 2017 (UTC)
I see your point(and agree to an extent), perhaps more opinions are needed...--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 20:44, 15 May 2017 (UTC)
 Peter's quite right and any diver will immediately spot that there's an inevitable connection between volume and pressure in a gas. I looked hard at the sources and it seems that the neologism 'volutrauma' seems to be almost exclusively associated with having a medical ventilator set to provide too great a tidal volume. That's the sense that the injury is caused by &quot;excessive volume&quot;. Of course, for the damage to occur, you have to have an excess pressure, caused by the ventilator trying to force too great a volume of air into a pair of lungs that can't expand that far (so we're back to barotrauma again). --RexxS (talk) 00:06, 16 May 2017 (UTC)
Boyle's law hasn't been repealed.  Reading on in the same source,  I would take that as simply indicative of an evolving nomenclature, from barotrauma toward volutrauma.  LeadSongDog come howl! 18:28, 16 May 2017 (UTC)
I agree that alveolar overdistention is the proximal cause of the overstressing of the tissues, but it could not happen without a pressure difference. Volutrauma and barotrauma are both logical descriptions for the injury and are describing the same thing. Therefore, I suggest that there is no good reason to have a separate article for each, and that one could and should be merged into the other with a redirect. Barotrauma seems to be the more widely used term - particularly in diving physiology and medicine. • • • Peter (Southwood) (talk): 20:30, 16 May 2017 (UTC)
concur[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pulmonary_volutrauma&amp;redirect=no]--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 00:52, 17 May 2017 (UTC)

 From Nunn's Applied Respiratory Physiology, 8th edition, page 471:-

 &quot;Many animal studies have demonstrated pulmonary oedema following artificial ventilation with high inﬂation pressures. In one of these studies, lung damage with high inﬂation pressures was attenuated by restricting chest movement to prevent overdistension of the lungs, indicating that alveolar size rather than pressure was responsible for lung injury. Termed volutrauma, this is now believed to contribute significantly to lung damage in patients with ALI [acute lung injury], in whom only a small proportion of alveoli may receive the entire tidal volume. This form of VILI most commonly manifests itself as interstitial or alveolar pulmonary oedema. There are several possible underlying mechanisms, all of which are closely interrelated.&quot; Axl ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 13:42, 17 May 2017 (UTC)
That is very interesting, and supports my understanding of the mechanism by experimental evidence. Perhaps this is worth adding to the barotrauma article. Thanks. • • • Peter (Southwood) (talk): 14:33, 17 May 2017 (UTC)
A careful reading of the single reference from Pulmonary volutrauma reveals the statement , so I think the original editor was a little confused. Anyway, now that Ozzie has redirected, I will try to make a few improvements to Barotrauma. • • • Peter (Southwood) (talk): 15:38, 17 May 2017 (UTC)
By way of comparison, is a steel beam bent (or a bone broken) by &quot;excessive shear force&quot;, or by &quot;excessive strain&quot; under that force? Neither term is &quot;wrong&quot;, it is simply another way of looking at the same thing: the beam follows a linear shear/strain curve until it exceeds an elastic limit, then the strain rapidly increases in a nonlinear fashion until the shear force is abruptly released.

Immunocompromise, immunosuppression and immunodeficiency

Assumed clear definitions distinguishing these terms, e.g.: 
* Immunosuppression -- therapeutic (or iatrogenic/adverse effect of treatment) reduction in immune function
* Immunodeficiency (immunocompromised redirects here) 

However, former article lists examples of &quot;non deliberate immunosuppression&quot; such as HIV/AIDS. If it is possible to be &quot;immunosuppressed&quot; because of medical conditions rather than it being a term restricted to an artificially created condition by medical interventions, then what is the difference between immunodeficiency and immunosuppression? And the next question would be do we need separate articles in the encyclopedia? Matthew Ferguson (talk) 18:20, 29 April 2017 (UTC)

I don't think that the terms have been used very precisely in most sources.  If we've got a top-quality source that specifically defines them, then we could create compare-and-contrast sections in the two articles and try to improve our own precision in other articles, but if you frequently read, e.g., that people with HIV are &quot;immunosuppressed&quot;, then you will expect them to be mentioned in that article.  (Ten seconds with Google suggests that sources are nearly 50–50 on that example, with slightly more Ghits for &quot;immunosuppressed&quot; than for &quot;immunocompromised&quot;.)  WhatamIdoing (talk) 05:59, 1 May 2017 (UTC)
If sources are commonly using the terms interchangeably, then this begs the question should we merge? Matthew Ferguson (talk) 18:07, 4 May 2017 (UTC)
It makes more sense to talk about the subject of the article(s) first, and to find a title later.
The possible subjects could be divided up like this:  deliberate immune reduction (e.g., lupus), accidental/side-effect-y immune lowering (e.g., chemotherapy), and pathological low immune system (e.g., AIDS).
Completely ignoring the terms, does it make more sense to you to have an article about all of those together (lupus+chemo+AIDS), or to separate them in various ways?  And if you split them, do you split them into two or three groups?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 02:14, 5 May 2017 (UTC)

Context
Inhaled corticosteroids causing isolated candidial lesions on the dorsum of the tongue and the palate, presumably the steroid flowing over these surfaces while it is being inhaled, and altering/suppressing local/mucosal immune function and allowing commensal candidal species to become pathogenic.

Visible citations for every sentence

Our readers appear to want at least one citation supporting every single sentence for medical content.

When a single ref supports multiple sentences in a row I used to hide all but the last one. I however am going to stop doing this as this happens SO often [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stevens%E2%80%93Johnson_syndrome&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=779054476&amp;oldid=777434169] Doc James (talk ·  · ) 19:42, 6 May 2017 (UTC)
Proposed  Doc James (talk ·  · ) 19:53, 6 May 2017 (UTC)
 That's just an essay . I think we might be better off writing our own essay at , explaining that we prefer having references in the lead (because we actively translate the lead into other languages as a priority), and that one source may support multiple sentences, especially in the lead. We could mention that hiding references inside  has become less useful since the advent of the visual editor. We could recommend using brief named references like ( at the end of each sentence, in order to lessen the maintenance work of the regular editors like yourself. If the essay gained support as a practice in medical articles, we could later propose promoting it to a subject-specific guideline. What do folks think? --RexxS (talk) 21:41, 6 May 2017 (UTC)
Sounds good Doc James (talk ·  · ) 21:45, 6 May 2017 (UTC)
 is going to be a problem.  We'd need to make a  that medical content be exempted from MOSLEAD, and I'm not sure that's a fight that's worth taking.
Especially since the IP's problem wasn't the hidden source, but the fact that the article was self-contradictory.  The lead said more men than women, and the body said more women than men.  That needed to be fixed.  (Whether it's correct now is more than I know.)  WhatamIdoing (talk) 00:23, 8 May 2017 (UTC)
 I'm not sure there's a fight to be had. MOSLEAD (or more precisely ) says  In my book, that's pretty much carte blanche for WPMED to explain why we prefer to have citations in the lead, and how medicine tends to be complex, so justifies a greater density of citations than some other topic areas (see also ) --RexxS (talk) 17:38, 8 May 2017 (UTC)
There is an important gap between &quot;explain why we (a group of self-selected individuals with no authority to make other editors do what we want) prefer to have citation in the lead&quot; and &quot;make other editors accept and provide such citations, despite the widely supported tradition of avoiding citations in the lead&quot;.  
Anybody can write an essay; a  is a sounder method of changing the guideline, and changing the guideline is what other editors are going to expect from you, if you demand the use of citations in the lead.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 20:57, 9 May 2017 (UTC)
 I'm really not suggesting we &quot;demand the use of citations in the lead&quot;. Honest. Read what I wrote again. I just want to make other editors aware that there are good reasons why medical articles may benefit from having more citations in the lead. There's a mistaken meme on Wikipedia that we don't have citations in the lead, and that needs to be balanced with cogent arguments of why that may not always be best. --RexxS (talk) 21:51, 10 May 2017 (UTC)

How do we know that ?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 00:11, 8 May 2017 (UTC)
Because I review 100s to 1,000s of medical edits per day and fairly frequently see stuff like this.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stevens%E2%80%93Johnson_syndrome&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=779054476&amp;oldid=777434169] Doc James (talk ·  · ) 18:01, 8 May 2017 (UTC)
That's a link to an edit – the fourth edit made from that particular mobile IP address – which means that it's what an editor did (i.e., not what a reader wants).  Furthermore, the edit summary states that self-contradiction was the reason for removal.  That sentence (or the one claiming the opposite) needed to be removed. Have a look at the screenshot:  The &quot;hidden&quot; notes are visible, and if you double-click them, they expand to fill the whole screen.  Or try it out yourself:  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevens%E2%80%93Johnson_syndrome#/editor/0 will work even from a desktop computer.  Use the pencil icon in the upper right of the toolbar to switch back and forth between wikitext and visual modes.  (Switching to visual mode is very handy for getting past the infobox.)
Have you talked to non-editing readers about whether they expect little blue clicky numbers, and/or whether they ever look at them?  I have a couple of times, and I find that people don't exactly care about sourcing.  They want our content right, and sources are an appropriate and effective means to that end, but readers don't use those as much as editors do.
For that matter, many editors, including me, will leave an edit summary of &quot;uncited&quot; as a euphemism for &quot;This is factually wrong&quot; or &quot;This does not belong in an encyclopedia&quot;.  So even if you're seeing a lot of &quot;uncited&quot; edit summaries from me, that doesn't mean that I actually care about whether a citation has been spammed into the end of that sentence.  It could just mean that I want the sentence gone, and I am engaging in a policy ritual that makes restoring it slightly more BURDENsome on you.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 20:28, 9 May 2017 (UTC)

Re: &quot;We could mention that hiding references inside hidden text has become less useful since the advent of the visual editor&quot;, what percentage of edits are done using VE? Is there any reason to believe that that percentage might be higher or lower for edits to medical articles? --Guy Macon (talk) 21:49, 8 May 2017 (UTC)
VE editors are higher among new editors who simply do not notice the comments.
How frequently VE is used is an excellent Q though. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 04:38, 9 May 2017 (UTC)
Use varies by platform and language.  Here at the English Wikipedia, maybe 5% of mainspace edits use the visual editor, and (because the configuration here essentially hides it) new editors have difficulty figuring out how to switch to visual editing.  As a result, here (and at a few other projects:  Meta, Commons, most of the Wiktionaries and Wikisources, a handful of Wikipedias with dual-script languages, etc.), using visual editing could be taken as an indicator that a &quot;new&quot; editor is not exactly new. 
For comparison, I've heard that about 40% of non-bot edits on desktop in the mainspace involve &quot;power user&quot; tools such as AWB.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 20:35, 9 May 2017 (UTC)

Readers might think the text is original research per [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AChiropractic_controversy_and_criticism&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=638563085&amp;oldid=616593727 this]. On controversial topics editors intentionally replaced sourced text with text that fails verification, especially in the lede. Sources in the lede is the best option. QuackGuru (talk) 01:34, 11 May 2017 (UTC)

Bundling too many citations at the end of the sentence will cause mass confusion. See &quot;Aluminum,[31] barium,[68] cadmium,[71] chromium,[1] copper,[11] iron,[11] lead,[71] manganese,[68] mercury,[72] nickel,[71] silicate,[11] silver,[11] strontium,[68] tin,[11] titanium,[68] zinc,[68] and zirconium have been found in the vapor.[68]&quot; That's the way to do this. QuackGuru (talk) 20:36, 11 May 2017 (UTC)
*Support citations for everything I support a default expectation that all claims in Wikipedia's medical content should be backed with citations to sources. I think the citations should be visible in all cases, and not commented out. I think that anyone is justified in striking any sentence without a citation, putting the burden back on anyone who restores it to add a citation. I do not think it would be appropriate at this time to remove all content which is not backed by a citation, but I do think that anyone is justified in always using citations after every sentence. If each sentence in a paragraph is backed with the same source, then I support having visible citations for all sentences. I support the use of citations for every sentence in the lead despite older wiki arguments that they are unnecessary. I acknowledge that this goes against wiki tradition but I think that the situation has changed and that there are good reasons for piloting reform of the citation system in medical articles. Having more citations increases the quality of Wikipedia's medical content. So far as I am able to understand, the major argument against using citations is that the presence of citations makes text more difficult and less attractive for readers to use, and that citations are a barrier to reader access to information. I am not persuaded that either that or other arguments against citations outweigh the reasons for having them.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 15:25, 12 May 2017 (UTC)

Other editors appear to want every sentence to be referenced. But than again we also have people who remove references when there are more than a couple in a row. I am not sure what the solution is. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 23:59, 19 May 2017 (UTC)
In a  editors who delete inline citations may be violating . See : &quot;Attribute all quotations and any material whose verifiability is challenged or likely to be challenged to a reliable, published source using an inline citation. The cited source must clearly support the material as presented in the article. Cite the source clearly and precisely (specifying page, section, or such divisions as may be appropriate). See Citing sources for details of how to do this.&quot;
See : &quot;If you want to request a source for an unsourced statement, you can tag a sentence with the  template by writing  or .&quot;
Any sentence without an inline citation is unsourced. But there is a much deeper problem. Most editors do not want to follow the rules. That may be the reason behind they are against an inline citation after every sentence. QuackGuru (talk) 00:19, 20 May 2017 (UTC)
Strongly support visible citation for every sentence. Things get messy when future editors will want to redraft and move things around (), articles will be more stable in the longterm. Matthew Ferguson (talk) 03:07, 20 May 2017 (UTC)
  There is always the potential for new users to have problems communicating, and having more references may help avoid those. In Fortnum's case he failed to leave edit summaries or reply on his talk page, but he did open a thread at  where he explains that he feels the &quot;text confuses 'cause' with 'association'&quot;. I've reworded that sentence of the lead and added another reference. --RexxS (talk) 10:42, 20 May 2017 (UTC)
Could we perhaps get a little clarity about what &quot;citations for every sentence&quot; means to its supporters?
For example, do you really believe that we need a citation behind a sentence such as &quot;The human hand normally has four fingers and a thumb&quot;?  Or do you mean that if a citation is needed for the content, then that citation should be present after each sentence and not merely dumped at the end of a long paragraph?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 01:05, 22 May 2017 (UTC)
I believe there is existing guidance about not needing sources for &quot;sky is blue&quot; statements. 
For stuff that needs citation, placing one inline citation at the end of a paragraph leads to  issues as other editors later redraft the article and add things in the middle of the paragraph. Matthew Ferguson (talk) 20:52, 26 May 2017 (UTC)
+1 to Matthew about the sky is blue thing; I can defer to existing policy on that. I do think the policy is often abused, though, with  being used to support content which is obvious to field experts but not known to layman readers. I also want citations in the lead and in infoboxes because I dispute the popular claim that Wikipedians have the capacity to easily manage the quality of leads and infoboxes when the citations are mixed in the body of the article somewhere. I feel that there was a misjudgement in the past about how labor intensive it is to cross check which sentences in the lead go to which citations in the body of an article and I want citations everywhere.

That was a huge edit, probably done offline/in a word processor.  Some of it's obviously problematic (e.g., blanking the entire
