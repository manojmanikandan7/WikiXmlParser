 Is Acupuncture a form of pseudoscience? 

Looking at the earlier discussions above, the field of acupuncture is obviously a very controversial topic, not just within the scientific community, but here on Wikipedia as well. 

The way forward, I believe, is to come to a consensus about whether it is indeed pseudoscience - if it is, then the article at cupuncture should say so. I personally believe that it is not pseudoscience, because

1) [http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/31107/title/Puncturing-the-Myth/ A plausible theory for its mechanism was proposed in 2009] 

2) [http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/35387/title/The-Science-of-Acupuncture/ Further studies have now proven that this theory is indeed true]

3) Mainstream medical journals have reviewed and  [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3192271/ accepted this theory]

4) Mainstream medical textbooks have [http://books.google.de/books?id=ev0rfZf1x6UC&amp;pg=PA352&amp;lpg=PA352&amp;dq=%22adenosine+and+nonpharmacological%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UBTCQY8KxJ&amp;sig=aLtr6UehcJAwjl1bRC6GsV98RWY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3TSbUtiwEaOG4AS_6oDICw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22adenosine%20and%20nonpharmacological%22&amp;f=false accepted this theory]

5) The latest review by the ational Cancer Institute [http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/acupuncture/patient says] that

Strangely, readers are not going to find any of this on Wikipedia, neither at the article cupuncture or elsewhere. In fact, acupuncture is still included in the ist of topics characterized as pseudoscience based on a misrepresentation of a 1997 NIH consensus statement. 

I have been accused countless times of promoting acupuncture, but I can disclose that I am not trained in acupuncture and have  never tried it out myself, but I am a firm believer in accepting hard evidence and keeping an open mind. 

If acupuncture is a form of pseudoscience as claimed by the ist of topics characterized as pseudoscience, can someone please show me a reliable source that explicitly says so based on widely accpeted scientific consensus? That way, it would be easier for me to keep a neutral perspective. -ser:A1candidate|A1candidate (ser talk:A1candidate|talk) 13:20, 1 December 2013 (UTC)

As constructive as the question. What's the point of trying to form a local consensus on this question? If the view WP contains (as stated in, e.g. the article you mention, ist of topics characterized as pseudoscience) is not reliably sourced then get it overturned there. If reliable sources characterize it as pseudoscience, WP follows, and trying to originate our own conclusion based on what the NCI  - or anybody else - says is not a gainful activity. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn ser talk:Alexbrn|talk|pecial:Contributions/Alexbrn|contribs|ser:Alexbrn#Conflict_of_interest_declaration|COI 13:39, 1 December 2013 (UTC)

It is definitely viewed as alternative medicine. Since placebo needling works as well as acupuncture needling (were you put the needle doesn't seem to make a deference) the mechanism behind acupuncture would be viewed as pseudoscience by some. ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 14:16, 1 December 2013 (UTC)

I notice that the National Cancer Institute website says that &quot;The study found that patients in both the true and sham acupuncture groups developed less nausea and vomiting than those in the standard care group.&quot; [http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/acupuncture/patient/Page2#Section_57] Which would seem to imply that, if acupuncture is a legitimate treatment, sham acupuncture is also. I would have thought sham acupuncture would be regarded as a perfect example of pseudo-science, even by acupuncturists. Perhaps not. --ser:Rbreen|Rbreen (ser talk:Rbreen|talk) 15:15, 1 December 2013 (UTC)
Curiously, sham acupuncture is probably less pseudoscientific since unlike &quot;real&quot; acupuncture is lacks the back-story of Qi energy, and instead is marshaled as an element in pursuit of evidence-based medical study (a scientific pursuit). ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn ser talk:Alexbrn|talk|pecial:Contributions/Alexbrn|contribs|ser:Alexbrn#Conflict_of_interest_declaration|COI 15:33, 1 December 2013 (UTC)

Acupuncture is an alternative medicine practice. The explanations offered by believers in its efficacy for its functionality beyond the placebo effect are, at this time, pseudoscientific. These include some of the statements made by government regulators and NGO advisories. Experts in quackery such as Edzard Ernst, David Gorski, Stephen Barrett, and Simon Singh have written extensively on the matter and basically have come to the consensus decision that there are no non-pseudoscientific mechanisms that acupuncturists promote. ser:QTxVi4bEMRbrNqOorWBV|jps (ser talk:QTxVi4bEMRbrNqOorWBV|talk) 15:19, 1 December 2013 (UTC)

@Doc James - It depends on how you define &quot;alternative medicine&quot;. For millions of people across ast Asia and parts of outheast Asia who cannot afford Western medical treatment, acupuncture/raditional Chinese medicine|TCM is the only form of treatment available to them. Your second point is a compelling one, except that simply putting a needle anywhere in the skin [http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=414193 is not a valid placebo], and there are [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304394008016029 different biological responses] between a sham acupuncture and a verum (true) acupuncture.  

@Rbreen - There is no question that sham acupuncture is a legitimate treatment option. The National Cancer Institute website states that both forms of acupuncture are superior to standard care. The issue at hand is whether true acupuncture is superior to sham acupuncture or not. Some recent reviews [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1533-2500.2009.00337.x/abstract do suggest that this may be the case]. 

@jps - Could you show me the specific mechanism of an acupuncture-induced placebo effect? 

@Roxy the dog - No, there is a demonstrable pain relief [http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v13/n7/fig_tab/nn0710-783_F1.html which can be felt after 30 minutes]

Arbitrary section break
ikipedia:WikiProject Skepticism/Encyclopedic articles is based on an &quot;Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience&quot;, and that work gives one of its longer articles to the topic of acupuncture. On that basis, I would have to say that there is sufficient basis from the standpoint of that part of the academic world which deals with matters of pseudoscience to say that they consider acupuncture to fall broadly in the range of pseudoscience. ser:John Carter|John Carter (ser talk:John Carter|talk) 18:19, 1 December 2013 (UTC)
I'm feeling like part of the problem is that we aren't working with the same meaning.  
&quot;Pseudoscience&quot; (and &quot;alternative&quot;, for that matter) does not mean &quot;something that doesn't work&quot;.  It means &quot;something that has a fake scientific explanation&quot;.  So if I tell my nephew that light bulbs give off light because tiny men light tiny candles inside them, I'm telling a fairy tale.  If I tell him that light bulbs give off light because there are phosphorescent bacteria on the surface of the bulb and flipping the light switch causes them to change state, then I'm engaging in pseudoscience.  No matter what explanation I give him, the light bulb still works, right? 
Acupuncture can be both &quot;pseudoscience&quot; and effective (for some purposes).  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 21:38, 1 December 2013 (UTC)
Yes, but acupuncture has the added wrinkle that there is no good evidence that is effective beyond a placebo either. Normally, this would be the end of the story. Quackery happens because the acupuncturists continue to claim that it is effective with pseudoscientific excuses. ser:QTxVi4bEMRbrNqOorWBV|jps (ser talk:QTxVi4bEMRbrNqOorWBV|talk) 22:25, 1 December 2013 (UTC)

That's nice. Please indicate whether the document in question directly addresses the matter of whether or not acupuncture can be reasonably described as pseudoscience or not, and specifically where such a statement might be made. I also once again note that there have been several forms of pseudoscientific medicine which have been demonstrated to produce some positive results, even if the principles upon which they are based are pseudoscientific, so I believe it is reasonable to request such statements directly relating to the matter of whether the principles upon which acupuncture is based, whatever they might be, are considered scientific or pseudoscientific, which is really the only kind of sourcing which is directly relevant to this discussion. ser:John Carter|John Carter (ser talk:John Carter|talk) 23:57, 1 December 2013 (UTC)

It would seem that there is an important distinction that doesn't seem to have been explicitly stated. Just sticking needles into people any old way is, most 
likely, not considered acupuncture by the vast majority of people. Certainly, I imagine that most practitioners would not hold this view, otherwise their &quot;degrees&quot; and training, and indeed any qualification that they possess (except perhaps basic nursing), is worthless. I also imagine that most patients do not hold this view either. Therefore, it seems important to keep in mind that acupuncture is in fact sticking needles in specific places in response to specific patient complaints (i.e. patients stomach hurts, so put a needle in this place because the qi is wrong (or something)), and must include the whole belief system that goes along with that. From this point of view, acupuncture is clearly pseudoscience (the explanation for it is mystic gibberish), especially since it doesnt appear to matter where you stick the needles. The debate on whether just sticking needles into people helps is a different matter. It does bring up an interesting hypothetical though: supposing acupuncture did work, but practitioners still used the current mythical belief system. Would it still count as pseudoscience? I would say probably. ser:Benboy00|Benboy00 (ser talk:Benboy00|talk) 16:05, 2 December 2013 (UTC)

@jps - Unfortunately, the article on lacebo effect makes no mention whatsoever of acupuncture. I would like to see hard evidence of an acupuncture-induced placebo effect instead of mere speculation, even if this may be plausible.

@John Carter - The source cited by ikipedia:WikiProject Skepticism/Encyclopedic articles is a book called the Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience that is published in the year 2000, which is more than a decade ago. Could you show me a reliable, independent source that has been published more recently to back up such claims? I believe there is indeed a great deal of scientific studies performed in this field since 2000 (see below).

@WhatamIdoing - That is a very good point you've made. A core concept of acupuncture, according to raditional Chinese Medicine, is the principle of i. In acupuncture, this can by observed by deqi (&quot;flow of Qi&quot;), which has a specific biological effect on people receiving acupuncture as proven by many different studies published in numerous mainstream scientific journals, as you can see for yourself [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006899309026535 here], [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmri.22006/full here], [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811909003309 here], [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156607021000069X here], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3192271/ here], [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006899310020457 here], and [http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10548-010-0148-8 many more]. Granted, there is still a lot of research to do and not all of these studies are conclusive, but so far, I have yet to see any evidence to the contrary.

@Benboy00 - [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0730725X09002902 It does matter where you stick the needles].

Concerns of LT910001
This boat may already have set sail, but I finally took a look at the cupuncture article, where some very strange things are going on. I refer here to just two:
* &quot;A report for CSICOP on pseudoscience in China written by Wallace Sampson and Barry Beyerstein said:... A few Chinese scientists we met ...&quot; (?!!)
* &quot;A 2012 meta-analysis found significant differences between true and sham acupuncture, which indicates that acupuncture is more than a placebo when treating chronic pain (even though the differences were modest). [99] Commenting on this meta-analysis, professor Edzard Ernst stated&quot; 
Amongst others, recorded here (Talk:Acupuncture#Commentary_from_individuals). A lot of weight (P:UNDUE) is given to quotes from certain individuals (P:MEDRS), which I find strange given the high-quality sources available on both sides of the aisle for this article. At any rate I feel I ought to flag this here, while we are discussing MEDRS in Acupuncture. --ser:LT910001|LT910001 (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 12:50, 17 December 2013 (UTC)
As far as I can see the problem is that a couple of editors at the acupuncture article (who call themselves skeptics) are straying from the path of objectiveness and science... We have a couple of reliable meta-reviews in the article concluding that acupuncture is effective for certain pain conditions. But some editors just refuse to accept that, because it doesn't fit their world view... and are now waging a sort of guerrilla war - which includes adding quotes like the ones above. Or this one: &quot;Quackwatch stated that, the TCM theories are so nebulous that no amount of scientific study will enable TCM to offer rational care&quot;. The rationale I hear in these cases is always the same: to counter a perceived pro-acupuncture POV. Which is just not there. The acupuncture article is one of the best sourced articles I know. Just take a look at the reflist. --ser:Mallexikon|Mallexikon (ser talk:Mallexikon|talk) 08:52, 18 December 2013 (UTC)
Skeptic editors are extremely vigilant in enforcing MEDRS, deleting individual randomized controlled trials wherever they see them. But then they add Ernst's comments from The Guardian. These comments fail MEDRS because they are &quot;non-evidence-based expert opinion,&quot; which MEDRS places at the bottom of the hierarchy of sources. Plus, MEDRS clearly states that popular media shouldn't be used as a source. ser:TimidGuy|TimidGuy (ser talk:TimidGuy|talk) 12:07, 18 December 2013 (UTC)
 It's simply not true that &quot;expert opinions&quot; (of whatever shade) fail MEDRS. P:MEDASSESS asks us to assess them as lower-quality sources, but specifically does not exclude them from consideration. The order suggested must also be treated with some degree of understanding: in the field of diving medicine, for example, an opinion by eter B.  Bennett or imon Mitchell is likely to be given far more credence in the mainstream view than an individual RCT. Our guidelines are extremely useful, and valid for the vast majority of cases, but we should not make the mistake of treating them as utterly infallible. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 15:41, 18 December 2013 (UTC)
As far as I understood ser:LT910001 they are concerned about P:UNDUE, not about expert opinions failing MEDRS. --ser:Mallexikon|Mallexikon (ser talk:Mallexikon|talk) 06:23, 19 December 2013 (UTC)

I'm concerned for several reasons. 
* Firstly, I don't believe Quackwatch constitutes an expert medical opinion, of which there are numerous other national and international medical bodies which can provide equivalent and medically-based expert opinion. This includes the WHO and numerous national-level medical bodies. Additionally P:UNDUE whole paragraphs are given to the perspective, however well-informed, of individuals - for example, one entire paragraphs are given to reporting the opinion of a Felix Mann. For a world-wide practice thousands of years old with numerous reviews and meta-analyses, and consensus statements to boot, this is not balanced.
* Secondly, I'm concerned, as documented, by the numerous use of individuals as sources. Not only do these give undue weight but I'm concerned that it significantly biases the article. Not only that, but there is implicit cultural sensitivities here. For example, the quote above &quot;A report for CSICOP on pseudoscience in China written by Wallace Sampson and Barry Beyerstein said:... A few Chinese scientists we met ...&quot; is equivalent in my mind at least equivalent to inserting in the alaria article &quot;However, a report by MalariaWatch, written by X and Y, said... A few African scientists we met...&quot;, and this occurs twice. I cannot stress how profoundly this quote fails P:MEDRS, P:UNDUE and P:BIAS. And, while we are on the subject, if quotes of this ilk are included, why are no quotes of Chinese origin included? This appears to be a practice 3,000 years old and yet there is not a single quote from either a historical source or Chinese body to represent this?
* Thirdly, I do not see any other medical article where facts are reported, in the name of BALANCE, like this: &quot;A 2013 metaanalysis found X. However, a professor in a university disagreed.&quot; To stress this, let's consider &quot;A 2013 metaanalysis reported the efficacy of the combined oral birth control pill as Y. However, in an opinion piece, professor X from Y university disagreed.&quot; This is an example of P:OR, which explicitly states &quot; If one reliable source says A, and another reliable source says B, do not join A and B together to imply a conclusion C&quot;. Shall we state the position of every professor with an opinion on this matter? 

If we are to take MEDRS at all seriously, this article needs to have these replaced with secondary sources that are of higher reliability than the expert medical or non-medical opinion of individuals. P:BALANCE does not trump WP:MEDRS. There is a whole list of reviews and metaanalyses detailing where acupuncture does and does not have an evidence base for efficacy that are documented within this article, and I strongly feel that these constitute a strong enough evidence without the addition of arbitrarily-selected expert opinions and quotes to justify this. I hope this clarifies my concerns. --ser:LT910001|LT910001 (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 12:52, 19 December 2013 (UTC)

 Who cares, aka, WP:MED has lost its way 
From our cupuncture article:A 2013 systematic review of English-language case reports found that serious dverse events associated with acupuncture are rare, but acupuncture is not without risk. Between 2000 and 2011, the incidence of English-language reported adverse events was 294 cases from 25 countries and regions. The most common adverse effect observed was infection, and the majority of infections were bacterial in nature, caused by skin contact at the needling site. Other adverse complications include bilateral hand dema, pithelioid granuloma, seudolymphoma, rgyria, pustules, ancytopenia, and scarring due to hot needle technique.ite journal |title=Adverse Events of Acupuncture: A Systematic Review of Case Reports |author=Xu, Shifen, et al. |journal=Evidence Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine |volume= 2013|year=2013 |pmid=23573135 |doi=10.1155/2013/581203 |pmc=3616356 |pages=581203 |doi-access=free  So, benefits attributed to acupuncture may be due to the placebo effect, and a small number of people using acupuncture may get skin infections.  WOW !!! That's dangerous stuff. Let's get all of WP:MED to weigh in on this serious issue, lest someone in China get a positive placebo effect result and a skin infection to boot.   On the other hand, no one from WP:MED can be bothered to help out at the POV, poorly sourced mess in the suite of articles at l|cannabis, also discussed on this page, where secondary reviews indicate real potential for physical, mental, behavioral and social harm among a huge number of persons, considering the prevalence of cannabis use.   What's wrong in here?  This is why we need a medical disclaimer on our medical content.  We can't even get medical editors to help out or keep up with our really dangerous articles; the battleground du jour seems to be acupuncture.  Disclaimer:  I have a bias.  I respect MEDRS when editing, and I voted to delete erman Acupuncture Trials because they are a coatrack and content could be included in cupuncture, but I don't really care if the benefits from acupuncture are real or due to the placebo effect.  When my 12-yo-son lost a year of his academic life due to two-week-long status migraines, only the relief from acupuncture helped him regain some of his life when nothing else helped.  I don't care if it was placebo or not; I saw the pain go out of his face and body when the needles went in from a good practitioner, and I saw nothing happen when that man was on vacation and a poor practitioner used different needle placement, and I saw good acupuncture help him when even when morphine didn't help.  So, I don't see the problems with our acupuncture content as much of a big deal, and wonder why can't we all go fix our really bad articles.  If folks can't be bothered to help out at edical cannabis, ong-term effects of cannabis, ffects of cannabis, annabis in pregnancy etc, which were massively POV and medically incorrect until just two of us started working on them two days ago, expect me to continue pushing for a medical disclaimer.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 18:01, 2 December 2013 (UTC)

As an editor who edits predominantly on P:FRINGE topics, acupuncture is exactly the kind of article where I spend most of my time fretting about details. However, Sandy is absolutely right: in comparison to this type of nicety, the problem in the &quot;cannabis suite&quot; is real &amp; serious. The annabis (drug) article has over 1,000 watchers, over 6,000 distinct authors and ~7,500 daily page views. These article were crammed (and I mean crammed) with bogus health information, ranging from assertions that cannabis use was totally harmless to a statement that it was an established treatment for brain cancer (seriously). The voluminous Talk page archives show that a lot of effort and consensus-building went into getting them as they were. I think this raises some questions for us: how could comparatively mainstream articles like this have got into such an abysmal state with nobody even noticing? ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn ser talk:Alexbrn|talk|pecial:Contributions/Alexbrn|contribs|ser:Alexbrn#Conflict_of_interest_declaration|COI 18:29, 2 December 2013 (UTC)
Yes many of the articles on Wikipedia dealing with sex and drugs are a disaster. And you are correct that I more or less ignore them (other than having removed many of the sex related articles from WP:MED).

I am happy to weight in if specific issues are encountered over disagreements regarding how to apply WP:MEDRS. Or how to interpret a reference.
We however have many articles on key health care topics that are more or less completely unloved. They are relatively easy to improve as so few people work on them. The ones I refer to of course are this list [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Medicine/Translation_task_force/Popular_pages] and I am slowly bringing them to GA. I assume many people who are looking up &quot;cannabis&quot; have already made their mind up regarding the topic and any content we contain will have no effect on their decisions. 
I would strongly support efforts to more clearly mark if an reference is a review or primary source. I know ser:Zad68 has build a tool to help with this. If we had a bot to add it as a ref parameter in individual articles that people from this project are working to improve it may help with this effort.

* Re: rant, I think there are a few essays on this general theme (e.g. P:Wikipedia is failing/P:Wikipedia is succeeding). It generally depends on your outlook on life.

You could say &quot;things are better than they were in 2005, maybe they will slowly keep getting better&quot;.

To me, any phrase that reads &quot;no amount of X will ever Y&quot; is a crystal ball phrase. Such a statement is largely unsupportable, as it makes a definite future prediction, and nobody can make future predictions with such certainty. Remember, the line is not an assumption (&quot;it is unlikely that...&quot;) but a definite statement. It would be akin to George W. Bush saying in 2002 that &quot;nothing can ever disprove Iraq's posession of WMDs&quot;, or clergymen in the 19th Century stating that &quot;no amount of foolish blasphemy will ever prove the theory of evolution, and disprove His almighty creation of all that is around us&quot;. We might not have enough randomised controlled trials and clinically useful studies done on TCM now, but that doesn't mean that in 10 or 20 years time there will never be; it makes zero sense to state that something will never happen in future, if the people of the present have no control over the future. It's logically absurd. I can only interpret those words by QuackWatch as an unbalanced POV statement, since it relies on literary yperbole to bring its message across, instead of a logically valid statement. --ser:benlisquare|benlisquareser talk:benlisquare|T•pecial:Contributions/Benlisquare|C•pecial:EmailUser/User:Benlisquare|E 00:55, 14 December 2013 (UTC)

Actually the statement is about as precise as the nebulous nature of TCM, which is a hodgepodge of ideas, some of which are religious, traditional, prescientific, and/or outright pseudoscientific. Now if Barrett were speaking about a specific aspect like acupuncture, I would be able to follow your reasoning, but we're talking about TCM, which is an umbrella term, and that umbrella has lots of holes in it. That statement points out that with so many holes, it will never be able to keep anyone completely dry. Now if that statement were to be used about a specific segment of the umbrella which had no holes, or only a few, it would be wrong to use it, but that's not the case here, so it's actually very apt. -- ser:BullRangifer|Brangifer (ser talk:BullRangifer|talk) 01:11, 14 December 2013 (UTC)

P:FRINGE/PS answers this question: No

I agree that this is an interesting and nuanced topic area, a mixed bag evidence-wise, and (for those reasons) a lame windmill for would-be debunkers to tilt at.  But the question &quot;is it a pseudoscience&quot; is already addressed by policy.

We had an P:ARB/PS|ArbCom case on pseudoscience that produced guidelines on when to characterize topics as pseudoscience.  See P:FRINGE/PS.  Acupuncture:
*has a following, and also
*has critics who say it's a pseudoscience, but
*is not generally considered pseudoscience in the scientific community, 
which means we can't characterize it as pseudoscience (unambiguously, e.g., by putting it in category:pseudoscience).  But we can (and do) include in the article good critical RS's that say it's pseudoscientific.  We can also put it on a list, e.g. ist of topics characterized as pseudoscience, because its inclusion can be annotated and thereby qualified. 

How do we know if a position is held by the scientific community at large?  Simple, we need an adequate source that is clear on the point, per P:RS/AC.  Examples include statements by scientific academies.  There is no such source for acupuncture (as opposed to e.g. homeopathy).  

The idea of a literal i running through the body is just as pseudoscientific as any italistic notion, but there is active mainstream research -- with mixed results -- into acupuncture as a treatment.  [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21359919 Cochrane reviews], among the most highly regarded in medicine, find evidence of acu being effective for certain conditions, but the effects are small and the design of proper controls non-trivial, so the debate goes on over whether or not it's really just a placebo.  Good reviews exist, pro [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22965186] and con [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16420542].

At alk:Simon Baron-Cohen, l|WhatamIdoing invokes P:MEDRS to say that a quote from Rapin in the Wall Street Journal book review of The Essential Difference by imon Baron-Cohen &quot;is not usually the kind of MEDRS-type source that we prefer&quot;.[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Simon_Baron-Cohen&amp;oldid=588243988#Additional]   Rapin is a recognized expert on autism: to the best of my knowledge, none of Baron-Cohen's theories on autism have gained acceptance.  Why is Rapin not a reliable source to review a book by Baron-Cohen, about his autism theories? These are autism experts commenting on book reviews of pop psychology theories of autism.  If Rapin is not an RS on the topic of autism, why do we cite her secondary reviews all over Wikipedia? (As a side note, I just wrote Rapin's article in an hour and a half, while in six years, I haven't been able to get the POV and uncited text cleaned up at Baron-Cohen.) ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 00:39, 30 December 2013 (UTC)

SandyGeorgia is proposing that [http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10583036864206600 a newspaper article, written by a staff reporter] (not a &quot;recognized autism expert&quot;) at The Wall Street Journal, be used as a source to say whether this scientific idea is good or bad.  The newspaper article, at one point, quotes a somewhat negative viewpoint from a recognized expert.  It also quotes the originator of this idea, and it comes to no actual conclusion about whether the idea is any good.
The question I asked is, &quot;Is there really no scholarly criticism of his ideas?&quot;  MEDRS isn't really supportive of cience by press release, even when it includes a quotation from an expert, and it directly states that &quot;The popular press is generally not a reliable source for scientific and medical information&quot;.  But perhaps a somewhat more direct question would be helpful:  :Why should we cite a newspaper article on whether this scientific idea is any good, when peer-reviewed, scholarly eview articles about this idea (like MID|22369368) exist?  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 01:30, 30 December 2013 (UTC)
 We are talking about a book review; did a medical reliable source summarize the book in the article?  (No. Statements about what the book claims are not sourced to MEDRS sources-- they are sourced to the book.)  So we allow an author's article to make statements about what his book proposes as a theory (not accepted by mainstream medical consensus) but we would disallow reliable expert's commentaries in a book review?  Just because the book reviews are published well, where book reviews are usually published?  Pushing MEDRS to these limits will give MEDRS a bad name.  It looks like disallowing an acknowledged expert book review just because she is quoted in the laypress-- which is where books are usually reviewed.  Since you hadn't reviewed the history of the article, I wonder if you really even considered the expertise brought to bear in the review.  Further, where do you intend to draw this line?  We can't quote Rapin, an autism expert, from the Wall Street Journal, but the article can cite Time magazine and Nature and any other manner of laypress in support of the book?  In a bio, where COI editing is evident, anything printed by magazines has been allowed, but critical review by an expert is disallowed, in a book review, in the name of MEDRS?  Recipe for POV, which is what the article is now.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 01:45, 30 December 2013 (UTC)
I don't actually see anything in the WSJ article that indicates that it is a book review.  The [http://articles.latimes.com/2004/jan/18/books/bk-wertheim18 Los Angeles Times piece] is a book review, but the WSJ piece appears to be a plain old article, in the &quot;Health&quot; section and about the subject matter, not about the book.  The fact that his theory was described in a book gets less than half a sentence out of the entire article (&quot;his theory, outlined in a recent book, The Essential Difference...&quot;).  The WSJ has [http://online.wsj.com/public/page/news-books-best-sellers.html a dedicated section for book reviews], but as far as I can tell, this particular article wasn't in it.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 04:35, 30 December 2013 (UTC)
d
Expert opinion is one of the categories of content that can be considered as set out at P:MEDASSESS. Care is needed of course but since Rapin is &quot;considered by many the doyenne of autism&quot; then I'd have thought her expert opinion is both relevant and usable here. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn ser talk:Alexbrn|talk|pecial:Contributions/Alexbrn|contribs|ser:Alexbrn#Conflict_of_interest_declaration|COI 06:21, 30 December 2013 (UTC)

 Agreed.  At any rate, better understanding of WAID's novel position wrt MEDRS is needed, as article progess is at a standstill pending resolution of her opposition to secondary laypress sources in a BLP, to express what SBC's views are.  The article makes extensive use of sources like Time magazine, NY Times, The Guardian, Scientific American, Nature and others, as secondary sources documenting the views of imon Baron-Cohen.  (Yes, there are few other secondary reviews of his work beause as far as I know none of his theories have gained traction, but he does attract media attention.)  Since WAID is rejecting lay sources for writing about his views, including those expressed in his books, shall we delete all lay sources from his article?  That would leave his book opinions unopposed and unbalanced.    Without pedantry, we need to understand if:
* WAID rejects sabelle Rapin (and other medical experts quoted in the laypress) as an authoritative reliable source on the topic, only because she was quoted in the laypress, or
* because the report in the laypress has no author in the byline,
* or because she rejects anything for this kind of BLP written in the laypress.
 Until this is resolved, it's hard to proceed with article work. Shall we remove all mention of SBC's theories, for example, as documented in Time magazine?  And if WAID is rejecting all laypress book reviews on medical topics, we've got big problems in scores of articles, because most book reviews happen in the laypress.  (I won't engage the pedantry that this particular WSJ article is not a book review, since SBC's views are clearly put forward in those books.)   Considering this pedantic black-and-white view of how to use laypress sources in a BLP, I'm not sure how much of an article SBC will have left if we follow WAID's interpretation of MEDRS. 
 ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 17:32, 30 December 2013 (UTC)
* I don't reject any person, expert or otherwise.  I am concerned about using publications that do not meet the standards set forth in MEDRS, not people.  Experts get misquoted and misrepresented in the laypress all the time.  If you want to know what Rapin thinks about this, then go look for something that Rapin wrote herself.
* Since I'm merely repeating to you the exact text of MEDRS, it's a little difficult to see how this is my &quot;novel position&quot;.  MEDRS directly says, ighlight|The popular press is generally not a reliable source for scientific and medical information in articles....Conversely, the high-quality popular press can be a good source for social, biographical, current-affairs, and historical information in a medical article.  If you don't like it, then go get the guideline changed.
* I'm not telling you that the source can't be used.  I'm telling you that it's not a great source for medical information.  
* P:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS is a pathetic argument.  My view about using a newspaper article written by a non-expert reporter applies to all of the other sources, too.  If you want to use them (or, indeed, the two that we've discussed here) to support &quot;social, biographical, current-affairs, and historical information&quot;, then go for it.  If you want to use them for &quot;scientific and medical information&quot;, then that's not okay.
* Newspaper articles are not generally considered to be secondary sources.  See P:PRIMARYNEWS.  You are allowed to P:USEPRIMARY sources, but MEDRS discourages it.  For that matter, you could simply cite his own books for the contents of his books.  We do that so routinely in articles about books that we normally don't bother providing any citation at all.
* There are, obviously (because I linked one above), scholarly reviews about his ideas.  If your deliberate search for negative viewpoints has turned up no criticism except in one quotation from an expert in the laypress and one book review by a non-expert, then IMO you need to consider whether those negative viewpoints are P:DUE.  And if there are more significant or more scholarly criticisms (surely there are!), then IMO you ought to be citing those other sources.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 19:00, 30 December 2013 (UTC)
 Again, you have not addressed the query or dealt with the extensive use of other laypress sources in that article (and no, my alleged &quot;deliberate search for negative viewpoints&quot; did not turn up &quot;no criticism&quot;-- there is boatloads-- the point is, there is essentially no support for SBC's theories in journal-published secondary reviews).  Please stop prevaricating; do you want laysources removed from that article, or not?  If you do, most of the article needs to be gutted, and there will be little left to say, since his theories have little coverage/traction in secondary journal sources, while plenty of play in laysources, and if we remove laysources (indeed, commentary from recognized experts in the field), the propositions put forward in his books will be left unbalanced and unopposed.  Your interpretation of MEDRS that Isabelle Rapin being quoted in a very high quality newspaper as unreliable for a review of another researcher's personal theories is most certainly novel.  In the meantime, the main editor of that article continues POV editing.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 19:31, 30 December 2013 (UTC)
I have addressed your query about the extensive use of other laypress sources.  Specifically, I said that &quot;WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS is a pathetic argument&quot;.  But so that we can be clear, here is a more detailed statement:
I want all laysources &quot;removed&quot; from this and all other articles in the entire English Wikipedia:
# where &quot;laysources&quot; specifically means &quot;popular press&quot; rather than reputable sources that intend to provide medical information to people who are not professional healthcare providers (e.g., lay summaries like [http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/alcmisuse/alcmisusefact.pdf this] from USPSTF);
# ff|if and only if said laysources are used to support scientific or medical information, e.g., what flaws might be present in a scientific idea; 
# where the primary and preferred definition of &quot;removed&quot; is &quot;replaced by a stronger source, if possible&quot;; and
# so that action is taken at some point before the P:DEADLINE, explicitly including any time in the next hundred years. 
So that there may be no confusion, I will also state the obvious converse:
I do not want laysources removed from this article, if said laysources are not used to support scientific or medical information.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 21:15, 30 December 2013 (UTC)
I can't read the article myself but looking through this discussion I think WhatamIdoing has a point. I don't trust newspapers to not cherry pick quotations or to quote out-of-context or even to quote accurately. We do have a problem in general with ideas promoted in the lay or popular press that are simply shunned in academia rather than publicly rejected (which may or may not be the case here). The increasing use of blogs by scientists doesn't help us find reliable sources. Books are sometimes reviewed in academic press, though such a review may concentrate more on the quality of writing or methods of argument rather than whether the theory is valid. -- ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 10:14, 3 January 2014 (UTC)

This is believed to be a form of nonconvulsive behavioral seizure (NCBS); following this theory, seizure-like limbic pathomechanisms that are kindled by memory stimuli result in brief psychotic episodes in which the affected patients impulsively set fire. It should be stressed that these hypotheses are purely based on a few case reports, and that no solid epidemiologic data support the theory that these forms of impulse control disorder are truly more common in epilepsy as compared to the general population.&quot;

 Sources on behavior genetics 

Wikipedia has a lot of interesting articles based on the ongoing research in behavior genetics, both in humans and in nonhuman animals. I've been reading university textbooks on genetics &quot;for fun&quot; since the 1980s, and for even longer I've been visiting my state flagship university's vast BioMedical Library to look up topics on human medicine and health care policy. That university has long been a center of research on human behavior genetics, being the site of a major study of monozygotic twins reared apart. I currently participate in a weekly &quot;journal club&quot; there with multidisciplinary postgraduate discussion of human genetics. On the hypothesis that better sources build better articles as all of us here collaborate P:HERE | to build an encyclopedia, I thought I would suggest some sources for updating the articles on behavior genetics and related topics. The P:MEDRS | Wikipedia guidelines on reliable sources in medicine provide a helpful framework for evaluating sources. The guidelines, consistent with the P:RS | general Wikipedia guidelines on reliable sources, remind us that all &quot;Wikipedia articles should be based on reliable, published secondary sources&quot; (emphasis in original). 

Other Wikipedians who watch the article ehavioural genetics did all of us a great favor on the article talk page by suggesting helpful sources. In particular, ser:Pete.Hurd suggested an authoritative textbook on behavior genetics, covering both the human and the animal research, and following up on his suggestion led me to several other helpful sources with similar subject cataloging in libraries. 

Noting that ehavioural genetics is listed as a start-class, high-importance article by the WikiProjects for both genetics and psychology, I will start a workpage of an article update draft in my user space, relying on the sources recommended on the article talk page and on others listed here (in approximate order of date of publication, which is also almost but not exactly the order in which I have read them over the last few years):

I'm particularly mentioning this here on the WikiProject Medicine project talk page because some of the article edits I plan to clean up what another active editor here describes as a &quot;mess&quot; while in greater or smaller part impinge on articles that are more squarely on topics of medicine-as-such. I generally leave most articles on purely medical topics in the hands of editors who have formal training in medicine (I have a few of those on my watchlist), but as I surf by articles that link over to the behavior genetics articles, I may have occasion, as I did yesterday, to update wikilinks or otherwise incidentally edit minor details of articles in the scope of this project. I welcome all of you to suggest how I may most collaboratively proceed to clean up the mess in the many articles that pertain to behavior genetics, and I invite all of you to suggest sources on the topic of behavior genetics that fit the most stringent interpretation of the P:MEDRS guidelines. Best wishes for a happy new year with many article improvements. -- ser:WeijiBaikeBianji|WeijiBaikeBianji (ser talk:WeijiBaikeBianji|talk, ser:WeijiBaikeBianji/Editing|how I edit) 23:51, 2 January 2014 (UTC)

I think we are looking at a subject expert editor here, and some of the sources seem at least at a glance to be sound. I think it would be best to inform about policy and inform that English sources are preferred unless translation is available. That said quite a few of the sources (if not all) are from Luis Joaquín García López, who seems to have published numerous (200+) papers on the subject, a number of which are CC-BY.

 &quot;In the news&quot; article that needs a watcher or two 

Just FYI, there's a ahi mcmath article about a California girl that's making quite a few headlines here in the US, dealing with some pretty thorny medical ethics issues.  The article needs cleanup but has no outrageous issues.  Asking whether this is a BLP is a major headache.  The article probably should have a watcher or two to make sure it doesn't attract any adverse content.  pecial:Contributions/24.18.193.73|24.18.193.73 (ser talk:24.18.193.73|talk) 08:58, 4 January 2014 (UTC)

It is mildly notable because the outcome has implications for many future cases.  If the family gets what it wants it will become very notable, but I don't think that is likely.  Beyond that it is notable simply because of the breadth of coverage by the news media. ser:Looie496|Looie496 (ser talk:Looie496|talk) 17:16, 4 January 2014 (UTC)
It might be better to merge the content into another article, but what would be the target?  There's a &quot;teachable moment&quot; in the McMath case (the article, as with Schiavo, should probably be about the case and not about the individual) in understanding the distinction between coma and death, and it might even have a home in rain death or some other overview article.  pecial:Contributions/24.18.193.73|24.18.193.73 (ser talk:24.18.193.73|talk) 18:22, 4 January 2014 (UTC)
It can be merged into a parent article. Coverage by the news media doesn't necessarily guarantee notability, and P:BLP1E still applies.

 Expert help needed over at T:WikiProject Neuroscience 

ikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Neuroscience#Expert_help_needed.21 A user brings up a question which really seems to belong here as it is about the effects of neurotransmitters relating to a psychiatric disorder. Seems to partly be a sourcing issue.
The section ntisocial_personality_disorder#Hormones_and_neurotransmitters feels very shakey. It was basically only about serotonines, so I added some text about serotonine and cortisol. However, I feel I'm out of my depth with this section. An article is used as a source that in its summary says: Trait aggression was significantly higher in the combinations “high T + high cortisol responses” (indicating decreased 5-HT availability), and “low T + low cortisol responses” (indicating increased 5-HT availability), after S-citalopram. Now I can copyedit these words but it doesn't make any sense to me - especially as I thought cortisol counteracts testosterone, so I would expect most trait aggression in the high T and low cortisol responses, and the least trait aggression in the low T and high cortisol responses. Now obviously this is not the case - showing that I don't get it. Could any of you with more insight into this copyedit the text so it becomes clear not for all of us who are not neuroscientists? ser:Lova_Falk|Lova Falk ser talk:Lova Falk|talk 16:06, 28 December 2013 (UTC)

 That's a really complicated question, because the neuroendocrine system involved encompasses the whole ypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (cortisol) and ypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (testosterone, esp. in men) - that's to say there's a lot of feedback back and forth between the axes. In a nutshell, the regulatory mechanism goes both ways. Cortisol affects testosterone and estosterone#Biological uses|testosterone affects cortisol by regulating the HPA axis under certain conditions (see bullet 2) through the hypothalamus (probably are indirect mechanisms as well). The above ref's statement is more or less in line with that bullet's ref and its explanation. ser:Seppi333|Seppi333 (ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert 2¢) 07:49, 7 January 2014 (UTC)

* athematical modeling of large-scale electrophysiological activity in epilepsy  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 00:16, 7 January 2014 (UTC)

 An excessively detailed article title like this may indicate that some particular POV (in this case, a particular set of  mathematical models) is being pushed. I don't know the literature well enough to judge POV, but it seems like a more general title, such as omputational model of epilepsy, would be a better choice. At this level of generality, there are review articles like [http://www.seizure-journal.com/article/S1059-1311(12)00224-5/fulltext], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3201757/], [http://www.expert-reviews.com/doi/abs/10.1586/14737175.8.6.889], and [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1528-1167.2011.03225.x/full]. --ser:Mark viking|Mark viking (ser talk:Mark viking|talk) 00:42, 7 January 2014 (UTC)

* That's more in the realm of P:MATH and OSMATH; however, that article isn't compliant with MOSMATH (or really, an encyclopedic style in general), because it's rhetorical in the analysis section.  Reads a lot more like a summary/amalgamation of research papers than an encyclopedia article.  I'm not going to comment on notability, because I'm not familiar with that particular sub-field of athematical biology (omputational neuroscience); at the very least, it needs a restructuring/rewrite to conform to encyclopedic standards.

Hey, everybody, thanks for the fresh eyes! I tried PRODding the page, but the editor who created it (yes, pretty much an SPI) reverted it, and tends to revert most things that I try. I'd support an AfD of the page in its present state, because it really is just a promo for one rather isolated bit of research, but I also think that there's a place on Wikipedia for a broader page about synchronization in epilepsy, with a lot of coverage of the mathematical modeling, but also with some experimental neuroscience and neurology. I haven't had the ambition to really fight it out with the other editor, but if we can have a couple of editors with eyes on it, I'd really like to see the page changed from the essay that it is now, to something broader and encyclopedic. --ser:Tryptofish|Tryptofish (ser talk:Tryptofish|talk) 20:13, 7 January 2014 (UTC)

We may need a guideline dealing with COI as it pertains to medicine. I have seen a fair number of experts who are here to promote themselves or there business more than write a balanced encyclopedia.

I do at some point recall |SandyGeorgia proposing a policy to deal with information added to med articles in a 'quick remove' sense, such as if uncited information is added, as apparently is used by WP:BIO (I apologise if I'm paraphrasing incorrectly, Sandy). If such a policy were to be formed, it could incorporate a sensible removal policy of: (1) unsourced content; (2) primary sources on articles. Part (2) would cover the majority of COI sources anyway, I believe. --ser:LT910001|LT910001 (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 23:16, 6 January 2014 (UTC)

I'm with |LT910001 that we need no further pages with extra guidance. Decisions to remove unverifiable information require case-by-case editorial decisions on verifiability. I generally agree that information medical that cannot be sourced to a MEDRS-compliant source is often best removed (although it requires a modicum of effort to determine that something is not sourceable). For BLPs the trigger is lower because of the risk of defamation. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 23:25, 6 January 2014 (UTC)
I don't really see this problem as specific to medicine. The p:COI problem affects virtually all areas of WP, always running up against p:AGF and p:OUTING. I doubt that a new guideline would go far. Our best tools are p:SECONDARY (to constrain the use of POV sources), p:NOTMYSPACE (to deter self-promotion) and of course simple education for the well-intentioned but overenthusiastic newbies. Essays can help with educating the latter group. Once in a while, as at LCAT test, we see the law of unintended consequences bites the culprits. ser:LeadSongDog|LeadSongDog ser talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl! 23:28, 6 January 2014 (UTC)

 ser:LT910001, I think you're referring to the oft-expressed notion that we might elevate MEDRS to a BLP-like policy, enabling us to more easily remove unsourced or poorly sourced content.  I don't see that as the same as COI?  l|Jfdwolff, it is easier for the docs among us-- and particularly those who have journal access-- to easily remove poorly sourced content.  It is harder for those of us who aren't docs or don't have journal access-- it can take us (me :) a very long time to determine if content should be removed, which is why I often can only go through and flag primary sources, and let the docs decide if the content should be removed.  If we had a policy to allow the removal of poorly sourced content, it would make my work easier and faster, but I don't see the relation to COI ... I think we already have that covered, except that often COI editors are trying to add primary sources (this has been the theme of most of my editing for the last two weeks, as we seem to have been hit with a lot of editors pushing their pet theories into articles).  I don't think we need a new guideline page for medical COI: we just need more admins to enforce it!  In one BLP I've been working on this week, it took the non-medical admins a bit longer than the docs to see the problem.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 00:08, 7 January 2014 (UTC)

Perhaps we need to make a provision in P:MEDRS that content obviously based on primary sources should be considered for removal. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 00:09, 7 January 2014 (UTC)
 As a caveat to this, from the anatomical perspective, if editors were to consider MEDRS as applying to Anatomy, most of Anatomy is based on a chain of whispers emerging from primary sources. I may be thinking three steps ahead here, as this is not an issue we face at the moment. --ser:LT910001|LT910001 (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 23:21, 7 January 2014 (UTC)
 I don't know.  Problem for a lay-person is that, if I know the topic semi-well (hypothyroidism, say), I can see what is likely incorrect and should be removed, vs. what is poorly sourced but could be sourced to a secondary review if I had journal access.  If I don't know the topic, I can't be of much help.  It is painstaking work for a layperson with limited journal access, and I often feel I am of little help.  I don't know what the solution is, but in those cases where we have intransigent POV-pushers (eg a BLP I worked on this week, and for six years), a policy allowing us to remove poorly sourced content (which I knew to be poorly sourced) would have saved me a lot of time.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 00:14, 7 January 2014 (UTC)
Yep |SandyGeorgia, I feel that the vast majority of COI editing is editing which relies on sources which are not reliable or are primary, so a stronger MEDRS grounding may have a significant impact on our ability to manage COI and student-based editing. Additionally, I feel an elevated MEDRS would be able to be used with a clarity and ease that would not be found in a new COI-policy.--ser:LT910001|LT910001 (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 23:21, 7 January 2014 (UTC)

In that case, in it goes. There are hundreds of case reports, and this condition is supposed to be significantly more common in Japan, but just only 4 dedicated secondary/tertiary sources we can use (1 in Spanish).

ser:Lesion|Tepi the way you can check if a journal is MEDLINE-indexed is to look at the NLM Catalog record for it.

MEDLINE indexing is a relatively low bar and there are LOTS of psychology journals that are MEDLINE-indexed and so I'd be concerned about the quality of that source.  I'd dig deep into the author's credentials and affiliations before using.

Don't know why it isn't, ser:Lesion|Tepi, but it would certainly make me treat the source from a &quot;guilty until proven innocent&quot; frame of mind.  Are there really absolutely no other better articles available that cover treatment?  Just use your best judgment, of course.

 Draft at AfC needs medical expert help.

The content looks comprehensive (to my in-expert eye) but in terms of style, formatting, referencing and other &quot;technicalities&quot; it is a very rough draft.

Yes! a script! I was thinking along the same lines but (AIUI) even if one gets the CrossRef record for an article, there's no article classification data (i.e. whether it's a research article, a review, or whatever) in there. However, one can I suppose pull in the classification data from PubMed if it's got a PMID - is that what you do?

This sounds great, and it will save many of us hours of clicking.
However, like any tool, it will really only be great if people use it correctly.  Primary sources are allowed in medical articles, if they are carefully chosen and sparingly used.  For example, it's common for a History section to link to the first formal description of a disease, even though that paper is often both decades old and a primary source.  Some details of physiology might be better explained in and better supported by a top-quality primary paper than with a secondary source that mentions them in passing.  P:Secondary is not another way to spell good, and &quot;primary&quot; is not an alternative spelling for bad.  Once you've got the list, you'll still have to think about whether this source is appropriate for the exact claim being made in the article.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:14, 9 January 2014 (UTC)

 This script is awesome l|Zad68.  Normally for an article that size, it would take me about eight hours just to check and flag the sources to know which are reviews, which are editorials, meta-analysis, etc, and by the time I'm done with that, I'm usually too sick and tired of the article (and sitting on my butt) to take the next step of seeing if the sources are used correctly.  In this instance, based on your list, it was much easier to flag the sources, and within an hour or two, work to see how the sources were used could get underway.  As it turned out, a good number of the reviews were extremely dated, but provided useful information for the History section, and several of the primary sources used actually backed statements that could be made in History.  This script saved a couple days' work, and a whole lot of frustration; the most important benefit is that one can get to work on the content faster, rather than wasting time with three tabs open to check and flag sources.   By the way, this article was written too long ago, so that what is there now mostly is a good history section; content needs to be built to be updated.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 19:56, 10 January 2014 (UTC)

|| Response of cluster headache to psilocybin and LSD   Cited by 74
|| The authors &quot;located—through cluster headache support groups and an Internet-based survey—several hundred people with cluster headache who reported use of psilocybin-containing mushrooms or LSD specifically to treat their disorder&quot;.  They interviewed 53 patients with a structured questionnaire.  Limitations:  &quot;First, it is subject to recall bias, because it relies primarily on participants' retrospective reports.&quot;  &quot;A second consideration is the possibility of selection bias, in that individuals with a good outcome may have been more likely to participate. Recruitment over the Internet also selects for younger, more educated, and more motivated subjects, likely leading to increased reported efficacy. Third, participants were not blind to their treatment, raising the possibility of a placebo response.&quot;   Discussion: &quot;Our observations must be regarded as preliminary, in that they are unblinded, uncontrolled, and subject to additional limitations as described above. Therefore, our findings almost certainly overestimate the response of cluster headache to psilocybin and LSD and should not be misconstrued as an endorsement of the use of illegal substances for the self-treatment of cluster headache. However, given the high reported efficacy for this notoriously refractory condition, it is difficult to dismiss this series of cases as entirely artifactual. Further research is warranted.&quot;

|| Literature review.  &quot;Although controversial, the evidence for the use of recreational drugs such as marijuana, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin is worth mentioning for the insight it provides regarding the pathophysiology of migraine and cluster headache. Further research on the effects of these substances may result in a greater understanding of the mechanisms of these headache disorders.&quot;  It describes the Sewell study, summarizes the results (same as for Sewell), and says:  &quot;These results are interesting not only because they describe the effective use of illicit drugs in cluster headache, but also because no other medication has been reported to terminate a cluster period. Furthermore, the drugs were effective at subhallucinogenic doses and effective treatment required very few doses of either drug. LSD reportedly terminated cluster periods after only 1 dose, and psilocybin rarely required more than 3 doses. The study was unblinded, uncontrolled and limited by recall and selection bias. However, further research on the effects of LSD and psilocybin on cluster headaches may be warranted, given the efficacy described in this report.&quot;
||  This review is focused specifically on alternative headache treatments, while no broad overview of cluster headaches seems to mention psychedelics, and this one mentions psilocybin as &quot;controversial&quot; but useful for what the response says about pathophysiology.

I don't think that James is pleased that he will now endure similar P:BLP nightmares (vandalism, etc.) that other Wikipedians with Wikipedia articles existing about them have endured, but it is an honor to have a Wikipedian create a Wikipedia article about you because they think you are notable enough for it. ser:Flyer22|Flyer22 (ser talk:Flyer22|talk) 18:43, 9 January 2014 (UTC)

I abstain from any comment on this individual article, suggest seek wider opinion from editors outside this project re notability. In response to Flyer22's comment above, whether a person (any person) is happy to have their own Wikipedia article or not does not feature in determining the notability for such an article.
Unrelated to this specific article, I would again raise concerns that user:Jinkinson considers the main article space a suitable place to create bio articles which may or may not be notable. I would recommend detailed review of notability guidelines for biography articles, which seem to be a favorite, so that there is more confidence about whether a person is notable or not. It is also worth pointing out that AfD is chronically swamped with bio articles and they get deleted by the bucketful. ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 18:52, 9 January 2014 (UTC)

As helpful as Doc is to Wikipedia, the sourcing provided so far doesn't show the BLP rises above P:BLP1E and P:ACADEMIC is not met either.

Heh, tricky. Not many Wikipedians have their own articles (although I've just noticed this: mage:Symbol support vote.svg|20px ssjay controversy).

I'd only known James as his screen name (Doc James) and the guy that did a lot of editing on medical articles.  His &quot;note-worthiness&quot; was news to me, so here's my impression based on reading the article then Googling him.  It may seem to be splitting hairs but James is (publically) known for 1) being a prolific clinician-wikipedian, 2) using Wikipedia as a teaching tool for medical students and 3) the Rorschach controversy.  Just because each event is tied to Wikipedia, shouldn't mean that all are lumped together as one event.  It seems different, to me, than the Justin Knapp article which was created (and deleted) based on wide coverage of one event.  I don't think it will lead to an onslaught of Wikipedians looking to create their own pages as most prefer to work under pseudonyms and even fewer make an effort to be newsworthy outside of the Wikipedia community.  My argument would be that the article stands based on the number and variety of independent sources.  As an aside (as I don't think this should be used in the consideration of keeping this article but I'd be lying if I said I didn't think about it), the article is a nice thing to do for someone who's done a lot for the community and creates an encyclopedic reference for other clinicians (or student clinicians) who might be looking for real-world examples of how they can contribute.ser:Ian Furst|Ian Furst (ser talk:Ian Furst|talk) 22:50, 9 January 2014 (UTC)

 Caries 

I was going to start a rework of the aries page, only to discover that, technically, it refer to destruction of not only teeth but also bone.  I've never heard of steomyelitis or other bone destroying diseases referred to as caries, only teeth (dental caries).  Question; should I turn this into a disambiguation page?  Treat the entire thing as dental caries and put in a sentence about the fact it can refer to other bone destroying diseases?  Right now the opening paragraph deals with bone or teeth but the text below deals largely with dental caries.  Thoughts are appreciated.  Thanks. ser:Ian Furst|Ian Furst (ser talk:Ian Furst|talk) 03:21, 13 January 2014 (UTC)
I'm not convinced &quot;caries&quot; referring to pathoses of hard tissues other than the dental tissues is still in regular, modern use.

Ian: No need to create any page, it already exists. Yes I think just write over the previous content + if you feel any of the content on aries is suitable to be merged to ental caries. 
Other option is make caries into a short article which 1. links to dental caries and 2. mentions that caries may also refer to bone destruction in a historic context.

Most occurrences of the term are historic: [http://www.artandmedicine.com/biblio/authors/Toland7.html] + the sources already posted above. Here is a an altmed source which utilizes some historic literature, referring to &quot;caries of the cranium, ribs, spine, and of the bones of the limbs&quot; and claiming that tooth decay is not related to bacteria [http://www.healingteethnaturally.com/dr-herbert-shelton-real-reasons-tooth-decay.html]. So as to the exact modern equivalent of the term, I would guess some sources are referring to vascular necrosis (osteonecrosis) ... based on &quot;the term for decay or ulcerous inflammation of bone.&quot; and the neuralgia-inducing cavitational osteonecrosis source earlier, but in all honesty I think this term was mostly used in a time when distinct hard tissue pathoses were poorly distinguished from each other, so &quot;bone caries&quot; could also mean osteomeyelitis, or any destructive process, i.e. a descriptive term like &quot;ulceration&quot; and not a precise entity. The current article talks about &quot;carries sicca of the cranial vault&quot; (lit. &quot;dry decay/rot&quot;?), related to syphilis.

On a related subject, since it's been so long since I've seen anyone interested in dental health:  The lead to isease says &quot;The most common disease in the world is gum disease affecting 3 out of 4 people.&quot;  I don't really doubt the claim (much; it kind of depends on whether you mean prevalence or incidence, and that level of detail isn't appropriate for the lead of this very basic article).

 Wikidata 2014 

Just a quick update for all those that are interested in Wikidata. Reasonator, a tool developed by Magnus Manske, has become quite good at displaying the basic information about certain medical topics. The big advantage is that we can translate little bits of information and create dynamic content in every single language. See for example the page for huntingtons disease:
*English: http://tools.wmflabs.org/reasonator/?q=Q190564&amp;lang=en
*German: http://tools.wmflabs.org/reasonator/?q=Q190564&amp;lang=de
*Russian: http://tools.wmflabs.org/reasonator/?q=Q190564&amp;lang=ru
*Russian: http://tools.wmflabs.org/reasonator/?q=Q190564&amp;lang=ko
*Kiswahili: http://tools.wmflabs.org/reasonator/?q=Q190564&amp;lang=sw
The last one doesn't work well because the properties and items haven't been translated into that language yet. But hopefully we can accomplish that in the coming year for the most important medical subjects.

I think that the intent for smaller Wikis is, that they will have these pages as place-holders until somebody writes an article. In the future the intent is that the user will be prompted if the infobox should be added from wikidata and what information should be displayed. That will free up a lot of time so that people can use on writing and translating articles, instead of getting frustrated with the infobox template.Tranlating has become very efficient. Sometimes one translation adds information to hundreds of other items.

 &quot;Cite Journal&quot; template in the Wikipedia editing toolbar not working 

I posted about this just now on the Village Pump - Technical, and I wonder if you guys can help as well:

This is frustrating -- the &quot;Cite Journal&quot; template in the editing toolbar (at least the one I see) is not working properly all of a sudden (I don't know how long this has been going on, since I don't think I've used in a month or so). If one clicks &quot;Cite Journal&quot;, the &quot;Cite Book&quot; template pops up instead! It is missing all of the critical ingredients of the &quot;Cite Journal&quot; template, like PMID number, DOI number, and so forth. I tried to make some manual adjustments after I filled in the fields in the &quot;Cite Book&quot; template that in now the only one available, but it's still not working correctly. Even odder is the fact that though the edit toolbar clearly titles the template &quot;Cite Book&quot; (instead of the &quot;Cite Journal&quot; requested), when one clicks &quot;add citation&quot;, the resulting citation text reads ite journal, even though it's clearly not and doesn't have the normal journal fields.

Anyway, this is really really frustrating for those of us citing medically related articles, and so forth. BTW, I've checked this on Chrome and on IE, and it's the same glitch on both.

Can someone please restore the &quot;Cite Journal&quot; template to its former correct state, complete with the proper name, and the PMID number field, DOI number field, and so forth? Thank you. ser:Softlavender|Softlavender (ser talk:Softlavender|talk) 00:14, 15 January 2014 (UTC)

 Animal studies - a general query 

Looking at terostilbene, which has some specific problems, I was troubled by uncertainty over a general issue: to what extent can an article which is not (fully) about human health cite animal studies?
In this article which is ostensibly about a chemical, for example, are the animal studies secondary sources or (through a MEDRS lens) primary sources? And what about when, as often happens, the language and titles start shading into implications about human health? (e.g. &quot;the ability to fight off and reverse cognitive decline&quot;)?
My inclination is to remove content that make claims of medicinal potential based on animal studies, when it is only supported by in vivo or in vitro experiments. But - would that be overly-draconian? ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn ser talk:Alexbrn|talk|pecial:Contributions/Alexbrn|contribs|ser:Alexbrn#Conflict_of_interest_declaration|COI 14:10, 7 January 2014 (UTC)

Any statement that makes a claim or implication about an effect on human health needs P:MEDRS-compliant sourcing.  This article has lots of problems, especially the entire section on Cognitive decline Reversal.  The article's use of a popular press article from 1999 discussing results from rat studies as if they might be relevant to human health is wholly unacceptable.  ser:Zad68|Zadser_Talk:Zad68|68 14:35, 7 January 2014 (UTC)

What about a statement like: &quot;pterostilbene has been shown to lower blood glucose levels in rats by as much as 56 percent, while simultaneously raising insulin and hemoglobin levels to near normal levels.[10]&quot;. Is that an informative neutral statement purely about an animal experiment (which may be of interests to chemists and pharmaceutical researchers), or an undue mention of a non-notable study that can't help but imply something? ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn ser talk:Alexbrn|talk|pecial:Contributions/Alexbrn|contribs|ser:Alexbrn#Conflict_of_interest_declaration|COI 15:06, 7 January 2014 (UTC)

Doubtful, but might it be defended as encyclopedic to gather together animal experimentation results for a chemical so as to give a full account of what is known of that chemical? This is a general worry I have - so another example article is edicinal mushrooms: much of the article is gathering together medicinal &quot;properties&quot;, &quot;associations&quot; and &quot;potential applications&quot; of mushrooms. Is doing that a fair summary of research activities, or an implication-heavy mass of undue content? ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn ser talk:Alexbrn|talk|pecial:Contributions/Alexbrn|contribs|ser:Alexbrn#Conflict_of_interest_declaration|COI 15:45, 7 January 2014 (UTC)
I am not sure of what you are trying to imply. Animal research is an essential part of preclinical, toxicological and biomedical research in general. As such, if there is a relevant literature on effects of substances on animals, I expect it to be in the article. P:UNDUE is on a case-by-case basis, and is about article balance. --ser:Cyclopia|cyclopiaser talk:Cyclopia|speak! 15:49, 7 January 2014 (UTC)

I don't have access to full primary study MID|16616938 but the MeSH terms includes &quot;Rats, Wistar&quot; which is a strain of albino aboratory rats developed by the istar Institute and testing is only ever done on these kinds of rats for the intended purpose of benefitting human health.

Wait, why? So far it is clear it is about animals it makes perfect sense to include such stuff. If there is an explicit implication of the kind &quot;Compound X could treat cancer in humans, given the promising results on animals...&quot; this is P:SYNTH and as such disallowed. But so far we report the studies as they are, there is nothing bad about that. --ser:Cyclopia|cyclopiaser talk:Cyclopia|speak! 16:01, 7 January 2014 (UTC)
If it is discussed in a secondary source may be notable. If it is a primary source would be very hesitant. ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 16:18, 7 January 2014 (UTC)
On the original question:  A source that's all about animals can be a secondary source.  A source that's all about humans can be a primary source.  The subject matter doesn't determine the status.  PubMed lists five recent reviews on this subject.  The first in the list is MID|22475317, and it's a review that happens to talk about animals studies.  That's fine:  it's still a secondary source.  It's important to make sure that the material isn't misrepresented, but you can summarize what the review says about the animals studies that have been conducted.  There are some things that can't be talked about any other way, like LD50s and chemicals that haven't finished human testing.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 02:26, 8 January 2014 (UTC)

 I don't like animal studies supporting any text that might suggest an identical effect in humans without a clear disclaimer. ser:Seppi333|Seppi333 (ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert 2¢) 20:27, 15 January 2014 (UTC)

The Wikipedia Library seeks renewal (please comment)
P:The Wikipedia Library|The Wikipedia Library has grown from a collection of donations to paywalled sources into a broad open research portal for our community.  New partnerships have been formed, new pilot programs started, new connections made with our library experts and likeminded institutions.  We have tried to bring people together in a new sense of purpose and community about the importance of facilitating research in an open and collaborative way.  Here's what we've done so far:

*Increased access to sources: 1500 editors signed up for 3700 free accounts, individually worth over $500,000, with usage increases of those references between 400-600%
*Deep networking: Built relationships with Credo, HighBeam, Questia, JSTOR, Cochrane, LexisNexis, EBSCO, New York Times, and OCLC
*New pilot projects: Started the Wikipedia Visiting Scholar project to empower university-affiliated Wikipedia researchers
*Developed community:  Created portal connecting 250 newsletter recipients, 30 library members, 3 volunteer coordinators, and 2 part-time contractors
*Tech scoped: Spec'd out a reference tool for linking to full-text sources and established a basis for OAuth integration
*Broad outreach: Wrote a feature article for Library Journal's The Digital Shift; presenting at the American Library Association annual meeting

We've proposed a 6 month eta:Grants:IEG/The_Wikipedia_Library/Extensionrequest|renewal request to continue and deepen this work and would appreciate eta:Grants:IEG/The_Wikipedia_Library/Extensionrequest#Community_comments|your comments, concerns, thoughts, questions, or endorsements.

 3RR over primary source being added to erpes simplex, erpes labialis, erpes genitalis 

A (?well meaning) editor is repeatedly adding a primary source to the above articles ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Herpes_labialis&amp;curid=21754540&amp;action=history], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Herpes_simplex&amp;action=history], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Herpes_genitalis&amp;diff=590356322&amp;oldid=583761439]). Tried to explain on user talkpage, obviously failed. I think I have made 3 reverts already. Comments appreciated. ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 14:35, 12 January 2014 (UTC)
 I did not see a 3RR warning on the user's talk, which is a prerequisite for admin action-- added that, but now off for a few hours.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 14:44, 12 January 2014 (UTC)
Ty for that. Don't think admin action needed, just better understanding of MEDRS. User has emailed me twice saying the source is fine with reasoning that there are already primary sources on the articles and that primary sources are clearly allowed if no 2o available. Replied to emails on user talkpage. ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 14:50, 12 January 2014 (UTC)
 P:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS.  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 14:53, 12 January 2014 (UTC)
Speaking of those articles, I have encountered two editors adding bad or otherwise poor sources to the erpes genitalis article; for example, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Herpes_genitalis&amp;curid=5069414&amp;diff=590369896&amp;oldid=590356322 here] with ser talk:Willpolydna|Willpolydna, and I see that Willpolydna is the editor that Lesion has been encountering at the herpes articles. As for the other editor I've encountered, I didn't revert ser talk:Ohnohedinnit|Ohnohedinnit again because I didn't feel like getting into a P:Edit war with a newbie (that type of edit war is almost always the most frustrating because the newbie will almost always continue reverting) and it appeared that ser:Jmh649|Jmh649 (Doc James) was watching that article. When I saw that Doc James didn't revert Ohnohedinnit, I left it alone. Ohnohedinnit also has a P:BLP issue, as seen [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ohnohedinnit&amp;diff=580644326&amp;oldid=580577985 here] on his talk page. We are not supposed to state that someone &quot;has become bisexual while in prison&quot; unless that person identifies as bisexual. And people don't just become bisexual, no more than they suddenly become heterosexual, gay or lesbian...unless speaking of those matters in exual identity or behavioral (as distinct from exual orientation) terms only. By that, I mean that the person's sexual orientation is already developed; whether they finally express it (physically or otherwise) or take up behavior that contradicts it does not change that.   

By the way, above I linked Willpolydna and Ohnohedinnit's talk pages for their usernames because they don't yet have user pages. ser:Flyer22|Flyer22 (ser talk:Flyer22|talk) 15:42, 12 January 2014 (UTC)

Thanks for the notice |Flyer22.  I do not want to get P:INVOLVED in the content but someone should review [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Herpes_genitalis&amp;action=history this] article history at erpes genitalis. ser:Zad68|Zadser_Talk:Zad68|68 02:41, 14 January 2014 (UTC)
Done, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Herpes_genitalis&amp;diff=590838174&amp;oldid=590369896 here] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Herpes_genitalis&amp;diff=590839674&amp;oldid=590838174 here] so far. That article still needs some sourcing cleanup, though; for example, it used [http://www.genitalherpessymptoms.org/genital-herpes-treatment.html this source], which [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Herpes_genitalis&amp;diff=590840711&amp;oldid=590839674 I removed.] ser:Flyer22|Flyer22 (ser talk:Flyer22|talk) 17:10, 15 January 2014 (UTC) 

Also note: The bisexual matter has [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Flyer22&amp;curid=11122823&amp;diff=590997214&amp;oldid=590995881#Your_recent_edits:_Herpes_genitalis_and_Timothy_L._Tyler_articles been taken care of]; turns out that one of the sources supports Ohnohedinnit's wording on that matter. ser:Flyer22|Flyer22 (ser talk:Flyer22|talk) 18:10, 16 January 2014 (UTC)  

Have taken a look and agree with Lesion. Have reverted and posted further instructions on the users page. ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 16:05, 12 January 2014 (UTC)

Willpolydna has clearly been edit-warring at the listed articles, and has received proper notices about sourcing requirements and our rules against edit-warring.  Looking at the state of the articles, this looks stale at the moment, but if the editor starts back up again ping me and I will block.  ser:Zad68|Zadser_Talk:Zad68|68 02:38, 14 January 2014 (UTC)

 Cadet article: lood pressure drop across major arteries to capillaries 

Hello, there is a cadet article at lood pressure drop across major arteries to capillaries, that seems to cover a fair bit of information that would be useful for the general article lood pressure. However, I think it both needs someone who understands body systems, to fairly merge the articles. I put a suggested merge tag on the page, but neither appears to be actively monitored, ser:Sadads|Sadads (ser talk:Sadads|talk) 16:43, 17 January 2014 (UTC)
