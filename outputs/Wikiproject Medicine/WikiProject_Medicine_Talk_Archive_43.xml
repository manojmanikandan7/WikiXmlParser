		<segment id="id41533689">Is Acupuncture a form of pseudoscience?

Looking at the earlier discussions above, the field of acupuncture is obviously a very controversial topic, not just within the scientific community, but here on Wikipedia as well. 

The way forward, I believe, is to come to a consensus about whether it is indeed pseudoscience - if it is, then the article at acupuncture should say so. I personally believe that it is not pseudoscience, because

1) [http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/31107/title/Puncturing-the-Myth/ A plausible theory for its mechanism was proposed in 2009] 

2) [http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/35387/title/The-Science-of-Acupuncture/ Further studies have now proven that this theory is indeed true]

3) Mainstream medical journals have reviewed and  [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3192271/ accepted this theory]

4) Mainstream medical textbooks have [http://books.google.de/books?id=ev0rfZf1x6UC&amp;pg=PA352&amp;lpg=PA352&amp;dq=%22adenosine+and+nonpharmacological%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UBTCQY8KxJ&amp;sig=aLtr6UehcJAwjl1bRC6GsV98RWY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3TSbUtiwEaOG4AS_6oDICw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22adenosine%20and%20nonpharmacological%22&amp;f=false accepted this theory]

5) The latest review by the National Cancer Institute [http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/acupuncture/patient says] that 



Strangely, readers are not going to find any of this on Wikipedia, neither at the article acupuncture or elsewhere. In fact, acupuncture is still included in the List of topics characterized as pseudoscience based on a misrepresentation of a 1997 NIH consensus statement. 

I have been accused countless times of promoting acupuncture, but I can disclose that I am not trained in acupuncture and have  never tried it out myself, but I am a firm believer in accepting hard evidence and keeping an open mind. 

If acupuncture is a form of pseudoscience as claimed by the list of topics characterized as pseudoscience, can someone please show me a reliable source that explicitly says so based on widely accpeted scientific consensus? That way, it would be easier for me to keep a neutral perspective. -A1candidate (talk) 13:20, 1 December 2013 (UTC)
Yes. Alexbrn talk||COI 13:24, 1 December 2013 (UTC)
Not sure how constructive that is supposed to be -A1candidate (talk) 13:33, 1 December 2013 (UTC)
As constructive as the question. What's the point of trying to form a local consensus on this question? If the view WP contains (as stated in, e.g. the article you mention, List of topics characterized as pseudoscience) is not reliably sourced then get it overturned there. If reliable sources characterize it as pseudoscience, WP follows, and trying to originate our own conclusion based on what the NCI  - or anybody else - says is not a gainful activity. Alexbrn talk||COI 13:39, 1 December 2013 (UTC)
Getting a consensus will result in much less edit-wars. This issue is related to multiple articles, not just the one you pointed out. -A1candidate (talk) 13:43, 1 December 2013 (UTC)

Note to editors - If you're here because Alexbrn told you to [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Fringe_theories/Noticeboard&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=584050330 consolidate responses] to my inquiry, you're of course welcome to do so, but I hope you'll give me a fair response supported by hard evidence. -A1candidate (talk) 13:42, 1 December 2013 (UTC)
It is definitely viewed as alternative medicine. Since placebo needling works as well as acupuncture needling (were you put the needle doesn't seem to make a deference) the mechanism behind acupuncture would be viewed as pseudoscience by some. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 14:16, 1 December 2013 (UTC)

I notice that the National Cancer Institute website says that &quot;The study found that patients in both the true and sham acupuncture groups developed less nausea and vomiting than those in the standard care group.&quot; [http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/acupuncture/patient/Page2#Section_57] Which would seem to imply that, if acupuncture is a legitimate treatment, sham acupuncture is also. I would have thought sham acupuncture would be regarded as a perfect example of pseudo-science, even by acupuncturists. Perhaps not. --Rbreen (talk) 15:15, 1 December 2013 (UTC)
Curiously, sham acupuncture is probably less pseudoscientific since unlike &quot;real&quot; acupuncture is lacks the back-story of Qi energy, and instead is marshaled as an element in pursuit of evidence-based medical study (a scientific pursuit). Alexbrn talk||COI 15:33, 1 December 2013 (UTC)
These studies indicate that there is no documented benefit to acupuncture beyond that of the placebo effect. To claim that there is would be a pseudoscientific claim, certainly. jps (talk) 15:19, 1 December 2013 (UTC)

Acupuncture is an alternative medicine practice. The explanations offered by believers in its efficacy for its functionality beyond the placebo effect are, at this time, pseudoscientific. These include some of the statements made by government regulators and NGO advisories. Experts in quackery such as Edzard Ernst, David Gorski, Stephen Barrett, and Simon Singh have written extensively on the matter and basically have come to the consensus decision that there are no non-pseudoscientific mechanisms that acupuncturists promote. jps (talk) 15:19, 1 December 2013 (UTC)
Of course it is.  --Roxy the dog (resonate) 15:26, 1 December 2013 (UTC)

I am not endorsing Quackwatch, but I am mentioning that it has [http://www.quackwatch.org/search/webglimpse.cgi?ID=1&amp;query=acupuncture information about acupuncture].
—Wavelength (talk) 15:46, 1 December 2013 (UTC)

I'd also like to point out that points 1 to 4 in the opening post of this discussion are just science admitting that when quacks stick sharp needles into human flesh, it hurts  --Roxy the dog (resonate) 15:51, 1 December 2013 (UTC)
I think we should endorse quackwatch, personally. It's a much more reliable source than many other sources I see being used at acupuncture currently including some apparently &quot;peer reviewed&quot; journal articles that are prime indicators of the problems that can happen when peer review fails. jps (talk) 16:06, 1 December 2013 (UTC)
QW is a fine source for altmed topics, and has been endorsed on numerous occasions by . Sometimes, QW is the only RS on a fringe topic. Alexbrn talk||COI 16:18, 1 December 2013 (UTC)

How can a non-expert (seeking expertise without bias) be certain that Quackwatch is not at least partly influenced by mainstream professionals whose desire to protect their business turf closes their minds to alternative practices which might have some validity?
—Wavelength (talk) 17:27, 1 December 2013 (UTC)
Perhaps you can answer the question by considering the answer to this one: How can we be certain that when a scientist predicts the Sun will rise tomorrow, that scientist is not at least partly influenced by mainstream professionals who desire to protect their academic reputations and close their mind to the alternative proposal that the Earth is going to stop rotating this evening? jps (talk) 19:22, 1 December 2013 (UTC)

@Doc James - It depends on how you define &quot;alternative medicine&quot;. For millions of people across East Asia and parts of Southeast Asia who cannot afford Western medical treatment, acupuncture/TCM is the only form of treatment available to them. Your second point is a compelling one, except that simply putting a needle anywhere in the skin [http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=414193 is not a valid placebo], and there are [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304394008016029 different biological responses] between a sham acupuncture and a verum (true) acupuncture.  

@Rbreen - There is no question that sham acupuncture is a legitimate treatment option. The National Cancer Institute website states that both forms of acupuncture are superior to standard care. The issue at hand is whether true acupuncture is superior to sham acupuncture or not. Some recent reviews [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1533-2500.2009.00337.x/abstract do suggest that this may be the case]. 

@jps - Could you show me the specific mechanism of an acupuncture-induced placebo effect? 

@Roxy the dog - No, there is a demonstrable pain relief [http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v13/n7/fig_tab/nn0710-783_F1.html which can be felt after 30 minutes]

-A1candidate (talk) 17:30, 1 December 2013 (UTC)

I linked to placebo effect above. Feel free to read that article and the references it contains. jps (talk) 19:22, 1 December 2013 (UTC)
Arbitrary section break
 is based on an &quot;Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience&quot;, and that work gives one of its longer articles to the topic of acupuncture. On that basis, I would have to say that there is sufficient basis from the standpoint of that part of the academic world which deals with matters of pseudoscience to say that they consider acupuncture to fall broadly in the range of pseudoscience. John Carter (talk) 18:19, 1 December 2013 (UTC)
I'm feeling like part of the problem is that we aren't working with the same meaning.  
&quot;Pseudoscience&quot; (and &quot;alternative&quot;, for that matter) does not mean &quot;something that doesn't work&quot;.  It means &quot;something that has a fake scientific explanation&quot;.  So if I tell my nephew that light bulbs give off light because tiny men light tiny candles inside them, I'm telling a fairy tale.  If I tell him that light bulbs give off light because there are phosphorescent bacteria on the surface of the bulb and flipping the light switch causes them to change state, then I'm engaging in pseudoscience.  No matter what explanation I give him, the light bulb still works, right? 
Acupuncture can be both &quot;pseudoscience&quot; and effective (for some purposes).  WhatamIdoing (talk) 21:38, 1 December 2013 (UTC)
Yes, but acupuncture has the added wrinkle that there is no good evidence that is effective beyond a placebo either. Normally, this would be the end of the story. Quackery happens because the acupuncturists continue to claim that it is effective with pseudoscientific excuses. jps (talk) 22:25, 1 December 2013 (UTC)

The World Health Organization has published [http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js4926e/ Acupuncture: Review and Analysis of Reports on Controlled Clinical Trials].
—Wavelength (talk) 23:22, 1 December 2013 (UTC)
That's nice. Please indicate whether the document in question directly addresses the matter of whether or not acupuncture can be reasonably described as pseudoscience or not, and specifically where such a statement might be made. I also once again note that there have been several forms of pseudoscientific medicine which have been demonstrated to produce some positive results, even if the principles upon which they are based are pseudoscientific, so I believe it is reasonable to request such statements directly relating to the matter of whether the principles upon which acupuncture is based, whatever they might be, are considered scientific or pseudoscientific, which is really the only kind of sourcing which is directly relevant to this discussion. John Carter (talk) 23:57, 1 December 2013 (UTC)
It appears to me, at this moment, that I am unable to find the information which you request.
—Wavelength (talk) 00:55, 2 December 2013 (UTC)
It would seem that there is an important distinction that doesn't seem to have been explicitly stated. Just sticking needles into people any old way is, most 
likely, not considered acupuncture by the vast majority of people. Certainly, I imagine that most practitioners would not hold this view, otherwise their &quot;degrees&quot; and training, and indeed any qualification that they possess (except perhaps basic nursing), is worthless. I also imagine that most patients do not hold this view either. Therefore, it seems important to keep in mind that acupuncture is in fact sticking needles in specific places in response to specific patient complaints (i.e. patients stomach hurts, so put a needle in this place because the qi is wrong (or something)), and must include the whole belief system that goes along with that. From this point of view, acupuncture is clearly pseudoscience (the explanation for it is mystic gibberish), especially since it doesnt appear to matter where you stick the needles. The debate on whether just sticking needles into people helps is a different matter. It does bring up an interesting hypothetical though: supposing acupuncture did work, but practitioners still used the current mythical belief system. Would it still count as pseudoscience? I would say probably. Benboy00 (talk) 16:05, 2 December 2013 (UTC)
I would say &quot;definitely&quot;.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 00:16, 4 December 2013 (UTC)

@jps - Unfortunately, the article on placebo effect makes no mention whatsoever of acupuncture. I would like to see hard evidence of an acupuncture-induced placebo effect instead of mere speculation, even if this may be plausible.

@John Carter - The source cited by  is a book called the Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience that is published in the year 2000, which is more than a decade ago. Could you show me a reliable, independent source that has been published more recently to back up such claims? I believe there is indeed a great deal of scientific studies performed in this field since 2000 (see below).

@WhatamIdoing - That is a very good point you've made. A core concept of acupuncture, according to Traditional Chinese Medicine, is the principle of Qi. In acupuncture, this can by observed by deqi (&quot;flow of Qi&quot;), which has a specific biological effect on people receiving acupuncture as proven by many different studies published in numerous mainstream scientific journals, as you can see for yourself [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006899309026535 here], [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmri.22006/full here], [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811909003309 here], [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156607021000069X here], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3192271/ here], [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006899310020457 here], and [http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10548-010-0148-8 many more]. Granted, there is still a lot of research to do and not all of these studies are conclusive, but so far, I have yet to see any evidence to the contrary.

@Benboy00 - [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0730725X09002902 It does matter where you stick the needles]. Most of these neuroimaging studies are very new, but they [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22197696 do exist] and have been reviewed in [http://books.google.de/books?id=kYxqAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=neurobiology+acupuncture&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gSSdUq7BENKg7AaWoYCgCQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=neurobiology%20acupuncture&amp;f=false medical literature].

Forgive me, but that just comes across as a kind of . We are in the business of describing the contemporary understanding of topics here. Pretending that most thoughtful people who aren't caught up in the program don't look askance at the claims of acupuncturists as to how acupuncture works is an argument essentially not worth entertaining. The fact that acupuncture's claimed qi mechanisms are pseudoscientific claptrap is not debatable. The &quot;hard evidence&quot; that these claims are nonsense is no more available for this fact than it is for the fact that Santa Claus doesn't exist. Pseudoscience is defined by the features which an idea lacks. jps (talk) 18:17, 5 December 2013 (UTC)
@jps - The general populace may or may not look askance at acupunctural treatment, but when it comes to medical articles,  clearly states that we should summarize scientific consensus only. You cannot ignore the existence of hard evidence just by brushing it off as &quot;non-debatable&quot; or &quot;nonsensical&quot; - that's not how Evidence-based medicine works. You do not have to prove the existence of Santa Claus. Nobody is asking you to do so. -A1candidate (talk) 15:34, 8 December 2013 (UTC)

Concerns of LT910001
This boat may already have set sail, but I finally took a look at the Acupuncture article, where some very strange things are going on. I refer here to just two:
* &quot;A report for CSICOP on pseudoscience in China written by Wallace Sampson and Barry Beyerstein said:... A few Chinese scientists we met ...&quot; (?!!)
* &quot;A 2012 meta-analysis found significant differences between true and sham acupuncture, which indicates that acupuncture is more than a placebo when treating chronic pain (even though the differences were modest). [99] Commenting on this meta-analysis, professor Edzard Ernst stated&quot; 
Amongst others, recorded here (). A lot of weight () is given to quotes from certain individuals (), which I find strange given the high-quality sources available on both sides of the aisle for this article. At any rate I feel I ought to flag this here, while we are discussing MEDRS in Acupuncture. --LT910001 (talk) 12:50, 17 December 2013 (UTC)
As far as I can see the problem is that a couple of editors at the acupuncture article (who call themselves skeptics) are straying from the path of objectiveness and science... We have a couple of reliable meta-reviews in the article concluding that acupuncture is effective for certain pain conditions. But some editors just refuse to accept that, because it doesn't fit their world view... and are now waging a sort of guerrilla war - which includes adding quotes like the ones above. Or this one: &quot;Quackwatch stated that, the TCM theories are so nebulous that no amount of scientific study will enable TCM to offer rational care&quot;. The rationale I hear in these cases is always the same: to counter a perceived pro-acupuncture POV. Which is just not there. The acupuncture article is one of the best sourced articles I know. Just take a look at the reflist. --Mallexikon (talk) 08:52, 18 December 2013 (UTC)
Skeptic editors are extremely vigilant in enforcing MEDRS, deleting individual randomized controlled trials wherever they see them. But then they add Ernst's comments from The Guardian. These comments fail MEDRS because they are &quot;non-evidence-based expert opinion,&quot; which MEDRS places at the bottom of the hierarchy of sources. Plus, MEDRS clearly states that popular media shouldn't be used as a source. TimidGuy (talk) 12:07, 18 December 2013 (UTC)
 It's simply not true that &quot;expert opinions&quot; (of whatever shade) fail MEDRS.  asks us to assess them as lower-quality sources, but specifically does not exclude them from consideration. The order suggested must also be treated with some degree of understanding: in the field of diving medicine, for example, an opinion by Peter B.  Bennett or Simon Mitchell is likely to be given far more credence in the mainstream view than an individual RCT. Our guidelines are extremely useful, and valid for the vast majority of cases, but we should not make the mistake of treating them as utterly infallible. --RexxS (talk) 15:41, 18 December 2013 (UTC)
As far as I understood  they are concerned about , not about expert opinions failing MEDRS. --Mallexikon (talk) 06:23, 19 December 2013 (UTC)

I'm concerned for several reasons. 
* Firstly, I don't believe Quackwatch constitutes an expert medical opinion, of which there are numerous other national and international medical bodies which can provide equivalent and medically-based expert opinion. This includes the WHO and numerous national-level medical bodies. Additionally  whole paragraphs are given to the perspective, however well-informed, of individuals - for example, one entire paragraphs are given to reporting the opinion of a Felix Mann. For a world-wide practice thousands of years old with numerous reviews and meta-analyses, and consensus statements to boot, this is not balanced.
* Secondly, I'm concerned, as documented, by the numerous use of individuals as sources. Not only do these give undue weight but I'm concerned that it significantly biases the article. Not only that, but there is implicit cultural sensitivities here. For example, the quote above &quot;A report for CSICOP on pseudoscience in China written by Wallace Sampson and Barry Beyerstein said:... A few Chinese scientists we met ...&quot; is equivalent in my mind at least equivalent to inserting in the Malaria article &quot;However, a report by MalariaWatch, written by X and Y, said... A few African scientists we met...&quot;, and this occurs twice. I cannot stress how profoundly this quote fails ,  and . And, while we are on the subject, if quotes of this ilk are included, why are no quotes of Chinese origin included? This appears to be a practice 3,000 years old and yet there is not a single quote from either a historical source or Chinese body to represent this?
* Thirdly, I do not see any other medical article where facts are reported, in the name of BALANCE, like this: &quot;A 2013 metaanalysis found X. However, a professor in a university disagreed.&quot; To stress this, let's consider &quot;A 2013 metaanalysis reported the efficacy of the combined oral birth control pill as Y. However, in an opinion piece, professor X from Y university disagreed.&quot; This is an example of , which explicitly states &quot; If one reliable source says A, and another reliable source says B, do not join A and B together to imply a conclusion C&quot;. Shall we state the position of every professor with an opinion on this matter? 

If we are to take MEDRS at all seriously, this article needs to have these replaced with secondary sources that are of higher reliability than the expert medical or non-medical opinion of individuals.  does not trump WP:MEDRS. There is a whole list of reviews and metaanalyses detailing where acupuncture does and does not have an evidence base for efficacy that are documented within this article, and I strongly feel that these constitute a strong enough evidence without the addition of arbitrarily-selected expert opinions and quotes to justify this. I hope this clarifies my concerns. --LT910001 (talk) 12:52, 19 December 2013 (UTC)

Who cares, aka, WP:MED has lost its way
From our acupuncture article:A 2013 systematic review of English-language case reports found that serious adverse events associated with acupuncture are rare, but acupuncture is not without risk. Between 2000 and 2011, the incidence of English-language reported adverse events was 294 cases from 25 countries and regions. The most common adverse effect observed was infection, and the majority of infections were bacterial in nature, caused by skin contact at the needling site. Other adverse complications include bilateral hand edema, epithelioid granuloma, pseudolymphoma, argyria, pustules, pancytopenia, and scarring due to hot needle technique. So, benefits attributed to acupuncture may be due to the placebo effect, and a small number of people using acupuncture may get skin infections.  WOW !!! That's dangerous stuff. Let's get all of WP:MED to weigh in on this serious issue, lest someone in China get a positive placebo effect result and a skin infection to boot.   On the other hand, no one from WP:MED can be bothered to help out at the POV, poorly sourced mess in the suite of articles at , also discussed on this page, where secondary reviews indicate real potential for physical, mental, behavioral and social harm among a huge number of persons, considering the prevalence of cannabis use.   What's wrong in here?  This is why we need a medical disclaimer on our medical content.  We can't even get medical editors to help out or keep up with our really dangerous articles; the battleground du jour seems to be acupuncture.  Disclaimer:  I have a bias.  I respect MEDRS when editing, and I voted to delete German Acupuncture Trials because they are a coatrack and content could be included in acupuncture, but I don't really care if the benefits from acupuncture are real or due to the placebo effect.  When my 12-yo-son lost a year of his academic life due to two-week-long status migraines, only the relief from acupuncture helped him regain some of his life when nothing else helped.  I don't care if it was placebo or not; I saw the pain go out of his face and body when the needles went in from a good practitioner, and I saw nothing happen when that man was on vacation and a poor practitioner used different needle placement, and I saw good acupuncture help him when even when morphine didn't help.  So, I don't see the problems with our acupuncture content as much of a big deal, and wonder why can't we all go fix our really bad articles.  If folks can't be bothered to help out at medical cannabis, long-term effects of cannabis, effects of cannabis, cannabis in pregnancy etc, which were massively POV and medically incorrect until just two of us started working on them two days ago, expect me to continue pushing for a medical disclaimer.  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 18:01, 2 December 2013 (UTC)
Here as elsewhere, there just aren't enough editors who can handle tricky specialized stuff, and they don't have enough time that they are willing to spend volunteering. But I agree re the disclaimer. Johnbod (talk) 18:13, 2 December 2013 (UTC)
As an editor who edits predominantly on  topics, acupuncture is exactly the kind of article where I spend most of my time fretting about details. However, Sandy is absolutely right: in comparison to this type of nicety, the problem in the &quot;cannabis suite&quot; is real &amp; serious. The Cannabis (drug) article has over 1,000 watchers, over 6,000 distinct authors and ~7,500 daily page views. These article were crammed (and I mean crammed) with bogus health information, ranging from assertions that cannabis use was totally harmless to a statement that it was an established treatment for brain cancer (seriously). The voluminous Talk page archives show that a lot of effort and consensus-building went into getting them as they were. I think this raises some questions for us: how could comparatively mainstream articles like this have got into such an abysmal state with nobody even noticing? Alexbrn talk||COI 18:29, 2 December 2013 (UTC)
Yes many of the articles on Wikipedia dealing with sex and drugs are a disaster. And you are correct that I more or less ignore them (other than having removed many of the sex related articles from WP:MED).

I am happy to weight in if specific issues are encountered over disagreements regarding how to apply WP:MEDRS. Or how to interpret a reference.
We however have many articles on key health care topics that are more or less completely unloved. They are relatively easy to improve as so few people work on them. The ones I refer to of course are this list [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Medicine/Translation_task_force/Popular_pages] and I am slowly bringing them to GA. I assume many people who are looking up &quot;cannabis&quot; have already made their mind up regarding the topic and any content we contain will have no effect on their decisions. 
I would strongly support efforts to more clearly mark if an reference is a review or primary source. I know  has build a tool to help with this. If we had a bot to add it as a ref parameter in individual articles that people from this project are working to improve it may help with this effort. Zad how easy would it be to adapt your tool to do this? If it was added to this would also be helpful [https://toolserver.org/~dispenser/cgi-bin/webchecklinks.py?page=Chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_di] Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 19:39, 2 December 2013 (UTC)

* Re: rant, I think there are a few essays on this general theme (e.g. /). It generally depends on your outlook on life. You could, arguably quite legitimately, say &quot;most of our content is not great&quot;. You could say &quot;things are better than they were in 2005, maybe they will slowly keep getting better&quot;. I generally align with the second view, but I feel Wikipedia is plagued by  and bureaucracy that just puts most people immediately off due to the unpleasant atmosphere. We are our own worst enemy. We complain of not having enough volunteers, and yet on the other hand we essentially discourage new editorship. Lesion (talk) 21:32, 2 December 2013 (UTC)

This isn't really a question for this noticeboard. It's not speculation that QW have expressed this view (which is what the text says). The questions here are about weight/neutrality - in other words, is QW's view worthy of inclusion? Alexbrn talk||COI 12:59, 12 December 2013 (UTC)
On the other hand we are out there with Cochrane reviews, does really Quackwatch place as high in credibility as Cochrane? To me it seems a fringe view that isn't either backed up by science properly. The theories may be faulty, but that's a damn hell of a statement when several ancient Chinese medicines have been shown to have effect. CFCF (talk) 15:57, 13 December 2013 (UTC)
When we can get excellent scholarly sources on a subject, then I don't see any reason to cite QuackWatch.  If we were talking about some individual commercial product (&quot;WhatamIdoing's All-Natural Cure-All&quot;) for which few sources existed, then it might be okay sometimes, just like citing a magazine article might be okay sometimes.  But I would not use it at the article about TCM.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:57, 13 December 2013 (UTC)

To me, any phrase that reads &quot;no amount of X will ever Y&quot; is a crystal ball phrase. Such a statement is largely unsupportable, as it makes a definite future prediction, and nobody can make future predictions with such certainty. Remember, the line is not an assumption (&quot;it is unlikely that...&quot;) but a definite statement. It would be akin to George W. Bush saying in 2002 that &quot;nothing can ever disprove Iraq's posession of WMDs&quot;, or clergymen in the 19th Century stating that &quot;no amount of foolish blasphemy will ever prove the theory of evolution, and disprove His almighty creation of all that is around us&quot;. We might not have enough randomised controlled trials and clinically useful studies done on TCM now, but that doesn't mean that in 10 or 20 years time there will never be; it makes zero sense to state that something will never happen in future, if the people of the present have no control over the future. It's logically absurd. I can only interpret those words by QuackWatch as an unbalanced POV statement, since it relies on literary hyperbole to bring its message across, instead of a logically valid statement. --benlisquareT•• 00:55, 14 December 2013 (UTC)

Actually the statement is about as precise as the nebulous nature of TCM, which is a hodgepodge of ideas, some of which are religious, traditional, prescientific, and/or outright pseudoscientific. Now if Barrett were speaking about a specific aspect like acupuncture, I would be able to follow your reasoning, but we're talking about TCM, which is an umbrella term, and that umbrella has lots of holes in it. That statement points out that with so many holes, it will never be able to keep anyone completely dry. Now if that statement were to be used about a specific segment of the umbrella which had no holes, or only a few, it would be wrong to use it, but that's not the case here, so it's actually very apt. -- Brangifer (talk) 01:11, 14 December 2013 (UTC)

answers this question: No

I agree that this is an interesting and nuanced topic area, a mixed bag evidence-wise, and (for those reasons) a lame windmill for would-be debunkers to tilt at.  But the question &quot;is it a pseudoscience&quot; is already addressed by policy.

We had an  that produced guidelines on when to characterize topics as pseudoscience.  See .  Acupuncture:
*has a following, and also
*has critics who say it's a pseudoscience, but
*is not generally considered pseudoscience in the scientific community, 
which means we can't characterize it as pseudoscience (unambiguously, e.g., by putting it in ).  But we can (and do) include in the article good critical RS's that say it's pseudoscientific.  We can also put it on a list, e.g. List of topics characterized as pseudoscience, because its inclusion can be annotated and thereby qualified. 

How do we know if a position is held by the scientific community at large?  Simple, we need an adequate source that is clear on the point, per .  Examples include statements by scientific academies.  There is no such source for acupuncture (as opposed to e.g. homeopathy).  

The idea of a literal qi running through the body is just as pseudoscientific as any vitalistic notion, but there is active mainstream research -- with mixed results -- into acupuncture as a treatment.  [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21359919 Cochrane reviews], among the most highly regarded in medicine, find evidence of acu being effective for certain conditions, but the effects are small and the design of proper controls non-trivial, so the debate goes on over whether or not it's really just a placebo.

MEDRS query
Isabelle Rapin is a recognized autism expert, and one whose secondary reviews we cite in numerous neuropsych articles.  At ,  invokes  to say that a quote from Rapin in the Wall Street Journal book review of The Essential Difference by Simon Baron-Cohen &quot;is not usually the kind of MEDRS-type source that we prefer&quot;.[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Simon_Baron-Cohen&amp;oldid=588243988#Additional]   Rapin is a recognized expert on autism: to the best of my knowledge, none of Baron-Cohen's theories on autism have gained acceptance.  Why is Rapin not a reliable source to review a book by Baron-Cohen, about his autism theories? These are autism experts commenting on book reviews of pop psychology theories of autism.  If Rapin is not an RS on the topic of autism, why do we cite her secondary reviews all over Wikipedia? (As a side note, I just wrote Rapin's article in an hour and a half, while in six years, I haven't been able to get the POV and uncited text cleaned up at Baron-Cohen.) SandyGeorgia (Talk) 00:39, 30 December 2013 (UTC)

SandyGeorgia is proposing that [http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10583036864206600 a newspaper article, written by a staff reporter] (not a &quot;recognized autism expert&quot;) at The Wall Street Journal, be used as a source to say whether this scientific idea is good or bad.  The newspaper article, at one point, quotes a somewhat negative viewpoint from a recognized expert.  It also quotes the originator of this idea, and it comes to no actual conclusion about whether the idea is any good.
The question I asked is, &quot;Is there really no scholarly criticism of his ideas?&quot;  MEDRS isn't really supportive of Science by press release, even when it includes a quotation from an expert, and it directly states that &quot;The popular press is generally not a reliable source for scientific and medical information&quot;.  But perhaps a somewhat more direct question would be helpful:  :Why should we cite a newspaper article on whether this scientific idea is any good, when peer-reviewed, scholarly review articles about this idea (like ) exist?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 01:30, 30 December 2013 (UTC)
 We are talking about a book review; did a medical reliable source summarize the book in the article?  (No. Statements about what the book claims are not sourced to MEDRS sources-- they are sourced to the book.)  So we allow an author's article to make statements about what his book proposes as a theory (not accepted by mainstream medical consensus) but we would disallow reliable expert's commentaries in a book review?  Just because the book reviews are published well, where book reviews are usually published?  Pushing MEDRS to these limits will give MEDRS a bad name.  It looks like disallowing an acknowledged expert book review just because she is quoted in the laypress-- which is where books are usually reviewed.  Since you hadn't reviewed the history of the article, I wonder if you really even considered the expertise brought to bear in the review.  Further, where do you intend to draw this line?  We can't quote Rapin, an autism expert, from the Wall Street Journal, but the article can cite Time magazine and Nature and any other manner of laypress in support of the book?  In a bio, where COI editing is evident, anything printed by magazines has been allowed, but critical review by an expert is disallowed, in a book review, in the name of MEDRS?  Recipe for POV, which is what the article is now.  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 01:45, 30 December 2013 (UTC)
I don't actually see anything in the WSJ article that indicates that it is a book review.  The [http://articles.latimes.com/2004/jan/18/books/bk-wertheim18 Los Angeles Times piece] is a book review, but the WSJ piece appears to be a plain old article, in the &quot;Health&quot; section and about the subject matter, not about the book.  The fact that his theory was described in a book gets less than half a sentence out of the entire article (&quot;his theory, outlined in a recent book, The Essential Difference...&quot;).  The WSJ has [http://online.wsj.com/public/page/news-books-best-sellers.html a dedicated section for book reviews], but as far as I can tell, this particular article wasn't in it.

Expert opinion is one of the categories of content that can be considered as set out at .

Alexbrn talk||COI 06:21, 30 December 2013 (UTC)

 Agreed.  At any rate, better understanding of WAID's novel position wrt MEDRS is needed, as article progess is at a standstill pending resolution of her opposition to secondary laypress sources in a BLP, to express what SBC's views are.  The article makes extensive use of sources like Time magazine, NY Times, The Guardian, Scientific American, Nature and others, as secondary sources documenting the views of Simon Baron-Cohen.  (Yes, there are few other secondary reviews of his work beause as far as I know none of his theories have gained traction, but he does attract media attention.)  Since WAID is rejecting lay sources for writing about his views, including those expressed in his books, shall we delete all lay sources from his article?  That would leave his book opinions unopposed and unbalanced.    Without pedantry, we need to understand if:
* WAID rejects Isabelle Rapin (and other medical experts quoted in the laypress) as an authoritative reliable source on the topic, only because she was quoted in the laypress, or
* because the report in the laypress has no author in the byline,
* or because she rejects anything for this kind of BLP written in the laypress.
 Until this is resolved, it's hard to proceed with article work. Shall we remove all mention of SBC's theories, for example, as documented in Time magazine?  And if WAID is rejecting all laypress book reviews on medical topics, we've got big problems in scores of articles, because most book reviews happen in the laypress.  (I won't engage the pedantry that this particular WSJ article is not a book review, since SBC's views are clearly put forward in those books.)   Considering this pedantic black-and-white view of how to use laypress sources in a BLP, I'm not sure how much of an article SBC will have left if we follow WAID's interpretation of MEDRS. 
 SandyGeorgia (Talk) 17:32, 30 December 2013 (UTC)
* I don't reject any person, expert or otherwise.  I am concerned about using publications that do not meet the standards set forth in MEDRS, not people.  Experts get misquoted and misrepresented in the laypress all the time.  If you want to know what Rapin thinks about this, then go look for something that Rapin wrote herself.
* Since I'm merely repeating to you the exact text of MEDRS, it's a little difficult to see how this is my &quot;novel position&quot;.  MEDRS directly says,   If you don't like it, then go get the guideline changed.
* I'm not telling you that the source can't be used.  I'm telling you that it's not a great source for medical information.  
*  is a pathetic argument.  My view about using a newspaper article written by a non-expert reporter applies to all of the other sources, too.  If you want to use them (or, indeed, the two that we've discussed here) to support &quot;social, biographical, current-affairs, and historical information&quot;, then go for it.  If you want to use them for &quot;scientific and medical information&quot;, then that's not okay.
* Newspaper articles are not generally considered to be secondary sources.  See .  You are allowed to  sources, but MEDRS discourages it.  For that matter, you could simply cite his own books for the contents of his books.  We do that so routinely in articles about books that we normally don't bother providing any citation at all.
* There are, obviously (because I linked one above), scholarly reviews about his ideas.  If your deliberate search for negative viewpoints has turned up no criticism except in one quotation from an expert in the laypress and one book review by a non-expert, then IMO you need to consider whether those negative viewpoints are .  And if there are more significant or more scholarly criticisms (surely there are!), then IMO you ought to be citing those other sources.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 19:00, 30 December 2013 (UTC)
 Again, you have not addressed the query or dealt with the extensive use of other laypress sources in that article (and no, my alleged &quot;deliberate search for negative viewpoints&quot; did not turn up &quot;no criticism&quot;-- there is boatloads-- the point is, there is essentially no support for SBC's theories in journal-published secondary reviews).  Please stop prevaricating; do you want laysources removed from that article, or not?  If you do, most of the article needs to be gutted, and there will be little left to say, since his theories have little coverage/traction in secondary journal sources, while plenty of play in laysources, and if we remove laysources (indeed, commentary from recognized experts in the field), the propositions put forward in his books will be left unbalanced and unopposed.  Your interpretation of MEDRS that Isabelle Rapin being quoted in a very high quality newspaper as unreliable for a review of another researcher's personal theories is most certainly novel.  In the meantime, the main editor of that article continues POV editing.  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 19:31, 30 December 2013 (UTC)
I have addressed your query about the extensive use of other laypress sources.  Specifically, I said that &quot;WP:OTHERSTUFFEXISTS is a pathetic argument&quot;.  But so that we can be clear, here is a more detailed statement:
I want all laysources &quot;removed&quot; from this and all other articles in the entire English Wikipedia:
# where &quot;laysources&quot; specifically means &quot;popular press&quot; rather than reputable sources that intend to provide medical information to people who are not professional healthcare providers (e.g., lay summaries like [http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf12/alcmisuse/alcmisusefact.pdf this] from USPSTF);
# if and only if said laysources are used to support scientific or medical information, e.g., what flaws might be present in a scientific idea; 
# where the primary and preferred definition of &quot;removed&quot; is &quot;replaced by a stronger source, if possible&quot;; and
# so that action is taken at some point before the , explicitly including any time in the next hundred years.

I do not want laysources removed from this article, if said laysources are not used to support scientific or medical information.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 21:15, 30 December 2013 (UTC)
I can't read the article myself but looking through this discussion I think WhatamIdoing has a point. I don't trust newspapers to not cherry pick quotations or to quote out-of-context or even to quote accurately. We do have a problem in general with ideas promoted in the lay or popular press that are simply shunned in academia rather than publicly rejected (which may or may not be the case here). The increasing use of blogs by scientists doesn't help us find reliable sources. Books are sometimes reviewed in academic press, though such a review may concentrate more on the quality of writing or methods of argument rather than whether the theory is valid. -- Colin°Talk 10:14, 3 January 2014 (UTC)

Engel &amp; Pedley's Epilepsy: A Comprehensive Textbook (2008, p. 2205) addresses this rather more succinctly than usual:
&quot;a putative link between very specific forms of epilepsy and...pyromania or arson...has been discussed to be possibly triggered by a putative mechanism called the limbic psychotic trigger reaction (LPTR). This is believed to be a form of nonconvulsive behavioral seizure (NCBS); following this theory, seizure-like limbic pathomechanisms that are kindled by memory stimuli result in brief psychotic episodes in which the affected patients impulsively set fire. It should be stressed that these hypotheses are purely based on a few case reports, and that no solid epidemiologic data support the theory that these forms of impulse control disorder are truly more common in epilepsy as compared to the general population.&quot;

Sources on behavior genetics

Wikipedia has a lot of interesting articles based on the ongoing research in behavior genetics, both in humans and in nonhuman animals. I've been reading university textbooks on genetics &quot;for fun&quot; since the 1980s, and for even longer I've been visiting my state flagship university's vast BioMedical Library to look up topics on human medicine and health care policy. That university has long been a center of research on human behavior genetics, being the site of a major study of monozygotic twins reared apart. I currently participate in a weekly &quot;journal club&quot; there with multidisciplinary postgraduate discussion of human genetics. On the hypothesis that better sources build better articles as all of us here collaborate , I thought I would suggest some sources for updating the articles on behavior genetics and related topics. The  provide a helpful framework for evaluating sources. The guidelines, consistent with the , remind us that all &quot;Wikipedia articles should be based on reliable, published secondary sources&quot; (emphasis in original). 

Other Wikipedians who watch the article Behavioural genetics did all of us a great favor on the article talk page by suggesting helpful sources. In particular,  suggested an authoritative textbook on behavior genetics, covering both the human and the animal research, and following up on his suggestion led me to several other helpful sources with similar subject cataloging in libraries. 

Noting that Behavioural genetics is listed as a start-class, high-importance article by the WikiProjects for both genetics and psychology, I will start a workpage of an article update draft in my user space, relying on the sources recommended on the article talk page and on others listed here (in approximate order of date of publication, which is also almost but not exactly the order in which I have read them over the last few years): 

* 

* 

* 

* 

* 

* 

* 

* 

There are many useful review articles and overview news stories from peer-reviewed scientific journals that meet the  guidelines and are very useful sources for updating articles about behavior genetics (and I encourage Wikipedians to suggest others besides those listed here).  

* 

* 

* 

* 

*

* 

Some more general reference books about genetics or behavior also touch on behavior genetics issues through book chapters. 

* 

* 

I'm particularly mentioning this here on the WikiProject Medicine project talk page because some of the article edits I plan to clean up what another active editor here describes as a &quot;mess&quot; while in greater or smaller part impinge on articles that are more squarely on topics of medicine-as-such. I generally leave most articles on purely medical topics in the hands of editors who have formal training in medicine (I have a few of those on my watchlist), but as I surf by articles that link over to the behavior genetics articles, I may have occasion, as I did yesterday, to update wikilinks or otherwise incidentally edit minor details of articles in the scope of this project. I welcome all of you to suggest how I may most collaboratively proceed to clean up the mess in the many articles that pertain to behavior genetics, and I invite all of you to suggest sources on the topic of behavior genetics that fit the most stringent interpretation of the  guidelines. Best wishes for a happy new year with many article improvements. -- WeijiBaikeBianji (talk, how I edit) 23:51, 2 January 2014 (UTC)

I think we are looking at a subject expert editor here, and some of the sources seem at least at a glance to be sound. I think it would be best to inform about policy and inform that English sources are preferred unless translation is available. That said quite a few of the sources (if not all) are from Luis Joaquín García López, who seems to have published numerous (200+) papers on the subject, a number of which are CC-BY. Its difficult because if the sources are sound there is no reason to remove them, but on the other hand review is more difficult.CFCF (talk) 07:16, 16 December 2013 (UTC)

&quot;In the news&quot; article that needs a watcher or two

Just FYI, there's a Jahi mcmath article about a California girl that's making quite a few headlines here in the US, dealing with some pretty thorny medical ethics issues.  The article needs cleanup but has no outrageous issues.  Asking whether this is a BLP is a major headache.

It is mildly notable because the outcome has implications for many future cases.  If the family gets what it wants it will become very notable, but I don't think that is likely.  Beyond that it is notable simply because of the breadth of coverage by the news media. Looie496 (talk) 17:16, 4 January 2014 (UTC)
It might be better to merge the content into another article, but what would be the target?  There's a &quot;teachable moment&quot; in the McMath case (the article, as with Schiavo, should probably be about the case and not about the individual) in understanding the distinction between coma and death, and it might even have a home in brain death or some other overview article.   (talk) 18:22, 4 January 2014 (UTC)
It can be merged into a parent article. Coverage by the news media doesn't necessarily guarantee notability, and  still applies. The information can easily be incorporated in a larger article. --benlisquareT•• 09:47, 5 January 2014 (UTC)

Expert help needed over at 

 A user brings up a question which really seems to belong here as it is about the effects of neurotransmitters relating to a psychiatric disorder. Seems to partly be a sourcing issue.
The section Antisocial_personality_disorder#Hormones_and_neurotransmitters feels very shakey. It was basically only about serotonines, so I added some text about serotonine and cortisol. However, I feel I'm out of my depth with this section. An article is used as a source that in its summary says: Trait aggression was significantly higher in the combinations “high T + high cortisol responses” (indicating decreased 5-HT availability), and “low T + low cortisol responses” (indicating increased 5-HT availability), after S-citalopram. Now I can copyedit these words but it doesn't make any sense to me - especially as I thought cortisol counteracts testosterone, so I would expect most trait aggression in the high T and low cortisol responses, and the least trait aggression in the low T and high cortisol responses. Now obviously this is not the case - showing that I don't get it. Could any of you with more insight into this copyedit the text so it becomes clear not for all of us who are not neuroscientists? Lova Falk talk 16:06, 28 December 2013 (UTC)
-- CFCF (talk) 12:08, 1 January 2014 (UTC)

 That's a really complicated question, because the neuroendocrine system involved encompasses the whole hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (cortisol) and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (testosterone, esp. in men) - that's to say there's a lot of feedback back and forth between the axes. In a nutshell, the regulatory mechanism goes both ways. Cortisol affects testosterone and testosterone affects cortisol by regulating the HPA axis under certain conditions (see bullet 2) through the hypothalamus (probably are indirect mechanisms as well). The above ref's statement is more or less in line with that bullet's ref and its explanation. Seppi333 (Insert 2¢) 07:49, 7 January 2014 (UTC)

* Mathematical modeling of large-scale electrophysiological activity in epilepsy  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 00:16, 7 January 2014 (UTC)

 An excessively detailed article title like this may indicate that some particular POV (in this case, a particular set of  mathematical models) is being pushed. I don't know the literature well enough to judge POV, but it seems like a more general title, such as Computational model of epilepsy, would be a better choice. At this level of generality, there are review articles like [http://www.seizure-journal.com/article/S1059-1311(12)00224-5/fulltext], [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3201757/], [http://www.expert-reviews.com/doi/abs/10.1586/14737175.8.6.889], and [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1528-1167.2011.03225.x/full]. --Mark viking (talk) 00:42, 7 January 2014 (UTC)

* That's more in the realm of  and MOSMATH; however, that article isn't compliant with MOSMATH (or really, an encyclopedic style in general), because it's rhetorical in the analysis section.  Reads a lot more like a summary/amalgamation of research papers than an encyclopedia article.  I'm not going to comment on notability, because I'm not familiar with that particular sub-field of mathematical biology (computational neuroscience); at the very least, it needs a restructuring/rewrite to conform to encyclopedic standards. I've added the appropriate WP temps to the talk page though. Seppi333 (Insert 2¢) 01:50, 7 January 2014 (UTC)

 Well, yes, it started as an essay on one model, overly specific, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mathematical_modeling_of_large-scale_electrophysiological_activity_in_epilepsy&amp;oldid=574426129] and  attempted to correct the article name to Electrophysiological hypersynchronization in epilepsy, but the SPA moved it back to a long name. The article was set up as the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mathematical_modeling_of_large-scale_electrophysiological_activity_in_epilepsy&amp;diff=589517784&amp;oldid=557992009 Shusterman-Troy model.]  I added what PMIDs I could find; someone really should give Trypto a hand in there, as it's not clear this should be an article, or at least, not the article it is.  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 13:17, 7 January 2014 (UTC)

* As soon as I saw the article title I thought, &quot;I bet this article has 99% of its edits from one editor with a redlink for the User page&quot; and I wasn't disappointed.  It appears to be an article that's essentially a single primary research paper, .  It was published in the journal Physical review. E, Statistical, nonlinear, and soft matter physics which isn't even a journal focused on medicine, it is described as covering &quot;Soft matter and biological physics; Chaos, hydrodynamics, plasmas, and related topics.&quot;  PubMed shows that there is only one PMC article that cites the work, and it is another primary source that does so only in passing.  Honestly this Wikipedia article should probably be deleted. Zad68 14:31, 7 January 2014 (UTC)
I moved it to a shorter broader title until this is decided. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 16:20, 7 January 2014 (UTC)
Hey, everybody, thanks for the fresh eyes! I tried PRODding the page, but the editor who created it (yes, pretty much an SPI) reverted it, and tends to revert most things that I try. I'd support an AfD of the page in its present state, because it really is just a promo for one rather isolated bit of research, but I also think that there's a place on Wikipedia for a broader page about synchronization in epilepsy, with a lot of coverage of the mathematical modeling, but also with some experimental neuroscience and neurology. I haven't had the ambition to really fight it out with the other editor, but if we can have a couple of editors with eyes on it, I'd really like to see the page changed from the essay that it is now, to something broader and encyclopedic. --Tryptofish (talk) 20:13, 7 January 2014 (UTC)

We may need a guideline dealing with COI as it pertains to medicine. I have seen a fair number of experts who are here to promote themselves or there business more than write a balanced encyclopedia.

This would include using references written by yourself. Mentioning yourself in articles. Adding images with your clinic or your own name listed within the image.

And as always my response when someone proposes a new guideline is &quot;please god no&quot;. Just find a suitable existing guideline to mention it in... in this case it can probably be tacked on to WP:COI or MEDMOS or even MEDRS without yet another guideline... If there is one thing wikipedia does not need is more.  Lesion (talk) 22:09, 6 January 2014 (UTC)

I do at some point recall  proposing a policy to deal with information added to med articles in a 'quick remove' sense, such as if uncited information is added, as apparently is used by WP:BIO (I apologise if I'm paraphrasing incorrectly, Sandy). If such a policy were to be formed, it could incorporate a sensible removal policy of: (1) unsourced content; (2) primary sources on articles. Part (2) would cover the majority of COI sources anyway, I believe. --LT910001 (talk) 23:16, 6 January 2014 (UTC)

I'm with  that we need no further pages with extra guidance. Decisions to remove unverifiable information require case-by-case editorial decisions on verifiability. I generally agree that information medical that cannot be sourced to a MEDRS-compliant source is often best removed (although it requires a modicum of effort to determine that something is not sourceable). For BLPs the trigger is lower because of the risk of defamation. JFW | T@lk 23:25, 6 January 2014 (UTC)
I don't really see this problem as specific to medicine. The  problem affects virtually all areas of WP, always running up against  and . I doubt that a new guideline would go far. Our best tools are  (to constrain the use of POV sources),  (to deter self-promotion) and of course simple education for the well-intentioned but overenthusiastic newbies. Essays can help with educating the latter group. Once in a while, as at ALCAT test, we see the law of unintended consequences bites the culprits. LeadSongDog come howl! 23:28, 6 January 2014 (UTC)

 , I think you're referring to the oft-expressed notion that we might elevate MEDRS to a BLP-like policy, enabling us to more easily remove unsourced or poorly sourced content.  I don't see that as the same as COI?  , it is easier for the docs among us-- and particularly those who have journal access-- to easily remove poorly sourced content.  It is harder for those of us who aren't docs or don't have journal access-- it can take us (me :) a very long time to determine if content should be removed, which is why I often can only go through and flag primary sources, and let the docs decide if the content should be removed.  If we had a policy to allow the removal of poorly sourced content, it would make my work easier and faster, but I don't see the relation to COI ... I think we already have that covered, except that often COI editors are trying to add primary sources (this has been the theme of most of my editing for the last two weeks, as we seem to have been hit with a lot of editors pushing their pet theories into articles).  I don't think we need a new guideline page for medical COI: we just need more admins to enforce it!  In one BLP I've been working on this week, it took the non-medical admins a bit longer than the docs to see the problem.  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 00:08, 7 January 2014 (UTC)

Perhaps we need to make a provision in  that content obviously based on primary sources should be considered for removal. JFW | T@lk 00:09, 7 January 2014 (UTC)
 As a caveat to this, from the anatomical perspective, if editors were to consider MEDRS as applying to Anatomy, most of Anatomy is based on a chain of whispers emerging from primary sources. I may be thinking three steps ahead here, as this is not an issue we face at the moment. --LT910001 (talk) 23:21, 7 January 2014 (UTC)
 I don't know.  Problem for a lay-person is that, if I know the topic semi-well (hypothyroidism, say), I can see what is likely incorrect and should be removed, vs. what is poorly sourced but could be sourced to a secondary review if I had journal access.  If I don't know the topic, I can't be of much help.  It is painstaking work for a layperson with limited journal access, and I often feel I am of little help.  I don't know what the solution is, but in those cases where we have intransigent POV-pushers (eg a BLP I worked on this week, and for six years), a policy allowing us to remove poorly sourced content (which I knew to be poorly sourced) would have saved me a lot of time.  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 00:14, 7 January 2014 (UTC)
Yep , I feel that the vast majority of COI editing is editing which relies on sources which are not reliable or are primary, so a stronger MEDRS grounding may have a significant impact on our ability to manage COI and student-based editing. Additionally, I feel an elevated MEDRS would be able to be used with a clarity and ease that would not be found in a new COI-policy.--LT910001 (talk) 23:21, 7 January 2014 (UTC)

But I could not find it on pubmed. What are peoples' thoughts about the suitability of this source and does anyone know of a way to find if any given journal is listed on MEDLINE? Lesion (talk) 15:40, 10 January 2014 (UTC)
Pubmed indexing is a sort of sign of quality. For very rare topics such as this one I would not have an issue with your source. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 16:47, 10 January 2014 (UTC)
In that case, in it goes. There are hundreds of case reports, and this condition is supposed to be significantly more common in Japan, but just only 4 dedicated secondary/tertiary sources we can use (1 in Spanish). This adds a 5th. I just can't find out if the journal is peer reviewed. Interestingly, there are only 4 articles from this journal listed on PubMed, all available via PMC [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=%22Curr+Psychiatr%22[jour]. Not sure why the rest of the articles from this journal are not listed. Lesion (talk) 17:36, 10 January 2014 (UTC)
It is peer reviewed [http://www.currentpsychiatry.com/corporate-links/journal-info/submission-guidelines/evidence-based-reviews.html]. Lesion (talk) 17:46, 10 January 2014 (UTC)
Tepi the way you can check if a journal is MEDLINE-indexed is to look at the NLM Catalog record for it.  For this particular journal Current Psychiatry the NLM Catalog record is [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/101134371 here] and unfortunately the journal is explicitly listed as not MEDLINE-indexed.  MEDLINE indexing is a relatively low bar and there are LOTS of psychology journals that are MEDLINE-indexed and so I'd be concerned about the quality of that source.  I'd dig deep into the author's credentials and affiliations before using.  You have to ask yourself why the author couldn't get the article published in a more established MEDLINE indexed journal? Zad68 19:14, 10 January 2014 (UTC)
This is interesting, because the journal seems legit. From their website: &quot;Current Psychiatry is a peer-reviewed journal for 40,000 U.S. psychiatrists in community and hospital practice, psychiatry residents, and advance-practice psychiatric nurses with prescribing authority.&quot; I wonder why it is not on PubMed... Regarding the article itself, it has a &quot;tacked on&quot; case report, so maybe it is inappropriate to call this a secondary source. First author is a prof of psychiatry, both have disclosed links to pharmaceutical companies. Lesion (talk) 20:23, 10 January 2014 (UTC)
Don't know why it isn't, Tepi, but it would certainly make me treat the source from a &quot;guilty until proven innocent&quot; frame of mind.  Are there really absolutely no other better articles available that cover treatment?  Just use your best judgment, of course.  And I don't see any issue at all with review having a &quot;tacked on&quot; case report actually, I've seen a number of perfectly well-qualified  articles written that way, especially when the articles are written by/for practicing ER docs or clinicians.  The case report gives a framework that drives the organization of the article, just a style thing. Zad68 20:43, 10 January 2014 (UTC)
Including this source, there are 5 dedicated, MEDRS compliant sources, 2 of which are described as systematic reviews, so yes I would say there better sources for treatment. I will use those for the treatment section then instead of this source. Thanks for advice, Lesion (talk) 20:58, 10 January 2014 (UTC)

Draft at AfC needs medical expert help.

This draft about a probably notable medical topic needs a lot of help to get it into shape. The content looks comprehensive (to my in-expert eye) but in terms of style, formatting, referencing and other &quot;technicalities&quot; it is a very rough draft. Rather than the draft being submitted to AfC numerous times and thus having problems pointed out for fixing one at a time, I believe it would be far better for the writer to be given fairly comprehensive assistance by someone familiar with the specific standards and requirements of medical articles.

I wrote a script that pulls the refs and tags them with the PubMed article type, I will run that for the article and post the results on the article Talk page.  However I feel that the best thing to do would be to simply throw out the entire article and start over. Zad68 15:06, 9 January 2014 (UTC)
 You did ?!?!?  Why am I just hearing about this-- I spent hours flagging primary sources at synesthesia.  Can others use your script, or do we have to contact you?  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 15:11, 9 January 2014 (UTC)
Yes... it's not really super-clever but it does the job.  It is actually a piece of a bigger script that I wrote to assist me in reviewing the sourcing for medical article GA candidates.  I've run it ad-hoc for a few things Doc needed.  I had intended to put it up on the toolserver (I got an account and everything) but am not familiar enough with that to get it done, and then I lost momentum.  I can still run it ad-hoc on request but the definitely sucks to make everyone dependent on me. Zad68 15:15, 9 January 2014 (UTC)

 He can help with that?  That'd be great! Zad68 15:24, 9 January 2014 (UTC)

Yes! a script! I was thinking along the same lines but (AIUI) even if one gets the CrossRef record for an article, there's no article classification data (i.e. whether it's a research article, a review, or whatever) in there. However, one can I suppose pull in the classification data from PubMed if it's got a PMID - is that what you do? Otherwise I have to confess I was thinking a delete and re-start might be easier -- does this article need to say much more than the corresponding section does at Circumcision ? Alexbrn talk||COI 15:29, 9 January 2014 (UTC)
I have run my script and posted my results at the article Talk page, hope it's useful.  Yes my script pulls the article type from PubMed. I think there's enough out there to fill out a real article on this topic, possibly even enough to support a GA.  The main article should provide a brief overview and use the  template to point to this article.  Probably the main article could use an update on this, actually. Zad68 16:33, 9 January 2014 (UTC)
Adding--I'm going to look into getting my script to pull the year and also whether it's MEDLINE indexed... Zad68 16:36, 9 January 2014 (UTC)
Done adding MEDLINE status and year of publication to script, output at the article Talk page now! Zad68 18:07, 9 January 2014 (UTC)
This sounds great, and it will save many of us hours of clicking.
However, like any tool, it will really only be great if people use it correctly.  Primary sources are allowed in medical articles, if they are carefully chosen and sparingly used.  For example, it's common for a
History
section to link to the first formal description of a disease, even though that paper is often both decades old and a primary source.  Some details of physiology might be better explained in and better supported by a top-quality primary paper than with a secondary source that mentions them in passing.  , and &quot;primary&quot; is not an alternative spelling for bad.  Once you've got the list, you'll still have to think about whether this source is appropriate for the exact claim being made in the article.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:14, 9 January 2014 (UTC)
 point taken, I'm trusting that this will be used as a tool to assist and it won't be used in place of thinking and common sense! Zad68 20:29, 10 January 2014 (UTC)
For mechanisms of diseases usually textbooks are better than primary sources. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 18:21, 9 January 2014 (UTC)
 This script is awesome .  Normally for an article that size, it would take me about eight hours just to check and flag the sources to know which are reviews, which are editorials, meta-analysis, etc, and by the time I'm done with that, I'm usually too sick and tired of the article (and sitting on my butt) to take the next step of seeing if the sources are used correctly.  In this instance, based on your list, it was much easier to flag the sources, and within an hour or two, work to see how the sources were used could get underway.  As it turned out, a good number of the reviews were extremely dated, but provided useful information for the History section, and several of the primary sources used actually backed statements that could be made in History.  This script saved a couple days' work, and a whole lot of frustration; the most important benefit is that one can get to work on the content faster, rather than wasting time with three tabs open to check and flag sources.   By the way, this article was written too long ago, so that what is there now mostly is a good history section; content needs to be built to be updated.  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 19:56, 10 January 2014 (UTC)
 I'm beaming with pride, seriously...  I'm delighted to produce something to help someone use their time more efficiently while... uh, well, wasting time on Wikipedia.  Please let me know if I can add anything else to the script to make it more useful and I will have to follow up with Boghog! Zad68 20:26, 10 January 2014 (UTC)

Specifically, not only does text need to comply with MEDRS, but after considering the sources, is it  to mention psilocybin treatment in individual conditions, and are we overusing the Vollenweider opinion piece?  Considering the number of broad overviews available (not all listed here) for cluster headache and OCD, we have for each condition a very small study reported briefly in one or two reviews.

James Heilman now has a Wikipedia page

I have decided that , i.e. James Heilman, MD, meets Wikipedia's notability guidelines, and have therefore decided to create an article about him. This article can be viewed here. I am curious what he and other members of this Wikiproject think about whether this article should exist should be deleted or not.  Jinkinson talk to me 18:24, 9 January 2014 (UTC)
Gah. Doubt I meet notability requirements. I am from Saskatchewan yes. But not Moose Jaw Saskatchewan even though I did live there for a number of years. It is &quot;East Kootenay&quot;. And I am not &quot;the leading clinician-Wikipedian behind WikiProject Medicine&quot;. That honor would go to . I could maybe be called a &quot;leading clinician-Wikipedian&quot;. One among a number. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 18:33, 9 January 2014 (UTC)
 May somebody someday do something nice for you, Jinkinson.  I'm not editing that article per COI, but will you please read  and banish the words curently and recently from your Wikipedia writing, and also, es are not spaced.  And, see  on spacing for logical quotation.  Strange quotes; what do you mean by &quot;think about whether this article should exist&quot;?  It does exist.   comes to mind, in the event you are suggesting it shouldn't.  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 18:42, 9 January 2014 (UTC)

I don't think that James is pleased that he will now endure similar  nightmares (vandalism, etc.) that other Wikipedians with Wikipedia articles existing about them have endured, but it is an honor to have a Wikipedian create a Wikipedia article about you because they think you are notable enough for it. Flyer22 (talk) 18:43, 9 January 2014 (UTC)

I abstain from any comment on this individual article, suggest seek wider opinion from editors outside this project re notability. In response to Flyer22's comment above, whether a person (any person) is happy to have their own Wikipedia article or not does not feature in determining the notability for such an article.
Unrelated to this specific article, I would again raise concerns that user:Jinkinson considers the main article space a suitable place to create bio articles which may or may not be notable. I would recommend detailed review of notability guidelines for biography articles, which seem to be a favorite, so that there is more confidence about whether a person is notable or not. It is also worth pointing out that AfD is chronically swamped with bio articles and they get deleted by the bucketful. Lesion (talk) 18:52, 9 January 2014 (UTC)
Lesion, with regard to notability, I of course know that; I didn't state or imply that &quot;whether a person (any person) is happy to have their own Wikipedia article or not [features] in determining the notability for such an article.&quot; Flyer22 (talk) 18:55, 9 January 2014 (UTC)
Yes, just making clear as that might have been the message that some readers took. Lesion (talk) 19:01, 9 January 2014 (UTC)
As helpful as Doc is to Wikipedia, the sourcing provided so far doesn't show the BLP rises above  and  is not met either. I don't see sufficient significant coverage in independent reliable sourcing to pass . The standard thing to do is to see if sourcing is provided that meets one of the standard Wikipedia notability guidelines, and  if not. Zad68 18:56, 9 January 2014 (UTC)

Heh, tricky. Not many Wikipedians have their own articles (although I've just noticed this:  Essjay controversy). At the moment I think it is very difficult to formulate what the threshhold would be for a Wikipedian to become notable. If  is not notable () then what hope is there for those with a less lofty edit count? JFW | T@lk 19:24, 9 January 2014 (UTC)

I'd only known James as his screen name (Doc James) and the guy that did a lot of editing on medical articles.  His &quot;note-worthiness&quot; was news to me, so here's my impression based on reading the article then Googling him.  It may seem to be splitting hairs but James is (publically) known for 1) being a prolific clinician-wikipedian, 2) using Wikipedia as a teaching tool for medical students and 3) the Rorschach controversy.  Just because each event is tied to Wikipedia, shouldn't mean that all are lumped together as one event.  It seems different, to me, than the Justin Knapp article which was created (and deleted) based on wide coverage of one event.  I don't think it will lead to an onslaught of Wikipedians looking to create their own pages as most prefer to work under pseudonyms and even fewer make an effort to be newsworthy outside of the Wikipedia community.  My argument would be that the article stands based on the number and variety of independent sources.  As an aside (as I don't think this should be used in the consideration of keeping this article but I'd be lying if I said I didn't think about it), the article is a nice thing to do for someone who's done a lot for the community and creates an encyclopedic reference for other clinicians (or student clinicians) who might be looking for real-world examples of how they can contribute.Ian Furst (talk) 22:50, 9 January 2014 (UTC)

Caries

I was going to start a rework of the caries page, only to discover that, technically, it refer to destruction of not only teeth but also bone.  I've never heard of osteomyelitis or other bone destroying diseases referred to as caries, only teeth (dental caries).  Question; should I turn this into a disambiguation page?  Treat the entire thing as dental caries and put in a sentence about the fact it can refer to other bone destroying diseases?  Right now the opening paragraph deals with bone or teeth but the text below deals largely with dental caries.  Thoughts are appreciated.  Thanks. Ian Furst (talk) 03:21, 13 January 2014 (UTC)
I'm not convinced &quot;caries&quot; referring to pathoses of hard tissues other than the dental tissues is still in regular, modern use. Suggest that caries redirect to dental caries, and in the latter history section this might be mentioned. Lesion (talk) 03:28, 13 January 2014 (UTC)
Here is a historic source which uses the term &quot;bone&quot; caries [http://www.maxillofacialcenter.com/BondBook/book/Bondbook.html], and another [http://www.maxillofacialcenter.com/indexNICO.htm] (relating it to neuralgia-inducing cavitational osteonecrosis, a controversial topic which potential implications on persistent idopathic facial pain/atypical facial pain). Also, here is a online popular dictionary defintion of caries: &quot;a progressive destruction of bone or tooth; especially : tooth decay&quot; [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/caries]. Lesion (talk) 03:52, 13 January 2014 (UTC)
maybe this page was created based on an old dictionary definition rather than reliable sources.  I've checked Robbin's Path, several Int Med &amp; Gen Sx textbooks (incl one a colleague left around from 1977) and I can't find any reference to caries except in teeth.  Editors (esp path/radio/ortho and those outside North America); have you ever heard of caries referring to lytic bone lesions? Ian Furst (talk) 13:37, 13 January 2014 (UTC)
I believe that Lesion's suggestion at 03:28 is a good one that will line up with what our readers expect. 
Is there another word for &quot;bone caries&quot;?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:46, 13 January 2014 (UTC)
I agree - sounds like there's little evidence it's used beyond teeth - , do you know how to create the redirect?  Do I just delete the contents and build the redirect? Ian Furst (talk) 17:24, 13 January 2014 (UTC)
Ian: No need to create any page, it already exists. Yes I think just write over the previous content + if you feel any of the content on caries is suitable to be merged to dental caries. 
Other option is make caries into a short article which 1. links to dental caries and 2. mentions that caries may also refer to bone destruction in a historic context.
WAID: This is the most recent source I found that uses the term &quot;bone caries&quot; (also &quot;vertebral caries&quot;): , may have just been inexpertly translated. Most occurrences of the term are historic: [http://www.artandmedicine.com/biblio/authors/Toland7.html] + the sources already posted above. Here is a an altmed source which utilizes some historic literature, referring to &quot;caries of the cranium, ribs, spine, and of the bones of the limbs&quot; and claiming that tooth decay is not related to bacteria [http://www.healingteethnaturally.com/dr-herbert-shelton-real-reasons-tooth-decay.html]. So as to the exact modern equivalent of the term, I would guess some sources are referring to avascular necrosis (osteonecrosis) ... based on &quot;the term for decay or ulcerous inflammation of bone.&quot; and the neuralgia-inducing cavitational osteonecrosis source earlier, but in all honesty I think this term was mostly used in a time when distinct hard tissue pathoses were poorly distinguished from each other, so &quot;bone caries&quot; could also mean osteomeyelitis, or any destructive process, i.e. a descriptive term like &quot;ulceration&quot; and not a precise entity. The current article talks about &quot;carries sicca of the cranial vault&quot; (lit. &quot;dry decay/rot&quot;?), related to syphilis. Historic sources for this can also be found [http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qubTdDk1H3IC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=syphilis+caries+sicca&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=H6Vfm9cSu2&amp;sig=rSNd96rtK-sBbUI2RgTg-jnbHGc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hDXUUrPEK6PBygP7-4CgAQ&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=syphilis%20caries%20sicca&amp;f=false],[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1295133/?page=3]. Lesion (talk) 18:40, 13 January 2014 (UTC)

On a related subject, since it's been so long since I've seen anyone interested in dental health:  The lead to Disease says &quot;The most common disease in the world is gum disease affecting 3 out of 4 people.&quot;  I don't really doubt the claim (much; it kind of depends on whether you mean prevalence or incidence, and that level of detail isn't appropriate for the lead of this very basic article).  

The source, however, is really pathetic.  If you can find a better one, please let me know (or boldly fix it yourself).  WhatamIdoing (talk) 01:23, 14 January 2014 (UTC)

Reasonator, a tool developed by Magnus Manske, has become quite good at displaying the basic information about certain medical topics. The big advantage is that we can translate little bits of information and create dynamic content in every single language. See for example the page for huntingtons disease:
*English: http://tools.wmflabs.org/reasonator/?q=Q190564&amp;lang=en
*German: http://tools.wmflabs.org/reasonator/?q=Q190564&amp;lang=de
*Russian: http://tools.wmflabs.org/reasonator/?q=Q190564&amp;lang=ru
*Russian: http://tools.wmflabs.org/reasonator/?q=Q190564&amp;lang=ko
*Kiswahili: http://tools.wmflabs.org/reasonator/?q=Q190564&amp;lang=sw
The last one doesn't work well because the properties and items haven't been translated into that language yet. But hopefully we can accomplish that in the coming year for the most important medical subjects.

This is brilliant and a highly accessible way to support translators in bringing huge amounts of data to people who speak any language. If this information could be presented within the Wikipedia articles people are already visiting then the work of a single translator would have a huge amount of impact.
I wish the best for this worthy project and to the extent I can I will support it.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 19:13, 13 January 2014 (UTC)
I think that the intent for smaller Wikis is, that they will have these pages as place-holders until somebody writes an article. In the future the intent is that the user will be prompted if the infobox should be added from wikidata and what information should be displayed. That will free up a lot of time so that people can use on writing and translating articles, instead of getting frustrated with the infobox template.Tranlating has become very efficient. Sometimes one translation adds information to hundreds of other items. See for example: http://tools.wmflabs.org/wikidata-terminator/?list&amp;lang=en&amp;mode=t1000 - And thank you  for supporting the collaboration. Hopefully these small steps will lead us to something great. --Tobias1984 (talk) 10:59, 15 January 2014 (UTC)

&quot;Cite Journal&quot; template in the Wikipedia editing toolbar not working

I posted about this just now on the Village Pump - Technical, and I wonder if you guys can help as well:

This is frustrating -- the &quot;Cite Journal&quot; template in the editing toolbar (at least the one I see) is not working properly all of a sudden (I don't know how long this has been going on, since I don't think I've used in a month or so). If one clicks &quot;Cite Journal&quot;, the &quot;Cite Book&quot; template pops up instead! It is missing all of the critical ingredients of the &quot;Cite Journal&quot; template, like PMID number, DOI number, and so forth. I tried to make some manual adjustments after I filled in the fields in the &quot;Cite Book&quot; template that in now the only one available, but it's still not working correctly. Even odder is the fact that though the edit toolbar clearly titles the template &quot;Cite Book&quot; (instead of the &quot;Cite Journal&quot; requested), when one clicks &quot;add citation&quot;, the resulting citation text reads , even though it's clearly not and doesn't have the normal journal fields.

Anyway, this is really really frustrating for those of us citing medically related articles, and so forth. BTW, I've checked this on Chrome and on IE, and it's the same glitch on both.

Can someone please restore the &quot;Cite Journal&quot; template to its former correct state, complete with the proper name, and the PMID number field, DOI number field, and so forth? Thank you. Softlavender (talk) 00:14, 15 January 2014 (UTC)
 I can't answer your specific question, but for PubMed-indexed references, I now use the . Axl ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 01:11, 15 January 2014 (UTC)
It is working again. This breaks from time to time. I use this as a backup [http://toolserver.org/~holek/cite-gen/index.php]. I do not like the cite PMID templates. We have had some people switch the cite journal to the cite pmid tags which is a pain. The cite pmid tags do not work in many other languages. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 01:17, 15 January 2014 (UTC)

 Hi Doc James -- it's not working, it's still the same. It's still the Book citation, and it's still missing DOI and PMID listings. I imagine you are using a different editing toolbar. Softlavender (talk) 01:32, 15 January 2014 (UTC)
Are you able to get the other one to work? Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 05:06, 15 January 2014 (UTC)

The totally blank one you posted? Too complicated for me. I want the normal one to be fixed, as there's no reason for the wrong template to come up on the editing bar. Hoping someone here has some influence and can get it fixed. Softlavender (talk) 05:12, 15 January 2014 (UTC)
Just put the PMID (or ISBN or anything else) in one of the blank boxes, and click &quot;Generate&quot;.  It should automatically figure it all out for you.  If you don't like that one (and it will stop working in a few months), then try [http://tools.wmflabs.org/citation-template-filling/cgi-bin/index.cgi Diberri's].
I believe that the cite gadget in the editing toolbar is a gadget written by a volunteer.  Support for such gadgets is limited to the time and interest that the volunteer has.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:19, 15 January 2014 (UTC)

along the same lines, is there a problem using  template when moving to other languages? Ian Furst (talk) 01:39, 15 January 2014 (UTC)
Yes same problem. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 05:06, 15 January 2014 (UTC)

Animal studies - a general query

Looking at Pterostilbene, which has some specific problems, I was troubled by uncertainty over a general issue: to what extent can an article which is not (fully) about human health cite animal studies?
In this article which is ostensibly about a chemical, for example, are the animal studies secondary sources or (through a MEDRS lens) primary sources? And what about when, as often happens, the language and titles start shading into implications about human health? (e.g. &quot;the ability to fight off and reverse cognitive decline&quot;)?
My inclination is to remove content that make claims of medicinal potential based on animal studies, when it is only supported by in vivo or in vitro experiments. But - would that be overly-draconian? Alexbrn talk||COI 14:10, 7 January 2014 (UTC)

Any statement that makes a claim or implication about an effect on human health needs -compliant sourcing.  This article has lots of problems, especially the entire section on Cognitive decline Reversal.  The article's use of a popular press article from 1999 discussing results from rat studies as if they might be relevant to human health is wholly unacceptable.  Zad68 14:35, 7 January 2014 (UTC)

What about a statement like: &quot;pterostilbene has been shown to lower blood glucose levels in rats by as much as 56 percent, while simultaneously raising insulin and hemoglobin levels to near normal levels.[10]&quot;. Is that an informative neutral statement purely about an animal experiment (which may be of interests to chemists and pharmaceutical researchers), or an undue mention of a non-notable study that can't help but imply something? Alexbrn talk||COI 15:06, 7 January 2014 (UTC)

Was the primary study cited done for the purpose of advancing veterinary science? Zad68 15:18, 7 January 2014 (UTC)
Doubtful, but might it be defended as encyclopedic to gather together animal experimentation results for a chemical so as to give a full account of what is known of that chemical? This is a general worry I have - so another example article is Medicinal mushrooms: much of the article is gathering together medicinal &quot;properties&quot;, &quot;associations&quot; and &quot;potential applications&quot; of mushrooms. Is doing that a fair summary of research activities, or an implication-heavy mass of undue content? Alexbrn talk||COI 15:45, 7 January 2014 (UTC)
I am not sure of what you are trying to imply. Animal research is an essential part of preclinical, toxicological and biomedical research in general. As such, if there is a relevant literature on effects of substances on animals, I expect it to be in the article.  is on a case-by-case basis, and is about article balance. --cyclopiaspeak! 15:49, 7 January 2014 (UTC)

Yeah, doubtful, so that's the point really. I don't have access to full primary study  but the MeSH terms includes &quot;Rats, Wistar&quot; which is a strain of albino laboratory rats developed by the Wistar Institute and testing is only ever done on these kinds of rats for the intended purpose of benefitting human health.  Therefore this use of this sort of source fails  badly and needs to come out of the article. Zad68 15:56, 7 January 2014 (UTC)
Wait, why? So far it is clear it is about animals it makes perfect sense to include such stuff. If there is an explicit implication of the kind &quot;Compound X could treat cancer in humans, given the promising results on animals...&quot; this is  and as such disallowed. But so far we report the studies as they are, there is nothing bad about that. --cyclopiaspeak! 16:01, 7 January 2014 (UTC)
If it is discussed in a secondary source may be notable. If it is a primary source would be very hesitant. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 16:18, 7 January 2014 (UTC)
On the original question:  A source that's all about animals can be a secondary source.  A source that's all about humans can be a primary source.  The subject matter doesn't determine the status.  PubMed lists five recent reviews on this subject.  The first in the list is , and it's a review that happens to talk about animals studies.  That's fine:  it's still a secondary source.  It's important to make sure that the material isn't misrepresented, but you can summarize what the review says about the animals studies that have been conducted.  There are some things that can't be talked about any other way, like LD50s and chemicals that haven't finished human testing.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 02:26, 8 January 2014 (UTC)

 I don't like animal studies supporting any text that might suggest an identical effect in humans without a clear disclaimer. Seppi333 (Insert 2¢) 20:27, 15 January 2014 (UTC)

The Wikipedia Library seeks renewal (please comment)
 has grown from a collection of donations to paywalled sources into a broad open research portal for our community.  New partnerships have been formed, new pilot programs started, new connections made with our library experts and likeminded institutions.  We have tried to bring people together in a new sense of purpose and community about the importance of facilitating research in an open and collaborative way.  Here's what we've done so far:

*Increased access to sources: 1500 editors signed up for 3700 free accounts, individually worth over $500,000, with usage increases of those references between 400-600%
*Deep networking: Built relationships with Credo, HighBeam, Questia, JSTOR, Cochrane, LexisNexis, EBSCO, New York Times, and OCLC
*New pilot projects: Started the Wikipedia Visiting Scholar project to empower university-affiliated Wikipedia researchers
*Developed community:  Created portal connecting 250 newsletter recipients, 30 library members, 3 volunteer coordinators, and 2 part-time contractors
*Tech scoped: Spec'd out a reference tool for linking to full-text sources and established a basis for OAuth integration
*Broad outreach: Wrote a feature article for Library Journal's The Digital Shift; presenting at the American Library Association annual meeting

We've proposed a 6 month  to continue and deepen this work and would appreciate

3RR over primary source being added to herpes simplex, herpes labialis, herpes genitalis

A (?well meaning) editor is repeatedly adding a primary source to the above articles ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Herpes_labialis&amp;curid=21754540&amp;action=history], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Herpes_simplex&amp;action=history], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Herpes_genitalis&amp;diff=590356322&amp;oldid=583761439]). Tried to explain on user talkpage, obviously failed. I think I have made 3 reverts already. Comments appreciated. Lesion (talk) 14:35, 12 January 2014 (UTC)
 I did not see a 3RR warning on the user's talk, which is a prerequisite for admin action-- added that, but now off for a few hours.  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 14:44, 12 January 2014 (UTC)
Ty for that. Don't think admin action needed, just better understanding of MEDRS. User has emailed me twice saying the source is fine with reasoning that there are already primary sources on the articles and that primary sources are clearly allowed if no 2o available. Replied to emails on user talkpage. Lesion (talk) 14:50, 12 January 2014 (UTC)
 .  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 14:53, 12 January 2014 (UTC)
Speaking of those articles, I have encountered two editors adding bad or otherwise poor sources to the Herpes genitalis article; for example, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Herpes_genitalis&amp;curid=5069414&amp;diff=590369896&amp;oldid=590356322 here] with Willpolydna, and I see that Willpolydna is the editor that Lesion has been encountering at the herpes articles. As for the other editor I've encountered, I didn't revert Ohnohedinnit again because I didn't feel like getting into a  with a newbie (that type of edit war is almost always the most frustrating because the newbie will almost always continue reverting) and it appeared that Jmh649 (Doc James) was watching that article. When I saw that Doc James didn't revert Ohnohedinnit, I left it alone. Ohnohedinnit also has a  issue, as seen [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ohnohedinnit&amp;diff=580644326&amp;oldid=580577985 here] on his talk page. We are not supposed to state that someone &quot;has become bisexual while in prison&quot; unless that person identifies as bisexual. And people don't just become bisexual, no more than they suddenly become heterosexual, gay or lesbian...unless speaking of those matters in sexual identity or behavioral (as distinct from sexual orientation) terms only. By that, I mean that the person's sexual orientation is already developed; whether they finally express it (physically or otherwise) or take up behavior that contradicts it does not change that.   

By the way, above I linked Willpolydna and Ohnohedinnit's talk pages for their usernames because they don't yet have user pages. Flyer22 (talk) 15:42, 12 January 2014 (UTC)

Thanks for the notice .  I do not want to get  in the content but someone should review [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Herpes_genitalis&amp;action=history this] article history at Herpes genitalis. Zad68 02:41, 14 January 2014 (UTC)
Done, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Herpes_genitalis&amp;diff=590838174&amp;oldid=590369896 here] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Herpes_genitalis&amp;diff=590839674&amp;oldid=590838174 here] so far. That article still needs some sourcing cleanup, though; for example, it used [http://www.genitalherpessymptoms.org/genital-herpes-treatment.html this source], which [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Herpes_genitalis&amp;diff=590840711&amp;oldid=590839674 I removed.] Flyer22 (talk) 17:10, 15 January 2014 (UTC) 

Also note: The bisexual matter has [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Flyer22&amp;curid=11122823&amp;diff=590997214&amp;oldid=590995881#Your_recent_edits:_Herpes_genitalis_and_Timothy_L._Tyler_articles been taken care of]; turns out that one of the sources supports Ohnohedinnit's wording on that matter. Flyer22 (talk) 18:10, 16 January 2014 (UTC)  

Have taken a look and agree with Lesion. Have reverted and posted further instructions on the users page. Doc James (talk ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 16:05, 12 January 2014 (UTC)

Willpolydna has clearly been edit-warring at the listed articles, and has received proper notices about sourcing requirements and our rules against edit-warring.  Looking at the state of the articles, this looks stale at the moment, but if the editor starts back up again ping me and I will block.  Zad68 02:38, 14 January 2014 (UTC)

Cadet article: Blood pressure drop across major arteries to capillaries

Hello, there is a cadet article at Blood pressure drop across major arteries to capillaries, that seems to cover a fair bit of information that would be useful for the general article Blood pressure.
