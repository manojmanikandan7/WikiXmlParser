		<segment id="id63061156">Therapeutic indication of medicinal plants
In case of most of the medicinal plants nothing can be found on the pages about their therapeutic use. One possible source is the webpage of ESCOP (European Scientific Cooperative on Phytotherapy), which, according to the guideline, can be used as reference. Escop has several publications containing scientific assessment of medicinal plants. Their résumés, including the indications can be found on their webpage (https://escop.com/downloads/category/monograph/). I started to introduce these, but some editors reverted and suggested to discuss the reliability of ESCOP, as a source here. Since there is a demand for authentic information on modern phytotherapeutic use of plants (historical use is interesting, but sometimes useless), I think that it would be useful to use this source. I would be grateful for you comments. --Csupord (talk) 15:56, 26 January 2020 (UTC)
Although ESCOP (a European herbalism society) appears to be a legitimate organization for studying the possible therapeutic effects of plants, the list of monographs offered is commercial (discouraged, see ) and not an encyclopedic source by itself (see ), as the level of source quality and clinical consensus cannot be assessed from that list of monographs. ESCOP as an article is currently under a deletion discussion [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/European_Scientific_Cooperative_on_Phytotherapy here.] Clinical research in herbalism is typically of low quality (poor experimental designs, low subject numbers, inconsistent material preparations), discussed partly [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbal_medicine#Scientific_criticism here.] ESCOP publishes Phytomedicine which has an impact factor of about 4, depending on IF source, and among journals publishing herbalism articles, is probably the highest rated, indicating a generally low-quality field of clinical research in herbalism.  has been using the ESCOP monograph list as a source over numerous plant articles [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Csupord shown here,] meeting resistance among other editors. Generally, there are few examples of plant compounds succeeding in well-designed, rigorously-reviewed studies meeting  standards. --Zefr (talk) 17:33, 26 January 2020 (UTC)
I appreciate your opinion. However, to be objective: ESCOP monographs are available also in books, the reason why I cited them the nnline abstracts was to give access to the orioginal source - similarly as it happens in case of scientific articles. (Btw, is there any difference in the gusiness model of selling articles and selling monographs? As far as I know nobody has problems with citing articles that are available only after paying.)
The therapeutic indication available in the outline is the same as in the books. Indeed, there are several poor clinical trials, just in case of synthetics. Of course everybody has the right to form opinion about scientific journals, but I have to tell that this journal is highly ranked and aknowledged in the scientific community. Nevertheless, Phytomedicine itself has nothing to do with the therapeutic indications of the monographs, that are partly based on clinical data, partly on empirical knowledge. In modern phytotherapy both well-established and traditionally based indications are acceptable, see https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory/herbal-medicinal-products My aim was to introduce information based on scientific assessment of available knowledbe, both experimenmtal and empirical. I think it is beter to give information based on the assessment of a scientific association than to present historical data from old books - as it is now in the majority of the cases.Csupord (talk) 19:52, 26 January 2020 (UTC)Csupord
It doesn't appear to meet MEDRS, so would likely require caveats similar to what's used for folk remedies. --Ronz (talk) 17:41, 27 January 2020 (UTC)
  So you'd prefer to see something maybe from a reference book published by an established publishing house that regularly works in medical and scientific areas, such as Thieme Medical Publishers, right?  Not just something on their website.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 21:34, 27 January 2020 (UTC)
No. I'm assuming that MEDRS sources are unavailable and that this should be treated similarly to folk remedies. --Ronz (talk) 21:36, 27 January 2020 (UTC)
Agree, no. Topics in herbal medicine should be held to the same clinical source rigor that  prescribes. Csupord argues above that it is better to provide the ESCOP monographs as &quot;available knowledge&quot;, but I say that knowledge mainly is unrigorous, unconvincing, and usually unsubstantiated, so should not be discussed as if it is, and should not be sourced by dubious &quot;phytotherapy&quot; journals or books. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Urtica_dioica&amp;diff=937630692&amp;oldid=933452217 This] is an example (among dozens of edits using ESCOP monographs) that Csupord added (all were reverted by other editors), showing false conclusions and folk uses of phytotherapy that may mislead unsuspecting encyclopedia users. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Csupord On his user page,] Csupord reveals that phytotherapy is his [https://scholar.google.hu/citations?user=wdXSilQAAAAJ&amp;hl=hu topic of university research], so  in promoting ESCOP literature may be at play.

MEDSCI says &quot;present prevailing medical or scientific consensus, which can be found in...in textbooks, or in some forms of monographs&quot;.   says that &quot;a monograph or chapter in a textbook intended for professionals or postgraduates&quot; is better than a textbook for student.  You seem to be assuming that the source's reliability can be determined according to whether it supports a particular POV, rather than according to the criteria laid out in the sourcing policies and guidelines (which look a lot more like &quot;It is published by a reputable publishing house, rather than by the author(s)&quot; than &quot;that entire field is unconvincing, so we can't use sources written by anyone in it&quot;]).  WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:05, 28 January 2020 (UTC)
 Yes, but all of the &quot;monographs&quot; published by ESCOP are online pdfs written by their members. So what makes ESCOP a reliable publishing house? Is it a reputation for publishing high quality textbooks and monographs? Are these used extensively in higher education courses? I'm sorry but I can't take seriously a publisher/author that so vastly overstates the effects of herbal remedies when compared to a mainstream source like the [https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory/herbal-medicinal-products European Medicines Agency]. YMMV. --RexxS (talk) 18:29, 28 January 2020 (UTC)
I haven't asked whether ESCOP is a reliable publisher of their website.  I've asked whether Thieme Medical Publishers, whose books appear to have been [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=%22Thieme%20Medical%20Publishers%22&amp;title=Special%3ASearch&amp;fulltext=1&amp;ns0=1 cited in more than 100 articles], is the kind of publisher that MEDBOOK is looking for.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 21:20, 28 January 2020 (UTC)
Indeed, maybe I am not an authentic person as a researcher involved in this field, as a teacher at a university, as an author of several reserch paper dealing with med plants (including meta-analyses), as an ESCOP scientific board member and as an ex-member of the European Medicines Agency Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products. Maybe it would be easier if I would be an outsider. However, I have to draw your attention that ESCOP monographs are not simply written by ESCOP sci com members, but disussed by all the members in several rounds and supervised by acknowledged supervising editors (https://escop.com/about-escop/supervising-editors/). And if you think that ESCOP monographs overstate the effects compared to EMA monograps, I have to admit, that this is not the case. If an EMA monograph contains only a traditional-use indications, these are based not on real empirical knowledge, but only on the evidence which comes from products that are on the European market since at least 30 years. ESCOP monographs are more pragmatic, since these take into account all the evidences, without time and geographical limits. Let us take milk thistle as an example. The standardized extract of this (silymarin) is available all over Europe as hepatoprotective medicine, its efficacy is proven by several studies, but according to EMA the only indication is: &quot;Traditional herbal medicinal product for the symptomatic relief of digestive disorders, sensation of fullness and indigestion and to support the liver function, after serious conditions have been excluded by a medical doctor.&quot; (https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-monograph/final-european-union-herbal-monograph-silybum-marianum-l-gaertn-fructus_en.pdf) Do we really think that this reflects the real therapeutic use?

 provides key terms guiding choice of quality sources for medical content that should apply to the phytotherapy literature: 1) prevailing scientific consensus (by reputable experts grounded in evidence-based medicine), 2) rigorous well-designed and conducted randomized controlled trials (RCTs), as required for approval of prescription drugs, 3) applying skepticism about disreputable journals, fields, and traditional medicine practices, which collectively represent quackery, among other examples.

Csupord then claims that &quot;silymarin is available all over Europe as hepatoprotective medicine, its efficacy is proven by several studies&quot;, but there is no MEDSCI source that would support that conclusion, but rather the opposite: 1) [https://nccih.nih.gov/health/milkthistle/ataglance.htm no benefit, no effect on liver inflammation]; 2) [https://www.drugs.com/mtm/milk-thistle.html silymarin should be avoided for its side effects and potentially adverse interaction with prescribed drugs;] 3) [https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003620.pub3/full a 2007 Cochrane review] stated there was no evidence for liver effects of silymarin; 4) [https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/herbal-monograph/final-european-union-herbal-monograph-silybum-marianum-l-gaertn-fructus_en.pdf the 2018 EMA position statement on it] shows there are no &quot;well-established uses&quot;, and 5) Drugs.com says there is [https://www.drugs.com/mtm/milk-thistle.html no evidence that &quot;milk thistle is effective in treating any medical condition. Medicinal use of this product has not been approved by the FDA. Milk thistle should not be used in place of prescribed medication&quot;]. There is no quality evidence or consensus of clinical experts supporting its use. 

Nor will there be to the satisfaction of regulatory agencies like EMA or the FDA: silymarin (a seed extract) and similar &quot;phytotherapies&quot; cannot be financed for sufficient pivotal RCTs because such research programs are prohibitively expensive and the compound is unpatentable, leaving the research sponsor no protection of intellectual property for its investment.

Third Man factor

We don’t really have an active science or skepticism board, and since this topic should fall under the general category of medicine, I’m hoping someone can take a quick look.  

While working on cleaning up various articles about Ernest Shackleton and the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition from the early 20th century, I noticed a see also link to Third Man factor from the Shackleton article, based on his personal experiences detailed in the memoir, South.

Looking at third man factor, I’m afraid that there is more of an emphasis on religion and the paranormal than there is on medical explanations for this alleged phenomenon.  I’m wondering if someone here can try to fix that based on the most recent research.  I always thought this was related to hypnogogic hallucinations from brain hypoxia, but there might be other causes involved.  I’ve heard similar anecdotes and experiences stemming from high fevers, as well as intoxication caused by accidental ingestion of plants in the family Solanaceae.  The article on oneirogen indirectly points in this direction.

Whatever the medical reasons for this experience, I’m fairly sure there is a better redirect, preferably one under the umbrella of the medicine project. Viriditas (talk) 22:15, 29 January 2020 (UTC)
Update - based on the literature, I would like to propose that the article should be moved to sensed presence effect, with any discussion of spirituality or the paranormal relegated to prescientific, historical background reference. Viriditas (talk) 23:11, 29 January 2020 (UTC)
Note, I’ve found the parent topic at its historical synonym, Anomalous_experiences#Sense_of_presence, and I’ve placed merger notices with a centralized link to this discussion. Viriditas (talk) 23:30, 29 January 2020 (UTC)
Are you looking for ?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:07, 30 January 2020 (UTC)
I just don’t think that project or the psychology project is all that active.  If you accept that [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/isolated-psychosis-during-exposure-to-very-high-and-extreme-altitude-characterisation-of-a-new-medical-entity/C2BCDEDCB0C6415B16531008857D730C/core-reader psychology is a branch of medicine], then wouldn’t it be appropriate for this project to address the issue?  I can briefly summarize it for you:

1.  The article subject term, Third Man factor, was invented by author John G. Geiger and used in several of his books and media works.
2.  The subject of Third Man factor duplicates an already existing topic that is authoritatively sourced at Anomalous_experiences#Sense_of_presence.
3.  I’ve placed a merge on the former term pointing to the latter. 

Thanks. Viriditas (talk) 20:16, 30 January 2020 (UTC)
Psychology is distinct from the related branch of medicine, Psychiatry; psychosis is a symptom that can be studied by Psychologists and Psychiatrists. Then again, perhaps this is just dancing on the head of a pin. Klbrain (talk) 10:35, 31 January 2020 (UTC)

We don’t really have an active science or skepticism board, and since this topic should fall under the general category of medicine, I’m hoping someone can take a quick look.  

While working on cleaning up various articles about Ernest Shackleton and the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition from the early 20th century, I noticed a see also link to Third Man factor from the Shackleton article, based on his personal experiences detailed in the memoir, South.

Looking at third man factor, I’m afraid that there is more of an emphasis on religion and the paranormal than there is on medical explanations for this alleged phenomenon.  I’m wondering if someone here can try to fix that based on the most recent research.  I always thought this was related to hypnogogic hallucinations from brain hypoxia, but there might be other causes involved.  I’ve heard similar anecdotes and experiences stemming from high fevers, as well as intoxication caused by accidental ingestion of plants in the family Solanaceae.  The article on oneirogen indirectly points in this direction.

Whatever the medical reasons for this experience, I’m fairly sure there is a better redirect, preferably one under the umbrella of the medicine project. Viriditas (talk) 22:15, 29 January 2020 (UTC)
Update - based on the literature, I would like to propose that the article should be moved to sensed presence effect, with any discussion of spirituality or the paranormal relegated to prescientific, historical background reference. Viriditas (talk) 23:11, 29 January 2020 (UTC)

I can briefly summarize it for you:

1.  The article subject term, Third Man factor, was invented by author John G. Geiger and used in several of his books and media works.
2.  The subject of Third Man factor duplicates an already existing topic that is authoritatively sourced at Anomalous_experiences#Sense_of_presence.
3.  I’ve placed a merge on the former term pointing to the latter.

Hello, I am one of the organizers for the SWASTHA project. I was not expecting that news piece and was planning on a later presentation to WikiProject Medicine, but I can preview it now. Yes, the goal is to apply the  model to about 10 English language article to translate them in about 10 languages of India. The project has three parts: managing the Wikipedia content development and translation; documenting a methodology for any expert organization to contribute content development labor to Wikipedia projects; and documenting ethical considerations when anyone adapts English language medical information to a language where many users are less empowered in Wikipedia or otherwise.

I am not expecting disruption of English Wikipedia but I have lightly drafted a couple of articles which are a bit unusual:
*Neglected tropical diseases in India
*Maternal mortality in India

Wikipedia has always had challenges with intersectional articles. For the NTDs, we already have diagnosis, treatment, prevention, etc content in the main articles for each disease. That means that if there is an NTD India article, it should not repeat much, and instead should say what is different about India.

Regarding translation, the challenge is that if we adapt these for Hindi, we have to produce original content which removes Western bias from the core medical articles and probably replace it with bias for the region of Hindi speakers. This requires producing some original content, and we have no established methodology to present to organizations like universities which would want language students and medical students to collaborate on this. 

This is what I have for now. Thanks for raising it. I will probably have more to show and be open for general feedback in a few months. Thanks.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 16:37, 21 January 2020 (UTC)

Eek! When you say &quot;removes Western bias&quot; in this context the alarm bells on my Ayurvedic and homeopathic woo detectors all start sounding.  Please tell us that they just intend to correct issues of focus, rather than to &quot;balance&quot; coverage of evidence-based medicine with traditional. Official India is all too willing to support AYUSH in the absence of good evidence. LeadSongDog come howl! 17:54, 21 January 2020 (UTC)
 This project has a foundation in the standard of quality of English Wikipedia. Discussion about Ayurvedic content  is outside the scope of what I plan to do. Anyone can edit Wikipedia and I am unable to say what anyone might do in India, which is a big country with lots of editors.
I will show some Western bias, which would be easy to spot in lots of places. Look at the lead of Tuberculosis. In the Western World TB is a concern as a co-morbidity with HIV/AIDS. For India, HIV has a much lower incidence than in the Western world, so perhaps we omit HIV and instead talk about co-morbidity with a disease which is common in India. The English lead suggests vaccination for as a choice for people who live or work with people with TB and rarely children, but in India, the at-risk group includes young children. In English articles like TB we frequently include United States epidemiology in the lead, but for Hindi language, another comparison could be more meaningful. The English article mentions &quot;consumption&quot; as an old name, and if we sent this to a translator they might try to translate that, but I know that it would be better to just strike English language historical terms.
Most English Wikipedia articles will have these kinds of Western bias and it takes some planning to identify and adapt this kind of text for translation. If you can think of a clever way of how and where to document the identification of this kind of cultural specificity then I would appreciate your advice. If &quot;Western bias&quot; is a term that puts you off, what should we call this kind of editing before translation?  Blue Rasberry (talk) 22:18, 21 January 2020 (UTC)
&quot;Western focus&quot; maybe? I see where you're coming from but I think &quot;Western bias&quot; makes it sound like these articles are slanted in a way that violates NPOV. The examples you mention above aren't really NPOV issues, it's more of an editorial decision to focus on things that are likely to be relevant to English-speakers, versus focusing on things that would be relevant to Hindi-speakers when writing in Hindi. ♠PMC♠ (talk) 22:48, 21 January 2020 (UTC)
Talking more about Western geography than India in that article probably is a straight-up violation of NPOV, of the  variety.  There are more TB patients just in the city of Mumbai than in the entire United States and Canada combined.  A neutral article might include English-language content (like the old name of consumption), but it would have geographically fair content, which means Indian statistics in preference to any other country.  Other countries might be included, too, but India should be the headline for tuberculosis.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:54, 22 January 2020 (UTC)
 Thanks for allaying the AYUSH concern, but  should give English-language readers a global perspective on the global subject. We already have  to give English-language readers a global perspective on localized subject matter (though it clearly needs some attention). WAID is right that the parent article does need globalization. However, if the goal is to match subject localization to the reader, then  should change the article being chosen for translation, not mangle the translation process.

Mutation vs Variant

There is some disagreement on whether using &quot;mutation&quot; is acceptable when describing a rare change in DNA that results in a disorder (in this case CDK13-related disorder) or whether we should require the use of the less offensive &quot;variant&quot;. This has come up by way of a GA review that can be found at . I have found no discussions concerning this issue here, at the MCB wikiproject or the NPOV noticeboard page so do not know what the consensus on this is or if it has even come up before. As it could potentially effect multiple articles it feels more prudent to discuss it here than at a review page.  who were involved in the review. AIRcorn (talk) 02:11, 1 February 2020 (UTC)
 Both terms are used in clinical practice and mean different things. A mutation is a change in DNA. A variant is a DNA sequence that is different from a chosen reference. Mutations can cause variants to appear in a genomic assay, but not vice versa. We speak of nonsense mutations, but not nonsense variants. And so son. They really are not interchangable, so which term to use depends on the context and intended purpose.--{{u|Mark viking}} {Talk} 04:01, 1 February 2020 (UTC)
 That is very true. An event vs. a state. · • SUM1 • · (talk) 04:41, 1 February 2020 (UTC)
I really like the idea that mutation = event, variant = state; when I am king, I will mandate that everyone uses this precise and unambiguous nomenclature.  Until then, I'll note that it's common for &quot;mutation&quot; to refer to the outcome of the event (i.e., the state), rather than the event itself. This can be verified by Googling &quot;has a mutation&quot; or &quot;found a mutation&quot;. Adrian J. Hunter(talk•) 01:43, 5 February 2020 (UTC)
See also [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4502642/ this] article in BMC Medical Genomics, linked by EllenCT at the GA discussion.

Hunter(talk•) 01:55, 5 February 2020 (UTC)
 Maybe you misunderstood that I was actually in support of retaining the use of mutation on Wikipedia. My comment was a defence against those trying to say you can't say a genetic condition is caused by a mutation, when the fact the word even more so refers to an event than variant does means there's even more reason to use it.

 I don't think this is necessary. Both mutant and allele mention mutation in the first sentence, and &quot;mutant&quot; is much less used than &quot;mutation&quot; (there's no point pointing worried parents to the page for &quot;mutant&quot; at the top of the article for &quot;mutation&quot;).

Wrt Klbrain citing , this policy is rarely cited appropriately. The policy links to the guideline  and specifically  is relevant: . Editors should always take care not to cause gratuitous offence, and consider (as the OP did) whether alternative language is desirable, suitable, etc. On the article talk page, a [https://www.acmg.net/docs/Standards_Guidelines_for_the_Interpretation_of_Sequence_Variants.pdf standards proposal was cited] and to me is evidence of academic writers trying to use language that avoids prejudice or preconceived ideas of what words mean (even if they do not). Readers will bring ideas of &quot;normal&quot; vs&quot; not normal&quot; when we use a word like &quot;mutant&quot;, which for some article topics could be a problem. -- Colin°Talk 13:27, 6 February 2020 (UTC)
Good point Colin. You made me think. I call viruses mutants often as in temperature sensitive mutant. But I would not dream of using the word to describe anything much larger than a fruit fly. Graham Beards (talk) 13:56, 6 February 2020 (UTC)
To return, therefore, to mutation versus variant. Mutation has as precise and well-understood meaning in genetic, for which which variant is not an appropriate replacement. Therefore, omitting mutation would make make many articles less informative and accurate. Klbrain (talk) 00:59, 7 February 2020 (UTC)
This might be something that needs to be solved with good writing.  We should always use the word correctly (and we probably don't, in some articles), and it may need an explanation.  We don't want readers to be thinking about fictional superhero mutations, and some (most?) of our readers will know more about comic books than about genetics.

MEDRS at Race and intelligence

 Thanks, I'm familiar with the policy. Just trying to clarify whether claims of a genetic connection between race and intelligence are considered biomedical information. –dlthewave ☎ 02:21, 7 February 2020 (UTC)
I tend to think of biomedical information as knowledge derived from clinical trials / prospective studies / epidemiological and laboratory-based studies etc. that study treatments, causes, and courses of diseases. So I'd think not. That said, we'd want any scientifically-based article to be using the highest-quality scientific information. Biosthmors (talk) 02:38, 7 February 2020 (UTC)
Also, dlthewave, for what it's worth, after a quick scan of the article, it does appear to be more of a sociology-, culture-, and history-based article. This can occur with scientific concepts. The article title of societal and cultural aspects of Tourette syndrome, for example, makes the intent of that article explicit. Right now I'd argue there's tension between what one might think is the focus of the article (I went to the article just wanting to see the current scientific consensus) with what is the actual focus. A more accurate title would be something like Societal, cultural, and historical aspects of the race and intelligence debate, in my opinion. Biosthmors (talk) 02:54, 7 February 2020 (UTC)
The current scientific consensus is that &quot;race&quot; is a social construct. &quot;Race&quot; is not science. Any article about race is perforce about societal, cultural and historical aspects. Bondegezou (talk) 09:47, 8 February 2020 (UTC)
 It's true that race is a social construct, a label imposed by one social group by another. However, once you start hypothesising about the traits that you believe are associated with a racial group, you move into the territory of phenotypes and inevitably into the field of genetics, as the article Race and genetics discusses quite cogently. That is science, and not only that, but medicine as well. There is no doubt that the sort of fringe theories under discussion at the article nominated for deletion require MEDRS sourcing every time they allude to a connection between a trait such as intelligence and a racial group. There's no way that primary sourcing is good enough to support any such inferences. --RexxS (talk) 18:50, 8 February 2020 (UTC)

My question was intended to elicit information. Unfortunately your response has not provided what I was looking for. · · · Peter Southwood (talk): 08:47, 10 February 2020 (UTC)
Because not all traits have any &quot;medical&quot; aspect?  For example, eye color is determined by genes, and eye color is a lot more complicated than brown/green/blue.  Some people have a dark blue ring around the iris, for example.  I get the &quot;bio&quot; part of that, but where's the &quot;medical&quot; part?  Having that trait has no association with any health condition.  I conclude therefore that it's not a &quot;biomedical&quot; subject.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 20:12, 9 February 2020 (UTC)
 So by your reasoning, it would be acceptable to use primary sources to source a claim about a link between a particular phenotype and race unless that phenotype could be shown to have health implications, when secondary sources would be required? I just want to be certain of the route you're going down. --RexxS (talk) 00:20, 10 February 2020 (UTC)
Where does  make this assertion? Alternatively, since you punctuate this as a question, which statements by WAID lead you to this tentative conclusion? · · · Peter Southwood (talk): 09:23, 10 February 2020 (UTC)
In addition to what RexxS stated, human intelligence does fall under the topic of neuroscience, which is why the talk page for the Human intelligence article is tagged with .

A statement of  should fall under WP:MEDRS, not the whole content of an article if it just happens to contain some biomedical claims. · · · Peter Southwood (talk): 09:23, 10 February 2020 (UTC)

We seem to be talking about different things, so let's back up and try for some factual statements.  Does anyone disagree with any of these?
#  says that &quot;All article topics must be verifiable with independent, third-party sources&quot;.  The word all in this sentence means all, as in &quot;every single one, without exception, regardless of whether you're writing about a professor or a film or a controversial subject&quot;.
#  says that &quot;Articles must be based on reliable, independent, published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy.&quot;  This, too, is &quot;must&quot;, as in [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119 RFC 2119], an absolute requirement.
#  says that &quot;Wikipedia articles should be based on reliable, published secondary sources and, to a lesser extent, on tertiary sources and primary sources.&quot;  This, again, is the standard for every single article, without exception.  No article should be based primarily on primary sources.
#  applies to .  Specifically, it applies to biomedical information in any article, regardless of whether the main subject of the article is biomedical in nature, and regardless of whether that article happens to be of interest to any given .

Assuming we agree upon these statements, then I think I can answer the questions above and forestall some others:

* I believe that most of the content (e.g., at least a physical majority of readable prose) in all articles, including this one, should come from, and be cited to, secondary sources.
* I believe that most of the content in all articles, including this one, should come from, and be cited to, independent sources.  (Remember that .)
* I believe that all content about controversial subjects, including this one, should get an  level of sourcing.  This means that I want to see not just more than the average number of citations per sentence, but also a higher proportion of secondary sources than usual, near-exclusive use of independent sources, and an even higher quality of sources than usual (e.g., more scholarly books published by academics, and fewer news articles).
* I believe that only a fraction of the content in this article is biomedical information, and that therefore only a fraction of the content in this article requires MEDRS-style sourcing.  Some biomedical information is found, for example, in the Race and intelligence#Health and nutrition section, but not in most of the others.
** There is a difference between &quot;involves biology&quot; and &quot;is biomedical&quot;.  Involving biology is a necessary but not sufficient factor for MEDRS to apply.
** There is also a difference between &quot;is heritable&quot; and &quot;is genetic&quot;.
** Hint:  If you think &quot;doesn't require MEDRS&quot; is a code phrase for &quot;any old primary is okay with her&quot;, then you did not read what I have written (here, or any of the other many times over the last many years).  If, on the other hand, you think &quot;Oh, noes, she thinks we shouldn't have so many articles about people and businesses and products, because I can't source half an encyclopedia article about some of them to anything except their employers' (or manufacturers') websites!&quot;, then well, you're probably right about that.

Proposal to remove gender bias from WP:MEDMOS

Dear colleagues,

it has come to my attention from a recent study that there is still a long way to go to fix gender bias in Wikipedia's health information.

One of the important aspects is that  discourages, or does not mention, the potential psychological or emotional impact of certain medical conditions. We likely treat this too much from a narrow, medical perspective whereas readers on certain topics (as was mentioned in this recent study, e.g. abortion, menopause, vaginal dryness, but also cancer etc.) are likely interested in emotional and psychological impact too.

I will open an RfC at the talk page: . I propose to treat this of course like any other aspect according to standard policies such as reliable sources, but I'm sure that for many of these aspects there is a wealth of research on the personal, emotional and psychological impact of diseases.

I would value your input on this important discussion (call cross-posted at WP:Women's Health).

--Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 10:07, 9 February 2020 (UTC)

 and I have looked at women's health versus men's health and we found based on a number of markers women's health coverage is better. 
Of course covering emotional / psychological impact when good sources are avaliable is perfectly reasonable. Would either go under signs and symptoms or prognosis. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 01:26, 10 February 2020 (UTC)
This is based on a count of the total number of women's health articles (like cervical cancer and contraceptives), and not based on content, like whether Cardiovascular disease mentions pregnancy at all (it doesn't), or whether the differences between males and females in terms of their pathophysiology, treatment, and other areas are adequately described in Myocardial infarction, right?  I don't have a great solution to the problem of presenting men's MI symptoms as the 'normal' ones and women's symptoms being relegated to a Separate but equal section, but surely we can all agree that pregnancy ought to be mentioned more than once on the page, and that other factors such as poverty or being of African or Asian descent should be mentioned at least once in those articles.  We can do better than this.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 21:05, 10 February 2020 (UTC)

Citation Template Woes

Am I the only one frustrated with citation templates? It seems they almost always include superfluous information, e.g., stating it's an English-language journal or including the ISBN for a journal, and at least one field always needs correction, e.g., the date format is wrong, or authors' first and last names are transposed. ¶ I am not a programmer (far from it!), so I have no idea how difficult it is to create a citation template. I imagine it's not easy. So please don't take this as a diatribe against the hard-working Wikipedians who create templates, which by and large make our work much easier. ¶ This is mainly a reality check for me. I find myself frequently copying an easy-to-produce citation from Google Scholar, PubMed, or Zotero and pasting it into Cite &gt; manual &gt; basic form, which is not a perfect solution because it loses many of the automatic hyperlinks the citation templates provide. But it's much faster than manually typing every author's first and last name and all the other data into Cite &gt; manual &gt; journal. I am open to suggestions. :) Thanks!   - Mark D Worthen PsyD (talk) (I'm a man—traditional male pronouns are fine.) 22:39, 9 February 2020 (UTC)

  I wouldn't worry too much about superfluous fields. Some wiki-gnome will come along and fix those. For your own use, you might want to try out this tool that generates a citation from a PubMedID, PMCID, etc:

 I rather like [https://reftag.appspot.com/doiweb.py?doi= this DOI-based citation generator]. SpicyMilkBoy (talk) 22:52, 9 February 2020 (UTC)
 Marielle's magical  tool is one of the wonders of this wiki-age, even if it's never going to be perfect. Every time one website's description is fixed, another one rearranges its website. Most uses are from the URL, including for books (e.g., the Google Books URL) and journal articles (e.g., the PubMed URL). You can use some identifiers directly. ISBNs (most journals ought to be giving you an ISSN, not an ISBN) depend upon the WorldCat folks, who seem to have settled on down-casing titles and using French spacing in titles, which is common in libraries but isn't my preference. PMIDs all go through PubMed and are consistent with what we're used to (and we like what we're used to).

Opinions are needed on the following: . This is the result of an editor having tried to remove  and  from the Gender dysphoria article. I [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gender_dysphoria&amp;diff=939360403&amp;oldid=939309787 reverted], stating, &quot;It should still be there as a matter of helping readers find this topic. The term [gender identity disorder] is still prominent as a historical name and redirects here. It's mentioned and bolded per . We might need to consider renaming the category.&quot; I also [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gender_dysphoria&amp;diff=939361076&amp;oldid=939360403 noted] that the ICD-11 will not come into effect until 2022. As for the ICD-10, editors can refer to [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gender_dysphoria&amp;oldid=939837327#Diagnosis this] section of the Gender dysphoria article. Later, Crossroads also [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gender_dysphoria&amp;diff=939398027&amp;oldid=939393023 reverted] removal of the categories. As seen [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gender_dysphoria&amp;diff=939519723&amp;oldid=939519113 here], I then took the time to comment, &quot; states 'should generally be uncontroversial.' 'Generally' (as in not always). We can't stop the fact that some categories will be controversial. And there is the fact that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders still has the title that it does and is defined the way it's defined in sources.&quot;

By mentioning the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders title, I was stating that gender dysphoria is still in a manual about disorders and is still considered a medical condition. Regardless of the DSM-5 renaming the condition to remove the word disorder to reduce stigma, the condition still technically falls under the definition of a mental disorder or psychiatric disorder (if one prefers the latter term) because of the distress involved. Also see the &quot;Definition&quot; section of the Mental disorder article. What other medical categorization do we have for it? We have  and . It's in those categories as well. Is it sufficient to just have them in those categories? Simply calling it a &quot;condition&quot; or &quot;medical condition&quot; is vague. A proposal to split &quot;Sexual disorder&quot; and &quot;Gender identity disorder&quot; might be considered sound. After all, we already have . But I question letting  stand in place of  and Category:Gender identity disorders. I know that &quot;Category:Gender identity disorders&quot; doesn't exist. Also, the Gender dysphoria article is already in Category:Gender identity. Flyer22 Frozen (talk) 00:29, 11 February 2020 (UTC)

&quot;... ICD-11 will not come into effect until 2022.&quot; - WHO is not consistent about the ICD-11 &quot;effective date&quot;. For example, the [https://icd.who.int/docs/ICD-11%20Implementation%20or%20Transition%20Guide_v105.pdf ICD-11 Implementation or Transition Guide] (p. 1) states, &quot;ICD11 is now available for implementation, following its adoption at the World Health Assembly on 25 May 2019....&quot; In addition, even if we assume that ICD-11 &quot;comes into effect&quot; on 1 Jan 2022, that fact does not make ICD-11 content meaningless until then.   - Mark D Worthen PsyD (talk) (I'm a man—traditional male pronouns are fine.) 23:09, 14 February 2020 (UTC)
Never stated or implied that it is meaningless. We, however, shouldn't be putting the cart before the horse. Is WP:Med updating all of its medical articles to the ICD-11 when the ICD-11 has been stated to not come into effect until 2022? Flyer22 Frozen (talk) 23:56, 14 February 2020 (UTC)

People can't math

(But we still need to put numbers in articles.)

 recommended this book:

 

to me a little while ago, and I have borrowed it from the library.  I haven't gotten very far, but so far, I like it.

In chapter one, Spiegelhalter talks about data presentation.  Cancer outcomes in the UK are presented in terms of survival (50% live!).  Cancer outcomes in the US are presented in terms of mortality (50% die!).  Both are correct, and math adept folks will recognize that it's exactly the same.

But it's not quite the same once you leave the world of mathematics.  People feel more optimistic when they're told the survival percentage than the mortality percentage.  And they feel worse if you tell them that more than 56 million people died in 2015 (so many people died!), than if you tell them that 0.9% of the world's population did (why, almost nobody died!).

Just mimicking a chosen source's framing isn't &quot;being neutral&quot;.  It can also be abdicating responsibility for tone, and therefore for the neutrality of the Wikipedia article.  I don't think that's our best option.  Additionally, with the major stats coming from sources that have defined, for their own (sometimes political) reasons, a particular style used consistently, the word usage there does not necessarily reflect anything more meaningful than the geographic location of the author or publisher. 

I remember suggesting once that some people are so bad at basic arithmetic that we should consider writing both sides of the equation for them:  &quot;60% of people with this cancer will survive at least five years, and 40% will die within five years&quot;, or &quot;60% of people will die, and 40% will survive&quot;.  Having read this, I'm now thinking that we should, at a minimum, write whichever side is larger:  &quot;60% of people will survive&quot; or &quot;60% of people will die&quot;, but specifically not just the minority outcome.  What do you think?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 06:16, 13 February 2020 (UTC)

I am open to logical persuasion, but my first thought was that it would depend on what we were talking about. A success rate might be more appropriate when discussing a treatment, and a death rate might be more suitable for a disease. I accept that there are people out there who do not understand what percentage means. I have seen in real life a group of people trying to explain to a person the 0.2 and 20% are the same thing, without success, and two of them were professionals in adult education. My take from that is that there will always be people who don't get it. The other problem is that a some people do not get that a 60% chance of survival does not mean that you are going to be one of the 60% just because it is the bigger number, or that the published statistics often do not mention fairly important demographic conditions, and that risk can vary a lot depending on who you are. · · · Peter Southwood (talk): 07:43, 13 February 2020 (UTC)
The scary one was the paper that reported on giving qualified, practicing, doctors similar tests. About 5 years ago.  Some did well, but eeek! Johnbod (talk) 16:53, 13 February 2020 (UTC) 
I'm not sure writing the larger number is the algorithm to use. Sure if you had a cure that worked 95% of the time, that sounds wonderful. If we compared your drug's 95% cure rate with my drug's 95% failure rate, people might be confused and better to compare 95% with 5%. Peter makes a good point about treatment vs disease. For disease prevalence, morbidity or mortality it is probably better to use the rate of occurrence. It would seem odd to say that 98.% of people won't get X in their lifetime, without good reason for wanting to put it like that.
How does using absolute numbers compare with percentages. Is it better to say 6 out of every 10 patients with X will survive 5 years, than to say 60% of patients? I have a feeling people can understand absolute number better than percentages, decimal fractions, ratios and odds. It works even better when we are discussing the change in risk, such as 6 people out of 10,000 will get X but if they drink Y regularly then the risk rises to 7 out of 10,000 people. IIRC the book also discusses presenting absolute risk vs relative risk (see [https://academic.oup.com/ndt/article/32/suppl_2/ii13/3056571 this article for example]).  -- Colin°Talk 12:12, 13 February 2020 (UTC)
Yes, I learned in a clinical genetics lecture that &quot;people are gamblers, not accountants&quot;, meaning that people interpret 6 out of 10 better than 60%.
The same lecturer said clinical geneticists should always give both sides in the manner WAID suggests.  Apparently it's normal for a conversation to go &quot;A woman of your age has a 1 in 20 chance of giving birth to a child with a significant disorder&quot; — *GASP!* — &quot;and a 19 in 20 chance of giving birth to a healthy child&quot; —  *Oh, whew!* What this means for Wikipedia, I'm not sure.  Adrian J. Hunter(talk•) 21:51, 13 February 2020 (UTC)
I think the &quot;6 out of every 10 patients&quot; is common.  I've sometimes wished for a template or something that would show those numbers in picture form.  Imagine it assembling 10 stick-figure people, color-coded to represent some situation, something vaguely like this:

It would need multiple colors, so you could show things like &quot;Will survive, will survive with treatment, will die even with excellent treatment&quot;.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 23:54, 13 February 2020 (UTC)
I wonder if one's reaction to numbers depends on whether you are a glass-half-full sort of person or a glass-half-empty:-) -- Colin°Talk 09:53, 14 February 2020 (UTC)
There's been discussion in the scientific literature about the best way to do this. Having all the affected people at one end is misleading and it has been suggested that you should randomly scatter affected cases throughout the non-affected cases. The choice of stick-figure icon is also an issue. Better that it's a gender neutral one unless there's a particular reason otherwise. Bondegezou (talk) 11:18, 15 February 2020 (UTC)

we are discussing this proposal right now at:

Please feel free to let me know.

*Would you be interested in an idea of this nature? 
*If so, which option below seems most feasible to you?

Help with MEDRS-related decisions

I'm developing a script (see below) designed to highlight blacklisted/deprecated/generally unreliable/predatory/questionable sources in citations and elsewhere. Amongst other things is the need to highlight possible-dodgy-but-not-garanteed-awful citations. Note that this isn't a script to remove anything, simply to highlight potential issues. For instance, arxiv/biorxiv/etc. preprints, links to ResearchGate/Academia.edu, and so on, which will often by just fine, but also sometimes contains predatory publications, preprints, self-published nonsense, and the like. That part is working pretty well.

However there's another part which is more grey area, and it's sources that will often fail , but which might be otherwise be acceptable for more routine information. Typical examples of this grey area would be Frontiers Media and MDPI publications. Currently, on , there's a couple of venues that have been listed on Beall's list, but which aren't OMICS Publishing Group-levels of garbage. Those include publications that Beall removed from his list, and those that probably fit the 'questionable' more than the 'predatory' label. Those include
*MDPI
*Frontiers Media
*Hindawi Publishing Corporation
*Medknow Publications
*Bentham Science Publishers (or rather Bentham Open, which my script cannot distinguish from non-open Bentham)
*Dove Medical Press
*Baishideng Publishing Group
*Frontiers in Bioscience

So my question is, should all of those be flagged as sources that should be evaluated against ? Or should I omit a couple of the above?  Headbomb {t ·  ·  · } 06:22, 14 February 2020 (UTC)
 I welcome this kind of innovation and think that WikiProject Medicine participants have had many discussions in this space over the years. You have competency to make the tools and I want you to keep doing that. I appreciate that you have compiled a first list of journals to flag. Now that you have a model for how technical tool development meets social decisions, I think it should be the place of WikiProject Medicine to take this list out of your control and maintain it elsewhere, probably on its own Wikipedia page, and probably integrated with other existing services to evaluate the reliability of sources. There are multiple wikiprojects which would be interested in maintaining the list. 
Jeffrey Beall compiled such a list of unreliable journals but when a hundred thousand people were watching, he took it down without comment. Everyone knows that the takedown meant that a corporation put legal pressure on him as an individual for producing a journal evaluation system which reported their publication as unreliable. Wikipedia has a precedent of identifying some journals as having quality standards below the level of acceptability in Wikipedia. We also know that by identifying journals as being of unacceptably low quality, we come into conflict with the business model and revenue stream of the corporation publishing the journal. I think we should take a clue from Jeffrey Beall's experience and keep a Wikipedia list of low-quality publications in its own place, under crowdsourced maintenance, and use the public and transparent Wikipedia editorial process to place and keep publications on the list. Whereas Beall somehow got in the position of having to talk to publishers and others in backchannels to defend his decision to list them as unreliable, in Wikipedia, we have the option to commit only to have public conversation about reliability judgments. By being open and transparent, our process should establish consensus and create records of evidence and leave no option for corporations to negotiate with fear tactics or to use money to gain non-objective privileges.
To do this, I think the next step would be to have a stand-alone list of sources on some page, then curate that list like we do with any list. Thoughts?  Blue Rasberry (talk) 15:50, 14 February 2020 (UTC)

 Conflicting evidence: does biological half-life of medication varies with the route of administration? 

#
#: It's important to know the half-life of a drug is the same regardless of the route of administration. This is because the half-life is a property of a drug, not a route.

Which source is correct? 

Thanks!

--Recap&amp;perforate (talk) 14:46, 20 February 2020 (UTC)

I haven't found a good source (and neither of these are good sources).
I wonder if it might depend upon how it's eliminated.  I can imagine a short half-life, eliminated via excretion through the kidneys, being different if it's PO or IM vs IV, because the drug in the IV case can go straight out the kidneys, but in the oral or IM versions has to first get absorbed into the bloodstream.  I wouldn't expect this to be as significant a factor if the liver is involved (because in that case, availability of enzymes is more likely to be the rate-limiting factor).  WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:40, 20 February 2020 (UTC)
Depends a lot upon how a drug is distributed, metabolized, and eliminated, but if half-life does differ by RoA for a drug, it will also have different half-lives in different fluid compartments (e.g., plasma vs cerebrospinal fluid). Seppi333 (Insert 2¢) 21:11, 20 February 2020 (UTC)
  I can point you to a good example, with MEDRS sourcing, that demonstrates that the YouTube video is talking complete bollocks.

*Heroin and clindamycin, for example, have multiple routes of administration with identical elimination half-lives. --Recap&amp;perforate (talk) 06:00, 21 February 2020 (UTC)
I think that the much of the confusion here arises because of the differences in what researchers and clinicians are measuring; for example, whether half-life from the time of administration, post-absorption or post-distribution. Notice that the many of those sources use the concept of terminal half-life (the half-life measured after absorption and distribution, the first two parts of ADME); it is this measurement which is independent of the route of administration. Attempting to measure a half-life earlier runs into the problem that the kinetics don't follow exponential decay, and so the half-life depends on other factors including the dose and route of administration; during this period the half-life isn't constant, so isn't a reliable concept. So, terminal half-life is constant is a relatively safe statement. Klbrain (talk) 07:52, 21 February 2020 (UTC)
* Many drugs have identical half-lives regardless of route of administration.  Some don't.
* For all drugs, regardless of what the half-life for that route of administration is (minutes?  hours?  days?), and regardless of what the dose is (a typical dose?  a tenth of that?  ten times the typical dose?) [but, see the caveat about first-order processes], four or five half-lives gets it out of your body.
* Using the oxytocin example, this means that it's out of your body in 15 minutes if it was delivered via IV (5 × the three-minute half life for IV), in 10 to 20 hours if was delivered intranasally (5 × the 2–4 hour half liife for IN).  WhatamIdoing (talk) 19:27, 21 February 2020 (UTC)

 That's not what it says at all. &quot;Although debated (Freedman et al. 2012), some studies indicate that the divorce rate for parents of children with ASD is twice as high as the rate for parents of [typically developing] children (Hartley et al. 2011).&quot;  Adrian J. Hunter(talk•) 05:41, 22 February 2020 (UTC)
Thanks!  Perhaps Hartley is the source of the oft-repeated but never-cited claim that 80% of parents with autistic children get divorced (with people assuming divorce rate, which is around 40% in the US, is the actual chance of a divorce, which it isn't; it's the ratio of all marriages registered to all divorces granted in a given time period).  WhatamIdoing (talk) 06:06, 22 February 2020 (UTC)
The Hartley et al. 2010 primary paper has . Its from a longitudinal study presenting results from 391 families, baseline data in 1994-1996, then followup in 2004-2006. So, the 40% to 80% extrapolation would be a very long bow to draw. Klbrain (talk) 10:27, 22 February 2020 (UTC)
Especially given that 23.5% is only a 70% increase above 13.8%, hardly &quot;twice as high&quot;. Adrian J. Hunter(talk•) 11:46, 22 February 2020 (UTC)

Could we turn this into a statement about parental divorce?  There's a paragraph at Autism that begins &quot;Parents of children with ASD have higher levels of stress&quot;, and I think it would fit into this.
I don't suppose that we know the &quot;real&quot; answer, because there have been so few studies, and they're limited.  You would have to take into account the chance of divorce among adults with autism (because many parents of autistic children are on the autism spectrum themselves), which might not be the same as the chance of divorce for a neurotypical couple, or for a childless couple, but I'd like to have a suitable statement in the article, e.g., &quot;Studies have produced conflicting results, but parents of autistic children in the US probably have a somewhat higher chance of getting divorced than parents of neurotypical children.&quot;  WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:38, 22 February 2020 (UTC)
I'd reduce the equivocation and qualifiers; all knowledge is imperfect, and so all statements on Wikipedia are subject to revision/uncertainty and should be read in that manner without the need for such qualifiers. I'd delete probably and somewhat, but (as you suggest), not include a number for that increase; include the relevant reference(s), of course. Klbrain (talk) 11:42, 23 February 2020 (UTC)

Some folks here have a long history of rejecting sources because of the journal's , and more recently, we're seeing editors remove content and sources because other journals handled by the same publishing house have attracted criticism.  We're not really in a position to cast any stones in this area.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 19:34, 21 February 2020 (UTC)

Hi , based on my own understanding of DORA, the goal is not necessarily to cast stones, but to encourage academic institutions to value areas of research output in addition to the traditional model of publishing ones findings. This could be interpreted in a way that allows academic researchers, particularly those pursuing tenure, to list all the outputs of their work rather than just their academic publications. It provides a fuller picture of a researcher's contributions to scholarly communication and their broader influence. At this time, whether a researcher spends time updating and improving Wikipedia content that falls within their realm of expertise is not considered in applications for tenure. But with DORA, it may become possible to do such a thing. CIHR, the Canadian Institutes for Health Research, just signed DORA in an effort to communicate their understanding that research output is more than just publication and measuring a researcher by their h-index. Wikipedia signing DORA would represent support for the research community and particularly the ivory tower of academia to look beyond traditional models of knowledge dissemination to understand the value of ones contributions to knowledge. Hope this helps! Mcbrarian (talk) 14:46, 23 February 2020 (UTC)

An apparent deficiency in our medical content: gastrointestinal ulceration

To be more specific, we appear to have no article that covers signs+symptoms/diagnosis/treatment/prognosis/etc. of intestinal ulceration (in any segment of the small intestine past the duodenum) or colonic ulceration (i.e., large intestine and sigmoid colon).

I noticed this because I recently generalized the description of a perforated ulcer, but couldn't find any article or SIA to link which is specific to gastrointestinal ulceration. I remember from reading a paper on colonic ischemias – one cause colonic ulceration – that they account for something around 1 in 1000 of all ER visits.  There's other etiologies of colonic ulceration as well (e.g., ulcerative colitis), so shouldn't we have a page that covers ulceration in other segments of the GI tract besides mouth ulcer and peptic ulcer disease (scope: lower esophagus, stomach, duodenum)? NB: intestinal ulcer redirects to peptic ulcer disease (this is a bad redirect; that redirect target only suffices for duodenal ulcer) and colonic ulcer does not exist. 

I'm kind of surprised that we don't seem to have article content on colonic ulceration given that perforated ulcers in that segment of the GI tract are surgical emergencies which I suspect carry a relatively high risk of bacterial sepsis compared to perforations (w/ a non-infectious etiology) in other regions of the GI tract due to extremely high microbial concentrations in that segment (e.g., the [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4086029/ human colon contains ~1 trillion bacterial cells/ml of luminal content], which is several orders of magnitude higher than microbial concentration on any other internal/external surface of the human body). 

Anyone want to take a stab at addressing this? Seppi333 (Insert 2¢) 04:19, 21 February 2020 (UTC)
There are [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=%22colonic+ulcer%22%5Bti%5D only 28 entries in Pubmed with &quot;colonic ulcer&quot; in the title], and [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=%22colonic+ulcer%22%5Bti%5D+AND+review%5Bpt%5D only one review, 22 years ago, and that one is about a rare cause].
