Hoping someone can look at the full text of this article for me: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12544302 Urodynamic classification of patients with symptoms of overactive bladder.]  I'm trying to write up Overactive bladder and the abstract refers to a 1-4 classification scale.  Can someone quickly check what that scale is,  if it's OAB-specific, and the exact name of the scale (if reported) so I can do some better searches?   () 01:45, 26 August 2013 (UTC)
Try looking on google with the title of the paper you are after in quotation marks &quot;Urodynamic classification of patients with symptoms of overactive bladder&quot;. You would be surprised how often the full text is freely available. Alternatively, this page is good to request specific papers if you can't get them yourself: .

I'll check from work tomorrow if they can't.  On the same topic, many of my sources are using &quot;micturition&quot; instead of &quot;urination.&quot;  My understanding is that the two are basically synonyms, but are there important differences I should acknowledge when writing an article that's inevitably going to discuss the subject?

POV pushing editor on medical/psych pages?

Might just be my AFB tendencies, but I had a concerning experience with user 1210donna today. I have looked over the edit history, and the history of previous messages left by other editors for this user, and there seems to be a history of POV pushing across several articles. Main MO is removal of content which they disagree with, sometimes with misleading edit summaries, and addition of content which pushes a particular POV, sometimes unsourced, sometimes unreliably sourced. Today, they removed some content from burning mouth syndrome with an edit summary saying that the source did not support the content. I double checked the source for accuracy and then reverted the changes, only to see them removed again with a similarly bogus edit summary stating that it was an unsourced statement. Editor also doesn't appear to be aware of MEDRS, so I pointed that out . Advice appreciated. [[User:Lesion|Lesion]] ([[User talk:Lesion|talk]]) 03:34, 26 August 2013 (UTC)

Clean up on aisle stub

There are sixteen high importance stub articles remaining for the project:

A few are &quot;overview&quot; articles where we may have detailed individual articles but the overall topic article is not developed.  These appear to be correctly labeled as &quot;high&quot; and are simply waiting to be done, but there's a question of whether an overview is really that necessary on some:

Gastrointestinal cancer
Language disorder
Nervous system disease
Infestation
Vision disorder
Medical advice
Patient education

Some of these are individual topics that are appropriately labeled high and are again awaiting work:

Respiratory arrest
Viral meningitis
Needle sharing

I've downgraded this to mid:

Pudendal anesthesia

These to low:

Papillary dermis
Insulin index (and upgraded to start class, there's not a whole lot to say anyway)

I'm looking for input on the following:

Spinal disease (proposed merge to dorsopathy, which is a mid importance and equally stubby article)
Intimate examination (proposed merge to well woman exam, which is a low importance but reasonable article)
Tuberculosis vaccines (Is this  or ?  Do we even want this article?)

Thanks for any input.  Also, just as a general question, are there any of these that strike someone as more important?  I'm sometimes bored and looking to do something productive here - it keeps me away from the idiocy that happens on some of the high-profile pages on the project.   () 05:13, 26 August 2013 (UTC)
Intimate exams can occur in males and thus should be left more general IMO. Tuberculosis vaccines should be part of both projects. Important topic. [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 14:28, 26 August 2013 (UTC)

Infanticide

Hey guys, I really appreciate the work that you're doing for Wikipedia. Keep it up. 
On that note, I was wondering if you'd be able to continue that good work on an article for me. I'm doing an assignment on infanticide at school, and I noticed that the top of the article requests an expert in medicine to assist in improving the article. I'm not so interested in getting this article fixed for my assignment, but as a regular contributor to a wide variety of Wikipedia articles, it's of my interest that this article is improved. I would love it if an expert in medicine, or someone quite knowledgeable (and possibly even qualified, to some extent) in infanticide at least. Thanks a lot, -- () 06:01, 26 August 2013 (UTC)

Xenoestrogens and gender identity and sexual orientation

What information does Wikipedia have (or can it have) about xenoestrogens affecting human gender identity and human sexual orientation? 
— () 17:51, 26 August 2013 (UTC)

Even if it is speculative, it seems to me to be an important area for research.

Thank you for your reply.  From my Google search for DES Sons International Network, I found [http://diethylstilbestrol.co.uk/gender-identity/ Diethylstilbestrol influence on DES Sons gender identity, radio interview] and the statement &quot;There is a possible connection between DES exposure and gender variance&quot;.  Let us follow the precautionary principle.
— () 20:11, 26 August 2013 (UTC)
 DES was dropped in the 1970s – better late [http://to.desaction.org/documents/2011NEJM40YearPerspective_000.pdf] than never, I suppose... I have yet to find recent MEDRS on the specific issue you mention. There is a paragraph that addresses it in the  #DES sons section which, imo, is reliably reasoned. If I come across any more reliable sources on this I'll certainly try to update the page.  () 21:36, 26 August 2013 (UTC)

It may be an &quot;important area for research&quot; but Wikipedia is not the apropriate venue for such research. The links you have provided are completely and utterly non-MEDRS. Please do not add them. -- [ [[User:UseTheCommandLine|UseTheCommandLine]] ~/[[User talk:UseTheCommandLine|talk]] ]# ▄ 21:54, 26 August 2013 (UTC)
Agree that the (interesting) primary source loosely reporting a convenience sample of DES sons recruited on the internet most certainly fails MEDRS. However, the topic itself is both pertinent and biologically plausible—the etiological suspicion is strong. Fwiw, I'm not altogether surprised about the lack of MEDRS on this question given the methodological challenges involved in its study. It is much easier to conduct, say, a case-control (or cohort) study on risk of vaginal cancer than on somewhat taboo topics such as gender identity concerns. In brief, I feel the information currently provided on the page can broadly be considered encyclopedically appropriate.   () 23:07, 26 August 2013 (UTC)

&quot;pertinent and biologically plausible&quot; is not enough. &quot;etiological suspicion&quot; is not enough. It's an encyclopedia, not a journal. -- [ [[User:UseTheCommandLine|UseTheCommandLine]] ~/[[User talk:UseTheCommandLine|talk]] ]# ▄ 23:36, 26 August 2013 (UTC)

Drug - Drug class merge policy

Hello all,

I'm doing a little census of articles marked for merge, and orphaned med articles that have been tagged for 1+ years. A lot of these are drug names which are not especially notable (or drugs with short stubs). Would like some clarification:
* Is there a policy to merge drugs with their classes?
* Any circumstance for deletion?
* In what circumstances should one simply redirect (rather than merge) into a drug class? (eg. articles with just a drug name and a list of possible dosages)?

Would value some input,  () 03:13, 27 August 2013 (UTC)
 No need to respond, I have spoken too soon. The respective style guide is [[:Wikipedia:WikiProject_Pharmacology/Style_guide#General_considerations | here, in WikiProject Pharmacology]], and this states to redirect to the drug class (specifically, the International Nonproprietary Name).

Another proposed new template

I while ago I asked about  and why it was so weird, but didn't get any response. So I have taken the initiative and drafted a sample of what a new template for orofacial signs and symptoms could look like. I have not given a huge amount of thought to all the things that could go in, or how to organize it, but it is just to give an idea. Note that this template contains some entries from the above template, some from respiratory system, some from gastrointestinal system symptoms and signs etc, but also I believe contains some items unique to itself, and there is no-where else currently to put them. This is the main rationale for this template, and also to have a single template for signs and symptoms that an oral and maxillofacial surgeon/oral surgeon/oral physician would concern him/herself with. Comments appreciated. [[User:Lesion|Lesion]] ([[User talk:Lesion|talk]]) 12:02, 26 August 2013 (UTC)

MCID

Recently I wrote an article on Minimal Clinically Important Difference. A subject not yet covered on Wiki. It got declined because of &quot;inadequate supporting of reliable sources&quot;.

All the sources I used are published articles in various medical journals; abstract are freely available on Pubmed, some as well in full text, all are retrievable through a library.
For the writing I acquired all articles and read them (as is common before using it as a reference, something that seemed to surpise the guys/girls at webchat).

Changing the sources to only fully publicly available literature is not an option, this would leave a lot of the statements unreferenced and would ruin the article.

Anyway, I need a reviewer to aprove this article; how do I get one?

Merge notification

* 

The above links to a discussion about whether to merge the page chapped lips with cheilitis. [[User:Lesion|Lesion]] ([[User talk:Lesion|talk]]) 11:17, 27 August 2013 (UTC)
Now when one goes to google to search chapped lips, the first hit, nicely Wikipedia and &quot;chapped lips&quot; for now, redirects one to Wikipedia this way: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapped_lips#Cheilitis_simplex_.28chapped_lips.29 . The first sentences are: Sometimes the term &quot;chilitis simplex&quot; is used as a synonym for cheilitis generally,[4] or more usually as a synonym of &quot;chapped lips&quot;.[6] However, exfoliative cheilitis (discussed later) is also sometimes stated to be the equivalent of chapped lips.[7] Cheilitis simplex (also termed &quot;common cheilitis&quot;),[8] is one of the most common types of cheilitis.[6][9] I tend to think this is fairly horrible information for the regular reader who just wanted some info on chapped lips. And chapped lips is such a common name too. I'm afraid we're bombarding people with medical terms to our own detriment.  is wise. What do you think? Also ping to . Lesion, thanks for being willing to do the merge. We don't have enough volunteers who do that task. I just want them to always improve Wikipedia. And the results here I'm afraid hurt us.  () 10:47, 31 August 2013 (UTC)

I'm happy to un-merge if that's the consensus. Suspect some work on the cheilitis simplex subsection would equally address this concern? Like moving some of the discussion about terminology away from the first part of the subsection? However, typing in the term &quot;chapped lips&quot; I feel should lead to a page called &quot;cheilitis simplex&quot; (or a subsection called &quot;cheilitis simplex&quot; of the parent cheilitis article, per MEDMOS naming conventions, we should not title it &quot;chapped lips&quot;. [[User:Lesion|Lesion]] ([[User talk:Lesion|talk]]) 10:53, 31 August 2013 (UTC)

The &quot;lead&quot; of the cheilitis simplex subsection now reads:
&quot;Chapped lips (cheilitis simplex,[1] or &quot;common cheilitis&quot;),[2] is one of the most common types of cheilitis.[1][3] The symptoms are cracking, fissuring and [...] &quot;
I think this is better than what we had before. Agree that was not a great way to start the section. Note that the referencing of WIkipedia's content on chapped lips improved a lot during this merge, the previous article was mostly unreferenced I recall. We still have some unreferenced content, but they sound so common sense I have just tagged them with cn assuming that at some point someone will fill in the citations for these statements. Also, the amount of content Wikipedia has on chapped lips has increased in this process. Furthermore, I think it is good that people are redirected to the subsection of the page cheilitis. Despite what most of the sources say, I feel that many of the conditions on that page might be described by patients as &quot;chapped lips&quot;, and therefore they might be now redirected to a more complete discussion of the topic rather than a brief and mostly unreferenced discussion of a layterm with no MEDRS references ... [[User:Lesion|Lesion]] ([[User talk:Lesion|talk]]) 11:06, 31 August 2013 (UTC)
Thanks for your contributions. I've made some edits as well and I am much happier.

Agree, looks better after those edits. Also I replaced cn span with normal cn tags. The question is, when one source states that chapped lips is synonymous with exfoliative cheilitis, should we have chapped lips as its own page? There is still not a lot of content imo to warrant a stand alone article, but we do have about 4 pictures for such an article.

[[User:Zad68|Zad]][[User_Talk:Zad68|68]] 03:48, 30 August 2013 (UTC)  In addition, one of the sections has been tagged with  for a year, and the nominator him/herself added a  tag to the article today... I'm puzzled. [[User:Zad68|Zad]][[User_Talk:Zad68|68]] 03:54, 30 August 2013 (UTC)
GA nomination not really appropriate at this time as lot of work yet to do. The section on HBOT is packed full of primary sources when secondary sources are available. [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 08:22, 30 August 2013 (UTC)
Maybe suggest a peer review to begin? Or even if the GA is unlikely to be successful, it is likely that the process will be a good editing experience to the editor in question, if they have been using primary sources etc. [[User:Lesion|Lesion]] ([[User talk:Lesion|talk]]) 10:30, 30 August 2013 (UTC)
This got me in the GA mood, so I worked a bit more work on aphthous stomatitis and I've nominated it now. I have tried to keep the reference density at least one ref (hidden or not hidden) per sentence, and all sources meet MEDRS (including MEDDATE), apart from some sources in the history section, but I think RS rather than MEDRS applies there ...

Privacy and WikiMed

Proposed policy: pictures included without explicit statement that these have patient consent should  be removed from Wikipedia and deleted from WikiCommons 

A removal of a picture due to lack of patient consent [[:Talk:Jaundice#Is_this_picture_appropriate.3F | here]] prompts me to ask, is there a policy for patient consent to pictures being included on Wikipedia? and, if there is no consent found, what is the appropriate action for editors? If there is no explicit patient consent, this is not only a possible violation of a person's privacy and/or a derogation of the responsibilities of whoever took the photo, but also ethico-legal consequences for Wikipedia.

I would like to raise this as pretty serious problem, as it should be noted that that this photo's use is in perpetuity, and may be included in whatsoever format and location an editor deems fit. One possible solution would be to have a vetting or tagging process for pictures included in WikiMedia commons.

The aforementioned jaundice photo is now used in 17 other articles. 

Not too sure if I should be proposing this here or on a more central forum for discussion.

Kind Regards,  () 05:35, 31 August 2013 (UTC)
Thanks for the heads up. I uploaded the image in question and have consent from the person in question to release it under a CC BY SA license. In fact a fellow Wikipedia launched legal attacks again me regarding my uploading of this image among others. Had a lawyer for 8 months and we won the case as I had consent to up load the image in question from the patient in question and my college was happy. The patients have not complained.
Should we force people to send in consent forms to OTRS? No we should not. I am not giving out patients names to people at OTRS (they are not authorized to collect this info). And I am not going to start asking for consent to do so. The patients in question are more than welcome to raise concerns regarding the consent process. It is not up to Wikipedians to take this on. In fact the Wikipedian who launched the legal attacks had the nerve to insult the intelligence of my patient as she had agreed to release her image to us. Most patients use Wikipedia and realize that it is an important source of education information for both other patients and for physicians. Most people want to help others who have the same problems as themselves. Article about this was in the NYTs [http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/24/business/24inkblot.html?_r=0]
This proposal has been brought up many times. Does Wikipedia want images? Why do people keep trying to make things harder for uploaders / get rid of the images we already have? If someone has positioned a person and is taking a straight on photo is it NOT obvious the consent has been obtained? Does this person not look fully awake and competent? Do we always automatically assume that the uploader has lost their mind and wishes to end their career? What happened to ? Maybe this should apply to assuming consent has been received for uploaded images? [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 06:01, 31 August 2013 (UTC)
The interesting phenomena that this exemplifies is just how visual people and especially males are (even though the person who launch the legal attack against me was female but that was more an attempt at revenge my position on the Rorschach issue). The most controversial discussion on Wikipedia have resolved around images; think Mohammad, Rorschach test, and pregnancy, among others. Debates around words never seem to be as fierce.

Oppose -- In my eyes, this proposal is unnecessary encroachment of medicolegal bs where it is not wanted and not needed. We don't even tend to use the word &quot;patient&quot; in wikipedia articles. Why can't the people in these pictures just be people? I'm sure there are already policies in place about identifying individuals in images on Wikipedia, without having to label them as patients and make up a new policy. [[User:Lesion|Lesion]] ([[User talk:Lesion|talk]]) 09:53, 31 August 2013 (UTC)
See also [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Photographs_of_identifiable_people], which states &quot;Normally it is sufficient that the uploader asserts that appropriate consent was given.&quot; [[User:Lesion|Lesion]] ([[User talk:Lesion|talk]]) 10:20, 31 August 2013 (UTC)

Yep, I think as Wikipedia matures that this is a natural and fruitful discussion to have 'prophylactically'. If you click on the images in that WikiCommons link, there's a little tag that states the photos are taken with consent. I think that's a great move, as obviously consent is assumed, but it's nice to have it explicitly stated, and certainly will prevent problems like this revert in the future. In this light, what would be the thoughts from changing MEDMOS Images#Identifiable to:



(italics are to show the proposed changes, but not part of the changes themselves).

 @DrJames I had a look at the pregnancy-related images discussion out of interest ... Yikes!
I agree this would be a good addition &quot;Where this is not documented,  should be assumed&quot; The last thing we need is a new policy being put in place and the last 12 years of images being deleted as they do not measure up.
With respect to &quot;In choosing images of identifiable people with a medical condition, prefer images of people who are strongly associated with the condition&quot; No we should be choosing the image that best illustrates the condition in question. This is not a good image for osteosarcoma [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:TerryFoxToronto19800712.JPG].

Silly policies... [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 13:22, 31 August 2013 (UTC)
I think for the protection of the subject of the photo and Wikipedia, consent should be a prerequisite for photos that identify the patient (ie show their face).[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bellspalsy.JPG] Written permission should be submitted to WP the same way that professional photographers are required to submit written permission for the use of their photos on WP.  Using a photo on WP to assert that a person is an example of a medical condition is publishing medical information about that person[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:BenzoperoxideRx.JPG] and we should exercise the same care and caution that doctor's and hospitals and insurance companies do in this regard. In such cases good faith should not be assumed but rather it should be clearly documented in writing and be a mandatory part of the photo acceptance process. There are legal and moral and BLP consequences here. A person posing for a photo only indicates they allowed the photo to be taken. It gives no indication of the person's understanding of how the photo is to be used and who will see it and for what purposes and under what circumstances. It certainly does not imply that the person has given permission for the photo to be published in perpetuity on the world wide web. Furthermore, I feel this issue should be discussed in a central forum, like Jimbo's page to get input from non-medical editors as it has significant repercussions for real people, not to mention legal and moral BLP issues for WP.-- — [[User:Keithbob|Keithbob]] • [[User_ talk:Keithbob|Talk]] •  16:14, 31 August 2013 (UTC)
One problem I see is that these images come from multiple different countries, with heterogeneous policies on patient privacy as well as norms on use of images. That's about all I feel competent to say, since even though I know a bit about these issues in the US, I know little about them in other countries. I think that it might be possible to state a preference for the use of images in articles that are not individually identifiable, where they are otherwise equivalent, but what someone uploads to commons and tags etc is something commons should deal with themselves, imho. I think the good faith presumption is a good one. if we're particularly concerned about it we might have some kind of template for individually identifiable images, to allow someone to notify us that they are the subject, and (if they are unable to do so themselves) remove or replace it in the article. That's a bit of a reach, maybe, but if it reassures editors working on this content it might be worth the time/energy. -- [ [[User:UseTheCommandLine|UseTheCommandLine]] ~/[[User talk:UseTheCommandLine|talk]] ]# ▄ 17:12, 31 August 2013 (UTC)
To clarify my point: we should of course assume the good faith intentions of the editor or person uploading the photo but..... that should not be a substitute for written permission from the person whose face and medical info are being exposed on the web.-- — [[User:Keithbob|Keithbob]] • [[User_ talk:Keithbob|Talk]] •  20:06, 31 August 2013 (UTC)
One of the problems with that is that everyone has a different idea of what &quot;identifiable&quot; and &quot;medical information&quot; is.  The standard put forward by most academic groups these days is basically that if the photo was taken with a camera, rather than through a microscope, then you should assume that the person is &quot;identifiable&quot;.  According to them, [[:File:Skin.agr.jpg]] is an identifiable person, and [[:File:ArmAcneVulgaris.png]] is an identifiable person whose &quot;medical information&quot; is being exposed to the whole world.  Would you want to make people do a bunch of extra paperwork just to post those images?  How much paperwork do you think is appropriate?  Would you want, for example, to have uploading a picture of someone with a medical condition to require more paperwork, less paperwork, or about the same paperwork than uploading an equally identifiable picture of the same person engaged in sexual intercourse?   () 22:31, 31 August 2013 (UTC)
Keith, currently you would have to alter the wording of policy to support this. I'm not sure that personal disclosure of consent is desirable or would offer any added protection against images being uploaded without the person's consent. Unless the disclosure of consent gives the individual's name, then anyone could complete it, rendering the process pointless because there is no evidence that the consent has indeed been given. Suspect that this would also discourage many people from agreeing to have their pictures uploaded if the anonymity is gone. Agree 100% with WAID. There really is no need for any special policy here. We already hold the simple and effective rule: only upload images which the individual involved has consented for. I honestly question how many pictures we have which have not been consented to, and why we want to add more of a barrier for people to upload medical images, often these are invaluable contributions imo. [[User:Lesion|Lesion]] ([[User talk:Lesion|talk]]) 22:44, 31 August 2013 (UTC)

We have this template.[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Template:Consent] That should be sufficient. Now if we are going to assume bad faith and require that consent forms be sent in to functionaries how do we know that the uploader has not simple made up the consent forms and forged the signatures? Should we demand that they include the subjects drivers license, social security number and passport? But what if the drivers license is forged? Maybe we should also require that the forms be notarized and signed by two people with high standing in the community like with passports? But who is going to verify that they too are not imposters? Maybe what we need is a multi million dollar global verification system? We should require that people present in person in San Francisco with documents in hand to PROVE that they are who they say they are with notarized signed copies of all the documents in question. Also just to be sure the subject of the image and the uploader should both be their. To make this fair the movement should pick up the tab and pay for the subjects and photographers time. 

Once we have this in place we should also apply it to editors. Allowing anonymous editing is a disaster. Look at the conflict of interest issues that have occurred on article like Transcendental Meditation because we allow anonymous editing (likely by at least some people associated with the subject in question). Our readers deserve to know that someone has verified not only the identify of the people who upload the images they look at and subject within said images but also the identify of the people who write the text they read. But wait a second this long term editor  was indefinitely banned for sending personal information regarding a Wikipedia editor to Wikimedia functionaries. Would not attempts to identify the uploaders of images and the subjects within them by Wikimedia functionaries also result in indefinite bans of all involved? 

And if we raise the bar beyond that of Citezendium and ban everyone involved based on our draconian outing policy who is going to be left to contribute content? Maybe we should all simply give up and go back to our real jobs. Thankfully this is NOT how Wikipedia works because if it did Wikipedia would not exist. Additionally it is not how anywhere else in the world works either. [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 22:48, 31 August 2013 (UTC)
James, as I understand it that template is not mandatory. Neither does it provide any added protection against images being uploaded without consent. The only advantage that has already been stated above is that it would discourage other editors from questioning whether the image in question had been consented for. It would be just as easy to upload an image and put this template on the filepage, it adds no real extra layer of protection, so it should remain optional as it currently is. [[User:Lesion|Lesion]] ([[User talk:Lesion|talk]]) 23:13, 31 August 2013 (UTC)

 A bright new day to all! I agree that requiring written consent is a bit much; apart from anything else the cost burden to Wiki foundation processing these forms would probably be pretty onerous, not accessible to all editors, and I don't see why an electronic statement is any more or less truthful than a written form. I think we should assume good faith by the uploader.

 Should this issue arise in the future, I think to prevent edit warring we could (if it looks that way) leave a message on the article's talk page with reference to the amended policy, and if needed leave a (single) message with the uploader of the image about how to include the consent tag... and leave it at that. There is indeed no onus on us to WikiPolice, but it certainly wouldn't hurt if the consent tag was included with the images.  () 23:15, 31 August 2013 (UTC)

I feel it could be worth exploring the suggestion made above for a template to facilitate requests from photographed persons for removal of potentially identifiable images. If the photographer/uploader (e.g. James!) has kept a private note of the name of the consenting person photographed it might also be possible to spot/rebut any hoax claims.   () 23:20, 31 August 2013 (UTC)
Adding: I think I agree with the rebuttals below. There may need to be an available route which is not hidden.  () 09:30, 1 September 2013 (UTC)
How common is such an event to warrant a template? If someone wants to complain I'm sure they'll find a way. Advertising a pathway for challenges about the image on the file page may encourage hoax claims... [[User:Lesion|Lesion]] ([[User talk:Lesion|talk]]) 23:25, 31 August 2013 (UTC)
There is a very clear method for individuals to deal with concerns about their medical images being used on Wikipedia. It does not involve Wikipedia. Why are we trying to take on a policing role when there are already lots of well funded organization doing this? Maybe it is time we start WikiPolice as we do need an organization to verify all contributors and store data on our readers indefinately. But has anyone heard of an organization called the government? From what I understand they are already taking care of the first bit but also in some countries the latter bits aswell. In fact I received a fairly large bill every year to cover the running of the government operated removal process. Now on a more serious note I welcome any patient bringing concerns to me if their was confusion around the consent that they signed or if they simply changed their mind.

One last comment. Someone mentioned consent standards of major publishers. Here is an example of a image published by Kaplan Publishing. Author of the book is from New York City. Source is described as Nishith Patel. They never got written consent (they never got any consent in fact). How to I know? Because I have the consent in a filing cabinet beside me. They never contacted me (yes I took the image and it was on Wikipedia long before this book was published). They did not even get the source of the image right. I am not saying we should be this negligent but we cannot expect a level of perfect way above anything that exists or has ever existed..

One Q, above you seem to suggest that should someone in an image change their mind then the image would be withdrawn. I don't know the exact ins and outs of CC BY SA, but is it realistic to suggest that things published under this can be withdrawn? Example is, someone uses the image from wikipedia, giving correct attribution etc. Should the original source of the image (i.e. wikipedia) then withdraw the image, is there any onus on those who have reused the image in other publications from when it was available under CC BY SA, that they should also withdraw it?

The fact that images of peoples faces are being taken from WP and are now appearing on other websites is all the more reason to get it right the first time. We currently have a system in place whereby photographers who are not WP editors provide written consent via email for their photos to be published on WP. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Declaration_of_consent_for_all_enquiries] Why can't this type of permission be a requirement for non-notable people whose faces have been photographed by private individuals and are associated with disease? There are likely only a few such photos uploaded per month so I don't see a heavy burden on the WP system which is already in place to receive and process such emails and I see a significant increase in the level of privacy protection for the individuals whose medical conditions are being publicized and for the legal protection of WP/WMF. -- — [[User:Keithbob|Keithbob]] • [[User_ talk:Keithbob|Talk]] •  16:49, 1 September 2013 (UTC)
So if I upload a picture of a woman with red hair and green eyes, and add a caption that says, &quot;Red hair + green eyes = melanoma risk!&quot; that's (1) a face and (2) medical information.  Would you want [[:File:Зеленько Ірина.jpg|the woman in this headshot]] to have to send an e-mail message to OTRS to say &quot;That's me, and I'm okay with releasing my so-called 'medical information' that any redheaded, green-eyed person has an elevated risk of melanoma&quot;?  Notice that the women pictured in [[:commons:Category:Females having sex]] are not required to send in any special consent paperwork.  (The photographer is required to maintain this paperwork, but we are not.)  Does it seem appropriate to you that a headshot of a redheaded woman would require more paperwork than an obviously pornographic image of a woman?   () 21:03, 1 September 2013 (UTC)
The burden would lie with persons wishing to generate such images, and they simply won't both to upload anything if you make it more difficult. In so doing there would also not be any extra level of protection. Emails can be sent by anyone. The disadvantages not only outweigh the advantages, but there are no real advantages, so it's pointless imo. [[User:Lesion|Lesion]] ([[User talk:Lesion|talk]]) 23:05, 1 September 2013 (UTC)

Major publishers do not just get little consent from the subject of images when they take the image from Wikipedia they get little consent regardless of were they get the image from. This suggestion would basically eliminate us using images from other CC BY publishers as well as the US government as our standards would be different than other open access and public domain licenses.
People often try to use policies to get rid of images they dislike for whatever reason. These changes would be further justification for . The difference in this situation to outside authors needing to sent in consent is that in the latter situation the outside author has already published it somewhere else before. Thus there is more evidence of a real life identity for the author (as most publishers require real identities for authorship). It is an issue of preventing copyright infringement.

User:LT910001 has kindly offered to be the main reviewer for the aphthous stomatitis GA nomination. The review is underway, and s/he has requested a 2nd opinion before closing the review.  Here is the review page: . Thanks, [[User:Lesion|Lesion]] ([[User talk:Lesion|talk]]) 11:51, 3 September 2013 (UTC)
It looks like they want someone else to do a second general look over the article.  If you've never done this before, it's pretty easy.  You just need to read the short list of criteria at  (see also  if you want), then read the article, and leave a note at the page Lesion linked about whether you personally believe that it does or doesn't meet the criteria.  If you've dealt with FAC, this is much simpler:  only the things directly named on the GACR 'count', and anything else (including most of the Manual of Style) does not.

Thanks. I've done a thorough check-over and I think this article's ready for GA status. This would be my first review, and as I've previously collaborated with Lesion I'd like to make sure I'm not viewing this article through rose-coloured glasses. At this stage, in my opinion this article's an easy pass but I'd like another pair of eyes to agree or not just to be sure.  () 22:26, 3 September 2013 (UTC)

German Acupuncture Trials

Just noticed this article, which seems to contain a lot of biomedical pronouncements sourced heavily (exclusively?) to primary medical sources. I am concerned that by creating a article specifically about a medical trial, no matter how large, it becomes a  for information about the results that differ from those found in more reliable sources; in this case the article gives a strong impression of acupuncture's effectiveness which is a bit out-of- with out main Acupuncture article.

I found the unsourced, two line stub &quot;Immune-mediated disease&quot; (via Psoriasis, via Battle of Midway) a few minutes ago, and figured that I'd mention it here.

Consistency in naming sex chromosome aneuploidy articles

At the moment, we have, among others:
* XXYY syndrome
* 49, XXXXY syndrome
* 48, XXXX

In each article lead, they are characterized both by the total chromosome number and the word syndrome, although not necessarily together. (Note: I did not put Triple X syndrome on the list because I treated it as a name, not a count, but it should be fair game for discussion.) Is there any interest in standardizing article title format with regard to leading number or the use of the word &quot;syndrome&quot;? () 19:37, 4 September 2013 (UTC)

Not all of these have unique ICDD10 codes. While Triple X is listed as &quot;Karyotype 47,XXX&quot; (no space after the comma; ), both &quot;48, XXXX&quot; and 49, XXXXX fall under &quot;Female with more than three X chromosomes&quot; . Similarly, there is &quot;Klinefelter syndrome, male with more than two X chromosomes&quot;  which would encompass XXXY syndrome and &quot;49, XXXXY syndrome&quot;, but not &quot;XXYY syndrome&quot;.

Candidiasis

This is a top importance article which is not at B class or above, one of WPMED's specific goals.

&quot;Candida&quot; is a huge industry in complimentary and alternative medicine. This topic is very much in the public's mind, as evidenced by the huge number of hits on this article.

Top / high importance ... happy to make high importance if that is the consensus. I think building the article is more of an issue than this distinction.

Arent there already enough marginal peer-reviewed journals that are pubmed indexed? (and would it be too much to ask to not use proxied links?) I think this one looks fine for now, though Elsevier is absolutely no indication of quality. They'll print anything by anyone whose check doesnt bounce. 
For a marginal source, though, this one is referenced entirely too many times. surely there's a better one? -- [ [[User:UseTheCommandLine|UseTheCommandLine]] ~/[[User talk:UseTheCommandLine|talk]] ]# ▄ 04:40, 7 September 2013 (UTC)

 Regarding PubMed indexing, there is certainly no requirement for that. None of my textbooks are listed in PubMed, yet there is no dispute that they are reliable sources. Regarding the use of this particular reference, I was initially surprised to see that a paper from &quot;Osteopathic Family Physician&quot; is being used for the article &quot;Acne vulgaris&quot;. After some reading around, I now realise that the nature of osteopathic medicine in the US is quite different from the UK. (I am British.)

 The [http://www.osteopathicfamilyphysician.org/home website] declares &quot;The American College of Osteopathic Family Physicians (ACOFP) is a professional association of osteopathic family physicians, residents, and medical students dedicated to treating the patient, not just the symptoms.&quot; I believe that the journal is a reliable source per  recommendations.

 I am intrigued to see that UseTheCommandLine characterizes the paper as a &quot;marginal source&quot;. I would like to know his basis for this claim. [[User:Axl|Axl]] ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 09:30, 7 September 2013 (UTC)

I was being kneejerk hesitant, because I wondered why it hasn't been indexed by pubmed, which already includes a fair number of osteopathic-targeted journals. And then I looked again a minute ago and saw &quot;Vol. 5&quot; which i guess might explain things to some degree. I do feel more comfortable editorially seeing things in pubmed, and it indicates to me that there has been some external independent review of the journal and its output. -- [ [[User:UseTheCommandLine|UseTheCommandLine]] ~/[[User talk:UseTheCommandLine|talk]] ]# ▄ 17:54, 7 September 2013 (UTC)

Conflict of interest how? I'm not involved in the paper. I'm happy to remove it if that will remove the suspicion. I used the paper because it's a brand new review article and my understanding is that current secondary sources are what we strive to use. Much of the information in the article was unverified and I verified it using such a source. I fail to see the problem. I'm still waiting for a direct answer regarding whether non-Pubmed indexed sources are considered okay for use on Wikipedia .

I realize it's a separate issue, but that second comment was referring to your edits to Touro University California and the related COM page.

Okay, well that was not clear to me from your previous statement since we were on the subject of the acne vulgaris article. As for my edits in Touro University California, if you can show me anything I put on there that is false or out of proportion, I'm all ears. I've worked with other editors on it, it has not been a unilateral effort on my part. I have had other editors assess it for neutrality, balance, verifiability, etc. While true that I have not subjected the article to additional scrutiny after some additional changes, the newer edits were not really major ones, mostly updates. Certain editors had raised concerns that I had relied too heavily on primary sources (from TUC) and I did my best with the available information at the time to slowly phase out those sources and replace them with more objective, secondary sources. Lastly, if you have a concern with my editing, I much prefer to talk about such issues on my talk page rather than here. I only ask that in the future you bring up such a discussion there instead of here. I am happy to go over the TUC page with you if you wish. Before I got to it, it was hardly an article at all.

I couldn't find where exactly in the guideline this is stated. As I read it, textbooks are described as reliable, acceptable sources? I am interested in this because I use textbooks just as much as pubmed sources. Also would note that textbook does not necessarily equate to a tertiary source, e.g. if they are based on primary sources as well as secondary then they can't be called a purely tertiary source. Some more specialized textbooks (e.g. surgical specialties) reference more primary sources than secondary. [[User:Lesion|Lesion]] ([[User talk:Lesion|talk]]) 23:49, 8 September 2013 (UTC)

I use a lot of recent major textbooks aswell. [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 03:02, 9 September 2013 (UTC)
Good textbooks are incredibly important sources, especially for anatomy, physiology, and other basic-science material.  You're never going to find a systematic review on what the name of a ligament is. 
A recent medical school-type textbook is usually a secondary source.  A textbook aimed at 12 year olds is usually tertiary.  However, the most important thing is that your source be strong enough to support your claim.  If your claim is very lightweight (e.g., &quot;There are several types of blood cells&quot;), then even a book intended for children may be perfectly adequate. 
On the more philosophical end, there are two competing styles of sourcing.  One says that you should use the most serious scholarly source for everything, because it makes Wikipedia look respectable.  The other says that you should try to use a variety of source styles, so that every reader will be able to find something in the refs section that he (or she) can understand, if the reader is looking for more information.  I happen to be in the second camp, but not everyone is, and it's possible that the Right Answer™ depends on the type of article.  My style probably makes more sense in an article like Human body, and the other style might make more sense in an article that will be of little interest to anyone except specialists.   () 05:31, 9 September 2013 (UTC)
That's an interesting point. I'd say most medical school-type textbooks are still tertiary sources, because they're aggregating the results of secondary sources plus some experiential knowledge and selected primary sources. I think textbooks is a difficult issue, because you're in essence citing a source the majority of viewers will probably not have access to, and being a tertiary source it may not be as responsive to change as a secondary source. That said, some of the clearest and most comprehensive information is provided in them, they are not as piecemeal as journal articles, and can examine issues in some depth rather than selectively focus or ignore topics of interest or controversy. 
Non-index entries is a tricky one. I can't provide specific evidence but I have edited quite a few articles without PMID, including those with PMC, historical articles, or those with DOI only. I think that we can't out-source  to pubmed. As is mentioned above, issues with non-cited articles should relate to their content or references rather than the fact they are not on pubmed.

Alopecia/Baldness

There seems to be consensus to merge the article baldness into alopecia (). I have created a new section for discussion.

I would like to do the following:
* Redirect baldness to androgenic alopecia, the state that commonly referred to as 'baldness'
* Move most content from baldness to alopecia
* Leave a note on androgenic alopecia saying 'the term baldness redirects here. For other causes of hair loss, see alopecia. For other uses of 'bald', see bald (disambiguation).'

I think this would represent the optimum solution, as compared with the current state. Comments? Kind Regards,  () 10:58, 9 September 2013 (UTC)

Autofill PMID

All the autofill PMID templates are broken today. This is the tool on Wikipedia that I use the most. This includes the one in the edit box (which has been down for weeks) and now diberri [http://diberri.crabdance.com/cgi-bin/templatefiller/index.cgi?]. Anyway know of any other workarounds?

Bugs have been happening to me regularly since the launch of VE, although not sure if these events are truly related. Sometimes the  cite templates drop down menu doesn't drop down when clicked, sometimes no cite journal pop up window appears when cite journal is selected from the drop down menu, and sometimes the PMID autofill doesn't work. I suspect the first 2 are true bugs whereas the last is probably a connectivity issue rather than a software issue.

Anatomy article reclass report

Hello all, as part of a greater effort to clean up Wikiproject:med administratively, I have reclassed most Anatomy-related articles to WikiProject Anatomy. In total about 730 reclassifications were made. Although WP:Anatomy is not a very active project, at the current time anatomy-based articles are . If this project were to be merged at a later date, it would be prescient to merge to an Anatomy taskforce to continue the grouping of these articles. As a reminder, , even if these articles are not under the scope of WPMED. I've preserved any articles with pathology sections of significant length, articles covered under task forces, and articles that related to anatomical pathology (eg. renal artery stenosis).

For this process I used wikitools [http://tools.wmflabs.org/enwp10/cgi-bin/list2.fcgi?run=yes&amp;projecta=Medicine&amp;namespace=&amp;pagename=muscle&amp;quality=&amp;importance=&amp;score=&amp;pagenameWC=on&amp;projectb=&amp;qualityb=&amp;importanceb=&amp;limit=250&amp;offset=1&amp;sorta=Importance&amp;sortb=Quality&amp;reviewFilter=0&amp;releaseFilter=0&amp;category=&amp;categoryt= here] and searched by keyword. 

The final count of this reclassification effort is:
* search keyword initial count -&gt; final count.
* artery 244 -&gt; done (count = 54)
** check (circulation) done
* vein 159-&gt;  done (count = 21)
* venous 53 -&gt; done (count = 39)
* nerve 233 -&gt; done (count = 93) *Note, this is continuing. Articles here were also placed under the scope of WP:Neurosscience.
* plexus 46 -&gt;  done (count = 17)
* muscle 147 -&gt; done (count = 38)
** check (flexor, extensor) done
** check (anterior, posterior) done
** check (superficial, deep) done
** check (superior, inferior) done
** check (ventral, dorsal) done
* bone 83 -&gt; done (count = 53)
* ligament 96 -&gt; done (count = 12)
* tendon 8 -&gt; no change (count = 8)
* &quot;lymph, duct&quot; skipped (too many lymphomas to sift through)

Every search result under B class I also had a look and reclassified stub-&gt;start-&gt;C-&gt;B as appropriate.

If there are any other large reclassification projects needed, I would be happy to have a look. Kind Regards,  () 05:43, 29 August 2013 (UTC)

* Great job, well done. I understand that the MOS for anatomy articles recommends a pathology section in all articles. If one such article doesn't have a pathology section, just indicates they need to grow at some point in the future. Maybe whether there is a pathology section or not, the more relevant tag is WPANAT? Agree re. &quot;anatomic pathology&quot; type articles should have both tags. [[User:Lesion|Lesion]] ([[User talk:Lesion|talk]]) 10:26, 29 August 2013 (UTC)

Scope (Universities and Medical Schools)

These surely must fall under the purvue of . Not included as in/out on our WPMED . Agree/disagree? If consensus will change guidelines to reflect this.  () 07:14, 5 September 2013 (UTC)
Regular med schools are generally within scope.  AltMed programs (including chiropractic) are generally out.  Offhand, I don't remember seeing enough nursing programs or other mainstream allied health training programs to say how we would handle them.  I suspect that most of them aren't independent articles anyway.   () 15:03, 5 September 2013 (UTC)
I am happen to hand these over to WP:Universities and remove them from our scope. [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 13:21, 6 September 2013 (UTC)
If medical education is within our scope (which it should be), dedicated articles on medical schools probably should be in our scope, too.  Nursing schools can be under WP:NURSE and Alt Med under WP:ALTMED.  Other allied-health schools perhaps under WP:HEALTH.  -- () 02:09, 8 September 2013 (UTC)
Doesn't seem to be consensus on this issue. What's scaring me more is that there are currently 9.1 million trained physicians on this planet ([http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.A1443?lang=en here]), of which I reckon about 1/10-1/20 will have some received some sort of award or commendation or was involved in research or a clinic or something or other that someone thinks will warrant a Wiki article (16,500+ at the current category count, thankfully &lt; 1600 on WikiProject Med's books). What to do then is the trick.  () 06:38, 9 September 2013 (UTC)
OK in seriousness, articles about hospitals go to WP:HOSPITALS, as you say nurses to WP:NURSE, pharmaceuticals to WP:PHARM and so on. As there is an active WP:Universities, in my opinion it makes sense to move these articles to a more appropriate location. () 10:15, 9 September 2013 (UTC)
These aren't content categories.  The goal is not the least possible overlap.  The question is, do individual members want to keep informed about these articles?  If yes, then they're in scope.  If no, then they're not.
The last time I remember talking about drugs, people did want to get  if someone prodded an article about a drug, or sent one to FAR, or whatever, without having to check separate lists.   () 15:18, 9 September 2013 (UTC)
 It is easy enough to set up a page with article alerts from related projects, either as a subpage of your userpage with exactly the topics your interested in, or as a subpage of this project with all related projects (can do that if anybody is interested). Surely the goal is not to have the least possible overlap, but I think it is worthwhile to keep the scope of each project narrow and specific. -- () 08:25, 12 September 2013 (UTC)
It is my experience (via WP:COUNCIL) that &quot;narrow&quot; is a death prescription for WikiProjects.  The most successful and active WikiProjects have broadly defined scopes and friendly, experienced editors. 
Setting up separate pages is the problem.  Most people want to look at one page to see everything that they're interested in.   () 21:02, 12 September 2013 (UTC)

* In response to the point raised by Scott, I would caution that there needs to be actual editors to populate such wikiprojects and task forces, otherwise said project/task force won't get anything done. I would like to see the opinions of the other task force, do they agree to start handling these articles? Not sure we should untag a load of articles if no-one else will keep an eye on them (so to speak), and I know that is not a great reason to keep them under the scope of WPMED. [[User:Lesion|Lesion]] ([[User talk:Lesion|talk]]) 16:11, 9 September 2013 (UTC)
**I agree with everything said, except parts of Lesion's comment directly above.  As WAID said, it's up to the members of each project to decide what they cover.  It seems to me that members of this WP are generally interested mostly in things directly related to the practice of medicine, and not the other related topics.  So WPMED's lack of interest in things like nursing, altmed, allied health, hospitals, etc, is why they were removed from WPMED.  Generally, as a more specific project was created, there was a conscious decision (usually with discussion) to re-define the scope of WPMED.  The presence of the new project (or reactivation of an old project) had been what sparked discussions of what topics WPMED included, and whether or not the WPMED members desired to cover such topics.  Articles were then removed from WPMED not strictly because of the new project's presence, rather, the lack of interest from WPMED (in addition to a better project with interested editors).
*:It is not up to WPMED, or any other project, to make sure that articles removed from its scope are covered by another project.  None of the health-related projects mentioned in this thread are particularly active.  But if their articles were still part of WPMED, nothing different would be done.  Keeping articles within the scope of a project does not make the topic interesting to a project's members.  Yes, it is nice to be able to track articles, which is why I personally would not remove the WPMED banner without replacing it with another one.  Typically, we don't just go on de-tagging sprees, rather we say that another project is interested in a topic, and WPMED isn't anymore - so the banner can be changed from one project to another.  The best examples probably being  and , even though these are both relatively inactive.  In both cases, WPMED decided those topics aren't within the scope of this project, so the articles were relegated to the other projects, which have similar tracking systems in place.  And I'd imagine that the members of WPMED, WP:Anatomy, and WP:Hospitals all have great overlap.  It's almost easier to keep track of issues from those 2 projects because they are not as active.  Things can easily get lost in WPMED.
*:Early on, before these other projects existed, WPMED just accepted anything vaguely health-related - whether or not there was interest in these topics.  WPMED became a project that included any health-related topics that no one was interested in.  Now that these other projects exist (theoretically with active members interested in those topics), if WPMED is not interested, then articles should not be in WPMED's scope.  If WPMED were still interested in a topic and another group is as well, it would be okay to keep both banners.  This project (or any other) should not worry about if there is another project to cover an article or topic.  WPMED should cover topics of interest to its members, and topics that are not of interest should be removed.  If another project exists that covers an article, than great.  If a project does not exist to cover a topic, WPMED does not have to include an article in its scope just because there is no other active project to do so.
**Getting back to the purpose of this discussion, while I'm sure WP:Universities should (would, and maybe already does) cover medical schools, are the members of this project also interested?  I'd guess that most members of this project are interested in medical education, including medical schools.  If medical schools are removed from this project, but there are interested members, they would now also have to follow a huge project with thousands of &quot;uninteresting&quot; articles, and only a few hundred (if that) &quot;interesting&quot; articles.  The medical school articles get lost among a huge WP:Universities project.  (Contrast this to a WPMED member interested in hospitals, who also follows WP:HOSPITAL.  Here, there is no other &quot;uninteresting&quot; content.)  Regarding physician articles in the scope, I think there have been previous discussions about this project not being interested (unless they made a profound change to the practice of medicine), and they have been relegated to the Science and Academia Work Group of WP:BIO.  Drugs have always been part of WP:PHARM, and usually part of WPMED, but seem to go back and forth every once in a while.  -- () 04:37, 10 September 2013 (UTC)
**:There are several of us at this board that have done work with the  and if that ever became well-established in any school then I think that eventually students would take this on for their own school. That is probably the most likely way to recruit the time and labor to develop medical school articles. I am interested in the articles being developed but it really needs to be done on a large scale as part of a new recruitment effort, and not take time from people who are on this board already doing health-related things. I do think lots of people here might support other people doing university-page development, though.

Dutasteride Article

My name is Maitri Shah, PharmD, and I work for GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals (GSK) as a Medical Information Scientist. My intent is to provide information to the editors of Wikipedia for their use in dutasteride related articles to help ensure that healthcare professionals receive accurate and balanced scientific information. I understand the Wikipedia Conflict of Interest Principle and my edits will be restricted to the “Talk” pages in the “Discussion” area for dutasteride related articles. I will never directly edit any GlaxoSmithKline related article; instead I hope to enlist the help of fellow Wikipedians to assess my proposals for improved content. 

I have proposed some edits and additional language in the Contraindications section of the dutasteride article. You can find this on the dutasteride &quot;Talk&quot; Page. Looking forward to your response. Thank you.  () 05:25, 12 September 2013 (UTC)

I think I have addressed Maitri's concerns.[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dutasteride&amp;diff=572585702&amp;oldid=572585650] -- ( ·  · )  07:05, 12 September 2013 (UTC) 

The proposed edits to dutasteride bring up an issue that's been raised before, but which is quite a bit different from the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine/Archive_33#Do_we_need_a_WP:NTHERAPEUTIC.3F previous discussion] about GW 501516: what to do about off-label prescribing?
The article on Dutasteride has in its lead para one of its off-label uses. I have no doubt that this is the case, but i wonder if we should be even implicitly promoting off-label use. Especially since, in this case specifically, GSK has been such a bad actor in terms of off-label promotion. I feel like we really should have some kind of explicit policy about the inclusion of off-label uses in articles. -- [ [[User:UseTheCommandLine|UseTheCommandLine]] ~/[[User talk:UseTheCommandLine|talk]] ]# ▄ 06:30, 12 September 2013 (UTC)
Why is  not good enough in this case?-- () 06:42, 12 September 2013 (UTC)
If it's reported in -compliant sources, and is relevant, I think we should report it. -- ( ·  · )  07:05, 12 September 2013 (UTC)
That's nice to say, but off-label uses have limited primary data to suggest their use, to say nothing of secondary sources. If there were sufficient primary data, arguably the drug/therapeutic would be approved for that indication.
Where there are secondary  compliant sources, the weight issues are complicated, since there are not, as far as i can tell, good public data on off-label prescribing patterns. 
Further, i get a bit of the heebie-jeebies when you say that all one needs to do is get a review article published in a MEDRS journal in order to, concievably, get your drug advert on the sidebar of a google search for that drug. -- [ [[User:UseTheCommandLine|UseTheCommandLine]] ~/[[User talk:UseTheCommandLine|talk]] ]# ▄ 07:15, 12 September 2013 (UTC)
If the secondary MEDRS source says x can be used for y, then the article can say x can be used for y. If the source doesn't have data on prescribing patterns, then prescribing patterns don't go into the article. I don't understand what is complicated about this. As for your heebie-jeebies, that sounds like .-- () 07:31, 12 September 2013 (UTC)
If the source is not strong/trustworthy enough for us to be confident about its off-label prescribing claims then we shouldn't be using it. But if a drug is widely used off-label and we have a strong source it would be derelict of us not to report it (and make clear to the reader what &quot;off-label&quot; means with respect to evidence). -- ( ·  · )  07:37, 12 September 2013 (UTC)
I think we have a duty to the reader not to implicitly promote drugs for unapproved indications. To that end, i think off-label uses should stay out of the lead para entirely -- that's the one that gets quoted in google search results, generally. I would further say that where adequate MEDRS exist, they should be limited to a section entitled &quot;off-label uses&quot; which should be ideally in the basement bathroom, behind a sign that says &quot;beware of leopard.&quot; I kid, but only slightly. I fear for what will happen to medical content if we do not take a strong stance against implicit promotion of drugs and devices on WP. -- [ [[User:UseTheCommandLine|UseTheCommandLine]] ~/[[User talk:UseTheCommandLine|talk]] ]# ▄ 08:23, 12 September 2013 (UTC)

You'll get no argument from me there. Uses not supported by good evidence should not appear in the lede. I'd like us to say something along the lines of &quot;X is a pharmaceutical drug in the class Y. It is approved in the USA, UK, Sweden and other countries for the treatment of A, and in Italy, Australia, Togo and other countries for the treatment of A, B and C.&quot; And if there are any verified doubts of any kind regarding the evidence supporting its effectiveness in approved or off-label uses (as in the case of many psychiatric drugs' approved use, and Gabapentin's off-label use), I'd like the next sentence to mention those, e.g., &quot;There are, however, concerns regarding the quality of the trials conducted for a number of conditions&quot; or similar. Pharmaceutical sleight of hand should be front and centre here, I think. -- ( ·  · )  09:11, 12 September 2013 (UTC)
Whether or not something is &quot;off label&quot; is a United States government thing. Wikipedia is a global encyclopedia. This is not true &quot;If there were sufficient primary data, arguably the drug/therapeutic would be approved for that indication.&quot; The FDA gives approval for uses for which there is little / poor evidence and some uses have good evidence to support them but the manufacturer has not &quot;applied&quot; for the approval as their is no money in it. [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 16:10, 12 September 2013 (UTC)
Additionally whether or not a medication is commonly used for X means nothing about if it works or not.

I strongly disagree with dividing out articles into &quot;off-label use&quot; and &quot;FDA indicated&quot; and remove this divide whenever I see it. We should organize our &quot;Medical uses&quot; section by the condition in question. And maybe an &quot;other&quot; section for less written about uses.

Agree however that we need to be skeptical. A good example is Drotrecogin alfa. It was FDA approved in 2001 but an Apr 13th 2011 Cochrane review found that it increase mortality rather than decreased it. I updated our article on sepsis Apr 24th,2011 [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sepsis&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=425729887] and our one on APC Aug 2011. [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Drotrecogin_alfa&amp;diff=447620405&amp;oldid=447190401] The FDA / manufacturer did not remove its recommendation / sale until Oct 25, 2011. Uptodate did not change their position until this time either. We beat them both by 6 months by using the best available literature. I would not be the least surprised if the FDA is reading what we write and basing some of their decisions on us (certainly at least some policy makers are). I have already had a run in with another company around this issue. [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 16:29, 12 September 2013 (UTC)

Several responses:
*Even though it's true that WP is a global encyclopedia, and &quot;off-label&quot; refers frequently to FDA approval, my impression is that a good number of other countries with less regulatory infrastructure of their own simply incorporate FDA approval into their own systems. And as noted in that paper, the EMA also has prohibitions on off-label marketing.
*Even though the FDA does sometimes make approvals based on crappy evidence, it is a baseline, in the same way that &quot;peer-reviewed journal&quot; is something of a baseline for MEDRS. It is also, as above, a baseline that is relevant globally.
I can see most of your points. Because it seems like pharma-and-device-company-proposed-edits are going to only increase in prominence though, I am eager for some brighter lines, e.g. in MEDMOS. Simply saying that we should report what the evidence is seems both difficult for less experienced editors to assess, and relatively easy for these companies to massage via publications, which they already do for drug promotion purposes. Certainly, credit where credit is due for your work on Drotrecogin alfa but how many other adverts-masquerading-as-articles like eculizumab exist? -- [ [[User:UseTheCommandLine|UseTheCommandLine]] ~/[[User talk:UseTheCommandLine|talk]] ]# ▄ 17:51, 12 September 2013 (UTC)

Wikiversity school of medicine

Wikiversity school of medicine seems to have sparked into life: [https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/School:Medicine]

Posting here in case any wikipedia editors are interested in this kind of thing. I personally don't understand why there isn't more interest in Wikiversity. It potentially might even meet the needs of many editors I see wanting to add mnemonics and how-to content on medical pages. Wikiversity actively wants this kind of content, or so I understand.

GA review for female genital mutilation

Review is here [[:Talk:Female_genital_mutilation/GA1]]

This is taking an inordinate amount of time and I am not willing to go point-for-point with the nominator, yet I feel the article relies heavily on primary sources, is quite ambiguous when paraphasing sources, and I feel has an undercurrent of bias and non-neutrality that I find it hard to point my finger at specifically. The majority of my proposed changes are meeting obstructive opposition and, although the reasoning for each point might be valid, without these changes I think the NPOV problems are more pronounced. I don't think this article should be passed without further changes. The counterarguments have been made in the review, but at the current stage I am unwilling to continue review.

As for the article title, it's been suggested on the [[Talk: Amphetamine: History, Society, and Culture|article talk page]] that the current name is too long, which is sentiment I completely agree with.  That said, I like your proposed title without a colon more than the current one. 

With the addition of the methamphetamine content, the title would need to reflect both compounds. So, I was thinking something more colloquial and general, such as &quot;History and culture of Speed&quot; or &quot;Speed (history and culture)&quot; if parenthetically disambiguated. As an article on culture, the slang term intuitively seems ok, but I don't know if that's too informal for wikipedia's naming policy or ambiguous as an article title.  The question of what to name that page probably deserves its own discussion thread on [[Talk: Amphetamine: History, Society, and Culture]] though, so I'm going to hold off until the meth merge is complete before creating that thread.

Thanks

I just thanked a good WPMED editor for cleaning up citations (a tedious, and too often thankless, task), and it reminded me that one of the great things about this group is that some of the people here are very good about going out of their way to say thanks for the positive things that we do, and that I haven't been doing very much of it recently.  

So for our new people (you are fantastic!) and for those of us who have forgotten to keep up our efforts at positive reinforcement, I wanted to post a little &quot;primer&quot; on the couple of easy ways to do that:

* Just leave a personal note on the editor's talk page.  It doesn't have to be anything fancy.  Start a new section.  Say thanks.
* Use  to highlight a single edit that you appreciate.  This is perfect for small reminders that people appreciate your edits.  Click &quot;thanks&quot; (right next to &quot;undo&quot; on the page history), and then click the button to confirm that you meant to thank the person.  Their notifications button will light up with something much better than notification of another edit war.  If you do a lot of recent changes patrolling, please consider making this a habit for all good edits.
* Go to the editor's user talk page and use  to give anything from popular barnstars to a bowl of strawberries.  Add a sentence or two about what the editor did right, preview and post.  
* Award other  (WPMED has a couple), or make your own.
* Whenever you see promising new editors working on medicine-related articles, add  to their user talk pages.  We want to keep the good people working on articles here, and getting them connected to this great group is one way to do that.

If you have other ideas about how to show appreciation to each other, please post them.  (Thanks!)   () 23:49, 14 September 2013 (UTC)

On this note, I would like to thank the community for the support I have received whilst doing the review for Female Genital Mutilation, including from the nominees. This was a very frustrating review as midway through my internet was capped. On thanking, I have often tried to thank editors of articles, as well as leave articles occasionally on editors' talk pages to recognise their contributions, as I believe not only does a community thrive when this sort of positive feedback is made, but you also attract editors who are more communal and receptive to change.

*Using the &quot;/&quot; is problematic. With the article titled &quot;HIV/AIDS&quot;, it means that there is a main article at &quot;HIV&quot; and a sub article of that article at &quot;/AIDS&quot;. There may be a technical reason why articles should not be named in this way; I am not sure.

*, what say ye? Why is the hyphen incorrect? Thanks.  () pls  me (i.e. ) when u sign ur reply, thx 14:15, 16 September 2013 (UTC)
A slash is used to separate two terms that have an interchangeable relationship, and a hyphen is used to join two words with separate meanings. Since HIV was established as the causative agent for AIDS, AIDS has been redefined as being symptomatic HIV disease. That gives the two terms an interchangeable relationship, so a slash is the correct form. Aside from which HIV/AIDS is the form used by the US Centers for Disease Control, the National Institutes for Health, the World Health Organization, the United Nations... pretty much every organization and agency that can be considered a reliable source. A quick check on Google will show that this is the overwhelming usage. [[User:TechBear|TechBear]] |  |  15:49, 16 September 2013 (UTC)

People uploading their own images

Grant proposal to WMF from health editor


 some time ago made a proposal in the Wikimedia Foundation's new Idea Lab that a project be funded to create a lot more graphics for health articles. The proposal is on meta at [[:meta:Grants:IdeaLab/Medi-Graphics]]. The emphasis is on graphics either without text and which can be used in many languages or with text. For articles with text, this user would like to collect many health diagrams and organize a lot of translation and image processing at once.

If anyone has not seen the new community funding scheme, this project is one for medicine and may be of interest to people on this board.

It is almost certainly a hoax. the H and N in e.g. &quot;H1N1&quot; refer to specific proteins in the flu virus that modulate infectivity (hemagglutinin and neuraminidase). From our article on Influenza A virus:

The Influenza A virus genome is contained on eight single (non-paired) RNA strands that can code for up to 14 proteins (HA, NA, NP, M1, M2, M42, NS1, NEP, PA, PA-X, PB1, PB1-F2, PB1-N40, and PB2). 
this jibes with what I remember from virology taken in the last few years, but without actually consulting a reference work

There is no E protein there. This E1M1 thing is someone making things up. -- [ [[User:UseTheCommandLine|UseTheCommandLine]] ~/[[User talk:UseTheCommandLine|talk]] ]# ▄ 01:53, 19 September 2013 (UTC)

I doubt that ibuprofen is any more effective in fever reduction overall than the other proprionic acid derivative NSAIDs (there may be some differences based on usual over the counter dose, etc).

 Great! It's good to have another editor, if you are so inclined please run your eyes down the article and do some more thorough cleaning, I've mainly transposed and arranged the content. I have mentioned the issue about common name on the talk page. The problem is that 'baldness' is quite ambiguous, and taken to mean both alopecia and androgenic alopecia, so the 'baldness' article ends up being a mishmash of content about both conditions. In this case, I think that the disambiguating properties of 'alopecia' are essential to making the scope of the article clearer. An example of the clutter this can generate is about treatment for androgenic alopecia, which is currently reduplicated in part in alopecia, androgenic alopecia, management of baldness, management of androgenic alopecia, and experimental treatment of androgenic alopecia.  () 11:10, 21 September 2013 (UTC)

 This doesn't resolve the issue about the ambiguity of baldness being hair loss or male-pattern baldness, discussed above.  () 21:20, 21 September 2013 (UTC)
I don't perceive the issue you do. Could you elaborate? Also, I suppose chemotherapy induced baldness (or whatever-the-genetic-disorder-is baldness) also would be discussed at a baldness article? Baldness is the thing. Alopecia is a process that can lead towards being bald. I see alopecia as either being distinct from or the redirect to baldness. The article still says Extreme forms of alopecia areata are alopecia totalis. How is a normal person supposed to read that if someone came from google after searching for baldness?

Hold your horses! This merge has been proposed on the pages since July 2012. I reopened a merge discussion on all three pages from a week ago, and posted here as well, so there has been ample time to discuss if you had wished to contribute. With the exception of short orphaned stubs, I always propose merges and wait a week before merging (more if the article is longer or has a higher view count); if you wish to check for proposed merges there is a list [http://toolserver.org/~svick/CleanupListing/CleanupListingByCat.php?project=Medicine#Articles%20to%20be%20merged here], or if you are particularly worried you could actively monitor my contributions.

Lots of articles need help. This is Wikipedia. I'd say the reason they haven't gotten the attention they deserve is because we don't have the volunteer labor.

() pls  me (i.e. ) while signing a reply, thx 10:54, 22 September 2013 (UTC)

I've been thinking about this since it was first posted, and at this point all I can offer is to share my confusion.  So:  baldness is the result of hair loss.  Alopecia is the medicalese for hair loss.  There is presumably some other medical term for the state of having already lost the hair; perhaps glabrousness is used, although I think that's usually for things that never had hair to begin with.  Androgenic alopecia is medicalese for losing hair because you're male.  Normally (I'm a dyed-in-the-wool mergeist) I'd be happy to merge 'result' and 'cause' articles.

But in this case, I have two concerns.  One is that we may be inappropriately preferring medicalese over the common name for something that is not commonly a medical condition, but which has some social significance.  The other is that it seems like this type of merge has a significant probability of adding to the already substantial &quot;Wikipedia is for men&quot; problem by focusing on male-pattern baldness.  What you write depends (or ought to) on the audience.  Good editors would write very different articles about this subject if they imagine that the audience consisted primarily of people caring for pediatric cancer patients vs. slightly vain men vs. pet owners trying to figure out why their pets have bald spots.  Keeping separate articles might help us provide better tailored information for each audience.  It would probably not help us do that today, but , and it might help us ultimately do that.  () 20:33, 22 September 2013 (UTC)
Hmm, that's a good point you raise and I actually think using medicalese over 'baldness' helps solve this problem, as 'baldness' is used preferentially to refer to men rather than women. What is commonly referred to as 'baldness' is referred to in androgenic alopecia, which also makes reference to women. I think it is fair enough for a larger section of alopecia to refer to androgenic alopecia, as this is probably the most common cause of hair loss in society. This would be the case with or without the merge. There is however no reason for it to be written in a male-orientated way. If you're referring to the current article, I do agree that this is the case at the moment.  () 21:18, 22 September 2013 (UTC)

There was a very long discussion about infoboxes not too long ago. No consensus for change was achieved, however I do not think anyone specifically suggested placing synonyms in the infobox.

Help needed at 

We had a 1-time poster who made a draft of this article two years ago, never edited since. The draft has been in limbo, and since this guy is apparently quite famous in the history of Harvard Med, and of typhoid research, we certainly should have an article about him. The article just needs a little cleanup and a few more footnotes, and there are plentiful mentions of him on GoogleBooks. Could some med person here take a shot at it just for a little, then hit &quot;Resubmit&quot; to so we can get it published? Thanks for any help,  () 20:55, 23 September 2013 (UTC)
I prevented it from speedy deletion as an abandoned draft, but all I did was save it so it could get the necessary editing.  () 21:36, 23 September 2013 (UTC)
The original complaint was lack of references so I found and listed six references. That should establish notability based on references. The article still needs cleanup. I resubmitted it for review but it is still a messy article. [[User:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ]][[User talk:Bluerasberry|(talk)]] 15:27, 24 September 2013 (UTC)
I am sure that notability is established but the article needs more integration of sources into content to migrate from AfC to mainspace. I added three citations from one source. If anyone else added one citation from another source then that probably would constitute minimal needed effort. If anyone would contribute more than that then this article is worth it and the sources are there.

First ever CC-By informed consent document?

Hello. I am a big fan of clinical research. For years I have wanted access to an informed consent document, which is the paper that a participant in a clinical trial would sign to indicate their consent to participate in a trial.

There is very little coverage of clinical research on Wikipedia. I wish this were not so, because the pharmaceutical industry interfaces with the community through clinical research and I would like to help people be more empowered to understand what research means if they wish to do so.

I managed to find a CC-By informed consent document and research protocol document for a larger-than-average study by Eli Lilly and Company. I uploaded those to Commons, ported the ICD to Wikisource, and made a Wikipedia article to feature them and collect all the research literature about this study. What I made is at PARAMOUNT trial.

Something potentially controversial about this is that I cited ClinicalTrials.gov for some of the information. ClinicalTrials.gov is a United States government website and project for tracking clinical research which will be used to back the introduction and use of drugs in the United States. The site was made in response to consumer safety needs to get certain pieces of information to consumers and to raise accountability of researchers to give more information to the communities in which they conduct their research. It is controversial that I cite this because the information there is self-published and verified only by the pharma company, however it is on this government website because the information is attested and it is the information specifically requested by the government. I feel that since the author is compelled to report this information in a way not of their choosing that this site is not actually a self-publication. Thoughts on this? Most but not all of the information contained therein should be replicated in other papers, but some significant information for consumers - like the international listing of study sites - would be difficult to find from any other source.

I would like to replicate what I have done here with other clinical research in the future. This particular article is not so remarkable, except that it is one of just a few such articles covering clinical trials on Wikipedia and because as I said I think this might be the only trial in the world by a major industry player which has a freely-licensed protocol and ICD. I would appreciate any comments here or on that article's talk page. [[User:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ]][[User talk:Bluerasberry|(talk)]] 03:32, 25 September 2013 (UTC)
Interesting idea, though it will need vigilance to avoid becoming a playground for commercially motivated editors. I've suggested a couple of recent review sources on the article's talkpage.  [[User talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl!]] 05:01, 25 September 2013 (UTC)
Great work; I agree that important trials often do not get the attention they deserve (one reason might be they are so many and the literature changes so quickly). You've obviously thought through the guidelines on primary sources and original research so I won't go any further there. I've uploaded the image to the informed consent article. I don't see this issue you raise as controversial; many things are self-reported to the government and an audit conducted if necessary; if at some level companies were not trusted to self-report, it would be necessary to go straight to the source for every instance of consent. As with many of our discussions about informed consent, some degree of trust is necessary to keep the wheels oiled in WP, WP:Commons and life in general.  () 06:44, 25 September 2013 (UTC)

My gut instinct is that the information on ClinicalTrials.gov can be trusted for uncontroversial background information and details that might be difficult to gather otherwise (lists of study centers, dates of trial start and milestones, etc.), but that we should generally shy away from using it to report results or interpretation.  It probably goes without saying that we shouldn't be mentioning studies for which no peer-reviewed publications yet exist, or which haven't received suitably extensive secondary coverage.  That is, we don't want to be writing articles where ClinicalTrials.gov is the only source, but I see no problem with it being a source.
I am not very familiar with Wikipedia's usual standards and practices – if any – regarding clinical trials, but as a specific comment on PARAMOUNT trial I am not sure that we need quite so much detail on the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  Those bullet lists are almost as long as the rest of the article; we could probably get away with a summary (perhaps whatever is used in the Materials and Methods section of the published papers?) and leave a footnote for the full criteria.  As an incidental benefit, this might alleviate some concern over the volume of material drawn from ClinicalTrials.gov.  () 12:54, 25 September 2013 (UTC)
Generally, articles on clinical trials are complicated.  You should handle them more or less like a small sub-organization, which means that you don't want an article at all unless there are some fairly extensive sources that are 100% independent of the trial.  This means, for example, that sources recruiting for participants or articles written by the investigators don't count at all in the notability determination.  Your sources must also actually be about the trial, which means that sources reporting the results don't count.  
We avoid articles about uncompleted trials unless they are (1) huge and (2) lengthy.  And in almost all cases—except for the truly world-changing trials—we have a bias towards merge them with a more significant subject, like the org that's running it, the lead author's bio, or the disease that's involved, because this provides better context and reduces the promotional problems.

Commons is really messed up

An X-ray was deleted as the uploader was &quot;a medical STUDENT and he cannot own these radiographs.&quot; and &quot;don't trust another wiki&quot;.

Two things to point out. Firstly, that deletion discussion is from five years ago. Secondly, most copyright discussions (both here and on Commons) work more like CSDs than AFDs -- an admin, experienced with copyright work, comes to a decision based on his own investigation, though potentially aided by the input of others. Thus, one cannot say if MichaelMaggs took the statements you cite into account. All we have is his explanatory statement that &quot;Radswiki lists no source&quot;, so it should be that which one would need to rebut to have the five-year-old decision overturned. -  [ ] 12:06, 18 September 2013 (UTC)
The difficulty is they are inventing copyright law by trying to use far fetched deductive reasoning. And than deleting images based on their new inventions.

I have been asking academics how thing work in the real world. Have spoken with an important person at the NIH (in an none official capacity), a widely published radiologist from Sweden, the founder of a radiology image wiki, and others. They all agree that diagnostic X-rays are not like pictures. That they are unsure if the images are copyrightable. But if they are they are definitely NOT owned by the X-ray tech. And those that have published X-rays have not asked for official permission from anyone before doing so. They do not see why a patient would be unable to publish their own images.
Now we at Wikipedia/Commons can say that everyone else in the world is currently &quot;breaking the law&quot; however I think we need to be very carefully if we are to make this position explicit. Could make us look foolish. [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 12:56, 21 September 2013 (UTC)

* Commons policy is very clear: all images have to be in the public domain in both the source country and in the United States. If an image isn't properly sourced, then the source country may be unknown. If the source country is unknown, then this seems to favour deletion per [[Commons:COM:PRP]] as the source country might be a country in which the image is copyrightable. One of the mentioned images was unsourced, and the other one was from the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom has a very low threshold of originality, which is why we don't allow British signatures on Commons until 70 years after the death of the signatory (see [[Commons:COM:SIG#United Kingdom]]) or simple text logos ([[:File:EDGE magazine (logo).svg]] was deleted after we found out that a British court decided that the logo was copyrighted in the United Kingdom). A medical X-ray image is almost certainly copyrightable in the United Kingdom. -- () 13:58, 23 September 2013 (UTC)

 Stefan2, only your last sentence is of relevance to this discussion. And that statement is pure speculation.

 Masem, that page does not suggest that x-rays are photographs. Of note, it states &quot;We could not find any case law directly addressing the issue of the copyrightability of x-ray images.&quot; In the absence of such guidance, the author (Pholm) draws an analogy between x-rays and photographs. Pholm's last statement is &quot;Depending on the circumstances, a radiology technician, radiologist, consulting physician, physician group, hospital, or some combination thereof, may hold any copyright that exists.&quot; Yet in the absence of case law, it is impossible to know who owns the copyright. If it is impossible to know who owns the copyright, in what sense does copyright exist? [[User:Axl|Axl]] ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 00:07, 24 September 2013 (UTC)

Hello, I have posted a RfC on WP:LAW, a more legal insight into this matter might help the discussion.  () 06:09, 24 September 2013 (UTC)

Like most pages I have seen on Wikilegal, it is worthless. It gives the illusion of containing useful and learned advice, but is actually pure speculation by an intern, and only considers US law. It is merely the opinion of one person with no stake in the matter and no experience of the subject. I fear the longer this discussion goes on, the more random speculation with accumulate. This is an example of where crowd-sourcing fails -- too many know-nothings with opinions -- and of where the dogmatism on Commons conflicts with pragmatism in the real world. WMF should state a position they are willing to defend in court (as they have done with photographs of PD art) or else require Commons delete all radiology images without OTRS evidence from institution where the image was obtained. Perhaps the denuding of Commons of such a huge collection of encyclopaedic photographs (leaving behind a collection of erect penises) will help the WMF focus on how their education project has gone off the rails. The doubt helps nobody. I don't think there is any realistic chance of an uploader or reuser being sued here (unless someone is stupid enough to scrape an x-ray from a journal), but the ongoing doubt causes people to waste their time uploading images (sometimes with verbal &quot;permission&quot;) only for some Commons admin to get all hot headed and delete it. -- ° 08:06, 24 September 2013 (UTC)

 It is unclear from the page itself to what extent it represents the official and legal stance of Wikimedia Commons/Meta-wiki. I am not active in those projects so I am unfamiliar with their processes. I assumed good faith when Masem described it as &quot;Legal advice from the Foundation&quot;. The author, [https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Pholm_%28WMF%29 Peter Holm], is a legal intern working for Wikimedia Foundation. It is certainly plausible that this is the official stance.

 I don't think that it's helpful to characterize editors as &quot;know-nothings&quot;. It is an ad hominem argument and could be construed as a personal attack. These editors are not stupid, and they are acting in good faith with the aim of improving Wikimedia Commons. Perhaps &quot;misguided&quot; would be more accurate.

 It is interesting that you mention medical journals. According to Stefan2 and Masem's interpretation, every medical journal and medical textbook publisher is infringing copyright. Although exactly whose copyright they are infringing is impossible to know. [[User:Axl|Axl]] ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 10:45, 24 September 2013 (UTC)

 Read the disclaimer at the top. Masem is wrong to call it &quot;legal advice from WMF&quot;. It is no more authoritative than a blog post. WMF have no official stance other than to state that issues of copyright are entirely the responsibility of the uploader/community. 

 There's an endemic problem on the Internet (and we all fall into the trap) of voicing an strong opinion on a subject you really know nothing about. As they say &quot;A little knowledge is a dangerous thing&quot;. Combine this with a position of power and you have a sorry mess. A five minute internet search and suddenly someone is acting like they are an expert in Swedish copyright law. I don't really understand why someone should wake up one morning and decided to delete a featured picture that has been on Commons for five years and is used on many articles in many Wikipedias. Commons could benefit from more admins saying &quot;Honestly, I don't know the legal situation here, and perhaps nobody does. So I'm going to do something else where I know my actions are correct and helpful.&quot;. Pragmatically, that would help Commons because it would respect the actual situation where it is ultimately the uploader's responsibility and nobody else. Pragmatism would help here because if the whole world acts like radiology images aren't copyright, then the speculation of lawyers is just unhelpful and hinders Commons mission to provide educational content. That would leave admins time to spend deleting content where they know the copyright situation or content with other legal and ethical problems. The admins aren't &quot;misguided&quot;; they are ignorant and should recognise their limitations. That people don't like this pointed out to them, is understandable.

 The medical publishers claim the copyright for themselves. Which is of course ridiculous and unethical. ° 11:54, 24 September 2013 (UTC)
 Ah, thank you for pointing out the disclaimer at the top of the page. It states &quot;This page is not legal advice or a representation of the viewpoints of the Wikimedia Foundation.&quot; Masem is indeed wrong to describe the page as &quot;Legal advice from the Foundation&quot;. The page is no more than Peter Holm's opinion.  [[User:Axl|Axl]] ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 17:14, 24 September 2013 (UTC)

Erm.  It should be emphasized that there is a significant difference between &quot;there isn't any case law on this point right now&quot; and &quot;this particular right does not exist&quot;.  The former simply means that no one has brought this particular question to trial and followed it all the way through to a judge's ruling—at least, not as far as the WMF's legal intern could discover in putting together a blog post.  I suspect that if we started scanning radiographs from radiology textbooks and uploading them to Commons, some useful case law would very quickly accrue.
The issue probably hasn't come up in a significant case-law sort of way because the people who write the textbooks are generally the same radiologists (or the friends and colleagues of the radiologists) who collected the images.  Hospitals which employ the radiologists want their employees and contractors to publish papers and textbooks because it is good for everyone's reputation.  In the case of a textbook or journal article, there's nobody who would plausibly have standing to claim copyright who wouldn't have given permission to use the images before publication.  () 18:18, 24 September 2013 (UTC)
Well it seems that unless the radiologist is self-employed, they don't have any claim to the image at all. The copyright, should there be any, belongs to the employer. What we are trying to establish, with various enquiries, is whether anyone actually does ask for permission or give permission. So far the answer seems to be no. In other words, the journals and textbooks are claiming copyright for themselves for images where they don't have copyright. It would indeed be foolish to start scanning from radiology books, though one suspects the publishers may have more to lose from any court case than a wikipedian. What unfortunately seems to be the situation is that a gentlemen's agreement won't satisfy the admins at Commons. -- Colin



 So if they think that the copyright owner would have given permission, it's okay to use the copyrighted image? [[User:Axl|Axl]] ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 08:38, 25 September 2013 (UTC)
I'm not quite sure what you are asking, Axl, but TenOfAllTrades's quote isn't correct. And giving &quot;permission to use&quot; one thing and quite separate from transferring ownership of copyright. My impression is that journals are claiming copyright on images they have no right to. The copyright (should it exist) would remain with the NHS Trust (say) that employed the radiographer who did the scan. From talking to one journal and to authors, it appears the journal's official line is that they expect the authors to get necessary permissions, but don't check themselves, and the authors in turn are unaware they need to get permission and have never done so nor had any problems (provided the patient isn't identified). ° 09:07, 25 September 2013 (UTC)
You're right that I should have written more clearly—it wasn't my intent to suggest that the combination of permissions and (often) hospital policies encouraging and allowing physicians to publish medical images constituted a formal grant or transfer of copyright, or indeed that they even mention copyright.  The physicians who write papers for medical journals generally have to sign off on a statement that they hold the appropriate copyrights and/or have obtained the required permissions, but as far as journal publishers are concerned there isn't any follow-up; they take those signed (but probably dubious) author statements at their word.  My point was that even if the journals had worried about the issue, they get by on a combination of we've-always-done-it-this-way and nobody's-going-to-sue-so-it-doesn't-matter—reasoning which we, on Wikipedia, cannot find acceptable.
While I'm hesitant to further muddy the waters, it is also worth bearing in mind that in some jurisdictions many physicians are independent contractors rather than employees—even for physicians who nominally work at or in clinics or hospitals.  While I doubt very much that the reason for such arrangements had anything at all to do with intellectual property concerns, it does have significant intellectual property ramifications. () 12:24, 25 September 2013 (UTC)
Yes most physicians are independent contractors. Does not really mean much as they are still not taking the images but are publishing. [[User:Jmh649|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 12:49, 25 September 2013 (UTC)
I don't think there are any circumstances where a physician would own copyright, unless working in some Third World practice where he'd have to do his own x-rays, or in episode of House, where the physicians appears to do everything. A self-employed radiographer would own copyright, unless his contract said differently. Given that it is typically physicians who publish the papers, the most they will have is &quot;permission to publish&quot;, not &quot;permission to give Elsevier the copyright to my work&quot;. ° 14:39, 25 September 2013 (UTC)
The copyright laws are very different in different countries. In some countries such as the United States, the copyright to a work for hire belongs to the employer. On the other hand, in other countries such as Sweden, the copyright belongs to the employee, unless you create computer software (see § 40 a in the copyright law). Many countries use the laws of the source country to determine the copyright holder of a work for hire. -- () 21:23, 25 September 2013 (UTC)

I find it strange that some commons admins wish to push this issue. They are more or less pushing to have all radiological images deleted even though we have obtained the equivalent permission as publishers. They are exposing themselves and Wikipedia to no risk by leaving things as they are, while publishers might be exposed to some risk by continuing on as they have been.

Commons has a &quot;precautionary principle&quot; which doesn't let them get away with &quot;everyone does this so it must be ok&quot; or &quot;nobody will mind&quot; sort of attitude. I think this is good for cases where lots of people really are breaking a law and depriving artists of their earnings (like for illegal movies and music downloads). But with these images we seem to have a situation where copyright shouldn't be sticking its nose in -- there are no artists making a living from selling these pictures -- but does simply because the technology is similar to photography and an image is produced that looks a bit like a photograph. And this situation will not be resolved because it isn't in anyone's interest to spend money fixing a problem they don't have in practice. What should Commons do in that case? Do we need some kind of &quot;You really have better things to do with your time&quot; kind of policy? Where technically deletable images are not deleted because it really is in nobody's interest to be anal about it. I'd support that along with some kind of template on the images to say that issues of ownership and copyright surrounding radiology images are unclear and untested and that professional practice has historically allowed physicians and patients to do what they like with images. We have the odd situation that user-uploaded images are investigated but not ones from open access journals -- yet it doesn't appear the latter are any better. ° 14:39, 25 September 2013 (UTC)
