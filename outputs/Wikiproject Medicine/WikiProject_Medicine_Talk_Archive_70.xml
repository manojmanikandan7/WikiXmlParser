Please look over Antiadherence activity of proanthocyanidins from cranberry, I've tagged several issues but as I'm not a medical or pharmacology specialist I might (probably?) have missed something significant. I couldn't figure out even one category for it. Roger (Dodger67) (talk) 12:37, 31 July 2015 (UTC)
Running my non-medical eyes over it I'll only note that it seems to be somewhat at odds with our cranberry article, which states that &quot;Two comprehensive reviews of available research concluded that there is no evidence that cranberry compounds are effective in treating urinary tract infections&quot;. As to which (if either) article is correct, I'll leave that to the experts. AndyTheGrump (talk) 12:45, 31 July 2015 (UTC)
If one checks the relevant paragraph in the new article it appears that the cranberry article statement is simply outdatd, the new article emphasizes prophylaxis rather than treatment, but as you said, leave it for the expert opinions of others. Roger (Dodger67) (talk) 12:55, 31 July 2015 (UTC)
Whatever the evidence, this doesn't need a whole article and should be merged to cranberry. Alexbrn (talk) 13:01, 31 July 2015 (UTC)
The reveal came in the last paragraph - was there  to promote a dietary supplement product called Cysticlean and there were arguments throughout the article that something just like that product is what the world needs.   I condensed the content, then put the content here: Proanthocyanidin#Urinary_tract_infections and redirected.   Maybe adding to the Cranberries would be better, or in addition to that.

My apologies for my clumsiness. oy Jytdog (talk) 16:53, 31 July 2015 (UTC)
 Did anything ever come of the idea to tag drafts with topic categories or wikiproject tags? Awhile back I set up the MCB tag to accommodate drafts, and MED could do the same if it hasn't been done already, but I haven't seen any topic sorting on the AfC end, beyond having individual reviewers ping relevant projects. But I'm not involved in AfC otherwise, so maybe I missed it. Opabinia regalis (talk) 17:00, 31 July 2015 (UTC)
 some of us are doing it sporadically, but there is a script function under development to include such tagging in the semi-automated reviewing tool, so it's bound to become more systematic soon. (We're also a bit burnt out after reducing the biggest backlog we've ever had - it peaked at well over 4000 submissions - down to around 200.) But clever tools and workflow redesigns will only go so far, we really need a sustained &quot;buy-in&quot; and participation from &quot;subject&quot; WikiProjects. Generalist Wikignomes such as myself can only do so much without subject specialists - on any given day I might review drafts on topics ranging from architecture to zoology via weapons technology, soccer and linguistics, but still the vast majority of submissions are simply crap.

The WikiProject Medicine Collaboration of the Month for August

Hello all,

As I announced earlier this month, I am trying to reboot the MCOTM and as it is now August in the majority of the world, I have gone ahead and updated the article of the month to be transverse myelitis. In its current state it is very dismal. At the very least, I think with the combined effort of everyone here we will be able to get it up to B at the least. As I know not everyone has access to sources I have shared some via Dropbox which anyone is free to use. Some goals I think we will be able to accomplish by September are: i) Expand epidemiology section ii) Add information for treatments, iii) Improve citations, and iv) Better Wikification of the article to comply with MEDMOS. 

Hopefully we will be able to make a marginal impact on the quality of this article. Peter.C ‚Ä¢ talk ‚Ä¢  00:24, 1 August 2015 (UTC)
For your sake I've removed the dropbox link as you could get into trouble for copyvio (unlikely yes, but it's also in the WP rules). You can however have this link available on request for anyone who mails you. -- CFCF üçå () 00:35, 1 August 2015 (UTC)
P.S. Great initiative, I plan to help out. -- CFCF üçå () 00:40, 1 August 2015 (UTC)
Yea, I realized that a few moments after I posted it. Anyone can contact me via Wiki mail and I will send them the link. Also of note, the summer semester is wrapping up over the next few days so I am being inundated with due papers and finals so if I go a few days without posting or checking up on the MCOTM, I have not jumped ship, I am just up to my eyeballs in work.

New Wikipedia study

The study is [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4511054/ Analysis of reference sources used in drug-related Wikipedia articles]. Apparently &quot;Wikipedia articles for the evaluated drugs tended to cite a wide variety of sources, with journal articles, commercial websites, news articles, and government websites being the most common sources cited.&quot; It seems about half the references are to peer-reviewed journal articles, which is good. However, the same study says that &quot;Wikipedia articles rarely cited evidence-based guidelines, which are generally considered to be important sources of drug information for clinical practitioners.&quot; Everymorning talk 14:13, 31 July 2015 (UTC)
An important limitation that is inherent to this type of research is that Internet-based information resources are constantly changing and being updated; thus, the types of sources used and the speed or frequency of information update may change as time goes on[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4511054/]--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 14:41, 31 July 2015 (UTC)
Most scientific journals are paywalled, the other sources (news, companies and government) are not. So if as many as half the cites in pharmaceutical articles are from journals we're actually doing pretty well. Roger (Dodger67) (talk) 19:03, 31 July 2015 (UTC)
Most of us I believe have access to paywalled content, and for those who don't you can always ask here for journal articles. As for news and company pages we shouldn't be using them for anything medical related and it's a shame they don't break those up into more detailed stats. -- CFCF üçå () 21:12, 31 July 2015 (UTC)
Many editors likely have institutional affiliations that come with good journal access, while readers mostly don't. I always try to use OA papers where possible, but that's easier in basic than in clinical research. They don't seem to have done much to break down what the sources were used for - obviously an article that discusses the marketing of a particular drug, or the history of its discovery, or its chemical properties, etc. will have a different mix of sources than the subsections specifically about medical information. This is a recurrent problem with research intended to compare &quot;medical information&quot; on Wikipedia to traditional sources, and IMO making too much effort to do better in these sorts of comparisons worsens the already detectable skew toward assuming the reader is looking for patient information rather than other encyclopedic content. Opabinia regalis (talk) 21:18, 31 July 2015 (UTC)
Most editors don't have paywalled access, which is why  is so important.
Our articles about drugs ought to cite news and other types of sources.  That's because they're encyclopedia articles, not drug articles, and therefore should contain a wide variety of information, including non-medical information.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 02:02, 1 August 2015 (UTC)

News items like &quot;Students targeted in MenW vaccination programme&quot; [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-33736761] make me think that users are likely to be searching for terms such as MenW or Men W (or Men A, etc, etc...)

MEDRS 

Help needed to discuss whether economic papers on public health are (or need to be) MEDRS, please: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Mass_deworming#Are_these_references_MEDRS.3F JMWt (talk) 08:13, 5 August 2015 (UTC)
  I see what you are trying to do here, but your edits have minimised the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mass_deworming&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=674654126&amp;oldid=674648486 considerable controversy raging] about the applicability of the results of the study. I'm not sure your solution of simply removing anything else is going to help a reader understand why there is a controversy.  Removing the criticisms in this way is not helping MEDRS, in my opinion.  Also, the page was originally written under the  which specifically has a section for criticisms.  I think in conclusion you've just widened MEDRS beyond what is helping in discussing a controversial topic which goes beyond simple medical results.JMWt (talk) 09:10, 5 August 2015 (UTC)
 If there truly is a controversy raging then that controversy will be covered in high-quality secondary sources we can use. If the controversy can only be shown be stringing together a load of weak sources then we need to wait until the &quot;controversy&quot; becomes an accepted thing in itself we can report. We can't question a Cochrane review using material from think tanks and the like ... and of course we shouldn't &quot;teach the controversy&quot; as that is inherently non-neutral. Alexbrn (talk) 09:20, 5 August 2015 (UTC)
 Whilst I see that the layout may needed to be improved, I dislike this swooping down and removing whole sections from a page when the sources are debating findings from other papers, which themselves are not primarily medical.  Plus, as I said, the page was not even originally written under the MoS of medical pages anyway. I think the controversy should be referenced, as with many other pages upon which the WP Sanitation is working on.  JMWt (talk) 09:38, 5 August 2015 (UTC)
 It's not just MEDRS, it's neutrality. If (as seems the case) there's a consenus in medical science that the benefits of mass de-worming isn't strongly evidenced, then it's just not neutral to give that a couple of sentences and then have a whole section with a ton of weaker references debunking it. There a nice lofty piece on [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/47a312ae-2fe8-11e5-91ac-a5e17d9b4cff.html ft.com] that covers the dismay with which the latest Cochrane findings have been greeted in some quarters, and this might be useful for a brief mention of the &quot;controversy&quot;, but for the medical evidence we need to put the weight on the best medical sources. Alexbrn (talk) 10:20, 5 August 2015 (UTC)

Lack of editorial judgment

While I don't have much to add to the above discussion I agree there are actual cases of poor judgment concerning images on Wikipedia. Hydrocephalus is a relatively common disorder and is normally treatable. The article currently lacks any prognosis section, but includes one image of a preserved specimen akin to what was featured at side-shows.

The image is very distasteful to me, not because of the condition, but because of the way it is treated. The &quot;specimen&quot; looks to be numbered and preserved in formalin some time during the 19th century. I think we should do our best to find a replacement image, because this is seriously bad for our credibility and is not informative to our readers. -- CFCF üçå () 11:58, 4 August 2015 (UTC)


Agree second image more appropriate, in this case. Matthew Ferguson (talk) 15:06, 4 August 2015 (UTC)
I have tried to explain more in the caption to the first image (&quot;Historical specimen of an infant with severe hydrocephalus, probably untreated&quot;), but not averse to it going. I've added the second one as &quot;Baby recovering from surgery&quot;.  Johnbod (talk) 15:18, 4 August 2015 (UTC)
Thanks . I will see if I can get anything better for the first section and maybe we can move that image down to the history section. I don't find it improper to include the image, it just has to be done in a way where some form of explanation is given. The 19th century was grim and there is nothing wrong in highlighting that, but having these images as the visually most prominent is just morbid and uninformative. -- CFCF üçå () 13:40, 5 August 2015 (UTC)

Angry blog post about us/Massive sockpuppet at large

Wikipedia readers demand pancakes


There is something very strange about the pancake article.

The traffic to this article has been 5000/views per day for some months. This puts it among the top 0.01% of Wikipedia articles by popularity, which makes it much more popular than any other food or beverage. The only food concepts which are more popular than the pancake article are [http://stats.grok.se/en/latest/McDonald%27s McDonald's], [http://stats.grok.se/en/latest/Coca-Cola Coca-Cola], [http://stats.grok.se/en/latest/Absinthe absinthe], and [http://stats.grok.se/en/latest/Cannabis cannabis]. Pi is more popular but is not pie and dog is more popular but probably not for food, just as cricket is a food but not popular for that reason.

I checked the top 3000 articles by traffic, which are updated weekly. Occasionally something will sneak in for news coverage for a short period of time, but pancakes have been consistently popular for the last year. Banana is the only other food in the top 3000, and it ranks around 2800 to pancake at 2500.

I was looking at this to think about nutrition. I was wondering if people were searching for some diet or something, but pancake seems to be the major entry to Wikipedia for food information. Are people searching for a recipe? I note also that 10% of people searching for pancake do so from a mobile device, while 50% of the traffic to banana are people using mobile devices.

Are pancakes really the food of universal interest? Why are people so crazy for encyclopedic information on pancakes? I searched PubMed for pancakes. There are a lot of doctors named Dr. Pancake plus also I made pancake syndrome so that we have some presence in this popular article.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 19:11, 31 July 2015 (UTC)

That pancake syndrome factor... See, that's why my pancakes are usually store-bought (in other words...already made, not homemade). Flyer22 (talk) 19:18, 31 July 2015 (UTC)

interesting--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 19:32, 31 July 2015 (UTC)
How reliable is this data? The bottom of the percent-mobile list contains some junk, and some other oddball outliers - e.g. the disambiguation page Ddd apparently gets 290,000 views, but with 0.14% from mobile. Or the #2 ranked article overall, with some 5 million views, 100% of which are from mobile, is... Angelsberg? A two-sentence stub about a town of 300 people in Luxembourg, which [http://stats.grok.se/en/latest/Angelsberg grok.se] says has been viewed about 400 times in the last month? 
I could go for pancakes right now, though. Opabinia regalis (talk) 21:00, 1 August 2015 (UTC)


 The data is suspect generally. I live in New York and meet a lot of people who work in the field of web traffic reporting, and have come to believe that the entire field is screwball with a lot of people making a lot of things up no matter where they work, what academic or respectable publication they use to publish, or who endorses the work. Still, the data can mean something sometimes, and I really do think something unusual is happening with the pancake article.
 used the word attack and I think that it is possible that the pancake article is being attacked. Other popular food articles are coffee, wine, and chocolate, and all of them get less traffic despite them all having a major web presence and large communities which discuss them continually. There are no pancake social groups that discuss pancakes endlessly like those things are discussed. It could be that since pancakes are one of the easiest things to cook at home then people are looking for a recipe, but I am not sure.
The other odd thing here is that the traffic is so consistent. Most Wikipedia articles have traffic that fluctuates weekends versus weekdays, or in summer versus winter. The traffic to pancake is steady every day, which makes me think that perhaps a bot is involved somehow.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 15:30, 2 August 2015 (UTC)
With no detectable periodicity, it's definitely strange. (Maybe someone thinks it's funny for the pancake traffic to be flat? ;) But I'm not convinced this is real traffic of unknown origin, as opposed to some kind of data collection glitch. [http://stats.grok.se/en/latest90/Ddd Traffic to Ddd] looks the same - high and flat. And this is the same dataset that tells us there were five million hits from people looking up Angelsberg, Luxembourg on their phones last week - for anyone who believes that, I have a bridge in Angelsberg to sell you. Today's update says six million views for nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, almost all on desktop - well, that's one of my favorite topics and I'd love to see that much interest in it, but there is no goddamn way that's true. Opabinia regalis (talk) 19:42, 2 August 2015 (UTC)

 I'm sure this is people looking for recipes and either the browser preloads the Wikipedia page or people think that there might be a good pancake recipe on Wikipedia. JFW | T@lk 11:33, 3 August 2015 (UTC)
You get these strange anomalies - for quite a while (several months) the obscure topic of bone char got over 10K views a day ([http://stats.grok.se/en/201311/Bone_char as here]); now it gets about 500.

Oppose
*Strongly, strongly oppose. This may be the only time I ever post on this page.  The AFT5 tool resulted in massive waste of time of editors. Almost zero &quot;feedback&quot; was useful and even the information classified as &quot;useful&quot; was usually at the level of &quot;needs more photos&quot; for pages that already had six images, or &quot;needs more information about [completely off-topic information].&quot;  It was deliberately not added to medical articles because even the people who created it realised that what you would get is &quot;so I have this funny lump here, does that mean I have Disease XXX?&quot;  We have few enough knowledgeable and wiki-skilled editors in this area; you should not be wasting your time in this way. Even having to take the time to point to the medical disclaimer is bad use of your time.  There was never a benefit to this tool - it's why it isn't used anymore. The software is very dodgy and would require rewriting and then ongoing maintenance; it's just plain a bad investment of time and energy on the part of everyone.

*:. We need more reader feedback. Given your opposition to AFT5, how would you propose we get it? ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ Peter (Southwood) (talk): 06:23, 20 July 2015 (UTC)
*::What do you want the feedback for? You need to really know the answer to that question before you know what type of tool is best suited. We know from the experience of the AFT5 tool that readers who wrote anything were (a) asking for information that was either inappropriate for Wikipedia to provide - a very serious risk for medical articles or (b) making suggestions for &quot;improvement&quot; that were heavily biased or were inappropriate for the particular article (&quot;GMOs kill people, why are you supporting them?&quot; or &quot;Why doesn't the 7/7 article mention [name your favourite conspiracy theory]?&quot;) or (c) were personal stories (e.g., on the article about a certain city, &quot;I was there last summer, and you should talk about the great restaurants!&quot;) Less than 1% of feedback was either actionable or an assessment of the value/quality of the information provided. Meanwhile, all of the feedback had to be reviewed because people posted really inappropriate information (BLP violations, personal information like phone numbers, personal attacks, editor abuse) that needed to be removed from public view, thus making a lot of work for almost no beneficial gain. Even if there was actionable feedback, that still required someone being able and willing to act upon it.  Effective feedback tools, especially on a project that is deliberately intended to be highly transparent, are very difficult to design. They're also almost always very labour-intensive. Unless you have a very clear idea of exactly what kind of feedback you want to elicit, and you have an action plan on how you will address the feedback you get that does not impose additional workload or burden on editors outside of the project, I'd suggest that your statement that you &quot;need&quot; more reader feedback is perhaps premature at best. One of the groups significantly impacted when it was turned on before were the oversighters, who were hitting about 50-70 requests a month for this tool alone; it made up about 15-20% of the suppression workload. Risker (talk) 07:03, 20 July 2015 (UTC)
*:::For starters I would like a tool which is easily visible to the reader, with obvious function, which allows me to specify the type of feedback I want, will allow the reader to easily abort if/when they realise this is not where they need to be, and is only activated on demand, by the person/s who will get the notification, and who is/are looking for the specified feedback. i.e, a tool, not a spam generator. Ideally it would allow me to reply to the user, usually needed to clarify the feedback, as many people do not know how to explain what they want in the first attempt. Technically the talk page should do most of these things, but it does not. Partly, I suspect, because many if not most readers do not know it is there, or if they do, don't have a clue how to use it (our user-unfriendly software again), and partly because the talk page is not a good way to ask people for specific information when you are fairly sure they will never read it. This should impose no burden on people other than those voluntarily watching the feedback system for the specific article, other than creating it in the first place. I speak only for myself, but I think such a tool would serve the purposes of this project, and others, adequately. By the way, I made use of AFT5, and agree with most of your criticism. I suggested several improvements, but nothing happened. It was mostly a waste of time, but a small number of articles that I watch were significantly improved by using reader feedback.  ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ Peter (Southwood) (talk): 10:28, 20 July 2015 (UTC)
*::::  Both Peter and I found the AFT useful for scuba-related articles where a significant proportion of the feedback indicated deficiencies in articles that we could address. In helping to expose issues in articles from a reader's perspective, such feedback helped prioritise our efforts and allowed us to &quot;see the wood from the trees&quot;. Does that help illustrate what we would use feedback for? According to , &quot;12% of posts were marked as useful&quot;. We may have been lucky at WPSCUBA, but my impression was that we had better results than that - this implies that a particular project, like WPMED, may achieve better results than average, if the tool is well-designed. I believe we have a strong and very active group of editors at WPMED and still maintain that we have sufficient resources to cope with feedback. This would be especially true if there were a mechanism for notifications of feedback to appear on a sub-page of this project, a little like how the recent changes feed appears, perhaps? I take your point about oversighters, but there are currently  users with that right. If a 25% increase in their numbers would have compensated for the extra workload over the entire project with  articles, I estimate that just 0.09 more oversighters would be needed to deal with work arising from feedback from the 33,596 articles in WPMED's scope. Heck, even I would volunteer to do that job, just one day per fortnight. --RexxS (talk) 16:27, 20 July 2015 (UTC)
*:::::I think we already know what the (useful) feedback will be on most articles:  Readers want to know the prognosis.  That was the #1 request on all the disease-related articles that I followed when AFT5 was open.  They also asked for pictures, but that was the suggested feedback, so that might be overrepresented.  And they wanted articles written in plain old English, not in medicalese.  I also found it useful on occasion (also more than the 12% average), but since the #1 request remains unfulfilled, I don't think that we really need it to be able to improve the articles. On a more practical level, I doubt that this wish will be fulfilled.  There are some open questions about whether the code needs dev time before it could run again.  There a sitewide RFC led to it being disabled here, and this is &quot;local consensus&quot; at best.  Also, unless someone here is an oversighter and wants to volunteer to manage the inevitable problems ‚Äì 's here occasionally, but I doubt that she wants to deal with this again ‚Äì then I think that the opposition from oversighters should be taken seriously.  It would not be kind or collegial of us to volunteer to increase their workload over their objections.  And stuff that needs oversighting can't be left around for a fortnight:  it needs to be killed as soon as it's noticed, ideally within minutes.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:41, 20 July 2015 (UTC)
*:::::: Yes, sorry, that was my (unsuccessful) attempt to inject a little levity. I was not suggesting that we wait two weeks to perform oversight, only that the additional workload on oversighters would seem to be equivalent to a requirement for an extra oversighter one day every couple of weeks. Perhaps I should have made the analogy that one extra oversighter would likely be able to accommodate feedback from around a dozen projects the size of WPMED. --RexxS (talk) 19:56, 20 July 2015 (UTC)

*::::::::: would you be okay with its use for research purposes? And by research I do not mean research to improve the tool but research to determine what our readers think? Doc James (talk ¬∑  ¬∑ ) 01:15, 22 July 2015 (UTC)
Generally speaking, I think it is always a bad idea to activate software that is completely unsupported by anyone and was known to need significant rewriting even at the time that it was used.  It is kind of the equivalent of restarting a car that hasn't been running for a couple of years and was taken off the road because it was belching smoke in order to test whether or not it improves air quality. I suggest if you want to start it up again, first it is necessary to have a (non-WMF) developer to carefully review the code, ensure that it meets the expectations for publicly visible user-created content, and then agree to remain available for any future issues. (Note: Expectations for user-created content are that it must be able to be deleted, it must be able to be edited by others, it must be able to be suppressed, and it must show up in checkuser, recent changes, and publicly-available logs specific to the content type. Any user-created content is essentially &quot;community property&quot;, and it must be able to be curated by the community.)   I specify a non-WMF developer because this is an extension that has consciously been de-activated by the WMF based on the results of the earlier trial (and let's be clear, the previous activation *was* a trial), and this isn't appropriate for even community tech because the community has already spoken on this issue. I remain gravely concerned that you will get a lot of personal stories and personal information from readers who do not understand that whatever they write will be publicly visible, or perhaps believe that a medical professional will contact them to provide them with advice or person-specific information, if the tool is tested on a page pertaining to a specific illness, condition, or treatment. Such posts should almost always be suppressed (&quot;hiding&quot; isn't nearly enough since almost everyone can see the hidden posts). And I'm still not seeing any evidence that there has been consideration of exactly what type of feedback is being sought, and what the action plan is to address both the desirable and the undesirable feedback.  I will remind you that there is already a feedback mechanism - the talk page of the article - and that a first step may simply be to include a banner pointing to that, which can probably be done by a template rather than activating a disused extension with its heavy overhead.  Risker (talk) 01:45, 22 July 2015 (UTC)
Yes not sure what shape the peice of software is in. I agree it is not important enough to deserve either foundation or tech team resources. I only propose it if it is as simple as 10 to 20 minutes to turn it on again. Yes more or less the same thing can be done with templates.

*Moderate oppose.  I actually don't care all that much, because the feedback isn't hard to ignore.  I wonder how many of the supporters actually tried to use it in its earlier incarnation?  I certainly did.  I was initially quite enthusiastic, and made a serious effort to look at the feedback and react to it.  But after a month or so I ran out of steam -- I just wasn't getting enough value from it to motivate the effort it required.  I can't see any reason why things would be different now.

*Oppose pending defined boundaries I am in favor of experimentation but not in favor of establishing projects which can consume volunteer time without being documented or supported. One way that could make me change my oppose to support would be defining a limit to the number of articles which have this tool turned on, suggesting a time checkpoint for reconsidering this experiment, and promising some reporting of outcomes. Here are some boundaries which, if set, would make me feel encouraged to support - turn on for 100 articles, watch for 12 months, then if by 15 months there must be reporting and reconsideration of experiment status. If the feedback is not being considered or used and if otherwise there are not signs that this tool is having a positive effect then it should be turned off. I feel that the tool is a net harm if it results in volunteers committing labor to make suggestions but in return there is no one responding to feedback. Based on past usage, we should assume that Wikipedians will not respond to feedback and that there is no reason to believe that allowing users to give feedback results in a positive outcome. I am willing to reconsider but I would like this project framed as a question in some light community-managed research.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 18:39, 23 July 2015 (UTC)

Discuss
The pilot was run with the purpose of engaging readers, rather than as a tool to help editors, and was evaluated as such. Looking at the project report at , the two major obstacles were the editor time involved in moderating the feedback, and the opposition of the majority of editors on each site. If we are to have the tool turned back on for medical articles (+ anatomy, physiology &amp; pharma, perhaps), we are going to have to make the case that (i) there is a benefit to our editors as well as readers; and that (ii) we have sufficient editor resources within our WikiProject to cope with the feedback without straining those resources. I believe we are capable of meeting those two requirements, but I still feel we will have to spend some time and effort in making the case. On balance, I think that's a net benefit and I support for that reason. --RexxS (talk) 23:36, 19 July 2015 (UTC)
I can't remember the details, but there are problems with the software and particularly the user interface, which is somewhat confusing to the reader and elicits a high percentage of useless responses. That aside, I found it (marginally) more useful than not. Getting it restored for a major project might get the coders to respond to requests for improvements, which would be a step towards getting it acceptable to more of the community. However it should be implemented as an opt-in, to be switched on for an article where someone will watch it, as it does not yet have any way to notify an interested user directly of a change. ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ Peter (Southwood) (talk): 05:34, 20 July 2015 (UTC)
Maybe only activatable by an admin or researcher? Doc James (talk ¬∑  ¬∑ ) 18:10, 21 July 2015 (UTC)
I'd have thought that if you want to gather useful data about the benefits (or otherwise) of the feedback tool, it would be better to try it out on a random selection of articles, rather than selecting specific ones. AndyTheGrump (talk) 20:22, 21 July 2015 (UTC)
In an ideal world there would be the same amount of activity over all articles, but the fact is many of us have only a subset we work on. Activating the feedback tool randomly would garner the same useless responses as in a site-wide trial. If we focus activation we can analyze the reasons behind specific responses.
I find it interesting that the most vocal opposistion is from people who do not engage in our project. I would hope the members of WikiProject Medicine could be allowed to decide for themselves what is the best use of their time instead of having someone uninvolved dictate it for them. -- CFCF üçå () 20:46, 21 July 2015 (UTC)
Would it be possible to include both a scale rating (as in version 4 of the tool) as well as a feedback form with specific comments? Currently there is no easy way for readers of Wikipedia to give feedback on how useful they found the article. Version 4's four ratings for trustworthiness, objectivity, completeness and writing quality does not cover this. Does anyone know if it would be difficult to change the questions? Mrjohncummings (talk) 00:30, 22 July 2015 (UTC)
I would be happy to just have it work on a small set of article. Articles would be changed from time to time. Once people have collected data on those articles or no longer need the data it would be turned off on those article.
I am not proposing this tool for general use. Only as a tool for editors or researchers who want it and will use the data. Agree we do not need to collect unneeded data. Doc James (talk ¬∑  ¬∑ ) 01:10, 22 July 2015 (UTC)
The last time it was in use there was absolutely nothing a user could do to mitigate the extremely poorly chosen features and customise it to ask more specific and useful questions of the reader (and stop it from encouraging useless input).

 It generated no comments (but that's probably because the article is perfect ). Maybe if you ask specifically for expert commentary, or ask for input on a specific aspect of the article people will be more likely to respond.

As someone above suggested, if you use this method, you can monitor the responses just by watchlisting the talk pages. --Anthonyhcole (talk ¬∑  ¬∑ )  12:20, 22 July 2015 (UTC)

Yep. It's effectively the same thing. --Anthonyhcole (talk ¬∑  ¬∑ )  11:07, 23 July 2015 (UTC)

Building a new tool

Perhaps a template can be developed which will do what is needed (as Risker suggested above). Something that can be added to the bottom of an article, maybe with a big button with thumbs up/thumbs down icons and some text inviting feedback, that when clicked takes the user to a talk page subpage, opens an edit, fills in a feedback header, prompts a few responses if desired and instructs the user how to abort or save. Something like this would be customisable to suit a wide range of applications, and would be open to anyone to improve. If, of course, it is possible. I am no templating expert. ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ Peter (Southwood) (talk): 08:32, 22 July 2015 (UTC)

This approach has several advantages over AFT5. (not difficult to achieve)
* You can watch the relevant pages
* It can be customised easily
* It can be used by anyone who takes on the responsibility of looking after the results
* It can be removed from any place it causes problems. No admin burden involved - the project can manage it.
* It is essentially a talk page, just with training wheels. Talk pages are standard and already covered by policy. No RfC should be required. It does have some MOS implications, but MEDMOS should be able to cover it within this project.
* It could be portable to other projects (like Wikivoyage, as James suggested)
As a starter, I suggest interested parties make up a list of:
* what they want the tool to look like on the article page
* what information they want to get from the readers
* how they propose to get useful information out of the reader
* how they intend to prevent/minimise oversight burden, and how the burden which actually gets through in spite of everything should be handled ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ Peter (Southwood) (talk): 08:47, 22 July 2015 (UTC)

**Thanks . Agree that this will do the trick without needing to restore a controversial piece of software that is unmaintained. Doc James (talk ¬∑  ¬∑ ) 22:02, 22 July 2015 (UTC)

I'd be curious to know how many of our 30,000 medical articles actually receive reader comments in an average month. I suspect it's a very, very tiny percentage. If so, to measure any effect from an invitation to comment, we should probably trial it on many, many articles. 

If you're talking about a time-limited trial, I'd support trialling it on a very large random sample, assuming the invitation isn't hidious. I'd also support putting it at the top of the article where everyone will see it. --Anthonyhcole (talk ¬∑  ¬∑ )  11:03, 23 July 2015 (UTC)

I would say each person should trial it on as many articles as they are prepared to include in their own watchlist, and deal with the feedback. Start small, if it is slow, add more until you are getting a satisfactory rate. I see no point in going random. I would only do it for articles I would be prepared to work on myself on the principle that if you ask for feedback you deal with it and don't leave someone else to pick up the pieces, as that will probably bring down the rest of Wikipedia like a ton of bricks, half of them claiming they told you so, and the other half demanding you prove you had consensus. As all comments are dated, it is relatively easy to keep track of changes. A suitably skilled person could probably write an app to give a monthly statistical report, but not me. Top of the article may be a better place for visibility. We could try both, see if there is a difference. ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ Peter (Southwood) (talk): 14:45, 23 July 2015 (UTC)
Yes agree with  individual editors should only ask for feedback on articles they are willing to full up on. Doc James (talk ¬∑  ¬∑ ) 09:55, 26 July 2015 (UTC)
The tool should contain a maintenance category tag to make it easier to find instances and to help get statistics. ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ Peter (Southwood) (talk): 06:39, 30 July 2015 (UTC)

Do we take this further or abandon the idea?
I see three options at present:

Postorgasmic illness syndrome (POIS) is a rare condition characterized by debilitating symptoms following orgasm that last for a few hours to several days. The phenomenon was first described in 2002. POIS is listed on the &quot;Rare Diseases&quot; website of the NIH: https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/gard/10809/postorgasmic-illness-syndrome/resources/1 . There are a few (literally, just a few) papers about it on PubMed: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Postorgasmic+Illness .

When I found the article, I was very confused by all the references. Higher quality references (academic papers) were jumbled together with news articles and websites. I am the one who separated the references into the groups because I actually thought (and still think) that it would reduce the clutter. I know other articles don't do this. But, just take a look at the References section. You can immediately find the academic papers and secondary sources. 
How do you suggest to fix this? Maybe reduce the number of reference groups to 2? One group could be academic papers and secondary sources and the other group could be everything else?

Dear medical experts:  The first of these two titles was about to be deleted as a stale draft. It had a lot of good information and references, but much of it was not specifically about the test, and also there was excessive technical detail.  Rather than see the work deleted, I moved some of the content to Beryllium poisoning, redirected the draft and moved it to its current mainspace titie.  Now, perhaps the experts here will decide that there should be an article about this specific test; in that case, by all means please feel free to revert my additions to the Beryllium poisoning article, undo the redirection and have a go at trimming the article about the test.

In any case, please check the appropriateness of the text and sources which I moved from the draft to Beryllium poisoning.  Also, I noticed that in a couple of places the article appears to be giving advice.‚ÄîAnne Delong (talk) 13:09, 7 August 2015 (UTC)

Introducing WikiProject Occupational Safety and Health (and myself)

Greetings, WikiProject Medicine,

I am James Hare, also known as  on Wikipedia. I would like to introduce myself as the newest Wikipedian in Residence at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. I will be working alongside Emily to improve Wikipedia's coverage of occupational safety and health issues; my role specifically focuses on training NIOSH staff and affiliates.

As part of my efforts, I have organized a  as our central hub for organizing our content improvement efforts with the community. I encourage anyone interested in OSH issues specifically to participate on the project. I am also interested in developing a central set of educational resources for people training others about Wikipedia, including cheat sheets, visualizations, presentation slide decks, and step-by-step guides. I would be very interested to see what you have all developed, especially since we work with similar audiences, and I would like to know what you want to see in such materials.

If you have any questions, my talk page is always open. Thank you, James Hare (NIOSH) (talk) 17:57, 7 August 2015 (UTC)

FoCuS, 
Can you explain the problem you're worried about?  &quot;OR&quot; means that the information on this page has never been published anywhere else in the world.

Cause vs Pathophysiology

Articles about diseases have a &quot;Cause&quot; and a &quot;Pathophysiology&quot; section. What's the difference between the two? I am working on the Postorgasmic illness syndrome article. Just finished the &quot;Cause&quot; section. Not sure what kind of material would go into the &quot;Pathophysiology&quot; section. POIS22 (talk) 21:29, 6 August 2015 (UTC)
My understanding has always been that &quot;pathophysiology&quot; describes the causal connection and mechanisms and processes between the cause and the effect while &quot;cause&quot; is for the underlying origin. See also Pathophysiology. Jo-Jo Eumerus (talk, ) 21:43, 6 August 2015 (UTC)
I'm sure others will explain better but if the article is carefully written, causes contains a list of etiologic factors (eg smoking) and pathophysiology details exactly how the cells are misbehaving to give the signs and symptoms of the condition. For what it's worth I often end up just writing o ne section called causes which contains all this information. Matthew Ferguson (talk) 21:47, 6 August 2015 (UTC)
 should always be followed--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 22:00, 6 August 2015 (UTC)
Of course.  The most important part about MEDMOS's &quot;Sections&quot; advice is that the sections need to be adapted, re-arranged, and combined for some articles.  You cannot follow MEDMOS correctly if you use exactly the same sections in every article.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 23:29, 8 August 2015 (UTC)
I'd argue that &quot;cause&quot; is really  aetiology leading to pathogenesis, whereas the specifics of what is happening in an active disease state is pathophysiology. --‚ÄîCyclonenim | Chat  11:11, 7 August 2015 (UTC)
We use &quot;cause&quot; for the overview of what brings about a condition either. This is either genetics or enviromental. It includes risk factors.
We use mechanisms / pathophysiology for the underlying changes that bring about the symptoms / disease. How the causes result in the symptoms. Doc James (talk ¬∑  ¬∑ ) 09:03, 8 August 2015 (UTC)
If I'm understanding your description correctly, the &quot;cause&quot; of influenza is infection by a type of virus, and the &quot;pathogenesis&quot; is stuff like the immune system's reaction to the virus (e.g., dumping a bunch of IL-2, which produces most of those lovely flu-like symptoms).

Help with re-drafting an article on an article on 'Altruism in Medicine Institute'
I drafted an article on [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Kerzin#Altruism_in_Medicine_Institute the above institute], the U.S. foundation created by Prof. Barry Kerzin, but it has been deleted for being 'too promotional'.

Hi MacPraughan,
What I see at that article is a very common &quot;mistake&quot;:  it talks about the &quot;mission&quot; and what's &quot;intended&quot;, but it doesn't talk about what it has actually accomplished.  It's really unusual for anyone to care about that.  (Think about a local food bank:  do you want to read their mission statement, or do you want to know how many people had enough food to eat?)  Also, perhaps I am unusually cynical, but my immediate conclusion is that it's done absolutely nothing ‚Äì which might be true, since it sounds like it's new and is basically a vehicle for one guy's work, but if it's actually done anything beyond filling out some government paperwork and trying to get organized, then it would be better to talk about that, then to write glittering generalities about what the founder's high hopes.

I looked at Orthotics#Lower-limb orthoses, but found it difficult to understand.  On the other hand, the article being discussed isn't very detailed yet.  Are all four Orthotics#Ankle-foot orthosis types generally called &quot;walking boots&quot; or &quot;CAM boots&quot;?  The &quot;Orthotics&quot; article starts out &quot;Orthotics is a specialty within the medical field concerned with the design, manufacture and application of orthoses&quot;, so it seems to me that this is a general article about this field.  If there was a section about every orthotic gadget, the article would be very long indeed.  You'll notice that the &quot;Foot orthosis&quot; section has a link to the main article Shoe insert.   I have moved the draft to Walking boot for now, so it won't be deleted.  If you medical guys decide it's not needed, it can be redirected; or, you may wish to enlarge it and have less detail in the Orthotics article.‚ÄîAnne Delong (talk) 03:20, 10 August 2015 (UTC)

very curious (and different)--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 12:18, 10 August 2015 (UTC)
This is part of a trend toward medicalization of sex and a backlash against it. I went to a presentation in which a doctor said that an aphrodisiac drug called Flibanserin is being promoted as advancing women's rights. The clinical trials seem ambiguous or that the drug is harmful, but the company trying to get FDA approval with a strategy including public seeking outcry that the FDA promotes male sexuality but withholds drugs from women. The patent for this drug is held by a company which has that patent as their sole asset. I do not understand pharma marketing, and maybe the presentation of this drug to the marketplace is orderly, but it seems suspect to me when a holding company is created only for the purpose of marketing one drug.
Sexuality is a battleground. I did ethics review on some clinical trials which recommend circumcision for people at high risk of contracting HIV and deciding what information to give the public in health education campaigns is difficult. I think Wikipedia has the best information of any source but the reality is still that all available information is confusing, poor quality, and not compiled thoughtfully. Wherever there is discussion of circumcision there are people who are angry.
It means a lot to me that Wikipedia has coverage of sexuality. Most people in the Western World have no other ways to access information on this topic, and people elsewhere frequently have no other options for information.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 12:25, 10 August 2015 (UTC)

Translation tool is cool
At Wikimania 2015 a new beta feature was introduced to assist with translations. See documentation at , but actually, that documentation is boring and does not communicate well. I think the only way to understand it is to use it. I am about to give instructions for using it.

This tool actually works and it is worth testing even if you only speak English. Consider choosing any  and translating it from English Wikipedia to Simple English Wikipedia.

Here are instructions -
#Go to your settings to the Beta Features Tab. This should be a direct link - 
#Click the &quot;Content Translation&quot; box to turn it on
#Go to 
#Go to your contributions page. Simple English calls this &quot;My changes&quot;.
#There should be a big obvious button at top which says &quot;translation&quot;. Click it.
#An interface opens. It asks some questions. Give it the featured article you like on English Wikipedia which does not exist in Simple English.
#Translate as much as you like.

Here are my thoughts.
*It works, and it is intuitive
*I could never imagine typical people enjoying Wikipedia translation. Now I can imagine people doing translation for their first edits.
*This tool does a great job of migrating citations in translations.
*I got bored and just translated article leads. I can imagine others would do only this much also. For this reason, I think we should reconsider citations in the lead.

If anyone else tries out the tool then please share reactions. I think this could be big for WikiProject Medicine. For those who do not know, there is a health translation project at , the &quot;Translation Task Force&quot;.  and  are chief instigators there. Now it seems like it is much easier for more people to get involved.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 14:05, 11 August 2015 (UTC)

We have an article at Bloodless surgery, and it's incomplete and weak on everything except name-checking historical proponents.  It barely mentions HIV, for example, despite that being a major force behind reducing the need for blood transfusions during surgery.  
There's no general page about Bloodless medicine, which would include things like the reduction in blood transfusions for people with leukemias or hemophilia (also major practice changes compared to 1980, caused by HIV).

I signaled the newly established .  Blue Rasberry (talk) 13:39, 5 August 2015 (UTC)
Please do not crop off the head. Please use the entire image. They did release it under an open license. And I image got appropriate consent. Doc James (talk ¬∑  ¬∑ ) 14:34, 5 August 2015 (UTC)
How is this of interest to that wikiproject? Matthew Ferguson (talk) 19:47, 5 August 2015 (UTC)
 In the past people interested in women's issues have sought to comment on model consent of women in medical images. One case is at . I would like for Wikipedia to develop more clarity on what is best.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 11:04, 6 August 2015 (UTC)
That patient has a remarkable number of comorbidities, to the point that I doubt the image is really useful for any article on a single disease.   Since there is a question of cropping the picture to not show her head, then I'll point out just one, which is craniostenosis.  That would change the shape of the head and therefore be misleading if that's presented as how a Marfan's patient looks.
Also, it's a photo taken in a private place of an identifiable intellectually disabled 13 year old wearing only her panties.  The consent standard for that is very high:  I would not be surprised if Commons required the uploader to assert that he has a clear statement from the legal guardians not just that &quot;uploading it to Commons&quot; or &quot;putting it in Wikipedia&quot; is okay, but that they agree that it could be modified and used for non-educational purposes.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 05:51, 6 August 2015 (UTC)
From the paper:

Consent

Written informed consent was obtained from the patient's parents for the publication of this case report and accompanying images. A copy of the consent form is available for review by the Editor-in-Chief of this journal.

This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

I don't think you can get more clear than that. On the other hand I will not personally upload an uncropped version, although I will not object with anyone else doing so from: [http://www.molecularcytogenetics.org/content/5/1/5/figure/F1?highres=y the full image]. As for comorbidities the only one that isn't directly associated with Marfan's is craniostenosis as far as I can tell, so it should be a good image (see Ghent criteria). -- CFCF üçå () 09:31, 6 August 2015 (UTC)

While I don't dispute the copyright question, nor do I doubt that the legally-appropriate consent forms were signed, I believe that we still ought to be reluctant to post identifiable images of this ‚Äì or any ‚Äì patient's face, absent a very strong and specific educational reason to do so.  (And indeed, some of the comments above note the presence of atypical comorbidities which make this a less-than-ideal case to present.)  Given Wikipedia's reach and wide accessibility, we quite literally have the power to make this nearly-naked, intellectually-disabled, teenaged girl the poster child for Marfan syndrome.  This is a power that we should use only with the utmost caution.  It is likely that the image we choose will stay on Wikipedia's article for years to come.
Bluntly, I do also suspect that this patient's parents may not have fully appreciated the consequences (indeed, this particular consequence) of releasing their daughter's images for use in an open access journal article under a CC license.  While there's no difference in copyright, there's a huge difference in exposure in going from a minor journal read by a few scientific and medical experts to the world's largest encyclopedia on very nearly the world's most-visited website.  (As an aside, there is probably a broader discussion that should take place among medical ethicists and OA journal publishers and editors about what sort of consents should be required in these situations, what types of images should be freely-licensed, and what level of protection of privacy and identity is appropriate.) TenOfAllTrades(talk) 13:12, 6 August 2015 (UTC)
I agree with TenOfAllTrades, I think it important not to cross a certain ethical line (though legal)--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 15:40, 6 August 2015 (UTC)
I would agree it sums up my reasons for cropping out her head. There are of course other ways of deidenifying her as well, such as blurring her face etc. If we are unwilling to use any such method I imagine an organization such as marfan.org would be willing to donate an image. That way we would have one where we know the individual is aware of the implications. (P.S. The co-morbidities are excellent examples of co-morbidities associated with Marfans ‚Äì apart from the ones that affect the shape of her head). -- CFCF üçå () 16:43, 6 August 2015 (UTC)
CC-BY is about copyright.  It is not a model release.  We need both.  It sounds like you could get a copy of the model release (and therefore find out what its limitations are) by contacting the journal's editor. 
I would rather have an image donated expressly for the purpose by an organization.  This one does not feel typical to me in any respect.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 19:46, 6 August 2015 (UTC)
If we got expressed content from the parents to use the image would that be okay? Many people are interested in helping other people who may have their condition. Doc James (talk ¬∑  ¬∑ ) 09:29, 8 August 2015 (UTC)
It's not immediately obvious to me the benefit that would accrue ‚Äì to Wikipedia, to Wikipedia's readers, to the patient, to her family, or to other individuals with Marfan syndrome ‚Äì from (re)publishing a version of the image that makes the patient clearly identifiable versus using a cropped ‚Äì or otherwise anonymized ‚Äì image. 
As a second, distinct, and less important point that doesn't touch on any ethical questions, I gather from the remarks above that craniostenosis is a rare and atypical comorbidity; we (and our readers) could arguably be better served if we omit that feature.  TenOfAllTrades(talk) 14:01, 8 August 2015 (UTC)
A little late to the table here but I too am uncomfortable with this image, of a child dressed only in her underpants, used to illustrate the disease. I do not think this treats the girl with the dignity she deserves, nor do I think such an image treats sufferers of the disease with the dignity they deserve. We may be legally in the clear but as  states this image does not feel typical in any way, and I hope we do not use many images of this ilk in our articles. --Tom (LT) (talk) 00:46, 15 August 2015 (UTC)

The Hum

I have been disturbed for some time by , an article whose title is essentially OR, a synthesis from colloquial names for a phenomenon that has no consensus name; a UK government document described it as low frequency noise. There is some activist editing of the article. There is a false dichotomy presented between those who do and do not hear the noise - a red flag, since it's a subjective syndrome and likely to be self-reinforcing and prone to people's ideas of cause, which may in turn be drawn from echo chambers (as with autism as a purported vaccine injury). 

I think it would be helpful if people with access to the literature could have a look over it - it may be that my understanding is out of date. I do get low frequency hum as well as tinnitus, so I have looked it up, but I don't have access to more than abstracts. Guy (Help!) 15:49, 11 August 2015 (UTC)

Ishihara Color Blindness Test

Hello once more, medical experts.  The draft article  was declined at AfC because there was already an article Ishihara Test.  The reviewer recommended that the information be moved to the existing article, but the editor did not do this.  I have moved a small amount of non-medical information myself, moved the draft to Ishihara Color Blindness Test and redirected it to Ishihara Test.  There is a lot more information, some sourced, some not, in the history of the redirect at https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ishihara_Color_Blindness_Test&amp;oldid=643820314 .

Edits lost behind bots

This could potentially make it very easy to hide things behind bots by simply adding a  tag after a controversial edit and waiting for a bot to cover up the tracks. Would it be possible to write a bot that could look out for these types of controversial edits on medical articles? It shouldn't be that hard to create a list of topics that need some extra scrutiny. -- CFCF üçå () 14:40, 15 August 2015 (UTC)
Basically this is a problem with how watchlists work.  What ought to happen is that if you activate the &quot;ignore bot edits&quot; option, then your watchlist will show the most recent edit that was not a bot edit.  What actually happens is that if the most recent edit was a bot edit and you don't have &quot;show all edits, not just the most recent&quot; activated, then you won't see the edit at all.  Same story for minor edits.  I have been complaining about this off and on for years -- maybe if other people would ask for a change too something might eventually happen. Looie496 (talk) 15:09, 15 August 2015 (UTC)
That is one dimension to it as well, but actually it is also possible to add several edits in a row, having secondary edits obscure more controversial ones - so I still believe a bot could be necessary. That said I definately take part of writing a letter to the developers about how the watchlist treats bot edits. -- CFCF üçå () 15:28, 15 August 2015 (UTC)

Does every sentence need a visible citation
I have been adding citations to every sentence of the leads of our articles. When multiple sentence in a row are supported by the same sentence I occasionally hide some of them.

It appears that some of our readers want every sentence referenced and every reference visible per [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alcoholism&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=661936124&amp;oldid=661703388].

Doc James (talk ¬∑  ¬∑ ) 14:00, 16 August 2015 (UTC)
I know you like sources in the lead so that it is quicker/better for people wanting to rapidly drill down to the relevant sources, but in general  opposes the use of references in the lead unless something is controversial.  I struggle with people who tag the lead for CN and don't bother reading the body to see if the content has clear support there.  In this case, they should have removed &quot;blood tests&quot; from the discussion of diagnosis in the lead, since blood tests are not part of the diagnosis of alcholism, but rather for recent alcohol use.  I just [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alcoholism&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=676370960&amp;oldid=676361880 fixed that].Jytdog (talk) 15:17, 16 August 2015 (UTC)

My thought about the stated problem is:  you should go to  and remove the checkmark from any option that says to hide edits from you (except maybe hiding your own).  
My thought about the situation at the article is:  That editor has more than 7,000 edits, and therefore could reasonably be expected to answer a question left on the user talk page.  Start there.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 01:49, 17 August 2015 (UTC)
