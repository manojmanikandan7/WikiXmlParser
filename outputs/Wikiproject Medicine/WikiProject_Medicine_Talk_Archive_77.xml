There's a new user who has [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Healingwounds uploaded a couple of photos] which are described as being of diabetic ulcers pre- and post-treatment. To me, they look somewhat unreal, but I'll admit to never having closely examined a diabetic ulcer. Could someone more experienced give their opinion?  DS (talk) 20:53, 7 January 2016 (UTC)
Meh, seems fairly plausible to me, although most images of diabetic ulcers I can find look like craters without granulation tissue (the rosa bits) around them.Jo-Jo Eumerus (talk, ) 21:27, 7 January 2016 (UTC)
*No way to confirm etiology if not part of a peer-reviewed report. The wound in the photo is definitely not typical, and therefore provides no instructional value (unless, again, associated with a peer-reviewed report that clarifies the instructive aspect(s)). â€” soupvector (talk) 03:33, 8 January 2016 (UTC)
Would you then suggest renaming the images? If so, to what? DS (talk) 01:45, 10 January 2016 (UTC)
I don't know the rules on evidence for an image name. Accurate names would include &quot;leg wound&quot; and &quot;healed leg wound&quot;. â€” soupvector (talk) 04:21, 10 January 2016 (UTC)
The rules are that we assume that the description is accurate.  Commons doesn't really care about verifiability.  On the Wikipedia side, what matters is that the image looks like the thing in question (e.g., is visually similar to images shown in textbooks on this subject).  Even if we later prove, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that these are photos of alien faces that just happen to look like leg wounds, they are still useful as images of leg wounds.
For this type of image, it's ideal to have images that are reasonably typical.  Determining whether the image is reasonably typical is done by knowledgeable editors discussing the question and coming to a consensus.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 04:42, 10 January 2016 (UTC)
Thanks for clarifying - very helpful. I've commented [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File_talk:Diabetic_non_healing_ulcer_before_treatment.jpg over there], which seems the best place to have that discussion. â€” soupvector (talk) 14:58, 10 January 2016 (UTC)

I would vigorously dispute WhatamIdoing's hardline &quot;the truth doesn't matter, as long as it looks right&quot; declaration.  Some editors â€“ including me â€“ really do care about image provenance.  (Commons can do whatever the hell it wants, but we don't have to take their nonsense at face value.)  We don't take the word of random uploaders for medical content.  It really does matter if an image is actually a diabetic ulcer, or
*a different sort of wound that coincidentally looks similar to a diabetic ulcer, or
*an imitation of a diabetic ulcer drawn on with make-up, or
*a simulation of an ulcer created with a computer graphics program, or 
*a photo of an alien that bears an uncanny resemblance to an ulcer.
We should never describe or misrepresent any of the bulleted items in the list as a diabetic leg ulcer in our articles. TenOfAllTrades(talk) 16:14, 10 January 2016 (UTC)
Excellent points here at WPMED for general consideration, and I hope some folks will go over to the image (particularly the &quot;non healing&quot; one) and comment on whether it's typical and well-supported. It's unfortunate that such comments aren't more prominent, since someone searching Commons might not notice the controversy - are there templates that could highlight the concerns on the image page? The [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Diabetic_non_healing_ulcer_after_treatment.jpg paired image] (purportedly of the result of Ayurvedic treatment) is potentially even more problematic, since it strongly implies unsupported claims of efficacy for unspecified treatment (when the earlier ulcer might have progressed to this degree of healing with nothing more than supportive care, since it was well-granulated). Note the uploader's user page specifically articulates their point of view, i.e. that Ayurvedic is an important adjunct to modern medicine - and uses these images in support. â€” soupvector (talk) 17:14, 10 January 2016 (UTC)
I think what WhatamIdoing means is that Commons only concerns itself whether the image can plausibly be a diabetic ulcerand we can not conclusively say it isn't. The patient has quite typical diabetic dermopathy, so it is highly likely that he/she has diabetes. That said the ulceration really isn't typical, nor can it be said that it is likely caused by diabetes, but its more likely some other form of ulcer that healed poorly following diabetes. A poorly healed surgery scar on a diabetic patient is impacted negatively by the conditions, but it isn't as far as I understand classified as a diabetic ulcer. CFCF ðŸ’Œ  18:18, 10 January 2016 (UTC)
Actually, what I mean is &quot;I have read and understood the guideline at &quot; as well as &quot;I have seen a dispute with someone who tried to use a lack of provenance to remove micrographs of viruses whose existence he personally didn't believe in&quot;.  Like Hep C. 
Individual editors are perfectly welcome to use  to omit an image whose inclusion might not have a desirable educational effect, or to give it a suitable caption.  (Consider the critical difference between &quot;Poor control of diabetes can result in leg ulcers like this one&quot; and &quot;This image shows an ulcer caused by diabetes&quot;.)  But we actually do not have a rule that requires any proof of provenance before those can images be used.  You don't have to do this for any pictures:  not places, not BLPs, not medical conditions.  Images exist to illustrate what can't be described as completely in words.  They do not exist to prove that something exists, or even to prove that this particular image is actually the thing in question.  They exist solely as illustrations of content that ought to be present and sourced in the text. WhatamIdoing (talk) 00:01, 11 January 2016 (UTC)


How about &quot;open ulcer on leg&quot; and &quot;leg with ulceration scars&quot; ? DS (talk) 20:21, 10 January 2016 (UTC)
Sure Doc James (talk Â·  Â· ) 01:52, 11 January 2016 (UTC)
 I have invited the uploader to comment here.

 I am disconcerted by WAID's statement: &quot;Even if we later prove, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that these are photos of alien faces that just happen to look like leg wounds, they are still useful as images of leg wounds.&quot; In my opinion, an image's caption/description should always (aim to) accurately describe what it is. A caption should not state &quot;Image of a leg wound&quot; if it is not actually an image of a leg wound.

 I am further dismayed by WAID's sophistry in the statement: &quot;Consider the critical difference between &quot;Poor control of diabetes can result in leg ulcers like this one&quot; and &quot;This image shows an ulcer caused by diabetes&quot;.&quot; The former caption certainly implies that the image shows an ulcer caused by diabetes, while the latter caption explicitly states it. Axl Â¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 14:06, 12 January 2016 (UTC)



The purpose of an image is to illustrate the nearby sentences and paragraphs.  The caption needs to explain the image's relevance to the (already sourced) text.  This goal can sometimes be achieved without directly describing the contents of the image.  That approach is appropriate when you don't want to commit to declaring that the uploader's description of the image is unquestionably accurate.  
The other approach is to prohibit volunteers from uploading or using images that don't come with a proper reliable source that says the contents of the image have been correctly identified by the uploader.  The community has chosen the moderate course of trusting uploaders to describe their images to the best of their ability, and trusting editors to present images as illustrating sourced facts, rather than trying to use the images themselves as reliable sources.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 20:38, 14 January 2016 (UTC)

 You have avoided responding to my specific points.

 &quot;This goal can sometimes be achieved without directly describing the contents of the image.&quot;  is the relevant guideline. Criterion 1 states &quot;A good caption... clearly identifies the subject of the picture, without detailing the obvious.&quot;

 &quot;That approach is appropriate when you don't want to commit to declaring that the uploader's description of the image is unquestionably accurate.&quot; A description is rarely &quot;unquestionably accurate&quot;. (Let's avoid a philosophical discussion of Wittgenstein's Tractatus.) We assume good faith on the part of the uploader that he/she has made a genuine attempt to describe the image accurately. If a reader/editor has doubt about the accuracy of the description, he/she should contact the uploader and seek other opinions from uninvolved editors to achieve a consensus. If an editor wants to use the image in an article but has doubt about its accuracy, it is certainly not appropriate to use devious wording to avoid acknowledgement of the uploader's description. Axl Â¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 13:35, 19 January 2016 (UTC)
How would you resolve a dispute, then?  Let's use the flower as an example.  You say it's not a dandelion; I say it is.  I demand that you not write a caption that says &quot;A close up of a cat's ear bloom, showing the stamens&quot;, because I believe that it's actually a dandelion.  The actual need in the article is to show that a cat's ear has lots of spindly little stamens.  What's your proposal to resolve the dispute?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 15:31, 19 January 2016 (UTC)
 I refer you to my previous statement: &quot;If a reader/editor has doubt about the accuracy of the description, he/she should contact the uploader and seek other opinions from uninvolved editors to achieve a consensus.&quot; Axl Â¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 16:26, 19 January 2016 (UTC)
And if the uploader is non-responsive or knows nothing about the picture beyond what the description page says (which is very common), and if uninvolved editors don't choose to become involved (a not entirely unusual fate of discussions), or if they simply don't know any better than you and I do, or if they ask you what the general rule is in such cases â€“ then what? 
My comments (and the guideline) are addressed to this &quot;then what?&quot; situation:  Here's what we usually do, when all else fails.  Does your recommendation for that situation actually differ?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 05:22, 20 January 2016 (UTC)
 You are now derailing the discussion to avoid further scrutiny of your original comments.

 &quot;My comments... are addressed to this &quot;then what?&quot; situation.&quot; No, they aren't. Your comments represent a unilateral opinion by a single editor to overrule and bypass the description from the uploader.

 In this thread, everyone apart from you has made sensible comments. It is clear that you will not be moved by my ongoing arguments. Therefore I am not going to respond again. I leave other readers to decide the merits (or otherwise) of our arguments. Axl Â¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 12:04, 22 January 2016 (UTC)

Proposed WMF board resolution on the unreliability of Wikipedia

I've asked the WMF board of trustees to pass a resolution (a) acknowledging that Wikipedia (among other WMF properties) is not reliable and (b) encouraging the WMF to support initiatives aimed at improving the reliability of Wikipedia (and other WMF properties). 

Please have your say [https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation_Board_noticeboard#Reliability here]. --Anthonyhcole (talk Â·  Â· )  14:51, 1 February 2016 (UTC)
Yes Wikipedia is not reliable. There however is not any completely reliable source out there. We have the Oxford University Press who copied from our article on Ebola per [http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/08/wikipedia-editors-for-pay/393926/ here] and while doing so changed the references so they no longer supported the content that was copied from us.
Another one of my favorite examples is a textbook produced by the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians which contains a number of drug doses out by a factor of ten. If I was to follow it blindly I would kill people. I have corrected my copy but cannot correct others.
I of course fully support prioritizing efforts to make Wikipedia's medical content more reliable. Doc James (talk Â·  Â· ) 10:23, 2 February 2016 (UTC)
Yes. Perfection only exists in mathematics. But we can strive. I'd like to see the WMF Board a bit more vocal on the issue of our unreliability. I don't expect them to actually do anything but set the tone. --Anthonyhcole (talk Â·  Â· )  01:52, 4 February 2016 (UTC)

This is a paid (Â£15,000/US $22,000) contract job for 6 to 12 months for the Wellcome Library, which is in London.  Richard, does this position require living in/near London?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:52, 3 February 2016 (UTC)

 Being near London would be useful as ideally it would involve working on site at the Library. Richard Nevell (WMUK) (talk) 11:11, 4 February 2016 (UTC)
Thanks, Richard.  The difference between &quot;come visit London a couple of times&quot; and &quot;We expect you physically at the library (nearly) every weekday for 6 to 12 months&quot; is going to make a difference in the size of your applicant pool, and it's not clear in the job posting which one is preferred and/or required.

Blausen images

  is back again - see .  (see old discussion here, ).  The user is posting in articles lots of images they have donated with a caption that says &quot;This image was donated by Blausen Medical&quot;

I'd like to note that I removed some of these yesterday, namely neuroscience-related ones in which the image itself was uninformative and served only as an excuse for the caption to link to a video hosted on an external site.  In my understanding Wikipedia policy is that in situations like this we should have an EL (in the EL section), not a direct link from the body of the article. Looie496 (talk) 15:39, 26 January 2016 (UTC)
 What you say is the norm. For Khan Academy, many editors agreed with their  campaign that external links to videos could be allowed in the body of articles. I am unsure. I think many people are unsure.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 20:20, 26 January 2016 (UTC)
You can use  for this sort of thing.  It's meant to be used sparingly, and some things to consider are listed on the /doc page for the template.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 01:14, 27 January 2016 (UTC)
With respect to external links to video my position is we should either make an exception and allowed CC BY SA NC video (no other exceptions) or we should convince them to release them under a CC BY SA license. External links are the worst of both worlds. Doc James (talk Â·  Â· ) 02:49, 27 January 2016 (UTC)
My position is basically that we should do what best serves our readers.  I don't think the Blausen approach serves our readers very well, because the way the links are added is confusing and messes up the article structure, and the videos are mostly not very informative.  But I don't have any problem adding external links to media if the media will substantially help readers understand the topic better. Looie496 (talk) 15:36, 27 January 2016 (UTC)

An interesting point of MEDRS interpretation

So ... The health authority in the UK, the Public Health England, came out with a statement taking a stance on a controversial public health issue.   The editorial board of The Lancet, which you all know is a prestigious journal based in the UK, came out with an editorial  - by the editorial board and signed &quot;The Lancet&quot; -  criticizing the basis for that stance.  The PHE statement of course is a very solid MEDRS secondary source originating from a &quot;major health organization.&quot; It is exactly what we intend by that phrase.  

Here is the debate - some editors are arguing to include content based on the Lancet editorial as an equally strong MEDRS source, others are saying that our article should not include content based on the editorial at all, giving this editorial the status we ascribe to  editorials in MEDRS - namely primary and weak -  and they want to follow the principle in MEDRS that we don't undermine content based on a strong secondary source with content based on a weaker primary one, and exclude it. 

In my view neither stance is reasonable in this case;  the editorial is not as strong a source as the PHE source - PHE is exactly what we mean by &quot;major health organizations&quot; and the Lancet as an institution is not -  but this is not your common editorial signed by Dr Ima GeniusWIthaStrongOpinion; it is a significant voice and should be included in the article as such (but less WEIGHT than the content based on the PHE report.  I have asked the embattled editors not to comment here so that uninvolved but MEDRS-savvy editors can comment.  

Which of the three positions do you find most reasonable?  Or maybe you have other ideas.  Thanks. Jytdog (talk) 07:10, 6 February 2016 (UTC)
Just a correction in the above: The &quot;statement&quot; from PHE is a formal report on e-cigarettes(their second)[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/457102/Ecigarettes_an_evidence_update_A_report_commissioned_by_Public_Health_England_FINAL.pdf], and thus corresponds to a secondary review, according to . And since the Lancet editorial (no matter how much weight it has) is a primary source per . Then what is being argued for, is that a primary source can be used to debunk a secondary source - which is according to  is a no-go.
As for the controversial nature of the report - it is not more controversial (within the UK) that 13 health organizations have undersigned it with a joint position statement.[https://www.gov.uk/government/news/e-cigarettes-an-emerging-public-health-consensus] -- 09:25, 6 February 2016 (UTC)

Hey All. Exciting news. After a couple of years of discussion ILAE has moved to an open license for [https://www.epilepsydiagnosis.org/index.html EpilepsyDiganosis.org]. This is just for the text though and not the images and videos.

Potentially promotional article (Flammer syndrome)

I have the thirst article on my watchlist due to vandalism, and I noticed that  removed a mention of Flammer syndrome saying that [//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thirst&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=702429127 &quot;Flammer syndrome&quot; is not well characterised, has no diagnostic test.

Estrous cycle article, and sexual behavior in relation to the menstrual cycle

Opinions are needed on the following matter: . By that, I mean where to place material concerning sexual behavior in relation to the menstrual cycle, including evolutionary perspectives? I argued that the Estrous cycle article is not the best place for material on humans, since it's commonly agreed upon by scientists and other researchers that human females do not have an estrous cycle, though some researchers disagree. I did note, however, that the Estrous cycle article should include the evolutionary viewpoint that human females once had estrus, lost it, and that some researchers believe that human females still have it. Anyway, a class has been assigned to the Estrous cycle article, and most of what they want to add would be more appropriate for the Ovulation, Concealed ovulation or Menstrual cycle article. A  for the discussion so far is [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Estrous_cycle&amp;oldid=703480879#Addition_of_a_section_on_the_estrus_cycle_and_sexual_behaviour here].

WebMed Central

While cleaning up , I landed on something called WebMedCentral [http://www.webmedcentral.com/]. I visited the website, and saw a pretty astonishing claim: &quot;Guaranteed biomedical publication within 48 hours&quot;.

Is this a shit journal/website? Because if so, there is at least
*Abdominal pregnancy (non-reviewed, removed)
*Abiogenesis (non-reviewed, removed)
*Copper in health (non-reviewed, removed)
*Gauthamadas Udipi (non-reviewed, may be appropriate for what it's trying to support)
*Neonatal tetanus (reviewed, not in pubmed however, left in article... for now)
*Phenethylamine (reviewed, in pubmed, left in article... for now)
*QPNC-PAGE (non-reviewed, removed)
*Residency (medicine) (non-reviewed, removed)
*Yawn  (non-reviewed, removed)
which cite those journals/website. Possibly more. Headbomb {talk /  /  / } 23:50, 27 January 2016 (UTC)

*Comment: I found this discussion through Headbomb's post at . It looks like the website publishes &quot;all but the clearly irrelevant and unscientific work&quot; within 48 hours, but then only conducts a peer review after the articles are published (see [http://www.webmedcentral.com/about_us/Our_Peer_Review_Policy this link] for their peer review policy). Once articles have been successfully peer reviewed by two editors, then they are moved to the &quot;peer reviewed&quot; portion of the website. I primarily publish articles in the humanities, but I have never seen anything like this. The website's &quot;shoot first, ask questions later&quot; approach makes me seriously question the reliability of articles published here. At the very least, I think articles published on this website should be considered  for the purposes of assessing their reliability. -- Notecardforfree (talk) 00:32, 28 January 2016 (UTC)
Post-publication peer review is a legitimate, albeit uncommon, publication model in the sciences; there's been more interest in it in the last few years due in part to the file drawer problem. (F1000Research is a relatively established example in the biomedical field; only papers that have been reviewed and approved get indexed in pubmed.) I recall WebMedCentral getting criticism when it launched a couple of years ago, but I don't know where it stands now. Certainly any citations to papers that haven't been reviewed should be removed. Opabinia regalis (talk) 00:43, 28 January 2016 (UTC)
&quot;We hope that these articles will be indexed by appropriate bodies in near future.&quot; meaning they aren't. Combined with the typos, and semi-hijacked of the WedMD and PubMedCentral brands, this seems very predatory indeed. Going to ping ,  on this. Maybe Beale's list has some info on these journals. Headbomb {talk /  /  / } 00:53, 28 January 2016 (UTC)
Beall's list doesn't pop up anything, but [http://journalology.blogspot.com/2011/01/what-is-webmedcentral.html here] is the Beall-style criticism it received from a PLoS editor. The quality of the offerings on their website says enough, though. Opabinia regalis (talk) 01:01, 28 January 2016 (UTC)
Very interesting. The &quot;file drawer problem&quot; certainly exists in the humanities as well, and WebMedCentral says that it uses its model [http://www.webmedcentral.com/about_us/Our_Philosophy &quot;to make the process of publishing more inclusive, efficient, accountable, economical, unbiased and transparent&quot;]. In the humanities, websites like SSRN help disseminate meaningful scholarship in an unbiased forum, but I'm not sure if there is an equivalent forum in medicine or the hard sciences. In any event, thanks for the explanation! Best, -- Notecardforfree (talk) 01:08, 28 January 2016 (UTC)
While I suppose a post-publication peer review model could work in principle, I have difficulty identifying any extant successful examplesâ€”and I would be very reluctant to hold up F1000Research as a role model. Perhaps it's just because I do a lot of weeding of fringe content, but my experience with F1000 is mostly in its role as an outlet for papers about Morgellons disease.  My understanding is that F1000 collects their publishing fee as soon as the paper goes up on their website, and peer review happens later...eventually, maybe.  Even then, it is explicitly the responsibility of a paper's authors to suggest peer reviewers to F1000 [http://f1000research.com/for-authors/article-processing-charges]. TenOfAllTrades(talk) 01:43, 28 January 2016 (UTC)
Yep, they and Frontiers have both had some bad barrel-scraping moments. I don't think the F1000 process of soliciting reviewer suggestions is much different than any journal that accepts such recommendations (a lot, at least in my little niche). A colleague sent them a file-drawer paper awhile back and the reviews were slow to arrive, but the experience was otherwise ordinary. The topic was technical and pretty fringeproof, though. Opabinia regalis (talk) 04:42, 28 January 2016 (UTC)
Digging somewhat deeper, you can find [http://www.webmedcentral.com/search_results well over 1500 articles] in those journals. How many have passed their peer-review process? A [http://www.webmedcentral.com/webmed_reviewed measly 31] apparently. This may indicate that the peer-review system is rigorous, but holy cow this seems like a cynical ploy  to capitalize on the fact that people probably will not suspect that they accept literally anything for publication. Did you publish in a peer-reviewed venue? Yes you technically did! Headbomb {talk /  /  / } 01:07, 28 January 2016 (UTC)

Nearly all cited articles were non-reviewed/failed review. I removed those. The two remaining references to WebMedCentral are
*Gauthamadas Udipi (non-reviewed, may be appropriate for what it's trying to support)
*Neonatal tetanus (reviewed, not in pubmed however, left in article... for now)
*Phenethylamine (reviewed, in pubmed, left in article... for now)
I lack the expertise to determine if those are appropriate sources or not for the claims they are attached to. Headbomb {talk /  /  / } 01:26, 28 January 2016 (UTC)

The material they publish must be judged  by the reputation of the author and the reviewer.There seem to be three types of review: the author suggests reviewers (and this is often the case in traditional journals also), One of their editors can review -- and that review is apparently anonymous; I am not convinced the quality of their editors is sufficiently high to be taken on faith, as we must in a traditional journal. . Anyone else can add a review also. . Looking at the two items in question:
 Neonatal_tetanus. All 3 types of review are present. The reviews show the qualifications of the reviewer. None of them are experts in the subject. On  the other handm what it documents is trivial. I'd remove the sentence &amp; ref altogether. 
 Phenethylamine. This is a review paper, not a research paper.  It doesn't document anything specific. The reviewers, tho not specialists, considered it a fairly mediocre review. We do not really need it, but there's no reason to remove it, since PMC accepted it.  BTW, I think the style of the WP article with its multiple long quotations, is pretty awful. I don't know if the Medical editors are encouraging this nowadays.   DGG ( talk ) 04:38, 28 January 2016 (UTC)
I added that review to the phenethylamine article a while back; every medical statement it cites is independently supported by at least 1 other review, but the citation is a pubmed-indexed review so I don't see any issue with MEDRS compliance.  Quoting the supporting text from the citation is simply my personal preference, although I usually only do this when citing multiple statements from a single review or the cited statement is rather technical. So long as there is direct attribution, which is provided by the cite template, quotations are acceptable so long as the length isn't excessive.  Seppi333 (Insert 2Â¢) 00:28, 29 January 2016 (UTC)
I'm puzzled by 's comment &quot;...there's no reason to remove it, since PMC accepted it&quot; and 's comment &quot;...the citation is a pubmed-indexed review so I don't see any issue with MEDRS compliance&quot;. These seem to imply a level of endorsement or quality that isn't suggested by the  guideline and certainly isn't how I understand these resources. I realize this is a bit of a non sequitur in this debate about WMC, and these comments may not reflect the users' true intent, but I think a shared understanding of reliable sources is needed (and IMHO there's much more to it than the pubmed or PMC inclusion than the comments I've cited might suggest). â€” soupvector (talk) 13:10, 31 January 2016 (UTC)
I agree with you, actually; I didn't word it precisely. My meaning was only that we could justify keeping it, and there is no inherent reason why we must remove it.  But there is no reason why we need add references to all reviews on a subject--we can select the best. One of the factors is where the review was published.  And even the reviewers for this journal didn't think the review was particularly good. The only reason we might want to use it is if there was no other recent open access review. Though some medical articles here may look otherwise, we do not need in WP articles to include every available reference.   DGG ( talk ) 17:11, 31 January 2016 (UTC)

 The name of the website alone is a red flag. As Headbomb mentions, it is an attempt to trick readers into conflating the established websites PubMed Central and WebMD with this one. The purpose of their immediate publishing model is to make money as quickly as possible and encourage researchers who just want a fast publication to submit their work to WebMDCentral.

 While much of the content might be of reasonable quality, I suspect that a lot is substandard. Headbomb's discovery that only 31 papers have received two satisfactory reviews is an indictment of the website's methods. Axl Â¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 12:38, 5 February 2016 (UTC)

References supporting our medical content

Hey All. Some updated data on the number of references support our content. We are now over 1.4 M Doc James (talk Â·  Â· ) 10:37, 16 February 2016 (UTC)
 Is this number of citations made or number of sources cited? It must be citations made, right, and the sources are duplicated many times, right? Blue Rasberry (talk) 16:10, 16 February 2016 (UTC)
Wouldn't a better comparison be the number of references per total medical article bytes vs. time? The number of medical articles (and medical content within articles) has increased over time so the absolute number of references doesn't tell us if we're keeping up. Sizeofint (talk) 17:25, 16 February 2016 (UTC)
Shouldn't the red portion of the bars be labeled &quot;other&quot; rather than &quot;all&quot; while the total height of the bar represents &quot;all&quot; so that &quot;English&quot; is not double counted?  If so, it appears that citations in foreign language medical articles is growing faster than in the English Wikipedia.  This may be a result of  that is translating citation rich English medical articles into other languages. Boghog (talk) 20:39, 16 February 2016 (UTC)
Top of the red bar represents &quot;all&quot; but good point other would be better. And yes agree that the translation task force likely represents a large part of the reason.
This is the total number of citations rather than the number of sources. Thus each time a source is used it is counted. More data is [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vM3IADEx7SBDOYNbYRdAG49nZ3qj3amhtQuevRbdfhc/edit#gid=0 here]
Yes we could take the number of bytes and divide it by the number of references to get bytes per reference. We have done this in the past and reference density has also been increasing. Have not done it again yet.

There's been a change to how categories interact with watchlists.  You can now see people adding and removing categories from articles, in your watchlist, by watching the category page.

Anti-psychiatry

I was clicking around and found myself on the Anti-psychiatry page and... it's a mess. I didn't know much of anything about antipsychiatry, but the blatant character attacks and POV pushing were red huge flags, so I started checking sources and none that I've checked so far have anything to do with antipsychiatry. I got the sense from the talkpage that there's a lot of poorly sourced information backing up ideas about psychiatry that stem from Scientology. Their beliefs do have a place in the article... but with proper sourcing and NPOV. There are other POVs being pushed as well. Apparently it's a very contentious topic. Now that I've read up a bit about it, it's actually quite interesting. But cleaning up the article will be a lot to tackle... so I'm posting this on the relevant wikiprojects in the hopes that others might find it interesting too and want to help. :) I've started a discussion about it at .

Ventricular remodeling page

This page seems to be of general poor quality and perhaps would better come under the title of cardiac remodelling. Incorrectly says that remodelling is an exclusively pathological state. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2300466/pdf/nhj1612900.pdf

Stanford medical student op-ed

Seems that Stanford med students don't go to class anymore.  See

[http://www.stanforddaily.com/2016/02/18/the-wikipedia-university-school-of-medicine/ The Wikipedia University School of Medicine]

&quot;We must ask ourselves if Stanford, or any medical school for that matter, can create a better curriculum than the combination of Khan Academy, Pathoma, Lippencottâ€™s, Goljanâ€™s Rapid Pathology Review, First Aid, Strong Medicine, Kaplan, USMLE World, SketchyMicro, FireCracker, Doctors-In-Training, Picmonic, UpToDate, MedScape and even Wikipedia.&quot;

Smallbones(smalltalk) 17:48, 19 February 2016 (UTC)
As a medical school professor, I share the commentator's low opinion of traditional medical school syllabi; their parallel development and maintenance seems inefficient and unlikely to produce a high-quality product. Instead, faculty should be contributing to a crowd-sourced, shared syllabus. I see WP as one model to consider, if not the right home for such a syllabus. I disagree with the commentator's suggestion that preclinical teaching should be abandoned altogether, rather it should be re-examined continually in a mission-based evaluation process. I would like to see these efforts synergize with WPMED, but it's not clear to me how to make that happen. â€” soupvector (talk) 22:29, 19 February 2016 (UTC)
Wikiversity is a possible home for such shared development of teaching resources.
Reforming medical school is probably outside of our scope.  As for the author's POV, he might be be interested in Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine in New York, which requires all first-year students to train as EMTs and ride ambulances â€“ certainly an experience that cannot be replaced with a website or a classroom.

Editing an article about a rare disease (Postorgasmic illness syndrome). In the &quot;External links&quot; section, can I put links to a few support forums?

&quot;Contentious&quot; because I can give three gold-plated references in both sides. A quick search reveals: [https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1957/49298/MurtaughPaulStatisticsDefensePValues.pdf?sequence=1], [https://www.stat.washington.edu/peter/342/Senn.pdf], [http://www.nature.com/news/psychology-journal-bans-p-values-1.17001] Bondegezou (talk) 00:14, 23 February 2016 (UTC)

For the record, the article isn't intended to take any sides on the frequentism-Bayesianism debate, which is what those sources address. If the comment on Bayes factors is causing problems, I'm fine with removing or qualifying that (I've said this at the article too). @, I'd appreciate feedback/edits towards what you'd like to see. If you could move the dispute tag to specific inline references, that would also be helpful. Sunrise (talk) 11:05, 23 February 2016 (UTC)
I and others have said a lot on the Talk page already. I think the article is classic : it's become a dumping ground for various different critiques of p-values, and the core material largely just takes a pro-Bayesian/anti-frequentist position. If the article isn't intended to take any sides on the frequentism-Bayesianism debate, it's failing in that regard, and it's pretty difficult for the article not to take sides when it is titled &quot;p-value fallacy&quot;! As an example, the article currently says towards the end, &quot;For example, p-values do not address the probability of the null hypothesis being true or false, which can only be done with the Bayes factor&quot;. Well, that's what a Bayesian would say. I could write a &quot;Bayes fallacy&quot; article saying the underlying premise of the Bayesian approach is inherently flawed. As it says in the Bayesian probability article, &quot;For the frequentist a hypothesis is a proposition (which must be either true or false), so that the frequentist probability of a hypothesis is either one or zero.&quot;
There is lots of debate in statistics and beyond about p-values, which should be covered on Wikipedia, and there is good content in this article, but why not stick it in the p-value article where (a) people will see it, and (b) it can be contextualised in an NPOV way? Bondegezou (talk) 12:57, 23 February 2016 (UTC)
I've added some more specific tags to aid discussion. I think a central problem with the article is whose fallacy is it? Some of the article is talking about common misunderstandings of the p-value, i.e. the so-called fallacy is an error on the part of the user and can be avoided with education. But some of the article describes problems as inherent to the nature of the p-value, i.e. the fallacy is unavoidable, p-values are doomed. The former is less contentious, but should be re-written to be clear that we mean misinterpretations. The latter is more contentious and comes back to Bayesian-frequentist debates. Bondegezou (talk) 13:07, 23 February 2016 (UTC)

Thanks for the edits and comments, and I've written some responses at the talk page. The intention, at least, was to describe a specific (named) misuse of p-values; I didn't think anything implied the fallacy was unavoidable, which was addressed by e.g. the &quot;correct use of p-values&quot; statement. (FWIW, I'd have no objection to a &quot;Bayes fallacy&quot; article as long as it's an independent concept discussed in the literature, as it is for p-values.)
I agree with you in opposing the addition of the FDR section, and I agree that it moves the article towards CFORK. In the first version of the article, I tried to avoid this by limiting the core references to include only those that used the specific term &quot;p-value fallacy.&quot; It might be that &quot;Misinterpretations of p-values&quot; or even &quot;Misinterpretations of statistics&quot; could be notable as independent concepts, then that section could be moved there, but then there's yet another challenge with CFORK.

Essay being added to ref section of articles

 I see a link to  a help essay called   being added to many med articles...even comes with a nice icon to make sure your eyes are drawn to it. Not sure how other feel about this...but I personally see a problem here. Firstly i dont  believe a link to a project essay  in the content of a main space article is a good idea ever (we have recommendations as to this point ). I also dont think the placement is a good idea either ....in the ref section? people will think these leads to more  sources on the topic at hand..not an essay about Wikipedia.  This info in this link can already be found under &quot;About Wikipedia&quot; ...at best they should be a proposal to have it in the left side bar.  Having a link of this nature that the average  reader will not use in the ref section is odd. Many other reasons I dont think this is a good idea....anyways see   if you have a comment.  Just dont see how this will help our readers...so many other essays could be linked  like this for med articles...i would love a link to  seen on every page personally but ...we dont spam essays in this fashion. -- Moxy (talk) 04:51, 8 February 2016 (UTC)

We can presume that it is not directed to editors, but to readers of Wikipedia who are not accustomed to analyzing sources in the same fashion. Adding it to the talk-page entirely defeats the purpose and makes it irrelevant.

Why was this not proposed for the left hand menu? I think most have a problem with an essay linked in the contents of an  article over  a place people would look for that type of info. Just an odd place as many people get to the ref section by clicking the refs in the article...thus takes them past the header.  I do see a great value for this  in the side menu.

Barbara (WVS), as seen with [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Clitoral_hood_reduction&amp;diff=556652162&amp;oldid=545715570 this edit], you might want to talk to with Ranze about some of the sourcing you removed from that article. Another big contributor to the article (as seen [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Clitoral_hood_reduction&amp;diff=456822723&amp;oldid=452632433 here], for example) is Otto Placik, who is currently indefinitely blocked. Thus far, I've had very little to do with that article. Flyer22 Reborn (talk) 18:41, 1 March 2016 (UTC)

I could be mistaken, but in my reading, clitoral hood reduction is performed on adults who meet the legal definition of informed consent, under anaesthetic, in safe (sterile) conditions, for reasons that are allegedly medical (patient self-esteem) and not religious. Male circumcision is carried out in a range of circumstances, including in neonates incapable of giving informed consent, in often without anaesthetic, sometimes in non sterile conditions (Prepex), frequently for religious reasons.

Clitoral hood reduction is performed in low numbers for non-religious reasons, while male circumcision is performed routinely among Muslims and Jews, using proxy consent without the informed consent of neonates.

History of male circumcision#Masturbation concerns and John Harvey Kellogg#Masturbation prevention indicate that male circumcision has been used historically as a punitive measure against teenagers found masturbating.

Note that Female genital mutilation#Europe and the United States states that clitoridectomy was performed in the US to &quot;treat&quot; &quot;hysteria, erotomania and lesbianism&quot;

My understanding is that the Clitoral hood reduction article is about non-punitive medical practise. 

Religiously and culturally motivated female genital mutilation is promoted within some African countries as preventative against infidelity. Clitoral hood reduction is not promoted as reducing sexual pleasure, or preventing infidelity, and should not be conflated with religious and cultural prohibitions on masturbation and/or adultery.

A number of apologists for female genital mutilation say that clitoral hood reduction can be conflated with type 1 FGM performed for religious and cultural reasons. While female genital mutilation is promoted as preventing infidelity, Western apologists for the practise assert that it is done for aesthetic reasons, in order to conflate type 1 FGM on prepubescents with elective clitoral hood reduction on adults. Richard A. Shweder, in a specious 2013 paper, says that all &quot;female genital surgeries (whether in Africa or Beverly Hills)&quot; have common features. The false conflation is repeated in the recent pro-FGM paper in J Med Ethics.

In many Western countries, male circumcision is performed on neonates for religious reasons by the parents, while Clitoral hood reduction is only performed on post-pubescent individuals that elect for the procedure. It makes me uncomfortable that elective female genital cosmetic procedures are given an implied commonality with religious genital alteration on pre-pubescent individuals.

If a &quot;see also&quot; section has to be used, the article Genital modification and mutilation is a better target than male circumcision, because Genital modification and mutilation includes a range of operations, including ones that are not religiously based.

Glad to be made aware of this, can't recall dealing with this topic recently, we could probably continue discussion of the particulars on the talk page.  your observations about the different usual conditions these surgeries happen under could be right, but that's quite unrelated to the general topic of the page. Nothing about the term &quot;hood removal&quot; implies consent must be absent or present. Nothing about 'male circumcision' implies it must be present or absent either. Either surgery can be done with consent or without it, in sterile or unsterile conditions. Your observations about statistics of these variables (if supported by sources) can have a place on the page but they do not support disassociating the clearly similar topics from one another.

&quot;Adding sources to the lead is a reasonable practice but not required as long as the text in question is supported in the body of the article&quot;

Is what  currently says, echoing .  In fact our normal practice goes well beyond that. Isn't it time to adjust that &amp; say something that better reflects what we actually do?  The question has been raised at .  I'd propose:

*&quot;In Wikipedia articles generally adding sources to the lead is a reasonable practice but not required as long as the text in question is supported in the body of the article [the old text- add link to ].  Because of the particular importance of accuracy in medical articles, it is generally expected that citations are included in their leads, as in the rest of the article.&quot;

Thoughts? Johnbod (talk) 14:55, 23 February 2016 (UTC)

I'm much more comfortable with the proposed language. Very often, leads contain assertions that aren't in the article (perhaps they shouldn't, but they often do) - let alone supported by a source in the article. Also, often I find what I want in the lede, so don't see why I have to go scouring through the article for the source (which often, as I say, isn't there anyway). --Anthonyhcole (talk Â·  Â· )  15:05, 23 February 2016 (UTC)

I dislike refs in the lead because they impair readability, and don't want to make them mandatory. Instead of the second sentence above I would suggest, In cases where editors disagree, it is generally best to err on the side of adding references. If other editors have added high-quality references in good faith, it is usually best to leave them in place. Looie496 (talk) 15:09, 23 February 2016 (UTC)
But they are &quot;generally expected&quot;, by long custom and consensus, in medical articles. The wording was chosen to avoid making them mandatory. Can you point to any case where an editor has objected to including them, other than the e-cig discussion I just linked to? I don't usually cite up the lead in other articles I write, but always in medical ones. I'm ok with having your sentences as well, after mine. Johnbod (talk) 15:16, 23 February 2016 (UTC)
They're not &quot;generally expected&quot; by actual readers in any article.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 17:58, 23 February 2016 (UTC)

*Require citations in lead of medical articles The premise behind not requiring them is that the community is capable of verifying that the content in the lead is also in the bottom and also verified. In fact, this is not possible. The community has never been able to manage this. It is a myth that it ever was possible, and a legacy from a time when Wikipedia did not require citations generally and from before communities like medicine started to examine the issue more closely.
I challenge the premise that it is possible to keep track of content in the lead without citations. It is difficult enough to verify content with citations, and unreasonable to suggest that some kind of institutional editor memory or notes on the talk page are sufficient to make it easy for readers and Wikipedia editors to quickly match content in the lead to citations without repeating the citations in the lead. I have two controversial opinions against Wikipedia policy - one is that content in Wikipedia should be matched with citations to existing published sources, and the second is that everywhere, including in infoboxes and the lead, information should be matched with citations.

* Whatever guidance is given in MEDMOS, I don't think it would be a good idea to alter what general guidance already exists without a very good reason. The present guidance is located at  and . In a nutshell, that boils down to &quot;decide it on a case-by-case basis by editorial consensus&quot;. It's also worth remembering that the lead not only summarises the rest of the article, it also introduces and defines it, which means that some content may be unique to the lead - and hence not cited elsewhere. --RexxS (talk) 18:30, 23 February 2016 (UTC)

* oppose We can't really go past LEAD and require this, in my view.  I understand the desire among some to do this (Doc James pays mind to how people use WP, and many use mobile, and many read only the lead), and I hear Bluerasberry's point as well.  We can strongly suggest it but we cannot require it, in my view.  We can't become a walled garden.  
however on the specific issue of their use in the lead of the e-cigs, LEAD does say that they should be used if anything in the lead is challenged and given how every jot and tittle of that article has been fought over, they should be used in the lead, absolutely.   Jytdog (talk) 18:34, 23 February 2016 (UTC)
Why are you opposing? The proposal is only to say it is &quot;generally expected&quot;, which if anything is milder than the &quot;strongly suggest it&quot; you say you support. Johnbod (talk) 19:17, 23 February 2016 (UTC)
I wasn't proposing specific language when I said &quot;strongly suggest&quot;.  Sorry to confuse.  I don't like &quot;generally expected&quot; as it is not true in the RW nor even here at WP:MED.   I would accept something like: &quot;Because many users read only the lead, and because content about health can be complex, it is useful to provide inline citations to support content about health in the lead.&quot;  something like that. Jytdog (talk) 19:33, 23 February 2016 (UTC)
Adding to the &quot;how articles are read in the real world&quot; idea:  Almost nobody reads the citations.  You could put random gibberish in the ref tags and almost no readers would notice.  The more sophisticated ones might get a &quot;oooh, it's cited, so it must be accurate!&quot; feeling, but that effect is actually an argument against including citations.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:34, 24 February 2016 (UTC)
well you made me laugh!  but i would hope there are some people who read seriously.  Jytdog (talk) 19:48, 24 February 2016 (UTC)
I also want to re-iterate that this discussion has nothing to do with the issue at play at the e-cig article.  Plain old  is what is at play there.   It is of course fine to talk about how to tweak MEDMOS but there is nothing at stake for the e-cig people in this discussion. Jytdog (talk) 19:55, 23 February 2016 (UTC)

* It seems to me that  and  are pretty loose in what they require (although I've seen some editors be more aggressive in trying to purge cites from ledes). So I don't think there is a  problem and it's reasonable for MEDMOS to at least suggest that citations might be more common in medical articles lede. Bondegezou (talk) 18:40, 23 February 2016 (UTC)
** The LOCALCONSENSUS problem appears because a very small group of editors (about 0.002% of current active editors) have come to a page where another small group of editors (about 0.01% of current active editors), who are known to be sympathetic to these issues, and made an unadvertised proposal to have LEAD and MEDMOS â€“ both of which are community-wide guidelines â€“ apply opposite rules to medicine and non-medicine articles.  The rule proposed (in practice) is that citations will be rarely used in the introduction to an article, and decided on a case-by-case basis if wanted, except in health-related articles, when the opposite rule would be used.  This is going to set us up for a  problem and probably another round of &quot;you medicine project people think you're so special&quot; disputes.  It's IMO not worth it.

*One point to consider here is that the lead operates at a higher level of synthesis than the body.  Sometimes a statement in the lead may summarize half a dozen or more items from the body -- for example a list of common symptoms -- each of which may cite a different reference.  Referencing the statement in the lead might then require citing a number of sources, which is seriously ugly and also not all that useful, since a reader can't tell which source is used for each bit of information. Looie496 (talk) 16:24, 24 February 2016 (UTC)

*I support referencing contentious claims and medical claims in the lead of medical articles. I almost always add references (usually 20+) to sentences in the lead of articles that I actively work on. When people have whined about me doing that in the past (e.g., see the ), I've compromised by moving the refs from each sentence into note at the end of the paragraph â€“ the list of references in the note then supports the statements in that paragraph (e.g., see the current lead of amphetamine). It makes it harder to  a statement if the refs don't include a quote, but at least the citations are included in the lead w/o affecting readability. Another alternative which I know  supports is the use of censored references in the lead after each sentence.  I'd never support the deletion of all citations from the lead of a medical article and I'd probably continue to add them even if a policy mandated otherwise.

Does this look like a sub-topic of Music therapy?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 17:51, 26 February 2016 (UTC)
This is something from a Georgia Tech class. I put the course page here: . The professor, Steve Potter, has been assigning his students articles for years. I've tried to help the professor design his assignment properly so that we are not inundated with material that is not appropriate for an encyclopedia, but I haven't felt my efforts were particularly fruitful. I invested a lot of time in 2012 and 2013 on this. (FWIW,  has bitterly noted shortcomings with regard to this class.) There's also discussion in the archives from this talk page,  and the  about this class' efforts as well, I believe. I do not know the current status of the assignment. He was teaching the class in Fall annually, and went on sabbatical one year. Biosthmors (talk) pls  me (i.e. {{}}) while signing a reply, thx 19:30, 26 February 2016 (UTC)
Yes it was a class project. It is the same as music therapy. A merge is needed. There are a couple of reviews in their. Doc James (talk Â·  Â· ) 19:36, 28 February 2016 (UTC)
Bitterly indeed-- I believe classes like this should be blocked.  I log in as unoften as possible so I don't have to see the damage.  Hi-bye to my friends here, SandyGeorgia (Talk) 21:22, 7 March 2016 (UTC)
