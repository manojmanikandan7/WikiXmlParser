		<segment id="id52416695">Merge Allopathic medicine with medicine?

This is pretty much a term for ordinary medicine used by homeopaths. The article doesn't present anything really new, I think it were best if we merged it — and then purged the terms: &quot;allopathic&quot;, &quot;allopathy&quot;, etc. from WP. Thoughts? [[User:CFCF|Carl Fredrik]]  20:19, 6 November 2016 (UTC)

 From the article, it seems like the topic is notable and has a long history of use within the field of homeopathy. I don't see a compelling reason for a merge. Attempting a &quot;purge&quot; of alternative terms does sound like POV pushing. -- () 21:07, 6 November 2016 (UTC)
Then you quite obviously have no clue as to what POV-pushing is. [[User:CFCF|Carl Fredrik]]  22:03, 6 November 2016 (UTC)

The article appears to explain the term/concept in a reasonably balanced way. It may be a bit repetitive and could use some copyediting, but it does not appear to be pushing a POV, and I see no reason to merge it with anything. Purging the terms from Wikipedia is censorship, which we do not do, and, as Mark viking states, suggesting censorship does indeed have the taint of POV pushing about it. • • •  : 06:08, 7 November 2016 (UTC)
No it is absolutely not censorship, it is called having a consistent terminology across Wikipedia. Calling medicine allopathic is akin to calling gravity &quot;the theory of gravity&quot; or speaking of &quot;orthodox economics&quot; etc. etc. It's not suitable for a neutral encyclopedia. [[User:CFCF|Carl Fredrik]]  10:31, 7 November 2016 (UTC)

Wikipedia is not required or expected to have &quot;consistent terminology throughout&quot;, as it is expected, as a neutral encyclopaedia, to mention and explain inconsistencies in terminology, and not to pretend that they do not exist. Your analogies are also unclear. What is wrong with referring to a theory of gravity or orthodox economics? Do you suggest there is no other kind, or that all versions of economics are unorthodox? and by whose standards? • • •  : 13:15, 7 November 2016 (UTC)
 I think, , that the issue is more of subtly casting aspersions. By referring to the &quot;theory of gravity&quot;, there is a hidden implication that it's not really a fact, but just a &quot;theory&quot;. Similarly, referring to what the mainstream understands as economics with the label &quot;orthodox economics&quot; can be used to imply that other forms of economics (including crackpot theories) are just as valid. In the case of the homeopaths, they use &quot;allopathic medicine&quot; to refer to what is ordinarily understood as evidence-based medicine, i.e. medicine. That opens the door to claiming that &quot;homeopathic medicine&quot; is just a different form of medicine from &quot;allopathic medicine&quot;. It isn't, because homeopathy is not medicine at all. The use of the term &quot;allopathic medicine&quot; has only one purpose: to indirectly bolster the cause of homeopathy in order to get equal treatment with real medicine. See:  -- () 18:31, 7 November 2016 (UTC)
As it happens, I agree with that, but one does not purge the encyclopedia of a term which is in use, one explains it, and ensures that it is used when and where applicable and with due weight. If that means seldom, then that is OK. People supporting evidence based medicine should be sufficiently educated to understand the difference between a theory and a hypothesis in a scientific context, so when it appears that they don't I ask for clarification in case I have missed something. I suspect a failure to communicate rather than a fundamental disagreement on the usefulness of the term, but attempts to communicate have so far been met with rather categorical responses. Cheers, • • •  : 19:21, 7 November 2016 (UTC)
 The problem is that regular editors of medical articles spend far too much time struggling with  who want to recast a topic into a much more favourable light than the mainstream sources indicate. They may have a financial interest in removing anything negative about their profession, and are often well-organised off-wiki. The regulars can often end up with a jaundiced view of dissenting editors, and I know I'm guilty of that myself, although most of the time, it's justified, sadly. In this case, my view is that the article Alternative medicine #Allopathic medicine now gives a good perspective on the term &quot;allopathic medicine&quot; in its proper context, so I don't see any value in seeing it spread beyond that, simply to bolster unduly the position of the homeopaths. -- () 19:38, 7 November 2016 (UTC)

Side note:  No, they use that term to refer to what is ordinarily understood as conventional or mainstream or Western medicine, which may or may not be evidence-based in any given case (depending, e.g., upon the decade in question, whether any evidence exists,  whether the practitioner chooses to practice according to that evidence, etc.)   () 06:55, 8 November 2016 (UTC)

*Support since &quot;allopathic medicine&quot; is a specific term for the topic covered in Medicine - they are the same topic. Any notable criticism/perspective relating to the &quot;allopathic&quot; term - i.e. the homeopathic perspective - should be considered for inclusion in a suitable subsection of the Medicine article. —  () 23:46, 6 November 2016 (UTC)

*I'm pretty sure that merging means that we'll stop appearing in Google searches for the term, or at least fall in the rankings. The article is fairly well-written, and I wouldn't want to cede the top spot (including the definition box) to a website like [http://hpplc.indiana.edu/medicine/med-res-twokinds.shtml my current #2 result]. [[User:Sunrise|Sunrise]] () 04:23, 7 November 2016 (UTC

*Undecided. I agree that it is the same as medicine and is simply an attempt at a derogatory term for it. But if we explain that clearly it and we are the top hit on google we may do better keeping it per Sunrise. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 06:32, 7 November 2016 (UTC)

*Undecided. Sunrise makes a valid point re Google results, but nobody has noted the fact that the word is used routinely in India, perhaps (I don't know), not carrying the derogatory connotations Alt-Medists in the west use. I'm afraid that the effects on a google search result probably shouldn't colour our judgement on this. -  10:21, 7 November 2016 (UTC)

*Against. That would mean we would have to work the material from the current Allopathic medicine article into the Medicine article, where it does not belong since it is fringe. The AM article is not about the subject of medicine but about the practice of calling that subject &quot;allopathic&quot;. -- () 12:47, 7 November 2016 (UTC)
—I'm actually more inclined to merge the definition into Alternative medicine now, do you have any thoughts about that? [[User:CFCF|Carl Fredrik]]  13:00, 7 November 2016 (UTC)
Much better. That article already has such a paragraph. -- () 13:03, 7 November 2016 (UTC)
I added that, pretty much what I thought was salvagable. I'm unsure what to do with the rest of the material, much of it seems redundant. [[User:CFCF|Carl Fredrik]]  13:06, 7 November 2016 (UTC)

Sunrise makes a very good point. Does anyone know if there is research into how google defines synonyms of things? For example searching for &quot;complementary medicine&quot; doesn't give our article on alternative medicine — which is odd because they are the exact same thing. I'm unsure how to proceed, but I do think we should remove any undue uses of allopathy in the rest of the encyclopedia. [[User:CFCF|Carl Fredrik]]  10:31, 7 November 2016 (UTC)
Agree with removing undue uses in the rest of the pedia :-)[[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 10:46, 7 November 2016 (UTC)

Hmm, by rewriting the definition of complementary medicine along the lines of what  suggests, and linking Complementary medicine to the subsection Alternative medicine#Complementary medicine I moved it up ~10 spots in the Google ranking…
This makes me think that we could redirect allopathic medicine to a subsection of Alternative medicine#Allopathic medicine with a clear definition and some etymology and we'd still be on the top of the Google results: [https://www.google.com/search?q=complementary+medicine&amp;ie=utf-8].

Thanks Carl. I think these results reflect personalization, though - the rankings usually take a couple of days to update (e.g. my search for allopathic still gives the old page at this point), and on my part searches for complementary and integrative still don't have any WP results in the top 10. Maybe we could find someone who knows more at VPT? [[User:Sunrise|Sunrise]] () 18:26, 7 November 2016 (UTC)
 Google results are personal, but generally are not very dissimilar between different searchers. My search for &quot;complementary medicine&quot; now puts our article in 4th position. Google certainly takes note of our redirects, but it does take a short while for it to catch up. I've just redirected Allopath, Allopathic and Allopathic Medicine after checking  for double redirects. That should speed up Google's indexing, rather than waiting for the bot to sort them out. -- () 18:46, 7 November 2016 (UTC)
It seems to be rather important to redirect to the specific subsection #Allopathic_medicine, not just to the article. A tip is to turn off search personalization manually in the Google settings, which can also be done by blocking Google-cookies (it gets rid of it to some degree, some location based personalization remains). [[User:CFCF|Carl Fredrik]]  19:52, 7 November 2016 (UTC)
FWIW, I just searched for &quot;complementary medicine&quot; on a computer different from the one I use (with personalization turned off, etc). Our article was still off the first page - 19th if the term was in quotes, and 13th if not. [[User:Sunrise|Sunrise]] () 00:04, 8 November 2016 (UTC) 

*Oppose I will admit that the Wikipedia article on allopathic medicine is in bad shape and that I cannot immediately identify good sources to cite and develop the article.
At the same time, I also feel that there must be better sources somewhere to cite, and that the article is not representing the term as it is commonly used. &quot;Allopathic&quot; as a term may have originated in the field of homeopathy but today is a standard term in Indian English for invasive medicine (pharmaceutical and surgical medicine) as compared to alternative and complementary medicine (AYUSH). In India &quot;allopathy&quot; is a word that every college educated person knows. I can think of a few aspects of the concept -
*Allopathy is the term for differentiating drugs with side effects from interventions which at their worst are the equivalent of doing nothing
*Allopathy includes a commercial exchange, when alternative medicine might include treatments accessible to very poor people
*Allopathy has a strong bias for Western corporations and their interests
The Wikipedia article did not reflect these perspectives. I think it is fair to say that &quot;allopathy&quot; is a term and concept mostly controlled by Indian culture and that the article ought to reflect Indian perspectives. I cannot immediately prove it, but I suspect that there must be numerous news sources, journal articles, and essays in India talking about allopathy because it is a ubiquitous concept there. To say that it is merely a foil to homeopathy is not capturing the popular use of the term. The problem in Wikipedia probably originated because we do not have many participants in WP:MED who use Indian English. [[User:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ]][[User talk:Bluerasberry|(talk)]] 20:57, 7 November 2016 (UTC)

Having glanced at this conversation, my two cents are that the merge with alternative medicine is sensible and nuanced, and covers pretty much everything we need to say about 'allopathy'. The encyclopedicness of the topic is how the term is used, and it's pretty much only used by horseshit peddling quacks. If it's used in mainstream Indian sources for conventional medicine, then we can (and should) document that too, but a note/mention in the relevant section of the alternative medicine article is all that's needed.   { /  /  / } 21:44, 7 November 2016 (UTC)
Another way to provide balance would be to include criticisms of allopathy in the medicine article. &quot;Evidence based medicine&quot; is guided by a Medical–industrial complex, and all of the cases listed at List of largest pharmaceutical settlements and List of off-label promotion pharmaceutical settlements are instances of evidence-based medicine backed with the support of hundreds of researchers and physicians doing standard practice. The nature of evidence-based medicine is to be hijacked by corporate greed. Perhaps the medicine article should emphasize how routine it is for unethical practices to happen in evidence-based medicine, because the criticism and court cases are continual. There are quacks everywhere, but the quacks who make the most money with the most outrageous illegal behavior are on the allopathic side. There is room for outside perspectives in all articles. [[User:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ]][[User talk:Bluerasberry|(talk)]] 23:04, 7 November 2016 (UTC)
I'm a bit concerned about a few claims in the altmed article, e.g., that mainstream practitioners &quot;never&quot; agreed with the term.  In 1810, they objected to the insult, but I understand that they accepted it as a reasonably accurate label for their treatment methods.
I mostly agree with Blue Rasberry overall.  We-the-editors have a strong Western/American POV here, and a bad case of recentism, and I think it's blinding us to the other uses.  For example:  What did the homeopaths originally mean by that term, and how does it compare to some of their less-remembered terms?  Where's the article that describes what those actual allopaths actually did in 1810?  [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZwouDHpgRcYC&amp;pg=PA111 this 19th-century American journal] says that Aloe vera was an &quot;allopathic&quot; medicine (probably most often as a laxative, although this source doesn't say that).  [https://books.google.com/books?id=q4k9ILvAcE4C&amp;pg=PA102 This book] on the introduction of Western medicine to India names &quot;Roy's Head Cure&quot; and &quot;Magic Ointment&quot; as allopathic treatments from the 19th century – quite the far cry from the best of 21st-century science-based medicine, but still a verifiable part of the snake-oil history of &quot;allopathic&quot; medicine.  I can't find anything about this on Wikipedia.  Since CFCF redirected the old article into non-existence (after just 21 hours of discussion?), all I can find is one short section in the altmed article, which leaves the reader with the impression that there's nothing more to be said about it than the homeopaths made up the word 200 years ago, and the average modern healthcare provider doesn't like it.  I don't think that nine sentences is the best we can do for this subject.   () 07:43, 8 November 2016 (UTC)
WAID I believe you are looking for the History of medicine article.  () 08:08, 8 November 2016 (UTC)
That article doesn't mention allopathy at all (nor heroic medicine, nor several other things), but I'm actually looking for a
History
section in a properly developed Allopathic medicine, and for the article about allopathy to actually talk more about allopathy itself than about how, a century after mainstream medicine rejected actual allopathy, they're kind of tired of homeopaths using that outdated label to their non-allopathic medical approach.   () 18:04, 8 November 2016 (UTC)
WP Is far from complete, right?  That is where that content should go.   A nice project for you.  () 18:13, 8 November 2016 (UTC)
Wikipedia is far from complete, and CFCF blanked nearly all of the content that we had on the subject.  Also, I disagree that (actual/old-fashioned) allopathy should be confined to a history of (Western) medicine article.   () 22:16, 8 November 2016 (UTC)
i am struggling some with the ax-grinding going on here all around, including CFCF, WAID, and bluerasberry.  Looking back at what people did in the 19th century to get help when they were sick, and the various interventions offered to them.... it is easy to see that there was very little science-based medicine anywhere to be found and all kinds of pseudoscience and hucksterism and rank greed/ego driving things.  A big reason for that is that nobody understood what was really going on with the human body.  We like to look back and cherry pick emerging science as it appeared (cholera prevention, etc) but the landscape of &quot;medicine&quot; (and its various alternatives) was mostly fetid swamp, just like traditional medicines have always been, and were gussied up in various forms of cultural authority, just like traditional medicines have always been.  Because people have always gotten hurt or sick, and there have always been people wanting to help and wanting to take advantage, and cultures have always had mechanisms to authorize some kind of care over others.
There is still a lot we (humanity) don't know today, but we know a lot more than we did then.  Science has made strides in the 20th century especially. Enough to look back and cringe, and to rightly call things pseudoscience that clearly had or have no basis in science.   
What some call the &quot;medical industrial complex&quot; certainly has elements of that, but there is also a shitload of &quot;stuff&quot; that has to be pulled together today to actually create and develop an intervention and prove that it is safe and effective.  Doing that requires tons of money, business people, lawyers, scientists, doctors, and people willing to participate in clinical trials.  Part of that is due to there finally being good laws governing marketing (which are still not strong enough in many areas, like dietary supplements -- a field where we find stuff as ugly as anything S.K. Roy ever did in colonial India and maybe worse, since the supplement marketers are doing their thing today when we know better).
But to do new medicine right today and to understand how older medicines should be used, it really does take a village &quot;complex&quot; to pull that off.  Because even today it is hard and we still don't know if something is safe and effective in humans until we experiment on humans, and lots of them.   () 18:56, 8 November 2016 (UTC)
I've seen sources that put the start of science-based medicine around 1930 (and that's for cutting-edge research, i.e., not what regular patients were getting).  Before then, it was all bad.  
Even now, we're not really proving that drugs are safe and effective (see all the drug recalls); we're just trying to find out if there's a decent chance of it.  We're doing much less than that for non-drug interventions.  The best-case scenario is that in 100 years, people will say that our hearts were generally in the right places, even though we were mostly short-sighted, incompetent, blinded by greed, and inclined to treat researchers whose POV we like the same way that villagers in previous millennia treated their priests.  Because, as Jytdog said, it's hard.   () 22:26, 8 November 2016 (UTC)
Your reply is only partially based in reality in some parts and obviously based in bullshit (a lack of concern as to whether what you are saying is even true or not) in others.   As to when accountability to evidence started to be enforced on the practice of medicine and the sale of medicines, see the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act.  This conversation is not serious, and I am done here.   () 22:52, 8 November 2016 (UTC)

mdcalc.com

A user, , has been adding ELs to articles, and using as a ref, sites within [http://www.mdcalc.com/ mdcalc.com].  

Examples:
* [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shock_%28circulatory%29&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=654661182&amp;oldid=654660813 dif] on Shock (circulatory)

* [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thrombosis&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=683335084 dif] on Thrombosis

They have been doing this off and on for several years now. 

They seem to be pretty savvy about diagnosis, per edits like [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pulmonary_embolism&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=750073564 this] (badly reffed but well intentioned), and same [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thrombosis&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=683334969 here]. 

Generally their pattern is add some content, then the EL to mdcalc. 

If you review  you will see that various folks have reached out to them, and they are not responsive; they have used a talk page twice, [https://tools.wmflabs.org/xtools-ec/?user=Mxdlvn&amp;project=en.wikipedia.org ever].

Bottom line, is mdcalc.com a useful EL or should we delete the ELs and refs to it?   Should we add it to the spam blacklist?

Nasal Mist Flu Vaccine Influenza vaccine

I realized that the US has modified their recommendations re Nasal Mist for 2016-17 flu season. I think that the wiki article should be updated accordingly, unless I am missing it. Last I heard, Canada is still supplying the nasal mist for children in 2016-2017, but also offers the injection. I am not sure about other parts of the world. Does anyone in the community want to try to tackle this in the wiki article? It comes up in a couple different sections 
Influenza Vaccine.
It has already been addressed in the Live Attenuated Virus wiki article, and there is a link from the Influenza article, but I think that it is important to update it on the influenza vaccine page as well.

 I'd encourage you to start a section on  to explain your concerns, as that would be more visible to editors of the article, especially once this page is archived. I agree that the edit is far too detailed for the lead and does not represent a summary of any part of the body of the article. I doubt that the information is undue for the article, though, as a similar point is made in the last paragraph of the General Criticism section, DSM-5 #General.

Category help - [[:Category:Monoclonal antibodies]] versus [[:Category:Therapeutic antibodies]]

My sense is that most of the pages currently categorized under [[:Category:Monoclonal antibodies]] really ought to be categorized under [[:Category:Therapeutic antibodies]]. Populating [[:Category:Monoclonal antibodies]] with recombinant antibodies used as drugs gives the sense that Monoclonal antibodies are chiefly relevant as drugs (which they're not).  () 15:24, 21 November 2016 (UTC)
The solution is not obvious to me (as a clinician and immunologist). The two categories do not overlap completely - there are members of each that are not members of the other. —  () 15:30, 21 November 2016 (UTC)
 - Seems to me that [[:Category:Monoclonal antibodies]] should definitely not be a subcategory of [[:Category:Therapeutic antibodies]]. I think that sort of implies that all monoclonal antibodies are therapeutic antibodies. 
I could be wrong here. I'm not super familiar with categorization rules.  () 20:04, 21 November 2016 (UTC)
My understanding is that the categories are not exclusive. If something is a therapeutic antibody and also a monoclonal antibody, then both would apply. I don't see a compelling reason to avoid the overlap. —  () 20:47, 21 November 2016 (UTC)
There are certainly monoclonal antibodies that are never used in therapeutic applications (e.g., the monoclonal antibodies used in home pregnancy tests).  Polyclonal antivenins are going to be therapeutic but not monoclonal.   () 05:25, 22 November 2016 (UTC)
 - I may need to polish up on my understanding of the categorization rules. I would have thought if an article were categorized as a &quot;Monoclonal Antibody&quot; and &quot;Monoclonal Antibody&quot; is a subcat of &quot;Therapeutic Antibody&quot;, then by implication the article would have something to do with therapeutic antibodies. I may have that wrong. Let me brush up on policy.  () 11:05, 22 November 2016 (UTC)
Ahh - sorry - I was responding to the content of the question, not the structure of the categories. These two sets intersect, but neither is a subset of the other. I think WAID is saying the same thing. I'm not sure how the categories should be structured to account for the reality that they are both subsets of antibodies, with substantial overlap. —  () 12:20, 22 November 2016 (UTC)
 - re &quot;neither is a subset of the other&quot; - Yes. I think that's the point I was trying to make. [[:Category:Monoclonal antibodies]] should definitely not be a subcategory of [[:Category:Therapeutic antibodies]].  () 02:25, 23 November 2016 (UTC)
I agree with that statement. I don't think this will solve the &quot;problem&quot; with which you started the thread - it's likely that [[:Category:Monoclonal antibodies]] will continue to contain a predominance of therapeutic antibodies. —  () 02:34, 23 November 2016 (UTC)
 - Yes. Well I guess one potential solution would be to remove [[:Category:Monoclonal antibodies]] from [[:Category:Therapeutic antibodies]], then just add the [[:Category:Therapeutic antibodies]] to all the articles in [[:Category:Monoclonal antibodies]] that it correctly applies to. I think this is right solution. Unfortunately, this is going to require bulk category addition, which isn't something I've done before. I think  can do this pretty quickly.... I'll look into it.
Anyways, appreciate your thinking through this with me !  () 01:22, 24 November 2016 (UTC)

() 20:35, 22 November 2016 (UTC)

 The point of Wikidata is to make facts available to all of the Wikipedia projects. You could argue that as the largest Wikipedia by far, the English Wikipedia editors could do a lot to spread information beyond the English-speaking world by improving the reliability of the 24,500,000 items in the Wikidata database. We could spend a little time adding references to information there, particularly for articles that we have an interest in. Magnus has created a gadget that allows you to drag and drop references from an en-wp article onto its Wikidata entries that I've found makes the process far quicker and more intuitive. See [[:d:Special:Preferences #mw-prefsection-gadgets|Wikidata -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Gadgets]] -&gt; Drag'n'drop with a quick visual tutorial at . That not only makes the data more reliable for us to re-use, but also makes reliable data available for the other 280+ language Wikipedias and third-parties. -- () 00:33, 23 November 2016 (UTC)
Hm.  the next video that youtube presented to me was a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=645bk8HQ4aw training video], where the instructor, who is teaching people how to edit WD, notes empty fields in a WD entry, jumps to the related WP article, finds something about those fields there, and types it into WikiData.  The stuff he grabbed was unsourced, and the instructor -- the instructor - didn't even pause to look to see if the words were sourced, much less if the source was reliable.  Horrible.   I worry that a lot of the stuff in Wikidata got there this way - that people just run around sucking words into WikiData with no  regard for sourcing.   () 01:21, 23 November 2016 (UTC)
And in [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWZQeNpBmRM this video], Lydia Pintscher spends twenty minutes teaching an undergrad class how to create an item in WD, and they do an entry on a person.  They get going and very soon in, she says, &quot;I have been told this person is a composer&quot; and types it in.  Same thing with citizenship, member of a band the person is in, etc..   Deeper in she encourages people to go around in WD and add stuff if they see it missing.  No mention of sourcing.   Not a single word.   So this lack of concern for whether words being entered into WD are true or false or even verifiable is apparently baked in very deep.   () 01:44, 23 November 2016 (UTC)
I don't think you've got the memo about how we now inhabit a post-truth world. Get with the programme, man.  () 04:34, 23 November 2016 (UTC)

 You can see the problem that many folks who spend time at Wikidata haven't spent their editing career trying to hold back a flood of POV-pushers and paid editors on the encyclopedia. It's easy for us to tell others that sourcing is the most important element in editing, but we've learned that lesson the hard way. For your edification, you can paste  into any section of an article and preview it; it will tabulate the Wikidata claims related to the article and the corresponding Wikidata references (if any). I always find it disappointing how many items are unreferenced or &quot;imported from xyz Wikipedia&quot;, but you can understand why that is. I suppose it will only be when regular Wikipedia editors decide to curate the Wikidata entries corresponding the articles they care about that the situation will improve. -- () 21:00, 23 November 2016 (UTC)

Wikidata new developments
I wish to confirm all the criticism stated above about Wikidata by Jytdog, RexxS, Ozzie10aaaa, and Alexbrn. Wikidata's current practice of permitted uncited content is a major problem. In the long term, lack of sourcing is intolerable. In the short term, I understand that projects need time to develop, but I think anyone would be right to worry about how long poor quality information can be tolerated and how much that poor quality information influences Wikipedia and Wikimedia content readers.

Although I have trouble imagining how to reconcile the good and bad with Wikidata, the power of the good things which I see amaze me. I also am continually surprised by the pace of development of Wikidata tools and applications, which I feel come quickly and often and with a complexity of possibility that I feel is monumental even if I do not understand them. I cannot articulate the significance of this, for example, but perhaps someone would look at this with me -
*[https://blog.wikimedia.de/2016/10/30/10-cool-queries-for-wikidata-that-will-blow-your-mind-number-7-will-shock-you/ 10 cool queries for Wikidata that will blow your mind. Number 7 will shock you.]

These are SPARQL queries at [https://query.wikidata.org https://query.wikidata.org]. I think that many WP:MED supporters would be interested to know that query.wikidata.org exists, and might like to check what it can do. I suggest starting with the &quot;famous cats&quot; query. That one is easy to understand, because it asks for all the Wikidata items that are &quot;instance of&quot; (which is property 31) &quot;cat&quot; (which is item 146). The other queries are more complicated, like &quot;show me the breakdown of causes of death for every royal person in history&quot;, &quot;show me the gestation time of every animal in the graphical format that I choose&quot;,  or something like &quot;map all the ABC which are not XYZ&quot;.

About the sourcing - quality control is coming. Wikidata has about 300,000 items for references. When the time comes that [[:meta:WikiCite]] allows more, then I expect all 60 million of PubMed entries will be among the first to be imported, but with Wikidata currently only being 25 million entries, it would overwhelm the community there to have so many citations now. Part of the reason why Wikidata is not currently using more citations is because they do not want to manually manage a few hundred thousand like English Wikipedia - the project is anticipating grabbing PubMed, the Chinese ones, the German ones, and then the table of contents for every book and magazine in the world. I just have no idea of when this will happen, but if anyone wants to see how it will look, check out the symptoms section of gout for example [[:d:Q133087]] then follow the reference.

Dual brain theory

This article seems kind of fringy. It mainly cites the work of one researcher on a proposed psychological treatment to rebalance the brain's hemispheres after traumatic experiences apparently cause one half to become dominate. The sources look to be primary, are mostly from a single author, and half are from the nineties. It has been tagged as needing expert review for over six years.  () 09:11, 25 November 2016 (UTC)

I've started looking at this, and I think the best result is to split/merge/redirect it.  There are a couple of pieces here, but the main story goes something like this:  Back in the 19th century, they decided that one hemisphere was dominant over the other (and the &quot;correct&quot; way was for the left hemisphere to dominate; if it didn't, then you got inferior people, such as women and criminals and non-northern-Europeans).  This idea was both the state-of-the-art medical opinion and also present in pop culture.  Then in the 1920s, when modern medicine started, they ignored it.  But then in the 1960s, it came back, because of split-brain syndrome after surgery, which developed into silly pop (pseudo-)science and doubtless some lucrative careers for buzzword-spewing business consultants (see Lateralization of brain function).  The idea in this article is that something similar to split-brain syndrome can happen as a result of psychological experiences (an idea that originated in the 19th century) rather than purely as a result of surgery or other physical insults to the brain.
So my recommendation is to merge this away, leaving behind the history because of some material that I copied to another article, and also adding a brief mention in Lateralization of brain function that says this old idea (that unpleasant experiences can cause changes to brain function) has been revived by so-and-so.  Does that sound good to everyone here?
(Also, if you're interested in the history of the idea, then https://books.google.com/books?id=y4YMSE9HUEMC seems to know what it's talking about.)   () 21:38, 25 November 2016 (UTC)
The &quot;Dual brain and psychology&quot; section is probably UNDUE. That leaves the history section which is very small and so I agree merging is probably in order. Is there anything else worth salvaging from the history section?  () 06:00, 26 November 2016 (UTC)

Caries

Seeking to confirm my layman's guess about the meaning of &quot;spinal caries&quot;, which we mention in at least two articles, and find out what causes it, I came upon , which justifies making caries into a redirect to Dental caries based on the usage of caries for an osteolytic bone lesion being antiquated. It seems we don't have any article dealing with osteolytic lesions of bone to which I can redirect the now inappropriate links going from &quot;spinal caries&quot; and the like to the &quot;caries&quot; redirect. But I note we're also using that term in one or other of those forms in at least two articles. Is there indeed some link target I've failed to find? Otherwise, I think we do need an article on caries/osteolytic bone lesions in general, similar to the scope of the pre-redirect caries article and reflecting currently used terminology. Since that was a wholly or entirely unreferenced article and I very obviously don't have the necessary educational background, I can't do this myself.  () 21:13, 17 November 2016 (UTC)
So you are proposing making a &quot;Caries (disambig)&quot;? That includes dental caries and osteolytic bone lesions? [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 21:59, 17 November 2016 (UTC)
 Well, we can't make a dab page until we have more than one article - and even then, a hatnote is preferred if there are only two articles. The first thing to do would be to create osteolytic bone lesions, which I see has just been redirected to Osteolysis. The previous version of Caries is still in its page history as , so perhaps there's something there to salvage? There's only one reference though. I'll make a temporary fix by putting a hatnote on Dental caries, and perhaps the articles that should be linked directly to Osteolysis could be updated, if that's appropriate? -- () 22:16, 17 November 2016 (UTC)
Thanks, the redirect works well; I didn't have the medical knowledge to confidently create it myself. I've added it to 3 biographies mentioning spinal caries, 2 of which were misleadingly linking to caries, but must now go to bed, as I'm starting to typo altogether too much.  () 22:39, 17 November 2016 (UTC)
Googling for instances I'd missed, I see references to tuberculous spondylitis—which we cover at Pott disease—as being a better name for it; maybe that's just the most common cause, where TB is still rampant. Some See alsoing needed?  () 13:28, 18 November 2016 (UTC)
 The most thorough way to find incoming links is to check . Most will be related to Dental caries, of course, but looking at all 105 links is sure to find all of the existing instances. A lot of them can be skipped if they are not in article space. I'll do the last 55 if somebody wants to check the first 50? -- () 18:15, 18 November 2016 (UTC)
I've done that in the past, but in this instance I'm concerned with what's meant rather than what's linked (at least one biography had no link at all). I think I've tracked down all the instances of &quot;spinal caries&quot; now, and enough of the instances of osteolytic lesions of bone where a link could usefully be added (some already linked osteolytic). This is a new concern based on the same issue, that as a person with no medical training I can't be expected to know what it is, let alone what it's called these days. I've now found a source saying it's now recognised as having actually been tuberculous spondylitis, and searching for that led me to a different article, so I'm wondering how they should be linked for the reader. If I were confident I am interpreting correctly, I'd put a link in the text at Pott disease to osteolysis and a See also at osteolysis to Pott disease. I'm puzzled by the total failure of the osteolysis article to mention tuberculosis, which is very much still present in many parts of the world. But I don't know what I'm doing, hence I ask here instead.  () 18:27, 18 November 2016 (UTC)
 Well, I found one link that wasn't Dental caries. It wasn't referring to Osteolysis, either. In Ibrahim Iskandar I, we were informing the world that East India Companies were interested in cowries and caries. That should have been &quot;caires&quot; (coconut fibre), a rather more profitable trading commodity than tooth decay. -- () 19:34, 18 November 2016 (UTC)

Body mass index

The body mass index article gives too much weight to arguments like [http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/why-being-overweight-means-you-live-longer-the-way-scientists-twist-the-facts-10158229.html published here] without mentioning the prevailing scientific opinion about the origins of the &quot;obesity paradox&quot;. It was suspected for a long time that unhealthy lifestyles can also lead to low BMI e.g. smoking, but you can also have people who don't eat well due to all sorts of health reasons like depression, drugs abuse, etc. On needs to do very sophisticated statistical analysis to correct for all the relevant effects before you can reliably extract what the expected health effects to some individual would be if that person were to lose or gain weight. In [http://www.bmj.com/content/355/bmj.i5855 this recent article] the results of a rigorous analysis based on the data from the Nurses' Health Study has been published, the results are not at all surprising to me at least:

&quot;Conclusion
Although people with a higher BMI can have lower risk of premature mortality if they also have at least one low risk lifestyle factor, the lowest risk of premature mortality is in people in the 18.5-22.4 BMI range with high score on the alternate healthy eating index, high level of physical activity, moderate alcohol drinking, and who do not smoke. It is important to consider diet and lifestyle factors in the evaluation of the association between BMI and mortality.&quot;

&quot;Discussion
After adjustment for the effect of high levels of physical activity, healthy diet (AHEI scores), moderate alcohol drinking, and never smoking, men and women with a BMI in the range 18.5-22.4 have a significantly lower risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and total mortality. In contrast, men and women with a BMI &lt;22.4 and unhealthy lifestyles had a significantly higher risk of mortality than overweight individuals. Our findings suggest that the U shaped relation between BMI and mortality detected in previous epidemiological studies could result from an over-representation of people in our industrialized societies who are, or most likely became, lean because of the chronic accumulation of metabolic, inflammatory, and pathological conditions caused by long term exposure to smoking, a sedentary lifestyle, and unhealthy diets. Interestingly, our data indicate that even in overweight and obese individuals, the exposure to one or more low risk lifestyle behaviors significantly reduced their risk of mortality.&quot;.

Did this article really just conclude that smoking, sitting on the couch, and eating junk food causes weight loss?   () 18:16, 28 November 2016 (UTC)
 I think it concluded that becoming seriously illas a result of a lifetime of smoking, sitting on the couch, and eating junk foodcould cause someone to become emaciated. -- () 18:58, 28 November 2016 (UTC)

If you replace a healthy diet by an unhealthy diet and keep the caloric value the same, you're not necessarily going to gain much weight. There are many people who have a normal weight who don't bother taking the time to cook, they just buy ready to eat meals from the supermarket and put that in the microwave. Such ready to eat meals are not always high in calories (I would lose weight rapidly and become underweight if I tried to live off such meals), but they often do contain a lot of salt and they often lack enough vegetables. 

But this is not the central point of the article, they simply report on the results of a proper statistical analysis, the results of which are in conflict with previous results and the most likely explanation for that is a hidden subgroup of people with a normal weight who live a very unhealthy lifestyle.

Use of primary sources in medical articles - Neuroangiogenesis

Hi, I work as the  at the University of Edinburgh and my colleague, Dr Chris Harlow () has been running Wikipedia assignments for 4th year Honours undergraduates in the Reproductive Biology course this year &amp; last year, whereby the students research a reproductive medicine term not represented on Wikipedia and then co-create the new article. Last year, they helped research &amp; create the Wikipedia article on Neuroangiogenesis. Recently, while the latest iteration of the  was going on with approx 40 students creating 8 new articles on reproductive medicine, Chris worked to improve the Neuroangiogenesis article by citing [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuroangiogenesis&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=741614335&amp;oldid=741570576 some research findings published in reliable journals]. These were flagged as  and the edits reverted. Chris has been arguing, not unconvincingly, that the research these articles indicate should be allowed on Wikipedia as the quality of review articles can often be inferior in comparison. As a layman when it comes to writing medical articles, I realise that WP:Primary is an important issue for medical articles but I wondered if Chris had a legitimate point. Would you be able to clarify the stance on the use of [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neuroangiogenesis&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=741614335&amp;oldid=741570576 such articles] as sources for medical pages? Or be able to point me in the direction where such discussions should be taken?  would obviously be able to articulate his concern better than I so could discuss on his Talk page or here on the WikiProject Medicine Talk page perhaps? Let me know what you think anyway. Best regards,  () 18:13, 30 November 2016 (UTC)
Thanks . Why not use secondary sources is the question? Yes some secondary sources can be of poor quality but many are of high quality and we should be using the high quality ones. If the content has never been mentioned in a high quality secondary source it does raise a bit of a red flag that it could be a one off. One major aspect of the scientific method is repeatability. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 19:29, 30 November 2016 (UTC)
I agree with you that secondary sources are not automatically better than primary ones.  On the other hand, an astoundingly high percentage of primary biomedical research cannot be reproduced.  Furthermore, results in animals often do not translate into humans. This is especially true with Alzheimer's disease where therapeutic approaches that appear to work in animals models have spectacularly failed in human clinical trials.  It is much safer to cite high quality review articles that weigh the available evidence. Preclinical research result are not prohibited in Wikipedia, but per , it is essential that it is not implied that the results of testing in animals will also apply to humans.  () 21:50, 30 November 2016 (UTC)
For what its worth there is an essay  that explains some of this (I started it but others have worked on it).  Briefly, every WP content policy (, , and ) says we should use secondary sources, and that is because our mission, per , is &quot;to summarize accepted knowledge&quot;.   Secondary sources are where we can most securely find &quot;accepted knowledge&quot; and get a good sense of what is widely held, what is a minority opinion, and what is plain FRINGE. MEDRS just makes that more explicit, and as Boghog and Doc James eloquently explained there are lots of reasons why this is extra important in health/medicine.   Why MEDRS? explains this in too much detail.   () 22:07, 30 November 2016 (UTC)
Hello  and . Since I reverted the content and literature in question, let me comment. First, the existing literature for the Neuroangiogenesis article is mostly , with no systematic review on the topic among the 8 references that would satisfy . The first proposed article to include PMID 21771586 in transgenic mice is more about VEGF than angiogenesis, so is preliminary/primary to the topic. The second article PMID 22850316 is an hypothesis opinion not suitable for summarizing facts about neuroangiogenesis. The existing article is highly speculative, similar to what might be included as &quot;potential mechanisms&quot; or &quot;future research&quot; in a research article, not adhering very well, in my opinion, to the goals of Wikipedia per , 6-7. There is a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease_research WP article on Alzheimer's disease research] where the Ambrose review may be better suited, but it also is [http://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad120067 plainly stated as an hypothesis] which is not a good WP source. -- () 23:15, 30 November 2016 (UTC)
  To imply something only becomes a fact when it is proven in humans is nonsensical.  makes no such argument.  Given the enormous amount preclinical research that has been performed in neurodegenerative diseases that is back up by secondary sources, per , this is fair game for inclusion into Wikipedia, as long as it is made clear that these results may not translate into humans. While  contain opinions, they are also full of facts about the current state of knowledge concerning neuroangiogenesis as it relates to Alzheimer's disease.  () 07:32, 1 December 2016 (UTC)

Image at female ejaculation article

There is [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Female_ejaculation&amp;oldid=752927798#Image_restored a discussion] at  about whether or not to use a real-life image depicting female ejaculation. I have concerns because the existence of female ejaculation is heavily debated among scholars and people have been known to photoshop photographs to look like female ejaculation, especially in the pornography media. Some pornography actresses have faked female ejaculation onscreen. As [http://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/advice/a5085/squirting-sex-realness/ this] 2013 Cosmopolitan source states, &quot;Porn has encouraged men to believe that when they've truly rocked a woman's body, it starts doing an impression of the Bellagio Fountain in the second-to-last scene of Ocean's Eleven.&quot; In that same source, sex therapist Ian Kerner states, &quot;Involuntary squirting is the Loch Ness Monster of sex. In other words, an unverifiable legend.&quot; The literature commonly attributes the type of &quot;gushing&quot; seen in the debated photograph to the bladder (meaning urine or mostly urine, or closer to urine to than to female ejaculate). Even Kerner, in the Cosmopolitan source, categorizes gushing as &quot;closer to pee than it is to female ejaculate.&quot; And a pornography actress in the source states that &quot;the extreme version of squirting — is often smoke and mirrors.&quot; She believes &quot;squirting&quot; is real, but thinks that it's rare and difficult to achieve.

Per the image description, this picture doesn't seem to have anything to do with the article other than that the woman is old and is in the demographic for likely incontinence.

In summary, an editor, , wants to remove the term &quot;toxic&quot; referred to wheat gluten for people with celiac disease [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Wheat&amp;diff=752832490&amp;oldid=752822767] (which is used worldwide in this context for years -see [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=(toxic)+AND+gliadin] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=(toxicity)+AND+gliadin][https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=(toxic)%20AND%20gluten] [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=(toxicity)+AND+gluten]), because he does not like it and against Wikipedia policies (such as  , , etc.). 

Perhaps we are facing a  or a . Here are the top articles from RAMRashan's [https://tools.wmflabs.org/xtools-ec/?user=RAMRashan&amp;project=en.wikipedia.org edit count]:

The POV pusher here is Ballena; sample [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wheat&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=752855309&amp;oldid=752829160 dif] where they actually added content to an article that flatly described gluten as &quot;toxic&quot;.   We might as well describe water as &quot;toxic&quot; every time we mention it as thousands of people have gotten brain damage or died from exposure to it.  When you make blatantly bad edits like that you can expect them to be reverted.    () 23:12, 3 December 2016 (UTC)

When I and others at the gluten at wheat pages suggested bringing up your behavior here yet again BallenaBlanca, it wasn't so you could cast blatant  about editors. I was giving you the benefit the doubt of this all being part of language barrier issue or just being overzealous for whatever reason in this topic as a claimed gastroenterologist, but your edits combined with attacking editors is very much looking like the hallmarks of . Ironically, compared to RAMRashan where this is no evidence of COI and actually a good spread of topics for a newer agriculture editor (SPA claim is silly there), BallenaBlanca has stated their main research is [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:BallenaBlanca&amp;oldid=551054160 on celiac disease and associated autoimmune disorders]. This may be evidence that they are too close to the topic at hand in terms of COI themselves, but that's probably better brought up at .

The main issue here is that BallenaBlanca is having a lot of trouble with due weight and really overblowing the idea that gluten is &quot;toxic&quot; and that there has been a sudden paradigm change in the literature that gluten is now considered  a major problem outside of celiac disease. We already extensively discussed their behavior [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine/Archive_79#BallenaBlanca.E2.80.8E_and_some_gluten_POV-pushing.2C_in_my_view already at this project]. I'm not sure what else we can do here for this mix of behavior and content issues with BallenaBlanca, but it does look like they're overall edits need a second look.  () 23:51, 3 December 2016 (UTC)

Even after heavy editing today, the section on wheat health effects remains over-weighted and over-referenced to the gluten story, likely misleading the typical encyclopedia user to believe that the main health issue about wheat is its small gluten content and the impact this has on only 1% of the general population. I find this uneven emphasis to be ridiculous, but  prevails on editing with a heavy hand. -- () 00:10, 4 December 2016 (UTC)
Zefr you are cutting out important well referenced details. Three relatively small paragraphs is not excessive. There is more to gluten than celiac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis is also notable. 
I have replaced &quot;toxic&quot; with &quot;harmful for people with coeliac disease&quot; as 1) it is stating a fact 2) is easier to understand IMO. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 00:16, 4 December 2016 (UTC)

Ballena, what exactly are you trying to communicate when you use the word toxic to describe a protein that most people can eat with no apparent harm?  
I looked at your suggested searches.  After limiting it to reviews during the most recent five years, I found that they produced very few sources ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=(toxin+OR+toxicity)+AND+(gliadin+OR+gluten) nine], if you want to run the search more efficiently) – and that many of those few sources seemed to use the word rather loosely, instead of being precise about the distinctions between toxins, antigens, allergens, etc.  Those nine contrast with the 542 reviews (about 98%) during that period that mention gluten and/or gliadin and don't use that word.  That comparison makes me feel about 98% against the idea of using that word to describe the protein.  But presumably you've got a point that you think should be made, and it's presumably something beyond &quot;be scared, because this is just as toxic as snake venom and pesticides and dioxins and mercury&quot;.  If you can tell us what your goal is, then we can probably come up with a way to present that information.   () 05:05, 6 December 2016 (UTC)

 Toxicity is only in the context of celiac disease, I have never said otherwise. We can also use cytotoxic or enterotoxic or immunogenic.

You can see [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gluten_immunochemistry&amp;oldid=731184641 Gluten immunochemistry] in which I have not done any edit [https://tools.wmflabs.org/sigma/usersearch.py?name=BallenaBlanca&amp;page=Gluten_immunochemistry&amp;server=enwiki&amp;max=] and the use of the terms here [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gluten_immunochemistry&amp;oldid=731184641#HLA_Class_I_restrictions_to_gliadin &quot;antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity&quot;], here [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gluten_immunochemistry&amp;oldid=731184641#DQ2_and_glutelins &quot;toxic protein&quot;] and here [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gluten_immunochemistry&amp;oldid=731184641#Taming_Triticeae_Immunochemistry &quot;toxicity of gliadins&quot;] and several refs, present since the first version, edited by  at 06:44, 19 June 2008 [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gluten_immunochemistry&amp;oldid=220297455].

Anyway, we have removed the term from wheat (all the possible terms) and the result is good, I agree with it [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wheat&amp;oldid=753409364]. I will not insist, I explain this to you because you asked. As I said [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Wheat&amp;diff=752855452&amp;oldid=752848032], oats could be the best example why it would be convenient to explain what toxicity means for people with CD, and avoid they be surprised by the term. [http://journals.lww.com/jcge/Fulltext/2013/02000/World_Gastroenterology_Organisation_Global.9.aspx World Gastroenterology Organisation Global Guidelines on Celiac Disease] [http://www.nature.com/ajg/journal/v108/n5/full/ajg201379a.html American College of Gastroenterology - Clinical Guidelines: Diagnosis and Management of Celiac Disease].

You searched the term &quot;toxin&quot;. No, no toxin, but &quot;toxic&quot;. And we have [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=(toxic+OR+toxicity)+AND+(gliadin+OR+gluten) 88, 20 of them from last 5 years]. And note that the first mentions go back to 1972. And if we expand the search with cytotoxic or enterotoxic, we find [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=(toxic+OR+toxicity+OR+cytotoxic+OR+enterotoxic)+AND+(gliadin+OR+gluten) 106,  28 of them from last 5 years].

Best regards. --    01:35, 7 December 2016 (UTC)
So the main problem with writing &quot;toxic&quot; isn't that less than 5% of sources use it.  It's that normal readers will misunderstand it.  Because if you go to your neighbor, or the grocery store clerk, and you ask them to name a couple of toxins, they're going to think about &quot;chemicals&quot; and &quot;poisons&quot; rather than &quot;common food that some people happen to react badly to&quot;.  And if you tell them that this is &quot;toxic&quot;, then they're going to think that Wikipedia says that it's just like scary chemicals and poisons.  In other words, if we write toxic, we'll be mis-educating nearly all of our readers.
I think that immunogenic would be a good choice.  It feels like it has less room for such misunderstandings.  Will that work for you?   () 02:16, 7 December 2016 (UTC)

How much [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGGQxJLuVjg salt, sugar, and fat] did you eat today?  () 22:06, 7 December 2016 (UTC)

, what you say makes sense. I agree. The issue of toxicity is a matter of adapting the language for the lay readers, you're right. One observation: the percentage of sources that mention it is not relevant, it depends on the concret topic on which they focus, not always talk about pathophysiology. The fact is that it has been used for more than 40 years among specialists.

In summary, we have removed the term toxic, and two paragraphs about gluten-related disorders &quot;is not too much in an article this size and is far from undue weight&quot; [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Wheat&amp;diff=753240840&amp;oldid=753234227], especially taking into account the format of other similar Wikipedia pages [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Wheat&amp;diff=753220736&amp;oldid=753184056] and the criteria that have been followed by the editors in them [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Wheat&amp;diff=753324857&amp;oldid=753312782].

New article needs attention

Please see Structured Triage System, the sources are all in Spanish so proficiency in the language would be useful. The topic seems clearly notable but the devil's in the detail, in some areas the referencing seems a bit thin. It could also do with more wikilinks.  () 07:47, 8 December 2016 (UTC)
per [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources_(medicine)] page documents an English Wikipedia content guideline... 10 of 12 refs need to be replaced w/ the English equivalent(or have article available in both languages, did not find evidence of the English equivalent)...IMO-- () 12:03, 8 December 2016 (UTC)
There's no such rule.  MEDRS only uses the word English to say that pop-science magazines often have the virtue of writing in &quot;plain English&quot;.  Non-English sources are permitted under the policy .  
Since this program is currently used only in Spanish-speaking countries, I think that it's unlikely that we'll find very many sources about it in English (or any language other than Spanish).  We have a handful of Spanish speakers here at WPMED, but if we need more help, then we can ask at the usual places for finding translators (WikiProject Spain, , etc.).
