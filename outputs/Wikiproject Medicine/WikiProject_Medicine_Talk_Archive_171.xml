After expanding Gustatory hyperhidrosis I'm starting to notice that most of the classification systems seem to list it as a synonym for Frey's syndrome. Before i make a redirect can anyone else find a clear distinction between the two.

Promotional edits relating to Cord blood.

I've recently got done with reverting a large amount of promotional editing relating to private cord blood banks across several articles, from a couple of single-purpose IP editors. These edits included non- sourcing, namedropping of particular companies, and cherry-picking quotes from various bodies to misrepresent their support for cord blood treatments. Here's a list of articles I found problems with:

* Amniotic stem cells
* Cell potency
* Cord blood bank
* Cord blood
* Cordlife
* Cryo-Save
* Developmental verbal dyspraxia
* Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
* Hematopoietic stem cell
* Ideational apraxia
* Matthew Schissler
* Motor neuron diseases
* Neurological disorder
* Prenatal care in the United States
* Regenerative medicine
* Stem cell
* Stem-cell therapy
* Tay–Sachs disease
* Umbilical cord

I think it is very likely that this is undisclosed paid editing. Please consider putting the affected articles on your watchlist to keep an eye out for more promo. - MrOllie (talk) 16:27, 22 March 2024 (UTC)

The Cass Review

The Cass Review is an important and much anticipated &quot;independent review of gender identity services for children and young people&quot; led by Hilary Cass, which was commissioned by NHS England in 2020 and is due to report tomorrow (10th April 2024). It is likely to generate a lot of news coverage, but hopefully also some professional responses too. The Wikipedia article was only created yesterday by  so likely isn't on many watchlists.

Chronic functional abdominal pain

I'm currently updating the page Chronic functional abdominal pain and I have questions about the article title.

The ICD11 lists it as functional abdominal pain syndrome.[https://icd.who.int/browse/2024-01/mms/en#1424508974] However several article discuss renaming it to Centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome.[https://link-springer-com.wikipedialibrary.idm.oclc.org/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-319-90761-1_99-1]

I'm just wondering what name would be more appropriate here. CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 23:11, 9 April 2024 (UTC)

Since CMAP is mentioned in the first sentence of the  lede it's probably not an issue worth worrying about, but  guidance is always worth a read. CV9933 (talk) 11:29, 10 April 2024 (UTC)
Yeah the main problem I have with the current title is that it doesn't distinguish it as a syndrome or disease and that may lead to confusion. According to  &quot;The article title should be the scientific or recognised medical name that is most commonly used in recent, high-quality, English-language medical sources, rather than a lay term (unscientific or slang name) or an historical eponym that has been superseded.&quot; and the ICD-11 is recommended for disease names. The only thing is that the ICD-11 uses the term &quot;functional abdominal pain syndrome&quot; but newer literature including the Rome criteria uses the term &quot; Centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome&quot; CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 19:13, 10 April 2024 (UTC)
These types of discussions often lead to those who would propose that when searched, title A produced X hits and title B returned XXX hits therefore title B  should be used. But MEDTITLE also tells us that some terminology is in flux and recently proposed names may not yet be widespread in adoption, from which one might infer that there is no rush and doing nothing for now is probably the best course of action. CV9933 (talk) 19:42, 10 April 2024 (UTC)
My only problem with the current title is that it isn't commonly used in literature and isn't classified under any of the disease databases (for lack of better terms) that we use. WP:MEDTITTLE also specifies that &quot;The article title should be the scientific or recognised medical name&quot; which isn't true for Chronic functional abdominal pain. I think it would make more sense to rename it to &quot;functional abdominal pain syndrome&quot; as that seems to be the more recognized term and is what's used by the ICD-11 and because as you mentioned proposed names might not be widespread. CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 20:31, 10 April 2024 (UTC)
You could be bold and just change it with your rationale in the edit summary, or propose a move on the article talk page. If the latter, then use it as an opportunity to gain consensus to update the title to CAMPS. CV9933 (talk) 08:49, 11 April 2024 (UTC)
Thank you for your help! I’ll change it tonight when I have the time to make sure all the names match. CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 18:28, 11 April 2024 (UTC)

Cass Review

Hi all

A major review into trans healthcare, the Cass Review, has been published in the UK, I'd really appreciate if people with an understanding of medical research could read it, its currently a very edited article with quite high traffic. To put it mildly the report is being used by politicians and press to push for restrictions to healthcare provisions. The report has been criticised by academics and trans groups in the UK for issues with both its research methodology and its recommendations, but I don't have experience in writing about this kind of thing on Wikipedia.

Thanks

Hi! I hope this is the right venue for this feedback. I have chronic medical problems that were slowly destroying my life, and none of my doctors could figure out what was going on or what to do about it. I have now identified some of my conditions and found treatments that help a great deal, and my doctors and I are working to understand my illness more clearly and improve my symptoms further. I finally get to start living a real life again, and I couldn't have done it without the tireless efforts of WikiProject Medicine contributors.

How do we welcome new editors? There's an essay (much of which I wrote): . It includes all the empirical evidence I could find on the question (if you find more, please add it).

Thanks HLHJ. That’s a great essay. I’m especially amazed by the graphs, for example:

I agree with you that adding the { { citation needed } } feature to Huggle may help. It will need other features like { { medref inline } } as welll. --Dustfreeworld (talk) 17:54, 11 March 2024 (UTC)
I think other tags are a good idea, too; I commented on  to suggest a general tool for adding inline point &amp; span tags. Anyone can add a comment or token; adding specific ideas about use cases might be quite useful.
I didn't actually make the graphs myself!  It might be possible to remake that &gt;decade-old graph live via Wikidata now. HLHJ (talk) 18:40, 11 March 2024 (UTC)
Yep the graph needs update. The trend seemed to indicate that “Other bots” were becoming the major problem (not Huggle) in 2011? --Dustfreeworld (talk) 18:49, 11 March 2024 (UTC)
I don't think Huggle is the problem; semi-automated editing countered an existential threat. Cluebot is, I think, also part of the solution; the third of those 2011 new users who were reverted by Cluebot were probably almost all vandals. Because  says &quot;inline-tagged new editors stay, reverted new editors leave&quot;, I think the problem is that it's now hard to inline-tag noob edits. This is not an intrinsic problem. It's hard to imagine a scenario where newcomers don't need semiautomated scrutiny. It's easy to imagine an interface where adding &quot;cn&quot; to a new edit is a single click. 
The longstanding lack of semiautomated tagging capabilities is influencing our culture. Pre-2007, citation-needed tagging was very common. It was policy to tag only stuff you thought was unverifiable, and delete it only after giving others a chance to verify it (BLP excepted, it's still policy). Readers knew to distrust anything with a citation needed tag; it was part of pop culture. 
Now, an increasing number of editors think they are expected to revert all probably-true but unsourced content (even on medieval Japanese furniture). It's rare to tag it first or talk to the contributing editor afterwards. I've been working on an explanatory template, contribs welcome.
The current interface marks new editors as pass/fail, and never as &quot;imperfect, but means well and should improve&quot;. Whether a new editor will stay depends mostly on the fate of their first three or four edits. It's more a learning cliff than a learning curve. HLHJ (talk) 02:15, 14 March 2024 (UTC)


Should I omit products that are no longer in clinical trials under a company even with conflicting info on Wikipedia?

I am creating a page for a biopharmaceutical company (no relation), and am currently looking for products that they have been doing clinical trials on so I can list them as products that are currently in their product pipeline.

However, there is one article I have found right now for which the responsibility for clinical trials on a drug has been transferred to another company (although there are probably more that I will have to find).

When I list the drugs currently in the product pipeline for that company, should I omit those being run through clinical trials under another company (where the clinical trials was originally being run under said company), even with conflicting info on Wikipedia?

CrSb0001 (talk) 13:25, 26 April 2024 (UTC)

@CrSb0001, is this the situation you're describing?
* Company A researched Wonderpam for a while.
* Company A transferred Wonderpam to Company B.
* The Wikipedia article on Wonderpam says Company A is researching it.
If so, I suggest that you correct the Wikipedia article on Wonderpam (to say something like &quot;Company A did some research from 2018 to 2020, and transferred it to Company B in 2021&quot;, or whatever the accurate and up-to-date facts are) and that you mention Wonderpam in articles for both companies.  Company A's should say &quot;worked on from 2018 to 2020&quot; (maybe in a
History
or
Timeline
section?) and Company B's should list it as a current pipeline item.
Also, if you're thinking of a list for pipeline items, I suggest that a list with more information than just the names would be helpful.  Even something as short as &quot;Wonderpam, new class of antibiotics&quot; or &quot;Wonderpam, entered phase II trials in 2022&quot; would be more informative than the name alone.

Why is there a wrist pain page? 

This is such a general page.  And much of the information is negatively framed in an unhealthy ways. Ischyros7 (talk) 15:45, 30 April 2024 (UTC)

Wrist pain looks like it would be a useful page for people who want general information or can't remember the name of a particular condition.  Sometimes you just need to look down a list of possible names until you recognize the one that you're looking for.  I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;negatively framed&quot;.  Mostly, I think it has so little information that there's no room for framing it.
@Zefr [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wrist_pain&amp;diff=1189084752&amp;oldid=1189025869 blanked] a bunch of content a few months ago.  (This is what I call treating Wikipedia like the children's game of Mother may I?:  He blanked non-controversial content that he knew was accurate and appropriate, on the grounds that the cited source wasn't ideal.  Most of us would have found a better source or tagged it with  instead.)  It would probably be good to expand it again.  We're missing articles on gymnast's wrist (which is really multiple conditions), so that's one place to start, if anyone's interested. WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:18, 30 April 2024 (UTC)

Use of Verywell Health for the Myolysis article

There is a request to add the Verywell Health page &quot;Myolysis: Everything You Need to Know&quot; (https://www.verywellhealth.com/myolysis-5189197) to the spam whitelist so that it can be cited in the Myolysis article. Verywell Health  was previously added to the  in 2018 because links to Verywell sites had been spammed on Wikipedia. If this whitelisting request is successful, it would be possible for editors to link to this specific page on Wikipedia again.

The whitelisting request proposes citing &quot;Myolysis: Everything You Need to Know&quot; as a  to augment citations of two other sources that Verywell Health cites and summarizes, [https://www.health.ny.gov/community/adults/women/uterine_fibroids/ &quot;Uterine Fibroids&quot; (New York State Department of Health)] and [https://www.brighamandwomens.org/obgyn/minimally-invasive-gynecologic-surgery/uterine-fibroids &quot;Uterine Fibroids&quot; (Brigham and Women's Hospital)].

Calomel - should it be separated into medicine vs rock/mineral?

I made some edits to the page for the historical medicine calomel (that caused mercury poisoning) but the Wikipedia page for it is a strange mix of a page describing the mineral and a page about the medical uses.

The Medicine section is too small to really warrant a separate page, and the calomel page overall isn't . I'd suggest framing the page around  for compounds, which has a Uses section, so its medical use could be seen within that context. Klbrain (talk) 09:58, 2 May 2024 (UTC)

Edit flagged as predatory journal - need help finding out which citation

Hi all,  I recently committed a large paragraph edit with numerous citations using the visual editor, and when committing the edit, I got a notice that one of the citations was automatically flagged as potentially from a predatory journal.  However, the popup notice didn't fit in the publish edit popup box, so I was unable to read the whole notice or see which of the citations was flagged.  Can someone point me to a tool that I can use to scan the article for potentially predatory journals, so I can see and fix this citation problem?  How can I avoid stumbling into this problem again, and why did the formatting of the publish edit box prevent me from seeing the whole notice?  The citations in question were the best available for a scientific project based in India that is necessary for discussion on the page I am editing.  Thanks!

Why do you need to reference a trial that can't even bother to go through peer review?  Headbomb {t ·  ·  · } 23:54, 12 May 2024 (UTC)
 WhatamIdoing yes!  I've copied the paragraph in question here below.  For context, this project was the first method of vas-occlusive contraception to be investigated, and gets a very large amount of (often overblown) publicity in the general news media.  It has performed multiple clinical trials in India in the last 40 years (some of which have had to be repeated to reach international standards, I believe) and most importantly, has now been approved by the Indian Drug Controller's office (equivalent of the US FDA) for use in India, though it has not reached the market yet (supposedly due to manufacturing scale-up issues).  The results of the most recent clinical trial were published in a predatory and possibly poorly peer-reviewed journal, yes, but I don't know whether the authors were aware of that.  I'm struggling to figure out how to discuss this project with fairness, given the seemingly earnest efforts of the treatments creators and the difficult structural conditions for research in India, and the fact that it may soon available for use by over a billion people, while being honest about the project's shortcomings.  I would appreciate any thoughts!
&quot;RISUG is an injectable male contraceptive implant that has been in development in India since the 1970s, and completed Phase-III clinical trials in India in 2017, completely blocking sperm release in 97.3% of users and achieving a 99.02% effectiveness at preventing pregnancy &quot;without any serious side effect&quot;.  As of 2022, RISUG was awaiting approval from the Drug Controller General of India for mass production.  RISUG is proposed to be reversed through a second injection that dissolves the polymer, though reversibility has not yet been demonstrated in humans.&quot;

Willmskinner (talk) 16:35, 13 May 2024 (UTC)

It'd be silly to have Male contraceptive completely omit information about Reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance (RISUG), especially now that it has marketing approval to the largest market on the planet, but it's difficult to find really good sources.  
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/andr.13525 has a paragraph on RISUG that gives lower numbers (&quot;A subsequent limited phase III study of 139 men showed that the Reversible Inhibition of Sperm Under Guidance procedure produced persistent azoospermia in 82.7% of men&quot;).  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8169637/ mentions that it's &quot;effective&quot;, but without any specific numbers.
I wonder whether it's actually important to include specific numbers in this article.  Perhaps it's enough to say that it appears to be effective. WhatamIdoing (talk) 04:11, 16 May 2024 (UTC)
Thanks, yeah, that review paper is great!  The trial they are referring to in there with lower numbers was for an earlier &quot;restricted&quot; phase III trial with fewer participants.  I suppose I could just report the results from that one and then mention the existence of the newest trial by citing a news article about it.  I'm still hesitant to reference anything that contains the possibly non-peer reviewed statistics in there, but I will at least refrain from mentioning those questionable statistics myself.

User is restoring a bunch of old animal models on Methionine. Content such as &quot;A 2009 study on rats showed &quot;methionine supplementation in the diet specifically increases mitochondrial ROS production and mitochondrial DNA oxidative damage in rat liver mitochondria offering a plausible mechanism for its hepatotoxicity&quot; isn't good evidence. One of the listed sources [https://web.archive.org/web/20091208113714/http://www.nhs.uk/news/2009/12December/Pages/live-longer-vegetarian-diet.aspx] describes a calorie-restricted diet on fruit flies. I am not sure why this is relevant to the article. Per  I do not believe we should be citing small scale cherry-picked animal studies like this which are clearly weak evidence. Psychologist Guy (talk) 02:00, 21 May 2024 (UTC)

There are over 120 review articles with 'methionine' in their title on PubMed over the last 5 years. There would seem to be little need to cite any articles older than those (as there are plenty of good recent ones to choose from). If one were to flesh out the clinical use paragraph in Methionine, then one should probably not dwell on its use for aging, but also include a balance of review articles covering all of its uses (and potential uses). Over a dozen of these 120 review articles discuss aging, so it is appropriate to include aging as part of a balanced coverage - but please use these more recent review articles as references.

Recreation: Anesthesiology task force

Hi, I'm writing this message in relation to the old . I was curious as to the interest in recreating and maintaining this task force which had never been truly established. If anyone is interested, or would like to provide a comment, please reply to this topic. Thanks,NeuropolTalk 17:44, 21 May 2024 (UTC)

Hi Neuropol, you're most welcome to unilaterally edit the task force pages, and to set them up however you see fit. I'll gently warn that the engine of each WikiProject/task force is the people, not the pages. Many WikiProjects/task forces were setup in our headier days, but over the years most haven't drawn a consistent group of editors to support them, and have lapsed into disuse. Thus, my advice: if you want an anesthesiology task force, focus on recruiting and cultivating a group of anesthesiology-interested editors, rather than organizing the task force pages. If the group is so large/active that you need the separate page to coordinate your efforts, then the task force is well on its way. Best of luck, Ajpolino (talk) 22:54, 21 May 2024 (UTC)

Metastatic carcinoma

Should Metastatic carcinoma be redirected to Metastasis. I know the terms are technically different but Metastasis covers the topic of Metastatic carcinoma pretty well and I feel like if Metastatic carcinoma was expanded there would be a lot of overlap with the page Metastasis. CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 01:24, 21 May 2024 (UTC)
Perhaps a reader interested in metastatic carcinoma would be better served by the article carcinoma? I agree with your basic premise that developing an article on &quot;metastatic carcinoma&quot; is (while possible?) probably not the best context to present that information in. Ajpolino (talk) 01:35, 21 May 2024 (UTC)
That's a good point, I'm honestly not sure which article would make a better target for a redirect. CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 01:41, 21 May 2024 (UTC)
I would definitely put &quot;Metastatic carcinoma&quot; as a subheader in the article Carcinoma. It does not stand on its own as a separate article. Indeed, there is already a Carcinoma#Invasion and metastasis subheader. The text could just go there — no need for new subheader. Jaredroach (talk) 02:49, 21 May 2024 (UTC)

New paper on Wikipedia's medical coverage

I happened to run into this while reading PeerJ's recent publications and thought it'd be of interest:

*

Looking at the supplementary material, it seems they reviewed Irritable bowel syndrome, Functional constipation, Constipation, Dysbiosis, Flatulence, Functional gastrointestinal disorder, Indigestion, Intestinal malrotation, Levator ani syndrome, Neurogenic bowel dysfunction, Proctalgia fugax, and Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. The conclusions are reasonably flattering. Notably, the authors seem aware of talk pages and content assessment. Vaticidalprophet 05:57, 27 May 2024 (UTC)

Transvestic fetishism article
Edit: Never mind, disregard. – 104.177.77.7; 03:03, 30 May 2024 (UTC)

104.177, total re-writes on hot-button subjects are rarely successful.  I suggest trying to make changes stepwise.  Add or change one sentence, paragraph, or section at a time, and let people have a while to &quot;get used to&quot; the new content before making the next change.  It sounds like one of the improvements you should prioritize is differentiating Transvestic fetishism from Cross-dressing.
By the way, one thing that you absolutely cannot do is quote the full DSM criteria (which are copyrighted).  We don't allow this in any article, even under fair use claims.  So your change would have been reverted even if everyone agreed with it.

In those cases, you have to find, e.g., the box for Nature, click on &quot;Access collection&quot;, and search their website directly.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 02:58, 11 May 2024 (UTC)

I got approved for Perlego.  So far, I've found a (complete, legal) copy of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR).  I recognize a few titles (e.g., The Royal Marsden Manual of Clinical Nursing Procedures, Neal's Medical Pharmacology at a Glance, Hoffbrand's Essential Haematology...), but there are several thousand recent books about health and medicine (including vet med and dentistry) on this website, and the search is designed for a student who has been assigned a specific textbook, so assembling a highlights reel is a little challenging. 
If anyone has a favorite book that they'd like to find, please post the name, and I'll see if it's in the list.  I'm also willing to do searches for topics (e.g., 150 books on COVID, 22 books during the last five years on epilepsy, ), if you are working on an article and want to see whether it's worth the 60 seconds to apply (It is!  And TWL still has almost two thousand unclaimed accounts available for Perlego, so you don't worry that you might taking something away from another editor if you sign up now).  There are also books available in several other languages, in case anyone regularly edits at another Wikipedia.  I think this is going to be a great resource for editors.

Prurigo simplex

The page Prurigo simplex currently is a stub and there was an interesting conversation regarding the classification of it . I'm not quite sure what to do with the page. The [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1346-8138.16067 2020 guidlines for Prurigo] made no mention of Prurigo simplex. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9425620/ This article] does a pretty good job of summerizing the controversy surrounding the term but I'll mention some of the highlights here:

&quot;Subacute prurigo, characterized by small papulovesicles, is the most controversial category of prurigo (1, 4). Besides many eponyms, it is also known as prurigo simplex, prurigo simplex subacuta or urticaria papulosa chronica perstans (1, 2). Lately, the classification of prurigo into acute, subacute and chronic forms has been questioned (5). It is discussed whether subacute prurigo (prurigo simplex) belongs to the prurigo group of diseases, or if it is just one of many papular eruptions. In American literature, it is better known as “itchy red bump” disease. The term was coined by Ackerman (6), who described it as a “maddeningly pruritic, persistent condition that clinically resembles dermatitis herpetiformis with histologic features similar to papular urticaria”.&quot;

&quot;Another controversial issue is whether prurigo simplex or “itchy red bump” disease is a clearly defined entity or a variant of chronic prurigo. It has been suggested that it is a transitional stage of prurigo that transforms from an acute to a chronic form&quot;

It seems to me that Prurigo simplex should be a redirect to Prurigo, however the page Prurigo needs to be expanded as well (which I am happy to do). 

I'm interesting in others thoughts on this topic. If anyone has anything to add or any opinions please let me know. For now I am going to focus on expanding Prurigo. CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 20:17, 6 June 2024 (UTC)

*As the editor who had stubbed the simplex article, I concur with the suggestion of making Prurigo the main article on the subject and redirecting Prurigo simplex to it.  The latter seems to be a minor and likely obsolete category with a PubMed search for prurigo simplex/prurigo simplex subacuta/urticaria papulosa chronica perstans/subacute prurigo finding only one review article: the [https://doi.org/10.2340/00015555-3912  2021 Wallengren article] mentioned above, which too calls the category and definition controversial.

Abecedare (talk) 22:27, 6 June 2024 (UTC)

 Looking through Rook's led me this [https://doi.org/10.1111/jdv.14570 EADV consensus statement on chronic prurigo] from 2018, which could be useful in further developing the Prurigo article and which says, &quot;There was a discussion among experts regarding the spectrum of the so-called prurigo simplex – acute and subacute. It was noted that there is no clear definition of these two terms.&quot; Consistent with other sources we have seen so far. Abecedare (talk) 01:04, 7 June 2024 (UTC)

Dealing with Cochrane Review retractions

Hey all, seeking some knowledge from the experts here!

I've recently started  back up, however there appears to be an edge-case I want to seek comment on in regards to Cochrane review papers.

Now, the Cochrane review appear to do odd stuff with replacing old papers and withdrawing the replacements, an example can be found here

In that example,  has been marked as retracted due to being replaced by a new paper (). That paper has then been withdrawn in favour of the older version. For this reason, the citation is flagged up as retracted/replaced in both CrossRef and RetractionWatch, and the bot normally would try and add a  template to it. 

I have supressed this for now, so any article published by Cochrane Review will be ignored, however I wanted to check...

* Is tagging as  desirable in these instances or is ignoring it the best way to go?
* Does anyone know if this is a common thing to happen?
* Are there any views on how to handle these? Detecting this sort of thing is possible if I do a check on crossref for the newer paper, however these withdrawn papers are not reported as retracted as they are not reported on another DOI/PMID.

Cochrane retraction notices are generally dumb in that database. However, a true retraction should be flagged, if possible.
I think the following conditions would work, for Cochrane Reviews: if v+1 is retracted (e.g. pub4), but v is not (e.g. pub3), then ignore matches to v (e.g. pub3).

Pandemic's over! (2024 edition)

*

Perplexity's Take
Here is what Perplexity Pro (an LLM) has to say:
The question of whether the COVID-19 pandemic is over is complex and multifaceted, with varying perspectives from health experts, organizations, and the public.
### Expert Opinions and Definitions
1. **World Health Organization (WHO)**:
   - The WHO declared an end to the COVID-19 public health emergency in May 2023 but continues to describe COVID-19 as a pandemic due to its ongoing global presence and impact[3][11].
2. **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)**:
   - The CDC has shifted its focus from tracking cases to monitoring hospitalizations and deaths. While acknowledging that COVID-19 remains a public health threat, the CDC emphasizes the importance of vaccination and other preventive measures[12].
3. **Boston University Researchers**:
   - Experts from Boston University highlight that COVID-19 still causes significant illness and death worldwide. They argue that the disease's widespread nature and the millions of cases reported weekly justify its classification as a pandemic[1].
4. **Scientific American**:
   - Maria Van Kerkhove from the WHO notes that while the emergency phase is over, the pandemic status remains due to the virus's continued global circulation and impact[3].
### Public Perception
1. **Gallup Poll**:
   - A Gallup poll indicates that 59% of Americans believe the pandemic is over, although a similar proportion report that their lives have not returned to normal[4].
### Current Data and Trends
1. **Global and National Data**:
   - COVID-19 continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality. For instance, the WHO reported over 774 million confirmed cases and more than seven million deaths globally as of March 2024[6].
   - In the U.S., COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths have decreased significantly from their peaks, but the virus still poses a risk, especially to vulnerable populations[12].
2. **Variants and Transmission**:
   - New variants, such as JN.1 and its descendants, continue to emerge and spread, indicating that the virus is still evolving and circulating widely[15].
### Conclusion
While the emergency phase of the COVID-19 pandemic has ended, the virus remains a significant global health threat. The WHO and other health experts continue to classify COVID-19 as a pandemic due to its widespread impact and ongoing transmission. Public perception varies, with many believing the pandemic is over, but data and expert opinions suggest that vigilance and preventive measures are still necessary to manage the disease's impact.

As much as I would love for AI to make our lives easier, I don't think LLMs are at the point yet where their &quot;opinions&quot; are of any weight or help. Digging up citations could theoretically be useful, but even here they don't always represent them accurately. For example, it cites [https://www.bu.edu/articles/2024/is-covid-19-still-a-pandemic/ this] Boston University article as saying that experts there support classification as a pandemic; however, reading it makes clear that two out of the three lean towards or outright say it is not a pandemic, while the third (Murray) seems to lean that it is, but even she acknowledges that definitions of the term vary by saying e.g.  [https://time.com/6898943/is-covid-19-still-pandemic-2024/ This] Time article is cited to refer to what is on WHO's website, but what other experts in it say (including WHO's COVID lead Maria Van Kerkhove) is totally ignored. Crossroads -talk- 16:13, 6 June 2024 (UTC)
Still, it's interesting to see what the state of development is for LLMs. WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:05, 6 June 2024 (UTC)

Lichen myxedematosus/Papular mucinosis

There seems to be an issue with the classification of Lichen myxedematosus/Papular mucinosis. The terms papular mucinosis, lichen myxedematosus, and scleromyxedema have all kind of been jumbled and I'm not sure how to classify them. Here's what I've found:

ICD-11 lumps the terms Lichen myxoedematosus, Papular mucinosis, and Scleromyxoedema all under the term Lichen myxoedematosus. [https://icd.who.int/browse/2024-01/mms/en#15830032]

MeshID lumps the terms Lichen myxoedematosus, Papular mucinosis, and Scleromyxoedema under the term Scleromyxedema.[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/?term=lichen+myxedematosus]

Orphanet lists Lichen myxedematosus as a group of disorders,[https://www.orpha.net/en/disease/detail/402007?search=Lichen-myxedematosus&amp;mode=name] with the terms Atypical lichen myxedematosus,[https://www.orpha.net/en/disease/detail/86797?search=Lichen-myxedematosus&amp;mode=name], Localized lichen myxedematosus (Orphanet uses Papular mucinosis as a synonym for Localized lichen myxedematosus),[https://www.orpha.net/en/disease/detail/86795?search=Lichen-myxedematosus&amp;mode=name] and Scleromyxedema.[https://www.orpha.net/en/disease/detail/167635?search=Lichen-myxedematosus&amp;mode=name]

Disease database lumps them all together as well.

However it seems that they are different disorders with different sources using different names. For example UpToDate uses Papular mucinosis for a synonym of Lichen myxedematosus.[https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-lichen-myxedematosus] This article[https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(01)68357-9/abstract] goes over the classifications and seems to imply that Papular mucinosis is a synonym fot Localized lichen myxedematosus, and that Scleromyxedema is a seperate disorder.

From what I understand it seems like generalized lichen myxedematosus is a synonym for scleromyxedema, Papular mucinosis is a synonym for Localized lichen myxedematosus and lichen myxedematosus is the the group of disorders.

Before I change any redirects I'd like to hear others input on the topic as it's quite confusing to me. CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 03:27, 8 June 2024 (UTC)

Expert attention needed

I've been working with  (and by &quot;working with&quot; I mean mostly doing some minor cleanup on his work) on  which is intended to replace the current contents of Limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy. As can be seen from the existing article, Nelson is clearly a recognized expert in the field for this condition. I got involved when he made a major wholesale edit to the article, basically blowing away the existing citations. Once I was able to mentor him through some Wikipedia basics, and help him with some article organization ideas, he has cleaned up the article (now living in my user space as a drafting location). I'd like to have someone from this project assess the present state of the draft and see if it is ready to be copied into place of the existing article. I might also need some Wikipedia expertise on how to do the merge to preserve the proper authorship attributions (his and my edits in my userspace). Thanks!!

Thanks Dan61.  Just to clarify, I wrote the prior version as well, this is just an update to flesh it out a little bit and conform more closely to (what I understood to be) Wikipedia formating.

How to deal with the overwhelming amount of pages with unsourced statements.

I think the majority of the active editors here know that WikiProject Medicine has an issue with unsourced statements in articles. I'm not blaming anyone; a lot of the citation issues come from editors not familiar with Wikipedia. Regardless of how this issue started, I think we need to have a conversation about how to fix it.
 
I've noticed that there are typically two different types of pages that have unspurced statements: pages that are almost completely unsourced (for example, 1q21.1 duplication syndrome), and pages that have one or two unsourced statements but are otherwise well cited (for example, 3-M syndrome).
 
For the first type of page, I believe it's best to do a quick literary search to see if you can find where the information came from; however, I've found that this is usually quite low-yeild, especially when the whole page is unsourced. I believe most of these pages need to be rewritten. Obviously, this is a time-consuming task, but something needs to be done about the issue.
 
For the second type of page, usually I can find where they got the statment by searching keywords from the unsourced statement in Google. When I can't find the original source, I think it's fair to delete the unsourced passage, assuming it is not somehow vital information (however, if it were vital information, there should be a source somewhere with that information).
 
I'm looking for other ideas, suggestions, advice, and knowledge on this topic. I'm still a fairly new editor, and I haven't worked much on correcting this problem, so if anyone with more knowledge could share their opinions, that would be great. I just want to emphasize that this is not me trying to bash any editors; I just think it's time we have a conversation about this very prevelant issue. CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 15:42, 16 June 2024 (UTC)

New form of B12 deficiency discovered

A new form of B12 deficiency affects the nervous system only, with B12 levels remaining normal in the blood: [https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adl3758 Transcobalamin receptor antibodies in autoimmune vitamin B12 central deficiency] - Pluvinage et al., 26 Jun 2024.

If the citation is no longer reliable, then the article needs to be updated, which could be as minor as the removal/replacement of the citation with a reliable one, to rewriting an entire section that was based on flawed premises. If the citation to a retracted paper was intentional, like in the context of a controversy noting that a paper was later retracted, you can replace  with yes/ with yes/ with yes.

missing info on Sarco Pod

the australian euthanasia activist Philip Nitschke announced earlier this month that the sarco pod, a device used to help carry out assisted suicides, would be used for the first time. i found headlines saying switzerland was gonna ban the device, but its only been sort of banned in 2 swiss cantons.

problem is, most news outlets reporting on this are listed in wikipedias section on reliable sources as untrustworthy and only swiss news outlets have reported reliably about it. I dont think i have the full picture tho. this is a sensitive subject and i need help finding sources.

i need a bit of help on adding the info mentioned above to the page on the sarco pod. i need help finding out whats going on exactly. i cant find any announcements on these developments on Exit Internationals website or on swiss agencies regulating medicine.

Spondyloarthritis (SpA)

Would someone from this WikiProject mind taking a look at  and assessing it? It was created yesterday directly in the mainspace and never received any type of assessment.

@Marchjuly, it's a C-class page, but the important question is whether it's the same subject as Spondyloarthropathy.  Damjana12, what's the relationship between spondyloarthrITIS and spondyloarthrOPATHY? WhatamIdoing (talk) 22:24, 18 July 2024 (UTC)
@Marchjuly It seems to me that spondyloarthritis and spondyloarthropathy are synonyms. However the icd seems to use the term spondyloarthritis[https://icd.who.int/browse/2024-01/mms/en#1848981072]. [https://spondylitis.org/spondylitis-plus/an-updated-overview-of-spondyloarthritis-a-family-of-related-diseases/ This article] seems to go over the terminology quite well. I'll give you kinda the highlights:
&quot;Spondyloarthritis and spondyloarthropathy are often used interchangeably. Some experts prefer the term spondyloarthritis rather than spondyloarthropathy because the ending “arthritis” indicates inflammation of the joint, whereas the ending “arthropathy” can refer to any type of joint disease.&quot;
I personally don't see the need for a seprate page for spondyloarthritis. In addition the page itself doesn't follow the formatting for diseases and the sources aren't great. CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 00:18, 19 July 2024 (UTC)
Thank you both for taking a look at this. Perhaps one of you could try explaining this to the article's creator? -- Marchjuly (talk) 03:02, 19 July 2024 (UTC)
I left a merge proposal template on both the pages however I think I'll reach out directly to the user on their talk page since they seem to be a new editor and I'll see if they are interested in helping me fix up the page Spondyloarthropathy as I personally feel it needs some work.

Li-Fraumeni syndrome / Additional Resources

However, due to potential conflicts of interest, I need to request assistance from another editor to add the &quot;Li-Fraumeni Syndrome Association&quot; (aka LFS Association / LFSA) as a reputable source that promotes LFS research and supports LFS families, as well as connecting families with the best providers known, world-wide.  The LFSA is comprised of an all-volunteer board, with medical and scientific boards comprised of the top international LFS researchers, along with a genetic counseling group of very active LFS/cancer genetic providers who contribute greatly.  The LFSA holds the top international scientific symposiums on LFS wherein families are also involved every two years and we offer an international Youth Program with fun and educational workshops every other year.  I volunteer for the LFSA, so if someone else could add our website to this page, it could help many cancer-prone families connect with each other and the best resources for care.  Thank you.

Intensive Interaction

Hi, i wonder if I could have some extra eyes on the article for Intensive interaction? 

The article was raised at  earlier this year after it was edited by an account called  and some form of COI was suspected. 
The user turned out to be an ex practitioner who wanted to improve the article. As the article had previously apparently been curated by non independent users from the Intensive Interaction Institute I gave this user some advice on the article talk page re: how the article might be improved.     

The article is now, I think, somewhat improved - especially re: the removal of PROMO text.
The user has now asked me if the 2017 flags for addl citations, promo and original research can be removed.
I am unsure if this would be appropriate and thought it best to ask here.
Any assistance gratefully received. Axad12 (talk) 00:29, 25 July 2024 (UTC)

@Axad12, the maintenance templates are not meant to be a badge of shame.  As soon as the problems are solved, they should be removed.  In this case:
* If you think the article has approximately enough citations, then you should remove the &quot;needs additional citations&quot; tag.  For comparison, I've heard that the median Wikipedia article has about four inline citations.  In borderline cases (which this probably isn't), sometimes the best thing to do is to remove the generic whole-article tag and replace it either with a couple of specific  tags or to change to a .
* If it no longer appears to be written like an advertisement, then you should remove the &quot;written like an advertisement&quot; tag.  Sometimes looking at  can help.  Or just looking at the ordinary advertisements you see each day, because this isn't supposed to be used as a sort of code word for 'not an ideal encyclopedia article' or 'happens to say something true but positive about the company'.  
* The original research tag was probably never correct.   means something that has never been published elsewhere.

LATE (Limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy) web page

Hi, my name is Pete Nelson (wiki username is Pete Nelson from UKY),

I wrote a web page about LATE:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limbic-predominant_age-related_TDP-43_encephalopathy
It generally gets around 300 hits per month; not a ton but it's a disease with high public health impact.

I had written the web page in a somewhat essay-like format and I noted that it had a poor formatting score according to Wikipedia editors.  Thus, I rewrote the web page and, under the advice and help by WikiDan61, we produced a Wikipedia page (in his sandbox) that conforms better the format and has a bit more info.  Apparently this replacement (of my web page, by my web page) has struck the senior medical editors as problematic, and therefore WikiDan61 suggested I contact you on this page.  

Can you help please?

Thanks,
Pete 
aka Pete Nelson from UKY Pete Nelson from UKY (talk) 00:03, 9 July 2024 (UTC)

Hello, @Pete Nelson from UKY.  It looks like @WikiDan61 removed it.  This is not necessarily a permanent thing, and it's reversible.  He summarized his objection as &quot;That comprehensive rewrite discarded 36 sources, and retained only one. See .&quot;
As a general rule, Wikipedia articles should be written in ordinary paragraphs rather than bullet points, and in an ideal world, there would be more  (which I know you were working on).  May I suggest that you look at  again, pick just one little section (maybe ?) and move just that one section over to Limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy?  (It doesn't have any normal sections at the moment, so just edit the page and paste the new section above the
References
section.)  Then see if there are objections to that specific edit.  It's more challenging to discuss whole-page changes, so I think that focusing on a single section would be more practical.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 01:46, 9 July 2024 (UTC)
Thanks WhatamIdoing!
I guess there was a miscommunication since the number of references went from 36 to 65 or so?  I don't think I discarded any, or only a few to lessen the number of references I was an author of because the Editors were focused on this problem.
Is WikiDan61 reading this?  I hope he can, so he could perhaps redo that summary that was quite inaccurate.  (WikiDan61 was very helpful in the rewrite and I am grateful for that.)
Thanks again,
Pete Nelson from UKY Pete Nelson from UKY (talk) 01:53, 9 July 2024 (UTC)
(Looking at the link you sent from WikiDan61, it confirms that there were 68 references cited and bibliographied)  
I'm a bit confused because there seemingly is a Wikipedia-wished-for headings and organization format, and the updated wiki page now conforms to it? Pete Nelson from UKY (talk) 02:10, 9 July 2024 (UTC)
So just to be clear, I've done all that work to make the Wikipedia post for LATE better, and it's all for nought?  Bummer. Lesson learned I guess. Pete Nelson from UKY (talk) 17:46, 12 July 2024 (UTC)
@Pete Nelson from UKY, your work is not lost.  But, please, take it stepwise.  Move just one of the new
Sections
into the existing article, instead of replacing the entire page all at once.  Then post back here, and I'll take a look at it. WhatamIdoing (talk) 06:40, 16 July 2024 (UTC)
Will do!  Thanks! Pete Nelson from UKY (talk) 19:32, 16 July 2024 (UTC)
alright, I added a section but it wouldn't let me add a figure which is pretty important (depicting cognitive trajectories). Pete Nelson from UKY (talk) 19:41, 16 July 2024 (UTC)
I collected the refs for you from .  When you're copying between pages, you need to open the 'source' page in the editor, and copy from that.  Otherwise it loses all the formatting, links, refs, images, etc.
Where's the figure that you couldn't add?  Is it already in the article? WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:01, 17 July 2024 (UTC)
Ack I didn't see this note yet, sorry.  I would like to add another figure if possible Pete Nelson from UKY (talk) 20:16, 25 July 2024 (UTC)
I have made some more suggested edits, mainly adding citations and whatnot.  When possible, I'd like to add another figure?
Thanks so much! Pete Nelson from UKY (talk) 15:04, 27 July 2024 (UTC)
@Pete Nelson from UKY, what is the other figure that you would like to add? WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:20, 27 July 2024 (UTC)
I think that I figured it out?  (I did add the figure using the insert method).
Thanks so much for your help, WhatamIdoing, I think it's gotten a lot better! Pete Nelson from UKY (talk) 16:27, 27 July 2024 (UTC)

Hello

Hello, I’m writing to introduce myself as a subject expert in medicine! I first joined  and was referred to join WikiProject Medicine by WhatamIdoing. I’ve been in medicine for 15 years, spanning clinical and translational research at the bench and in the clinic. My current focus within clinical trials is administration and operations, along with regulatory work. I look forward to contributing and am always open to constructive feedback! Thanks!

Please note that I have access to hundreds of academic databases and journals, so I’m able to cite work, including works that may be behind a paywall. On that note, if you need access, contact me, and I’ll see what I can do to help! Gobucks821 (talk) 14:57, 3 August 2024 (UTC)

Opinions needed on the topic of if the word rare is appropriate in the lead of Addison's disease

For some time not the first sentence in Addison's disease has been &quot;Addison's disease, also known as primary adrenal insufficiency, is a rare long-term endocrine disorder characterized by inadequate production of the steroid hormones cortisol and aldosterone by the two outer layers of the cells of the adrenal glands (adrenal cortex), causing adrenal insufficiency.&quot; However there's a bit of a disagreement going on between me and another editor. 

They removed the term rare stating &quot;unquantified relative terms are meaningless&quot;. I reverted this edit with my reasoning being &quot;taking out the fact that Addisons disease is rare doesn't make sense as it is well sourced and helpful to readers (eg. the average reader knows what rare is but may not understand that 1 in 10,000 is considered rare for a disorder&quot; perhaps I didn't word this very well but i stand by this point. To which the other editor reverted my revert with the reaoning &quot;an unquantified relative term does not provide the information that you seem to believe was taken out. the number you quote remains in the lead section&quot; and started  on the talk page.

I have weighed in on the talk page as to why i think rare should be kept in the lead but I'm not going to add it back as I want to prevent conflict and would appreciate some unbiased opinions on the topic. If anyone could weigh in on the talk page that would be greately appreciated. CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 15:49, 17 July 2024 (UTC)
In some contexts, and countries, &quot;rare disease&quot; is a legally-defined term - see [https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/rare-disease here for a starting point]. Don't we have rare disease - yes, apparently we do.  In most countries, Addison's disease would seem to meet the criterion. Johnbod (talk) 16:34, 17 July 2024 (UTC)
Interesting! In my comment on the talk page I did list the FDA definiton which is the same as the one you linked. I didn't feel like digging up an international source as I doubted that Addison's disease would fail to meet other criteria used. CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 16:52, 17 July 2024 (UTC)

Hierarchy of Evidence
I’ve recently been pointed to the WP guidelines advising against primary sources and privileging secondary sources for medical content. As a career clinical research I am surprised by the misinterpretation of the hierarchy of evidence. Many (most?) secondary sources are non-systematic and at least as prone to conflicts of interest as well-conducted large RCTs, and the source of the evidence is important, as large representative and new-agent phase 3 trials in high-impact journals may be more definitive than secondary sources in lower-impact journals or platforms. Not certain if this is the place to raise this broad issue but I’d be happy to work with the community to review and revise the guidelines, or join a community of experienced clinicians and researchers to improve the guidance. Best, EquityAce  — Preceding  comment added by EquityAce (talk • ) 13:47, 28 July 2024 (UTC) 

Certainly don't want that much from 'lower-impact' journals, but in general the job of this encylopedia is to summarize &quot;accepted knowledge&quot; as has been published, which is subtly different from what editors adjudge high-quality evidence, particularly novel high-quality evidence. Are there any examples of where the current guidance has a detrimental effect on an Article, in your view? Bon courage (talk) 13:54, 28 July 2024 (UTC)
Thanks @Bon courage. For convenience I’ll use a single recent example, though I’ve come across questionable citations as I ramp up edits on clinical topics. I’d just added mention of a recent well-conducted clinical trial from a reputable research group showing slowing of progression of diabetic retinopathy with  fenofibrate, without any recommendation to take the drug. The trial was a culmination of years of suggestions that the agent is effective from observational studies. The Wiki editor @MrOllie removed the addition because it came from a primary source. The data are more informative than a casual narrative review (a purpose the Wikipedia page itself serves), and it deprives the WP community of knowledge of a low-cost generally safe preventive intervention in favor of the module’s mention of higher-cost injection therapies. It seems a delayed or missed opportunity. I’d say there’s a role for a properly performed systematic or scoping review and/or meta-analysis in fairly summarizing evidence, but that’s not the standard the current guidance encourages (ie any review is sufficient). @EquityAce EquityAce (talk) 19:28, 28 July 2024 (UTC)
There are reviews and reviews, and certainly some systematic reviews have been rejected too because . I'd resist an overly-lawyerly reading of the guidance, and in a vibrant area like Diabetic retinopathy it's reasonable to wait for the . We certainly shouldn't be trying to affect 'real world' decision making in any way. Bon courage (talk) 19:42, 28 July 2024 (UTC)
  - I think the specific guideline you are referring to is , and there is even as we speak a current discussion about this at  that you are more than welcome to take part in. The guidelines have been shaped by a range of knowledgeable encyclopedians, clinicians, and researchers, of which you could join at  or here, as are you of course welcome of invite any of your contacts to join or take part of discussions.

What you may note, and bring to your discussion with  is that there is no blanket ban on primary sources, only a recommendation to give due weight. If there is a high quality clinical trial, that you report correctly (i.e. no recommendation), it may very well be apt to cite it. I would suggest looking at  (subsection of MEDRS) that discusses how, and when to cite single large studies appropriately. I do not have the time to consider this particular case, but those pages do show where you could find appropriate arguments for including that material (or not). One of the primary arguments against including this specific trial may be  or  (i.e. not a page for listing potential treatments/drug candidates). Simply stating that it is from a primary source is not enough if you have strong enough arguments for it that are in line with those guidelines.

(P.S. Additional essay-pages [not guidelines or policies are those linked above] that may be of relevance: , , and one more that I forgot what it was called that covers why Wikipedia isn't cutting-edge [in part because this tends to lead to bloat, as it is easier to add new details than to go back removing old debunked things that were once thought to be novel and cutting-edge, the latter requiring more subject-matter expertise]). CFCF (talk) 13:03, 29 July 2024 (UTC)

Excellent response. Provides much more context. Thank you. EquityAce (talk) 14:21, 29 July 2024 (UTC)

I wholeheartedly and absolutely agree with each and every sentiment expressed by EquityAce, and I too am a seasoned researcher. In many cases, such articles may be the ONLY source of critically needed data, making these so-called primary sources necessary. It would be prudent to cite well-referred articles from reputable journals for such topics—think of rare diseases, in particular. In a sense, due to the editorial process, these have a (slight) degree of secondary source because nonsense would be rejected and go unpublished. This said, it would be absolutely key, as time goes by, to revisit these citations and augment or amend them as science evolves. Gobucks821 (talk) 15:49, 3 August 2024 (UTC)

How to write pages for categories of medical conditions.

I'm attempting to rewrite the page Connective tissue disease and I've kind of ran into an issue. When it comes to writting about catagories of diseases or more broad terms should we follow the  of signs symptoms, causes, diagnosis, treatment etc. or should this be modified a bit? The issue I've come across is that there usually isn't much information on the group of disorders itself as most research is directed on individual diseases. Meaning if i wanted to make a section for symptoms of Connective tissue disease the only resource i could find summerizing the general symptoms is the cleveland clinic page[https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/14803-connective-tissue-diseases] and Cedars-Sinai page[https://www.cedars-sinai.org/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/c/connective-tissue-disorders.html]. Currently a lot of the disease catgory pages just have the classifications for the disorders. Would it be appropriate to make the classification section its own section (instead of having it as a subsection of diagnosis) and moving it farther up due to it being relevant (like I've done in my draft for connective tissue disease). Sorry if this came off as a bit of a ramble but I've been meaning to ask this question for awhile. CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 23:49, 15 July 2024 (UTC)
I think you need much better sources! Pubmed stuff does tend to be on extremely specific topics - you may want to be looking at recent medical textbooks, which you won't find free online. Johnbod (talk) 01:01, 16 July 2024 (UTC)

Yes, that's the sort of thing I mean (about Pubmed stuff does tend to be on extremely specific topics). Medical textbooks are hard to find online, as they want to get the students/doctors to pay their often very high prices. Can you get to a good college or medical school library. These days it is often paywalled online subs. Perhaps other medical editors can advise? Good luck. Johnbod (talk) 03:28, 16 July 2024 (UTC)
I'll start blindly looking in some rheumatology textbooks for now. Thanks for the help! CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 04:49, 16 July 2024 (UTC)
Perlego at  has two potentially useful textbooks:
* The Rheumatology Handbook for Clinicians (ISBN 9781550599053), especially the chapter &quot;The Patient Who Is Systemically Unwell: Is It a Connective Tissue Disease?&quot;
* ABC of Rheumatology (ISBN 9781118793206), which has a bit on pediatric connective tissue disorders and a chapter at the end on epidemiology that includes a section on connective tissue disorders.
There are probably other sources available in TWL. WhatamIdoing (talk) 07:08, 16 July 2024 (UTC)
In the U.S., you can usually get just about any book you could imagine via a process called interlinbrary loan (known to librarians as “ILL”). Just about any municipal library could do it, otherwise find a county level or state library. Many states have state libraries for which some residents qualify.
For these kinds of works, you’ll likely get your ILL fulfilled by an academic medical center’s library in your state or from another state (if your state doesn’t have it).
Larger libraries let you make the request online. Others use paper forms. Be prepared to provide a LOT OF SPECIFICS of your desired textbook. 
Gather key info like publisher, edition, and the likes.ALWAYS provide an ISBN. Be careful to NOT provide the e-book ISBN, as these are unique. If there are multiple formats or reprints, just provide as many ISBN options as you can so the librarians can try.
Amazon is an easy place to start your search for those identifiers. WorldCat is the authoritative source for this.
good luck!! Gobucks821 (talk) 18:42, 6 August 2024 (UTC)
Oh by the way: typical loan period is 3 weeks, minimum. You’re allowed to renew as many times as the lending library allows. Often this is 3 renewals. Cheers!! Gobucks821 (talk) 18:44, 6 August 2024 (UTC)
PubMed is useful, and recall there are hundreds upon hundreds of academic journals spanning so many topics beyond medicine. Another free source would be Google journals.
If you find a great journal article via PubMed etc., but it’s behind a paywall, I propose commenting on the article’s talk page to ask for somebody with access to check that journal.
For example, I have access to plethora journals, and I’d be happy to find the requisite data/citations that are behind the paywall.
However, I of course cannot respond to every single post by myself. We’d need folks to volunteer their access. Gobucks821 (talk) 15:14, 3 August 2024 (UTC)

CT / MRI viewer

We at Wiki Med Foundation have been working to develop a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Doc_James/CT_scan_viewer?withgadget=ImageStackPopup CT / MRI scan viewer]. Currently it is functionally on EN WP as a trial and works fairly well on mobile and desktop. Thoughts? Doc James (talk ·  · ) 23:56, 30 June 2024 (UTC)
this is a very good idea, I believe this needs to be supported--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 14:37, 1 July 2024 (UTC)
That looks interesting.  I think the UI needs a little more information.  So first, for anyone who wants to take a look (do it!), just go to , and where it says &quot;(requires turning on the gadget under preferences or [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Doc_James/CT_scan_viewer?withgadget=ImageStackPopup this])&quot; in the section heading, click on the word 'this'.  (If you do that, you can test it without having to do anything to your prefs.)  In the picture, a ► play button will appear.  Click that.
Then wait several seconds for all the images to load.  In this instance, there are 248 images.  It'll give you a vertical bar with a slider dot at the bottom.  After everything's loaded, you can slide that up and down to step through the images.  If you want to view it image-by-image, then look at the text (sideways) that says &quot;← (177/248) →&quot; and click on the individual arrows.
I think this would be particularly interesting on CT scan, because it gives people an idea of what the results are.  For that page in particular, I'd love to see a head-to-toe scan with a few labels (spine, lungs, liver?), so they can stay oriented. 
Also, I wonder whether this could be integrated into MediaViewer.  MarkTraceur, do you know a multi-part image has ever been considered there? WhatamIdoing (talk) 17:26, 1 July 2024 (UTC)

Does any one happen to know ? (He doesn't seem to be around much. I wonder whether he knows the CMAJ liked his image enough to use it.)

Note: [https://www.cmaj.ca/content/196/4/E121 The article] was published electronically in February.

I will check out their website, but my very first guess is that this is a fake journal to churn papers. We see this all the time from companies that invite even the least experienced folks to publish. Hate to speculate, but this is in line with the practices of such pseudo journals.

This journal is old enough that it's unlikely to be a fake journal.  Regional journals aren't usually prestigious, but most countries have a medical association that publishes papers of interest to the practitioners in that country.  The big journals may not want to run a &quot;Prevalence of common cold in Ruritanian Kindergartens&quot; article, but the Ruritanian Medical Association might think it an excellent piece for their little journal.

PS - CMAJ previously used one of my images of diffuse alveolar damage on the cover (for an article about ARDS in July 2021)... and violated the terms of use. (I saw the image when it was published. They ended-up publishing a correction.) Nephron  T| 22:53, 21 July 2024 (UTC)

Copyright issues with diagnostic criteria

I'm currently trying to improve the page Mixed connective tissue disease and I've ran into a bit of an issue. For context Mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) has 4 different sets of diagnostic/classification criteria. Usually when I add in classification or diagnostic criteria for a disorder I'll just re word it a bit. The issue is that the diagnostic criteria for MCTD is so specefic that it's hard to reword it without losing meaning. I'm not super familiar with the details of copyright rules but I believe some of this falls under . If someone could check out the classification section of my draft for the artcle () and let me know if what I have is appropriate, that would be much appreciated. I also used an open access article for the diagnostic criteria ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7204172/ link]) so I think it would also be okay to leave the text the same and put in an attribution template but I'm not fully sure if that's needed or what the logistics of that are.

Diagnostic criteria are not copyrightable. Only the expression of a work is protected, not the contents. It would be perfectly acceptable to publish the criteria exactly as worded. In fact, re-wording the criteria could be injurious to the article and its readers.
I haven’t reviewed your article, but in many cases, such criteria are presented in table format—or it’s much more convenient to do so. Thus, if you haven’t already, I suggest word-for-word content in a table. Hope this helps!
Of course, I welcome input from senior/other editors. Gobucks821 (talk) 15:53, 3 August 2024 (UTC)
Thank you for the clarification! I decided not to go with a table as I couldn't find a way to format it in a way I liked however the information is presented in a way that could be easily put into a table if anyone chooses to do so!CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 11:59, 6 August 2024 (UTC)
The copyright question is very much &quot;it depends&quot;.  Copyright applies to expressions but not to facts.  If there's only one way to express a given fact (e.g., &quot;≥40 mcg/dL&quot; or &quot;has low back pain&quot;), then it's not copyrightable.
When the diagnostic criterion is just a number or other simple fact, then copyright is not a significant concern.  When the criteria are expressed as complex sentences/paragraphs (e.g., anything in the DSM), then we always need to re-write them in our own words.  The complicated moment is when it's somewhere in between the two extremes.  The dividing line between &quot;just simple enough to not be copyrightable&quot; and &quot;just complex enough to require re-writing&quot; is not always clear.

Intersex healthcare draft feedback 

EDIT: Nevermind, draft was accepted:D I you still have any feedback though feel free to add it to the article's talk page.  — Preceding  comment added by Urchincrawler (talk • ) 04:21, 17 August 2024 (UTC) 

Hello. I saw that there was a page of  including intersex healthcare since the intersex medical intervention page focuses mostly on intersex children. I whipped up a draft but I've never made such a hefty article from scratch (especially not a medical related article) so I'd appreciate some gentle feedback.  Thanks. 
P.S. feel free to add stuff if you happen to be knowledgeable about this subject.

Expertise in evaluating systematic review &amp; adding appropriate language to an article

 There is currently a discussion at  regarding the evaluation of a small systematic review &amp; how to include its findings in the article. The thread is . The discussion is about the topic . Thank you.

A IP editor posted a study about the efficacy and safety of Tribulus terrestris. I responded that we . I also found a systematic review concerning dietary supplements for erectile dysfunction.
