Not quite sure where to bring this up, but there are several articles on suicide methods that make me really uncomfortable and I think they're arguably illegal. Not sure if the best way to handle it was to view them as medical articles and keep an eye that they're not making biomedical claims without proper sourcing or if there's some other legal avenue to pursue. They're really good using a tone that sounds unbiased, like it's an objective discussion on the ethics of suicide, but they're really just pro-suicide sites and they're really dangerous. These people like to tag anything about suicide prevention as lacking NPOV or as demonstrating a &quot;American&quot; perspective. Reddit and other social media sites don't allow content or even links to websites that explicitly tell people how to comment suicide. Since they can't link to these articles, people will tell each other &quot;Google suicide bag and read the wikipedia article.&quot; I would think if this content is illegal enough for reddit, it shouldn't be on wikipedia.

I think it could be argued that some of these are encouraging suicide. The suicide bag article is about exactly how to make your own suicide bag, including a diagram, with easily accessible items. The hardest thing to get would be helium or a propane-butane mixture and the rest are household items. Then look at , literally any article about bags (purses, backpacks, etc.) links to suicide bag. Suicide methods is exactly what it sounds like and this is : Teenage suicide in the United States, suicide prevention. Basically any article about suicide links to an article that tells you specifically how to kill yourself. Lots of them have a handy dandy suicide infoboxes that link to suicide methods. alt.suicide.holiday is an article on  former usenet group that is clearly just a pro-suicide article.

This [http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2011.300608 2012 study] showed that pro-suicide content on social media can increase the risk of completed suicide because it normalizes and glorifies the act and provides people with access to information about lethal methods. It specifically mentions methods using gas. This [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26502782 2015 study] discusses an increase in helium-related suicide deaths as a direct result of discussion about it in online forums. There have been stories in the news over the years about people who have been convicted for encouraging suicide on internet forums. Here's [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/14/us/14suicide.html?_r=0 one from 2010] about a woman who was convicted for encouraging suicide online. What do other people think?

This might be a good topic to take to the . Obviously Wikipedia is not censored in so far as the content is not illegal in the United States (i.e. libel and child pornography). The dividing line is not always clear though I would think in this case the line is the difference between is and ought. Sizeofint (talk) 07:29, 9 April 2016 (UTC)

 The article's subject itself is notable and therefore is worthy of an entry in Wikipedia. However I am concerned that Wikipedia and/or the editors of the article might be construed as assisting suicide, especially if a high-profile case is reported in the media (e.g. &quot;Robin learnt suicide technique from Wikipedia&quot;). This article requires a formal legal assessment. Axl Â¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 10:27, 12 April 2016 (UTC)

I don't know about legal assessment.  I reviewed it and I think it is stays on this side of .  I noticed that for a while it had a suicide hotline hatnote, like [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Suicide_bag&amp;oldid=625953066 this].

 , Did you mean the idea lab or the main village pump? I'm trying to put together a more cohesive argument so it does sound like I'm just trying to censor wikipedia. , that's a good point about NOTHOWTO. Something definitely didn't feel encyclopedic about it to me, but I couldn't put my finger on it and I think you hit the nail on the head. I don't know if it's a coincidence or someone who read this thread, but for the past 2 days an IP editor has repeatedly removed the diagram from the Suicide bag article on the grounds that it's OR. It's a bit of a slow motion edit war. I think they each have 2 reverts now, but there have been a few hours in between each one. I wonder how long it will go on. I never would have considered arguing that an image was OR, but I think the IP has a good point. I'm not getting involved yet though, because I'd rather focus my energy on trying make a policy that specifically addresses this topic. If that fails, my back up will be NOTHOWTO for the majority of the text and OR for the image. , that's also my concern (that it could be construed as assisting suicide) plus that it likely is assisting suicide based on the [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26502782 2015 study] that I linked above.

Hi all. I've been talking to medical doctors, researchers, and major suicide awareness charities about this article, and some others, for the past two years, with full in-person meetings every few months. Their view is that not only is Wikipedia classed as a &quot;pro-suicide&quot; website in terms of the information it provides, but that the occasional spikes in attention that come to these articles are probably reflected in real-life suicide attempts. They are particularly concerned about the diagram: their research indicates that the existence of the diagram does cause suicides and attempts at suicides that would otherwise not happen. We've been a bit stuck on how to move forward with this on Wikipedia, though - a big discussion about it could work both ways. Chase me ladies, I'm the Cavalry (Message me) 14:28, 14 April 2016 (UTC)
Can you tell us what standards they use to decide whether an information source is &quot;pro-suicide&quot;?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 04:14, 15 April 2016 (UTC)
 I don't know how many people are researching this so I kind of wonder if I'm about to quote any of the people  has been talking to, but here's how [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22357378 Collings and Niederkrotenthaler (2012),] and [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21616763 Kemp et al. (2011)] define prosuicide websites... Sites that:
* have detailed suicide instructions or descriptions of suicide methods
* advocate suicide or describe suicide methods in detail
* are permissive or encouraging of suicidal behaviors
* promote or enable suicide by describing suicide methods.

 Both papers put prosuicides sites in direct contrast with &quot;suicide prevention, and suicide support&quot; sites that offer resources, psychological, social, or practical support to reduce suicidal behaviors. Collings and Niederkrotenthaler said, &quot;many websites [have] life-promoting characteristics (such as the opportunity to contact a support service) and potentially suicide-promoting characteristics (such as detailed descriptions of suicide methods) have been found to be closely intertwined&quot; This is definitely true on reddit where they like to call themselves &quot;pro-choice&quot; and claim to be places for &quot;discussion about the moral, ethical, and religious implications about the right to choose the time of your own death.&quot; But they all contain links that tell you ways to kill yourself. They are NOT &quot;pro-choice&quot; or &quot;suicide neutral&quot; as they claim. Same with the Wikipedia article that sounds &quot;NPOV.&quot; It's really just a prosuicide site that normalizes, glamorizes and encourages suicide attempts in individuals who are already high-risk. This is all supported by the studies I've linked, especially [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26502782 Gunnell et al. (2015)]. PermStrump(talk) 06:27, 15 April 2016 (UTC)
Permstrump I hear and understand your passion on this, but it seems that you want WP to take a moral stance.  Have a look at Abortion.  Is that a &quot;pro-abortion&quot; article because it doesn't have hotline information for counseling?  (real question for you).  I could see someone arguing that.    
I also want to note that we have a whole article on Suicide methods and a .  There has been some of this kind of discussion at both talk pages over the years (!) as well as  and they get shot down each time. Jytdog (talk) 06:54, 15 April 2016 (UTC)
Jytdog, this isn't a moral stance, if I'm honest. The article on abortion does not tell people how to perform an abortion (especially not with at-home methods) - instead it talks about the procedure from a medical/scientific standpoint. Secondly, I would argue that our general goal - &quot;a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge&quot; - means that we shouldn't be promoting suicide methods in the way we currently are. Moral issues aside, (and this may seem quite cold, but) if vulnerable people use the information on our site to end their lives unnecessarily, then we're not adding the the world's knowledge - we're working to reduce it. Chase me ladies, I'm the Cavalry (Message me) 14:20, 15 April 2016 (UTC)
WhatamIdoing, to answer your question: I don't know the specifics, but two key points came through: first, that Wikipedia articles are often a &quot;how-to&quot; guide rather than a sensible, neutral analysis, and secondly that the vast majority of people who are looking for suicide methods online turn to Wikipedia as a source.

 : Re: the abortion article, is there notable documentation in peer reviewed sources that say Wikipedia.specifically. is contributing to a public health issue by facilitating people to follow through with abortions that are illegal in their jurisdiction by normalizing, glamorizing, promoting, and providing access to the means for performing self-abortions at home (normalizing them by discussing them at length without balance from opposing viewpoints and linking to list articles and websites about regular people who have had abortions with a focus on how quick and painless their abortions were; glamorizing them by listing all of the celebrities who had abortions and the exact methods they used; promoting them by inserting pro-abortion infoboxes in every article someone on the fence might visit, and links at the bottom of completely unrelated articles to articles detailing abortion methods; and providing the means by detailing all of the information someone would need (including illustrated diagrams) to perform a &quot;quick and painless&quot; self-abortion at home without a medical provider using easy to access household items)? Because if that were the case, then yeah, I'd say we should definitely rethink what we're doing with our abortion articles. Because that's exactly what the suicide articles do and that's exactly what scholars have directly connected to spikes in actual suicides that correspond with spikes in page views of wikipedia articles on that method following major news reports on noteworthy people committing suicide. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26502782 Gunnell et al. (2015)] use Robin Williams's suicide as a very disturbing example. He did not actually use asphyxiation, but for 1 hour the suicide bag article said he did and the visits to that page increased astronomically, as did suicides completed by asphyxiation with gas. Look at , literally any article about bags (purses, backpacks, etc.) links to suicide bag. PermStrump(talk) 15:33, 15 April 2016 (UTC)
That was a navigation template at work, I've changed it pending discussion. Certainly , but the topic is clearly notable. It is also very current event driven. The Canadian parliament is (unwillingly) grappling with medically assisted suicide issues at present, as no doubt are others. The hard part will be finding NPOV sources without legitimizing self help approaches. LeadSongDog come howl! 18:17, 15 April 2016 (UTC)
I haven't spent much time thinking about medically assisted suicide, but I do sometimes wonder why even a few people bother with it.  In comparison to the unregulated &quot;homemade&quot; methods â which are often so simple that even a brief explanation is &quot;detailing all the information someone would need&quot; â it seems like a lot of work for no benefit, except maybe the emotional comfort of having your decision &quot;approved&quot; by some medical or government authority (think &quot;certified proof for my loved ones that I'm not mentally ill&quot;).  
I'm not sure that every single article about suicide should have a &quot;right to respond&quot; section.  If an article is about a particular method, then it makes sense for the information to be restricted to that particular method.  For example, in the suicide bag article, editors could reasonably include information about, say, the ethics of this choice vs others (e.g., it's probably more ethical than jumping off a bridge and thereby triggering a search and rescue mission that could endanger emergency response workers).  But I don't see room in an article like that for something on the ethics of committing suicide at all; it's off-topic.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 03:29, 16 April 2016 (UTC)
 Some of the sources I've linked above talk specifically about the suicide bag and ethics of suicide, so it wouldn't be off topic. I have it on my to-do list. I'm not really concerned about medically assisted suicide for people with terminal illnesses. The problem is that that's not who these prosuicide sites are usually aimed at/who they hurt. PermStrump(talk) 10:42, 16 April 2016 (UTC)
Oh dear, this issue again. Suicide bags exist. They have for decades. As an encyclopedia, WP covers them. The article describes them, what they look like, their history, what people have said about them, etc. There are no step by step instructions (such instructions are readily available elsewhere [https://vimeo.com/11334172] [http://www.veoh.com/watch/v15857852SNBFDqej] [http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=b7c_1359440522&amp;comments=1] etc etc). As for the panic about increasing numbers of people using this method, it should also be noted that total numbers of suicides have not risen (indeed, suicide rates are stable or falling in most countries)



The fact that a slightly increasing percentage of suicides (the numbers are tiny) are choosing this method (for euthanasia as well as suicide) is to be expected, since it is painless, non-toxic, aesthetically acceptable and easily obtained (until recently), compared, for instance, to carbon monoxide poisoning, hanging and other brutal and distressing methods (some of which are also extremely dangerous to bystanders and medical response personnel, e.g. CO poisoning). Those who would bury the suicide bag article probably have good motives (nobody wants to see depressed youngsters making this error), and are not on a religiously-motivated campaign, but the outcome, if we suppress it, is unlikely to be good. People who are absolutely determined to kill themselves will find a way, and that way will generally be much more distressing and dangerous for all concerned. In addition, helium canisters these days are &quot;cut&quot; with 20% oxygen (due to a global shortage of helium) [http://assisted-dying.org/blog/2015/04/24/australian-warning-on-diluted-helium-tanks/], so the method does not work for many who try it. To make it effective, you have to get argon or nitrogen, and these are simply NOT casually available. Buying these gasses is not something most people are equipped to do. Ratel (talk) 21:50, 17 April 2016 (UTC)

 From [https://exiteuthanasia.wordpress.com/2015/04/25/lighter-than-only-some-air]:


Without balloon helium tanks, potential suicides have to order very large canisters from gas suppliers. They are heavy, come delivered by a truck, and are expensive. This whole topic is becoming moot ... Ratel (talk) 22:22, 17 April 2016 (UTC)

Interesting. Diluting 99.x% helium with 20% air will give a hypoxic mixture (roughly 4% oxygen), which should be quite effective at asphyxiating a human at normal atmospheric pressure. However, I was under the impression that balloon helium has 20% oxygen added, specifically to avoid accidents with people breathing it from balloons to produce squeaky voice effects. Maybe this varies between countries. â¢ â¢ â¢ Peter (Southwood) (talk): 09:44, 20 April 2016 (UTC)

Not really.  Divers accidentally die through the same biological mechanisms that kill the users of suicide bags.  The fact that one death makes some people more queasy than the other doesn't really change the biomedical facts about what happens if you get your Nitrogen/Oxygen balance wrong (or Helium/Oxygen, for really deep dives).  They both need good-enough sources, and neither absolutely requires gold-plated-only sources.  &quot;Controversial&quot; only applies to BLPs.  What you're probably thinking of is the &quot;extraordinary claims&quot; idea, and the biochemistry here isn't the least bit extraordinary.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 02:51, 11 May 2016 (UTC)
As far as I can tell, no-one on Wikipedia is prescribing suicide bags as a medical intervention, or claiming that this would be an acceptable medical practice. Therefore why should the article on suicide bags be considered within the scope of MEDRS? A more appropriate standard for reliability should be applied to the sources used.â¢ â¢ â¢ Peter (Southwood) (talk): 07:51, 11 May 2016 (UTC)

*we need more opinions at --Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 18:08, 10 May 2016 (UTC)
It is well-known that breathing a severely oxygen-deficient atmosphere (4 to 6%) results in unconsciousness after a few breaths, and that the exposed person has no warning and cannot sense that the oxygen level is too low (http://www.csb.gov/assets/1/19/SB-Nitrogen-6-11-031.pdf). No warning would imply no pain, but I don't expect to find peer reviewed studies or Cochrane reviews confirming or disproving that assumption. 
Maybe it's time to clearly define the limits of MEDRS, and ban &quot;off-label use&quot;. Prevalence  21:32, 10 May 2016 (UTC)
Changing MEDRS won't stop POV pushing. 
Speaking of which:  I suspect that part of the public health concern about this uncommon method stems from the population that chooses it, and I wonder whether that's addressed.  It's not the method of choice by sympathetic old cancer patients; instead, it's largely used by men with traditional risk factors for suicide (e.g., impulsive, young, white, recreational drug users).  So I'm wondering whether there is real-world POV pushing at play here, too:  parts of society have decided that this is a 'bad suicide' (a young person acting independently, if probably stupidly) rather than a 'good suicide' (a terminally ill elderly person ending up equally dead, but with the explicit blessing of a government bureaucracy and the medical establishment).  Because, you know, if you truly wanted to stop suicides, you'd stop worrying about this method, and this article, and instead make it illegal for my local (American) pharmacy to sell an unlimited number of bottles containing 375 extra-strength pills of liver failure each to any kid who can use a credit card.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 02:54, 11 May 2016 (UTC)
Changing (or more precisely, specifying the limits of) MEDRS will not stop POV pushing, but it would make using MEDRS as an excuse/ weapon by the POV pushers easier to refute/dismiss, hence a good thing. â¢ â¢ â¢ Peter (Southwood) (talk): 07:37, 11 May 2016 (UTC)
I agree, of course, but I don't think that we'll get there until  exists.  People cite MEDRS because it's a good hammer, even when the tool they really need is a screwdriver.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 13:23, 12 May 2016 (UTC)

I surprised there seems little pushback at this article to what seems very dubious proposals. The latest is to source a description of how &quot;peaceful&quot; death-by-helium is, to eyewitness accounts. Alexbrn (talk) 12:54, 12 May 2016 (UTC)
Perceived peacefulness is not .  Therefore, plain  guidelines apply, and that guideline probably requires nothing more than a newspaper article and  attribution.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 13:23, 12 May 2016 (UTC)
How the human body reacts physically to a substance / the nature of the death that subsequently occurs is biomedical information. The proposed source is the book Final Exit. Alexbrn (talk) 13:56, 12 May 2016 (UTC)
&quot;Causes myoclonus&quot; is biomedical information.  &quot;Seemed subjectively peaceful to bystanders&quot; is not.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 14:09, 12 May 2016 (UTC)
Possibly, but that's not the proposed wording and not the intended meaning of the edit, which is justified by the proposer thus: &quot;We have ample evidence from numerous sources that this is a quick and easy way to die, and deleting that simple fact from the page by impugning the source is POV&quot;. The &quot;evidence&quot; being proposed for this &quot;simple fact&quot; is somebody saying &quot;When I witnessed the helium death of a friend of mine it could not have been more peaceful&quot;. This seems to be way worse than using a well-published case report even: it falls off the bottom of . Alexbrn (talk) 15:52, 12 May 2016 (UTC)
Um no. That was not the evidence proposed, that was merely an example. There are different sources for the fact that the death is quick and peaceful. You can also go to the WP article Inert gas asphyxiation for data such as  and  And of course Ogden's studies draw on a large number of eyewitness accounts. And backing this up, autopsy does usually not show any notable findings, (lots of RS for this) suggesting an absence of unconscious death struggle. Ratel (talk) 22:29, 12 May 2016 (UTC)
 The [http://www.csb.gov/assets/1/19/SB-Nitrogen-6-11-031.pdf CSB.gov source] that  and  are referring to has nothing to do with suicide bags. Itâs about accidental, gradual exposure to nitrogen in the workplace in a contained environment like a small room. Iâm going to quote few sources that talk about death by nitrogen asphyxiation to illustrate how irrelevant the CSB source is. But I want to clarify something first...  There are 2 different statements by 2 separate people about the physical reaction (or lack there of) to the inhalation of inert gas using a suicide bag. One is a primary source in a low-impact, peer-reviewed journal written by Ogden, a right-to-die advocate and criminologist, that talks about how quick, painless and peaceful death is with helium and a suicide bag. The other statement is from a self-published newsletter written by Nitschke in which Nitschke says that helium has a risk of adverse effects, but nitrogen is much better in comparison. Iâm NOT suggesting that the sources quoted below that talk about nitrogen should be used in the article since theyâre about nitrogen asphyxiation using masks or in a contained environment in the workplace, not suicide bags. 

1) This [http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/13/health/death-row-stories-execution-methods/ CNN article] from 2015 is about Oklahoma looking for humane alternatives if the Supreme Court ruled that lethal injections were inhumane: 
Perfect illustration of how Nitschke doesn't represent the mainstream, medical view. By the way, Nitschke already [http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/philip-nitschke-says-exit-international-has-seen-a-surge-in-demand-for-help-to-die-peacefully/story-fndo471r-1226452088699 sells suicide kits] with pure nitrogen for $690, so I wonder if that has anything to do with why he claims there are zero adverse effects compared helium, the product gas of choice promoted by his right-to-die competitors, who have essentially rejected Nitschke and his methods. Not to mention the Medical Board of Australia suspended his medical registration, to which [http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-11-27/philip-nitschke-sets-medical-certificate-alight/6981522 Nitschke replied,] âOh yeah?

*Permstrump, you're confused by the fact that there are several ways to die from inert gas exposure, some much more efficacious than others. If you'd read Final Exit and The Peaceful Pill Handbook you'd know that there are very specific instructions to follow for using a suicide bag. Those instructions are not on WP because of . The chapter from the latter book on how to use the suicide bag correctly runs to ~50 pages of instructions and videos, about all manner of aspects that must be done correctly. But in summary of the basic process, one has to put a completely flattened bag at the top of the head above the ears with collar loosely on head, turn on nitrogen to fill the bag like a tent with pure nitrogen/inert gas (takes ~2 minutes) and wait till nitrogen is escaping from the bottom of the bag,  take rapid deep breaths (hyperventilate), then exhale completely (expel all air from lungs), then lower bag over head and take a deep breath, with cord and toggle snug against neck. This is a very precise sequence of events; if it is not done right, if there is insufficient nitrogen flow, or if the bag is not fully compressed and empty of air when the process begins, then failure to die quickly and peacefully can ensue, and this would be why we see some (a few) autopsies that show petechiae and aspiration of vomitus. If there is still air in the bag, that can delay the onset of unconsciousness and death. As Ogden says, &quot;done correctly&quot; the method is just about foolproof. I'd hazard a guess that most people who get a bag and a canister of helium don't know what to do, and there is a real chance they'll fuck it up. Sorry to have to be brutally specific, but these are the facts. Now perhaps you can think of a way to incorporate this information into the article as a warning? Ratel (talk) 04:25, 13 May 2016 (UTC)
* , no, I cannot think of a way to incorporate that into the article without original research or synthesizing multiple sources. That's one of several reasons why the current version isn't . There are virtually no actual experts in the field who share the same view and had their work on the topic published in a solidly reliable, independent source that we could cite in lieu of Nitschke and Ogden's weak sources. There aren't even enough other people giving it the consideration to publish statements contesting their claims, making it next to impossible to appropriately contextualize.  says, &quot;Points that are not discussed in independent sources should not be given any space in articles. Independent sources are also necessary to determine the relationship of a fringe theory to mainstream scholarly discourse.&quot; The current wording, despite attribution, still sounds like there's general consensus in the medical field that these 2 methods are quick and painless and all you need is a plastic bag and inert gas. Even if we take for granted that their statements are true (which in my opinion is dubious given the sources in my previous comment), even then their statements would only be true if the method is used properly, which the article technically says, but doesn't adequately emphasize, and likely can't without SYNTH due to the dearth of coverage on the topic outside of a small, radical group. PermStrump(talk) 05:43, 13 May 2016 (UTC)
  I also think you should strikeout/delete the extraneous details from your last comment unless you're deliberately trying to scare other editors away from contributing to this discussion/article. I didn't need to understand the any of the details you gave about how to use the method properly in order to comprehend that there are more likely to be adverse reactions when you do it wrong.

 At this moment, I'm only saying Ogden and Nitschke are weak sources for the statements about how quick and painless nitrogen/helium+suicide bag are and that there aren't adverse effects. They're weak because there isn't a single independent reliable source that can be used in addition or in place of Ogden and Nitschke. The sources you just liked are blog/newspaper articles by journalists who were quoting/paraphrasing Nitschke's beliefs. The fact that Nitschke said those things doesn't need more sources. I've explained multiple times in various threads on  how their views qualify as fringe on wikiepdia. It's a slam dunk. There's really no doubt about it. The argument of editors who disagree with me has basically boiled down to, &quot;Nuh huh. Their views aren't fringe,&quot; but no one has been able to provide a single independent reliable source to show that other SCHOLARS agree with them. It doesn't matter how many people &quot;in-universe&quot; hold the same view. That's how  works.   The editors claiming something isn't fringe are the ones who have to prove that support from mainstream scholars in the field exists. Until proven otherwise the  is on the editors  who want to include the disputed content to find the better sources. It really should be removed until then.  PermStrump(talk) 08:44, 13 May 2016 (UTC)

So if we ignore two of the experts who have made this their life's work, we have no sources? Perm, that's only true if you ignore the great sources I gave above showing almost immediate unconsciousness (&quot;one or two breaths&quot;), and the existence of studies featuring inert gas asphyxia autopsies without petechiae or inhalations (therefore without what is called in veterinary science an &quot;unconscious death struggle&quot; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17628370 example]). Do you need links to the [http://www.csb.gov/assets/1/19/SB-Nitrogen-6-11-031.pdf U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board document] and more studies showing unremarkable autopsies? For FRINGE to come into play, Nitschke and Ogden and Humphry and Dr Bruce Dunn and etc would all have to be claiming something that flies in the face of the wording of FRINGE, namely:  Ratel (talk) 09:48, 13 May 2016 (UTC)
 Like I already said above, the CSB source has nothing to do with suicide bags. The Auwaerter et al. source doesn't support Nitschke and Ogden's statements; it repeats them, but doesn't support them. Auwaerter: &quot;In the last years, right-to-die activists promoted suicide methods by asphyxiation with use of gases as being relatively quick and painless.&quot;  says, &quot;Statements about the truth of a theory must be based upon independent reliable sources.&quot; Auwaerter et al. did not attest to the truth of that theory. None of the names you mentioned are independent of the topic. They're part of the small, radical group, so no, the fact that they agree with each other doesn't make it mainstream. PermStrump(talk) 10:02, 13 May 2016 (UTC)
 * , we're going round in circles
 CSB source has nothing to do with suicide bags â of course not, but CSB source is about breathing a pure inert gas in an enclosed space, which completely agrees with the statements of Nitschke, Ogden et al, so let's not play semantics, it just wastes everyone's time.
 Statements about the truth of a theory â it's not a theory. Plenty of people have died like this, some filmed by Dignitas, some observed directly &amp; reported to researchers like Ogden, some scuba divers by mistake, some workers around inert gases. Where's the theory? Where's the fringe claim? If you do it properly then just a couple of breaths and you're out, 10 mins later (or longer if there is a vestige of oxygen) you're dead. If you don't do it properly you can take ~10-50 seconds to lose consciousness and up to 50 mins to die, with some twitching and movements, and possibly some signs at autopsy (inhalations, heart congestion, a few other signs I forget now, but none of which would have been felt consciously by the unconscious suiciding person, so relevance is moot). This is not controversial, nobody has contested it except the one source you have who looked at only 2 deaths by inert gas asphyxia and based his doubts on the one case with petechiae and inhaled vomitus, but this case also took a known emetic before breathing nitrogen, and in any case there is no proof that case experienced any pain, so the author's questioning of the painlessness of the method is strange. You can complain all you like about lack of numerous independent verifiable sources that echo these details, but you're never going to get a lot of researchers doing this kind of research when you see what happened to Ogden, who got himself unavoidably into a legal minefield that hobbled his career, so bleating about lack of verification from other sources gets us nowhere. And then you have [https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/78181/heliumsuicide.pdf the latest review study in this field] that calls bag+inert gas an &quot;easily understood and generally effective suicide method&quot;.

 The Howard source doesn't support &quot;quick and painless&quot; or &quot;peaceful&quot; or &quot;without adverse reactions.&quot; It would be much better in place of those 2 citations.

PermStrump(talk) 13:40, 13 May 2016 (UTC)
Most people who do not want to die would freak out if they knew someone was actively killing them. I would guess that it has more to do with the fact that someone is killing them than the actual method in use. Would it be unreasonable to suggest that the reaction might not be the same if the subject actually wants to die? â¢ â¢ â¢ Peter (Southwood) (talk): 09:36, 4 June 2016 (UTC)

Mainstream?
* Ogden is  according to Wikipedia's standards.   He gets nothing from his papers except what any other academic gets from their papers.  If we start declaring that experts aren't independent, then we will never be able to cite any journal article â no surgeons on surgical methods, no drug manufacturers on drugs, no pesticide researchers on pesticides, etc.  Ogden actually is that &quot;single independent reliable source&quot; that you're looking for.
* When you have one reliable source saying X, and no reliable sources saying anything about it, then saying X (perhaps with  attribution) is  DUE.  For example, we don't reject LD50 numbers when there is only one source for that number.
* Here's how we know that &quot;other SCHOLARS&quot; accept Ogden:  Multiple other scholars cited his paper.
* Permstrump, you're saying in your comments here that government sources about the proven effects of occupational exposure to Nitrogen is irrelevant, but that vague speculation in a newspaper about using it for lethal execution is just fine.  This sounds like cherry-picking sources based upon their POV to me, and that won't produce an acceptable article.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 13:53, 13 May 2016 (UTC)
* :
# Capital punishment: Using nitrogen for capital punishment would be difficult to impossible without sedation because to make it work properly you need complete co-operation (see instructions above). Some condemned prisoners will co-operate, most will not.
# Without adverse reactions : The ultimate adverse reaction is death. And since the autopsy-discovered sequelae, which are rare, occur after loss if consciousnesses, they are moot. So why are you making an issue of them? To the user, the process is still painless, otherwise we'd have seen people interrupt it (note the eyewitness accounts and films by Dignitas showing some involuntary movements but no attempt to remove bag or mask).
# BTW did you get access to the full text of the Kleespies paper? That paper seems to be more about a &quot;debreather&quot; than a suicide bag. Ratel (talk) 20:24, 13 May 2016 (UTC)
* , Yes, capital punishment is different from suicide, but so are the situations CSB was referring to that involved people who were unaware of accidentally and gradually being exposed to nitrogen while in a small room. Obviously that would be different than what if feels like when you have a plastic bag over your head. My point was essentially that the policies and guidelines exist for a reason. It's so easy to draw false conclusions with honest intentions, but  and  prohibit us from drawing conclusions from 2 separate works and from citing sources that aren't directly relevant to the topic at hand. It makes it really straight forward: CSB isn't talking about suicide bags, so it's irrelevant to this article. That should save us from wasting time arguing about sources that are unlikely to be useful for anything other than POV pushing. Yes, I have access to the full text of Kleespies (and pretty much any academic journal) through the library at work. I'll respond to your comment on  after this and C&amp;P some quotes from Kleespies.

So?  Being employed in your field of expertise is not a conflict of interest for that scientific field.  If it were, then we'd have to stop citing prominent world experts in nearly every subject.  No more citing Peter Piot on infectious diseases, for example, because he's running a non-profit organization that relates to to his scientific expertise.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 04:11, 14 May 2016 (UTC)
 I don't know if Peter Piot is, but I assume you mentioned him because he's well accepted an expert in his field by other exerts in his field, which is not true of Ogden. He's one of few adherents to a view well outside of the mainstream in his field (aka ) that he has some financial and much personal investment in. I didn't say he can't be cited in that article or any other article, but when it comes to this topic, it needs to be properly contextualized and his statements can't be given false weight. PermStrump(talk) 15:22, 14 May 2016 (UTC)
You keep saying that, but the reliable sources keep saying things like &quot;internationally known assisted-suicide expert&quot;[http://vancouversun.com/news/staff-blogs/suicide-researcher-yearns-to-teach-about-his-soul-sucking-work], &quot;a world-leading researcher&quot;[http://news.nationalpost.com/news/bizarre-situation-controversial-assisted-suicide-expert-missing-from-b-c-university-but-still-drawing-salary], &quot;a respected social scientist doing research on illegal behavior&quot;[https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2008/07/07/suicide], &quot;one of the worldâs foremost experts on assisted suicide&quot;[http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/story.html?id=4f4e563a-ea65-4394-bd02-1e1f15c98b17] who &quot;altered fundamentally the way the situation is looked at&quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/14/science/vancouver-aids-suicides-botched.html].  So unless we're redefining this to mean &quot;the mainstream of the field, counting only people who agree with the One True POVâ¢&quot;, then I think we're going to have to give up on calling him FRINGEy or &quot;outside the mainstream&quot;.  He is definitely too accepting of suicide to please the pro-life people, and he is reportedly too restrictive to please the right-to-die people, but I checked about a dozens news sources, and I didn't find a single one that said he was anything other than a prominent researcher doing fairly good work in the legally fraught field of (sometimes) watching people commit crimes (i.e., watching people assist in a suicide attempt, when their assistance is illegal in that jurisdiction).  
My mind is open on the point, but if you want me to change my mind, then you need to come up with some reliable sources (=not merely a repetition of this unverifiable assertion) that say he's not an expert.  You might start with Canadian political sources; since he and his research has influenced every piece of Canadian legislation about assisted suicide for years, you might be able to find a political hatchet job in any magazine that opposed the legislation.  If it's not there, it's probably not going to be in any standard news source.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 04:19, 15 May 2016 (UTC)
 I'm not sure what the question is anymore. He's &quot;in-universe&quot; as evidenced by the fact that he founded Farewell Foundation. No other scholars call him an expert. The only people who call him an expert are a few journalists, and even then they're calling him an expert in &quot;assisted suicide&quot;, which isn't even a field of anything. (). There's also his legal conflict of interest: 

 âPermStrump(talk) 09:39, 15 May 2016 (UTC)

Russel Ogden IS an expert in the field of assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia, as his [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Ogden%20RD[Author] long list of Pubmed indexed studies] into this field show objectively. Not only is he called an expert in the field of assisted suicide by numerous major news sources, but his list of published studies into the topic, more than any other researcher AFAIK, speaks volumes. Let's stop this pointless discussion now please. Ratel (talk) 11:16, 15 May 2016 (UTC)
It doesn't matter if the &quot;pro-life&quot; people say that he's &quot;in-universe&quot; with the &quot;pro-suicide&quot; people.  Ben Goldacre is &quot;in-universe&quot; with the evidence-based medicine people, and we don't say that he's FRINGEy or not an expert.  Having a firm opinion on a socially controversial subject doesn't change anyone's status as an expert on assisted suicide.  
Also, there are healthcare professionals right here on Wikipedia who have &quot;been subpoenaed&quot;.  That's what happens to the victims and witnesses of a crime, not to the alleged criminals.  &quot;Pushing for legal reform&quot; (according to one source, his goals are to reduce the number of painfully botched suicides and suicide attempts that turn into murder, and to make it clear in Canadian law that merely sitting in the same room as a suicide attempt, especially in the capacity of a journalist or scholar, without physically trying to stop it, is not itself a crime) is not a &quot;legal conflict of interest&quot;.  Conflicts of interest are spelled out pretty clearly in law, and they involve tangible benefits (money, goods, or services).

Articles on salt have taken the side of the &quot;low salt intake is bad&quot; camp

Perhaps the MEDRS guidelines are not sufficient to deal with controversies within the peer reviewed realm. As pointed out [http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb1607161 in this article] the &quot;low salt intake is bad&quot; camp is arguing for a position that is untenable when considering the totality of the evidence. All they have are results of cohort studies where the statistical analysis cannot correct for confounding factors to a sufficient degree to allow such conclusions to be drawn. Such results do get published because things are done &quot;by the book&quot;, but that should not distract from the obvious issues when drawing such conclusions. E.g. among the people who have low sodium intake there will be more frail people who don't eat much. Such effects are not going to be corrected for to the degree necessary to be able to see any effect due to low salt intake as explained in detail in the article. This has to be contrasted with the evidence that does exist about the health effects of very low salt intake from intervention studies and indigenous populations who have extremely low salt intakes.

 would you please point to the specific articles so we can see?  thx Jytdog (talk) 01:21, 8 June 2016 (UTC)

The main salt article is already problematic, the section on &quot;Diet and health&quot; obviously does have to summarize the evidence, but the way this is done makes it look like both sides have equally good arguments, while one side's arguments are far more plausible.  Far more problematic are the articles Health effects of salt and Salt and cardiovascular disease as they report on the results of large cohort studies without putting these results in the context of the discussion in the scientific community where the problems that I referred to above are raised.

 I was doing a trawl through PubMed and Trip database at the same time.

I suspect that a group of advocates have coined a catchy phrase for &quot;iatrogenic atrophic rhinitis&quot; and it's caught on.

Straw poll on COI editing

The other day, a medical journal editor asked me if Wikipedia is being manipulated by pharmaceutical or device manufacturers, and I told her there's no way of knowing for sure, short of a confession, and to the best of my knowledge no one's confessed. It did make me wonder, though, what the general feeling was here. Do you suspect there are shills at work on Wikipedia? (Let's not argue the point here, I'm just wondering about your level of suspicion/conviction, if any.) --Anthonyhcole (talk Â·  Â· )  12:31, 22 May 2016 (UTC)
in terms of pharmaceutical or device manufacturers they probably (unfortunately) see opportunity, since their goal is to &quot;make a profit&quot;, they most likely come at us w/ multiple accounts,there simply aren't enough people to handle COI, we need to be more proactive to stop them(when they sign up-directly ask if they have COI and if so... deny them access...IMO)--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 13:09, 22 May 2016 (UTC)
*We have strong evidence of editors targeting specific companies/drugs/treatment plans, even with a proven COI. It is possible that these simply act out of poor judgement, not realizing that Wikipedia abhors COI, but I think it's very naive to think that is always the case. We will likely not see any true confession, as it is not illegal and the editor only needs to create a new account. While not pharmaceutical in nature, there is at least on user who has confessed to paid-editing who worked on medical topics: . Carl Fredik ð  13:55, 22 May 2016 (UTC)
*Sometimes an editor has a more obvious COI due to their username, e.g. . Scray (talk) 15:09, 22 May 2016 (UTC)
*It's likely happening. My impression is that editors are likely choosing to hide their coi as best they can rather than disclose, but it's just an impression from the lack of disclosures I encounter in these type of articles vs other topics. My solution is to mention  to every new editor that I contact. --Ronz (talk) 16:41, 22 May 2016 (UTC)
*Within central topics the issue with company editors is small. At the smaller / less central topics company editors are fairly common. We got a write up about it here http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/08/wikipedia-editors-for-pay/393926/ Doc James (talk Â·  Â· ) 17:31, 22 May 2016 (UTC)
*I've seen occurrences on dietary supplements and phytochemical articles where developing consumer trends and marketing opportunities evolve readily from misinformation spread by celebrities and quacks. It requires an editor to keep skepticism sharp, apply  and  and adhere to  sourcing if clinical efficacy is claimed. --Zefr (talk) 17:45, 22 May 2016 (UTC)
* The FDA wrote rules a few years ago on what the manufacturers/marketers of regulated drugs can and can't say on social media sites (Wikipedia counts as social media), and that encourages a certain amount of caution.  We have occasionally had a few good pharma contributors, including some from GlaxoSmithKline who identified their employer in their usernames, years before that option was even explicitly permitted in the username policy.  In my experience, pharma contributors are rare, scrupulous about following the rules, and very happy to supply sources.  I don't remember encountering any device manufacturers (which is too bad, because there's much to say about those products, and overall less risk of problems with clinical efficacy claims).  But AFAICT there are no such regulatory rules for sellers of dietary supplements or alt med products, and that's an endless problem area.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 21:13, 22 May 2016 (UTC)
* We had a device manufacturer quite recently, and nutriceuticals and alt-med is rife with them, and they are allowed to continue despite that. I hold extremist mainstream views mind you. -Roxy the dogâ¢ woof 21:17, 22 May 2016 (UTC)

*I find that I come across very little COI editing from bigger pharma/biotech companies about the companies themselves.   I have seen promotional editing around new drugs, especially mAbs for cancer, some of them from bigger companies.  But mostly it is startups (see for example Alacris which is undergoing AfD now) or smaller companies (see ) - and often this takes the form of hyping clinical trial results.  Reagent companies do it too.  We had an article created (pretty clearly for pay) about [http://www.exonbio.com/antibody_platform_technology.php Exon Bio's mAb-making platform] and then another editor spammed wikilinks to that article into several others.  Medical device companies are the most aggressive.  I actually emailed the founding scientist of a MED-EL as their employees were pretty relentless adding content about their devices and how they work into Wikipedia and to their credit, the spamming stopped.  And the Atlantic article tells about James' experience with Medtronic.  Yes the dietary supplement space is pretty rife with conflicted editing.   
Two other things I want to mention about WP that no one else has yet.  The first is that advocacy editors are a huge problem - no one can quantify if people with a financial COI or who are advocates harm WP more, but both are a big problem.   In the medical space, we see that especially with people upset about side effects.   All our articles about Quinolones had been extensively worked on by someone who disclosed on-wiki that he was head of a patient advocacy group and had made those articles into horror stories; an editor who is no longer here cleaned most of that up. Likewise we get folks wanting to dramatically emphasize side effects of SSRIs (especially sexual side effects).  Likewise articles about circumcision have been beset by people opposed to the practice.  Lots of the alt-med issues arise from advocates, perhaps more than from people with a financial COI.  We have had super fierce battles about chronic Lyme for example and our article about acupuncture is a militarized zone.  And very recently we have had .. what shall i call them, bio-hackers maybe? -- writing all kinds of promotional how-to content about nootropic drugs. 
The other thing I want to say is that I think most everybody in WP:MED is very watchful and I think we do a pretty good job keeping promotion and advocacy out of our articles.  Article maintenance is a ton of work.  WAID will not like it that I say this, but one of the beneficial &quot;side effects&quot; of our strong sourcing guideline is that generally it is hard to get lousy (i.e. driven by promotion or advocacy) content about health into WP because generally MEDRS sources won't support it.  The strong sourcing guideline along with our active maintenance is powerful. 
Finally, Anthony one thing I would love for your journal editor friend to be aware of, is that when they publish reviews that make claims that are really not supported by the work that has been done in the field  this harms Wikipedia.  Everything in WP starts with sources, and when those articles enter the literature, they are MEDRS sources, and we are stuck with them and advocates use them like hammers.  I for one am very grateful for high quality medical editing. I don't know if your friend is aware of how dependent we are on the work he/she and their colleagues do.

*There is no instance in the popular Wikipedia community consciousness of any medical organization corrupting Wikipedia content, or even attempting to do so. There are hardly any examples of any medical organization engaging Wikipedia in any way that has an impact the Wikipedia community would recognize. I am aware of numerous claims outside the Wikipedia community among advocates of alternative medicine that Wikipedia is controlled by agents of big pharma that wickedly add evidence-based medical content to Wikipedia as a way to suppress the public availability of alternative medicine. I really wish the big pharma shills would come here and do that, but have seen no evidence that this happens. The rumors that circulate complain about regular Wikipedians in this forum, and not unknown actors, and I think no one in this forum is suspected by other forum members to be a secret big pharma spy. The rumors are based on a misunderstanding that regular Wikipedians are commercial actors.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 19:34, 23 May 2016 (UTC)
Of course Big Pharma don't go out of their way to discredit alt med. Alt med products earn Big Pharma billions of dollars each year, often through specialist alt med companies that are owned by major pharmaceutical companies.

 I think you are confusing alternative medicine with the dietary supplement business. The two are ENTIRELY different. â kashmiri TALK 18:55, 6 June 2016 (UTC)
Well, there's certainly some overlap.  Shark cartilage pills are sold as dietary supplements, but that's alt med.  It probably makes sense to think of it on a continuum that runs from mainstream medicine through dietary supplements and out to the fringiest ends of alt med. 
But I don't think I'd describe mainstream brands of basic multivitamins as &quot;alt med&quot;.  &quot;Anti-evidence med&quot;, maybe, but still mainstream.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 03:45, 7 June 2016 (UTC)
All I'm trying to say is that Big Pharma has no financial incentive to support our mission, because they profit tremendously from an ignorant and gullible public.

 Yes, although not always. There is a bunch of editors with a truly messianic approach, who seem to go over the top in bashing alt medicine. Look at Burzynski Clinic, it not just states that the guy is a fraud (which he likely is): the bunch of editors seem to take weird pleasure in debating every single court case, even ongoing one, in the lengthy article; at detailing every single negative mention of the clinic. Any attempts to restore balance get you attacked and reverted. I gave up long ago. That's the approach I guess which makes some question the motives of some WP editors. â kashmiri TALK 06:39, 24 May 2016 (UTC)
It seems increasingly hard to get people to remember what an encyclopedia article looks like.

It would depend upon what you're writing.  &quot;Poor handwriting hurts patients, when they end up with the wrong drug/dose/whatever&quot; is a medical claim, but &quot;Doctors are popularly believed to have worse handwriting than schoolteachers&quot; is not.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 04:42, 18 June 2016 (UTC)
It's a interesting topic, though there may be few statements strong enough to state it hurts patients â but there is bound to be historical analysis and sociology papers looking at why or even if it is true that they have bad handwriting. My own thoroughly unscientific theory is that its because doctors tend to take so much notes while studying/consultations/rounds that they start to write in autodidactic steganography, which noone else can read but they themselves.

GLILD draft

New to Wikipedia.  Be grateful for opinions and edits on my draft talk GLILD. Dr John Hurst (talk) 06:24, 20 June 2016 (UTC)
 Jytdog (talk) 06:25, 20 June 2016 (UTC)
Welcome!   We generally source articles about health from recent reviews in the biomedical literature (I set a banner on Talk page, which produces [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=%28+%22Granulomatous-Lymphocytic+Interstitial+Lung+Disease+%28GLILD%29%22+OR+%22Granulomatous+Lymphocytic+Interstitial+Lung+Disease%22%29+AND+Review%5Bptyp%5D+AND+%22last+5+years%22%5BPDat%5D this search]) or statements by major medical bodies.  That is described in .  Also please see  generally for style, and the  on typical sections we use for articles about conditions.   Again, welcome! Jytdog (talk) 06:38, 20 June 2016 (UTC)
The article says that no guidelines exist and that the scientific evidence is limited to retrospective case studies, and review articles on the specific subject are few and far between.  
The regulars at WT:MEDRS may recall that I regularly mention the problem of trying to apply a one-size-fits-hypertension-and-breast-cancer guideline to rare diseases.  Well, GLILD is an uncommon complication of a rare disease.  It affects about one in a quarter-million people in developed countries.  You are an order of magnitude more likely to get hit by a lightning strike next year than you are to develop this condition.  And if you're trying to figure out how difficult &quot;reviews only&quot; sourcing can be for something like that, I'll point out that PubMed finds [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=%22Lightning+Injuries%22%5BMesh%5D+AND+Review%5Bptyp%5D+AND+%22last+5+years%22%5BPDat%5D only nine (9) review articles on lightning injuries] published during the last five years, and this is even rarer than that.
The PubMed link you created gives an error message, because it finds no reviews during the last five years.  If you do a manual search with somewhat less specific terms, you'll find the Verma review (which has been repeatedly cited in the article) and one by Prasse () that might be interesting (or might say the same things as the already cited sources).  There are also a few reviews of CVID that mention this complication at least briefly (but, again, might not add any actual information).  Overall, however, I think that this is one of those situations in which we really do have to accept the evidence that actually exists, rather than the evidence we (and all patients with this life-shortening complication) wish existed.  When it comes to very rare conditions like this, our sourcing guidelines do not mesh well with reality.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 07:16, 21 June 2016 (UTC)

I like that you can get returns for 'review' on any med topic and that, I'm not sure exactly what you mean by trends, but I find that the number of 'cites', i.e., the number of times a review article is cited by other articles, to indicate a trend of sorts. Best Regards,

 It looks interesting, and should find some use for niche topics.

I'm concerned of bias here â it doesn't explain how it weights different papers to produce its top list. Is it some algorithm of relevance that depends on MESH-codes, citations, or just whichever papers support what is sold by the pharmaceutical company that pays SciCurve the most money?
This is especially concerning as it gives itself out to be a source for performing systematic reviews â which it really can't be if the underlying system isn't disclosed. I would be extremely wary of using this site, simply because using its algorithms may bias which articles we or anyone else chooses to cite. Carl Fredrik ð  18:12, 16 June 2016 (UTC)

I'm not sure everyone here got what my concern was: but it's about where you find sources, not necessarily the sources themselves. We should always be critical when reading a source, and when considering what it in turn has cited. But the problem is when we use these types of services such as Sci-curve or Google-scholar to find sources to cite. These are commercial actors which are under no obligation to disclose any bias in their search algorithms. Using results from their searches is akin to using a list produced by a pharmaceutical company of what they consider to be good reviews of the field. This list can be awesome and really cover most of the field, but the problem is we just don't know â they might be biased towards omitting certain negative results.
A number of papers have been published on why you shouldn't use Google scholar for systematic reviews, and this argument extends to other similar commercial services which are opaque in how their weight their articles.
* Google Scholar as replacement for systematic literature searches: good relative recall and precision are not enough. ()
*Google Scholar is not enough to be used alone for systematic reviews. ()
I don't know if these are the best studies on the topic, I haven't really reviewed them or the field, but they are a start.
Soupvector also raises good points about the way unpublished studies skew science, and it is a major problem â but this is a different one, akin to the FUTON bias that already plagues Wikipedia. Carl Fredrik ð  14:38, 18 June 2016 (UTC)

Problem is that it is impossible for almost any reasonably good search engine to prove that it is unbiased. Sure it can publish its own source code. But many search engines also have some machine learning
in place, which is based on search logs (what queries were written, what results users clicked on, ...). To make this transparent, the search engine would need to publish the logs and this
would lead people to stop using it.  (talk) 06:40, 22 June 2016 (UTC)</segment>
