		<segment id="id55339059">MeSH

It occurs to me that we might do well to map MeSH to articles — when we have an article on a concept covered by a subject heading or entry term, I think the heading or term should redirect to the article if the names are different.  Even when a heading changes, the old name is still useful as a redirect because it was once standard.  Any objections to this basic idea?

Do we have a complete list of headings and entry terms from MeSH?  WP:NOTDIR, so it would be in projectspace somewhere I suppose.  The whole vocabulary can be [https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/filelist.html downloaded], so creating the list, by itself, should be easy, but I'm not about to do it without checking here, since I don't want to duplicate someone else's work.  Nyttend backup (talk) 13:13, 14 September 2017 (UTC)

Sizeofint, yes this is redirect-focused.  For example, if I find [https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D010254], I might want to see if we have coverage of Paranasal Sinus Diseases, and because that's a redlink, it's harder to find.  I might create it as a redirect, and if I don't find paranasal sinus diseases first, the two redirects may end up going to different places.  Nyttend backup (talk) 15:03, 14 September 2017 (UTC)

This seems like something that better belongs at WikiData. It should be straightforward for the query wizards to construct a query to identify those MeSH ids that have no corresponding article in (a specified language) Wikipedia. We have  (Medical Subject Headings)  (MeSH ID) and  (MeSH Code). The  (List of MeSH codes) links to List of MeSH codes here on EnWikipedia. LeadSongDog come howl! 19:34, 14 September 2017 (UTC)

Healthcare or health care

I noticed that articles with healthcare/health care in the title change between the two different types of spelling. Maybe unify the healthcare/health care spelling for all the different articles? Here are some examples:Health care in the United States, Health care in Canada and Healthcare in Cuba, Healthcare in Israel.It's just a detail but I think it's expected that we settle on one type of spelling. -Throast (talk) 08:57, 15 September 2017 (UTC)
per article... Health care--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 18:21, 15 September 2017 (UTC)
 states consistency is a &quot;goal&quot; (rather than a rule). However, in line with  and , if the single word spelling is preferred by English-language sources from Cuba, Israel, etc, then the single word spelling should probably be the article title for that territory (redirects can always be used for the alternative spelling). For the main health care article title; cursory searches (using boolean operators) on Google and PubMed, both return more results for health care. Little pob (talk) 21:12, 15 September 2017 (UTC)

Doubt this is a viable topic. Alexbrn (talk) 19:41, 13 September 2017 (UTC)
 @Alexbrn how so? There is an article on Foot odor and Old person smell. I don't know why FBO would be less viable. --Candide124 (talk) 20:33, 13 September 2017 (UTC)
 Time to make sure you've read . --RexxS (talk) 00:17, 14 September 2017 (UTC)
  because unlike foot odor, in serious sources this &quot;condition&quot; doesn't exist.[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=%22fecal+body+odor%22] Just one mention in a fringe journal. At the most this might get a mention in body odor, but even that could be an over-stretch. Alexbrn (talk) 05:13, 14 September 2017 (UTC)
This draft makes it sound like this is more than one thing, which means that it's probably impossible to source.
The first of those things appears to be &quot;smelling bad because you're farting all the time&quot;, but the odor is presumably the flatus itself rather than the body (unlike what's written in the lead sentence).  Trimethylaminuria is an unrelated (and rare) cause of a similar unwanted odor, and there is already an article about that.  (TMAU has traditionally been described as a &quot;fishy&quot; odor, but this chemical is present in and characteristic of feces, too, and humans are exceptionally sensitive to its scent, so it's not unreasonable to call it a fecal odor.)  
Also, despite covering multiple unrelated causes of this symptom, I didn't notice the most common, which is poor hygiene.  I'm thinking that this would probably be better split up into smaller improvements for multiple articles, and some work at Body odor to  to those articles.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 00:49, 17 September 2017 (UTC)
Your input is appreciated, . I've refactored the whole article to be smaller and more of a hub to other articles. Do you mind taking a look? --Candide124 (talk) 10:15, 17 September 2017 (UTC)

Missed schooling due to severe illness?

Is there a Wikipedia article which discusses the subject of missed schooling due to severe illness?  Does that have a more formal name?  I found a review article which mentions it as a consequence for children with such poor bone density that they can break bones while being dressed, and I was hoping there'd be a Wikipedia article which discussed that in more detail so I could wikilink it.  I had a looksee in the education issues category, but couldn't find one.  -- (talk) 00:55, 15 September 2017 (UTC)
We have Truancy and although it is difficult to assess the number of cases due to illness, this article is more about delinquency.  I can't say that I found exactly what you were looking for.  —PaleoNeonate – 04:34, 15 September 2017 (UTC)
Thanks for looking, I found that one too. I just thought there might be a more focused article or section on the subject.  (talk) 09:36, 15 September 2017 (UTC)
It'd probably be called something like Health and education.  Education-related articles are generally under-developed, so it probably hasn't been created yet.  It would presumably contain information about the educational effects of missing school (some students miss so much school that they have to repeat the year), the regulations on schools (excused vs unexcused absences, loss of attendance-based funding), and connect to articles such as Medical certificate and Special education.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 01:00, 17 September 2017 (UTC)
The CDC often uses 'missed school days' as a measure of virulence or the impact of a disease/condition on school attendance. It sort of is like the quantification of days of work missed due to the flu. Best Regards, Barbara (WVS) ✐  02:10, 18 September 2017 (UTC)

Bilateral cancer

I've proposed deletion of this article - rationale in the PROD - would appreciate your thoughts. (also hoping I did this properly - just followed the &quot;PROD&quot; template from TW) — soupvector (talk) 18:10, 16 September 2017 (UTC)
We need to wait until Sept 23rd to delete. But agree with deletion. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 18:33, 16 September 2017 (UTC)
I kind of wonder whether this seems worthless to physicians but extremely valuable to people who are trying to figure out whether their mother is going to die (&quot;bilateral breast cancer&quot; being a bad sign, generally).  If, for easy math, we assume about 1.5 million new cases of breast cancer each year, and 1% are bilateral, then that's 150,000 women whose friends and families are going to want to know what this whole &quot;bilateral&quot; word means (and that's just for breast cancer).
So rather than thinking about whether it's an important &quot;thing&quot; biologically, what do you think we could do to make this information easy to find in Wikipedia?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 01:18, 17 September 2017 (UTC)
You seem to have started with the assumption that &quot;bilateral breast cancer&quot; is a bad sign, specifically (as opposed to, say, more than one focus in the same breast). What is the basis for that? Perhaps I misunderstand. I absolutely accept that the definition for &quot;bilateral&quot; should be available - would apply to bilateral broken leg, bilateral pneumothorax, bilateral stroke... do we need an extra article for each? (btw, is your response a veiled ad hominem rejection of the perspective offered?) — soupvector (talk) 02:33, 17 September 2017 (UTC)
It seems to me that the POV offered by people who already know what this word means in this context is that they don't think that people will be trying to find out what it means.  But someone created that article last week, and I assume that it wasn't for a frivolous purpose like boosting the edit count.  (The purpose might be because it's been listed for years at .)  I'm not convinced that having this separate article is the best way to deal with the information, but I believe that information needs to be somewhere in Wikipedia.  Maybe it belongs in a glossary of cancer-related terms?  Maybe a single sentence in Cancer?  Maybe somewhere else?  But somewhere, and ideally with this title redirecting there.
As to the example, I understand that a woman with bilateral breast cancer is about three-quarters as likely to survive long term compared to a woman with similar-grade unilateral breast cancer (which is commonly but not always single foci, of course).  Other cancers will mostly be worse:  I understand that bilateral ovarian cancer is correlated with metatases.  I imagine that treating bilateral lung cancer could create some significant treatment problems, because there's only so much lung tissue that you can remove. 
Most average, non-medical people react to any sort of diagnosis by trying to find out what all that medicalese means.  Grandma comes back from the doctor's office with some papers, and they sit down with her papers and type each of the unfamiliar words into their favorite web search engine.  They may not want to admit it to their doctors, but this is how a lot of people figure out what's going on.  They will end up somewhere in their searches, and I'd kind of rather that they ended up here. 
By the way, the PROD's out of process.   already removed a prod once.  So if we can't find a decent redirect/merge option, you will have to send it to AFD.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 03:22, 17 September 2017 (UTC)
PROD removed - thanks for pointing that out. I discuss WP content with my patients, trainees, and colleagues - I appreciate its value and limitations. I don't think &quot;bilateral condition X[i]&quot; is a good template for articles where i = 1 to N, but let's see what happens - it's great to be pleasantly surprised. — soupvector (talk) 03:57, 17 September 2017 (UTC)
WhatamIdoing, and why can't this [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bilateral_cancer&amp;oldid=801012412 currently tiny article] simply be covered in the Cancer article, if not already covered there? Why do we need this one-sentence article? Yes, we can often expand tiny stubs, but stuff like this should be covered in the main article before being split off. Flyer22 Reborn (talk) 03:10, 18 September 2017 (UTC)
Never mind; I see that you stated, &quot;Maybe a single sentence in Cancer?&quot; Flyer22 Reborn (talk) 03:15, 18 September 2017 (UTC)

Chiropractic and other alternative medicine practices as &quot;health care&quot;?

Eyes and comments [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Health_care#Chiropractic_in_lede_and_as_a_health_care_topic here]. If one quackery practice is included, is the article on health care open to others? --Zefr (talk) 19:04, 17 September 2017 (UTC)

A few off-the-cuff thoughts:
* That article has mentioned Ayurveda and other forms of traditional medicine for years.  What's so bad about chiropractic that we swallow these forms of quackery but strain at that form?
* How would you describe the current realities of health care in developing countries without mentioning &quot;quackery&quot;?
* How would you describe the economic issues without mentioning the multi-billion-dollar SCAM industry?
* How would you describe the history of European health care without including &quot;quackery&quot;?
Everything depends upon the exact sentence(s) in question, but I think that it's going to be necessary to mention the undisputed fact that alternative medicine exists (and costs money). 
Also, I notice that you reverted any mention of optometry, and if that's part of your idea of &quot;quackery&quot;, then we might need to spend some time coming to a shared understanding of what that word means.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 22:12, 17 September 2017 (UTC)

 A few off-the-cuff replies:
* Ayurveda, homeopathy, etc. are mentioned in the body, but not the lead - what makes chiropractic so significant as a mode of health care that it needs to be listed in the lead alongside mainstream professions?
* What has quackery to do with the weight we give to chiropractic in the lead's list of health care provisions?
* We can describe the economic issues raised by the multi-billion-dollar SCAM industry without mentioning it in the lead.
* I would describe the history of European health care as a learning experience, in which quackery played a significant role, but I still don't think the history of European health care is vital to an understanding of present-day health care, nor that it is so key that it needs to be in the lead.
 The sentence in question was a poorly thought-out 'laundry list' of every conceivable medical and pseudo-medical discipline. Not a good idea for the lead of such a top-level article as Health care.
 I always thought optometry was the good deeds done by groups of women who weren't allowed to join the Freemasons, but I could be getting muddled there. Even so, do we really want to list in the lead every possible medical speciality? Would we then wish to quote Tom Lehrer:  And then why stop with just the top ten? What next - manicurists? --RexxS (talk) 16:24, 18 September 2017 (UTC)
Optometrists are the licensed professionals with a doctorate who spend all day telling people that they need new glasses.  I suppose that one could make a case for manicurists (some elderly and disabled people are unable to cut their toenails, which makes walking painful), but nobody does, so I don't think that we need to go down that slippery slope yet.
If the problem was really &quot;in the lead&quot;, then I'd have expected the editors to move that information to a different part of the article.  Wholesale blanking suggests that the editor who blanked it does not want it mentioned at all.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 15:22, 19 September 2017 (UTC)
First, I think that's a narrow view of the role optometrists play in total eyecare. Ophthalmologists would say that well-equipped, well-trained optometrists are essential for screening, detection, and referrals of more serious vision problems than just supplying glasses, particularly for seniors. Second, the lede addresses mainstream, evidence-based areas that are within the connected network of a total health care system, with the quackery practices removed from the article for lack of sources showing they are part of a network. Quackery and fringe practices - chiropractic, naturopathy, acupuncture, herbalism, etc. - tend to take their roles as singular endpoints, rather than being referrals or partners in a network for total care. It's possible we could have a section on quackery practices under 'Related sectors' [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care#Related_sectors here], particularly for less-developed world regions, but the challenge is finding good sources showing such practices are effective and perceived by respected health organizations as useful. --Zefr (talk) 15:54, 19 September 2017 (UTC)
Hmm, do the telephone sanitisers need someone to speak up for them here too? There are quite a few occupations where incompetence or inaction would pose health and safety risks (to clients or the public) yet are minimally regulated rather than recognised professions. Food handlers, heavy equipment operators, janitors, firefighters, police, and yes even manicurists all fall into this group. It's not just the academic difficulty of admission to the traditional self-regulated professions which defines them. Sheldon Cooper's discipline isn't about to be regarded as a profession any time soon. Perhaps we need a different collective term for these relatively-easy-but-still-risky jobs.

Journal of Dietary Supplements

If a journal does not have the impact factor, this journal is not &quot;reputable medical journal&quot; ()? Even if it is include in the Index medicus (MEDLINE)? Or am I wrong? --Мит Сколов (talk) 12:23, 20 September 2017 (UTC)
This criteria would seem to imply any recently created journal is not a reliable source. This seems not ideal to me. If Elsevier or Springer or PLoS start a new journal with stringent editing standards I think it would be reliable despite not having an impact factor (yet). Sizeofint (talk) 00:46, 21 September 2017 (UTC)
That said, I think the lack of an impact factor is a red flag to investigate further. Sizeofint (talk) 00:46, 21 September 2017 (UTC)
According to that article, this journal has been around since 1996 and is published by Taylor &amp; Francis, a reputable publisher as far as I know. ResearchGate gives it an impact factor of ~1 which isn't horrible [https://www.researchgate.net/journal/1939-022X_Journal_of_Dietary_Supplements]. Sizeofint (talk) 00:51, 21 September 2017 (UTC)
Given the small number of articles published per year – I counted just 50 articles spread across six issues in 2016; I see only 17 articles in four issues for 2015 – I would take the RG impact factor numbers with a large grain of salt.  Having (or not having) a single moderately-widely cited paper would be sufficient to swing a calculated impact factor wildly up or down. (The relatively low and rather uneven output of this journal may be a reason why Clarivate doesn't even calculate an impact factor for them.)  The vast majority of articles could well never be cited (beyond self-cites) or even read.
The scope of the journal encompasses a lot of territory frequently infringed by woo promoters, and would require a diligent editorial staff and careful peer reviewers to effectively police.  Unfortunately, the top scientific entry on the [http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/ijds20/current journal's homepage] is to [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/19390211.2015.1008614 Emerging Adjuvant Therapy for Cancer: Propolis and its Constituents], which has a wildly-overblown abstract about the miraculous healing properties of bee glue:
&quot;...Its biological effects, which range from antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, dermatoprotective, anti-allergic, laxative and immunomodulatory to anticancer, have been validated. Propolis has shown efficacy against brain, head and neck, skin, breast, liver, pancreas, kidney, bladder, prostate, colon and blood cancers....&quot;
On the other hand, right next to it we have [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/19390211.2014.904128 An Evidence-Based Systematic Review of Goji (Lycium spp.) by the Natural Standard Research Collaboration], which offers
&quot;An evidence-based systematic review of goji (Lycium spp.) by the Natural Standard Research Collaboration consolidates the safety and efficacy data available in the scientific literature using a validated, reproducible grading rationale. This article includes written and statistical analysis of clinical trials, plus a compilation of expert opinion, folkloric precedent, history, pharmacology, kinetics/dynamics, interactions, adverse effects, toxicology, and dosing.&quot;
(The Natural Standard Research Collaboration, as near as I can tell, is small but reputable and associated with Edzard Ernst.)
So altogether the journal's a mixed bag.  I would be very careful about which articles I cited from it, and reluctant to use any content from articles without independent indicia of reliability.  TenOfAllTrades(talk) 02:54, 21 September 2017 (UTC)

IMO we are losing Wikipedia to undisclosed paid editors
Thankfully most paid editors are still obvious like this

But they make a fair point [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Whispering&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=801398247 here] regarding:

*AlloMap_molecular_expression_testing
*Multitarget_stool_DNA_screening_test
*Oncotype_DX

Because we are getting overrun by spam, they do not see why they cannot add their spam as well :-(

Doc James (talk ·  · ) 18:15, 21 September 2017 (UTC)

* What's the problem here?
* Poor article quality
 or
* &quot;Fruit of the poisoned tree&quot;
 There is an increasing incidence, agreed, of paid editing and undisclosed paid editing. There are always questions of article quality. Yet, despite the initial gut reaction, I can't see so much of an inherent problem with paid editing. None of us are trusted as sources here: everything added needs to be sourced in a way that's independently verifiable. It doesn't matter whether additions come from &quot;good faith&quot; editors or from paid editors: are their edits any good?
 We have an article quality problem. I don't see paid editors significantly changing this. Maybe competent paid editors are to be encouraged?  We do have a number of incompetent, secretive and usually quite obvious paid editors around too, and most of those are quite obviously the low budget end of the market.
 We have a bias problem too. But even that is greater from the volunteer zealots, rather than the professional advocates.
 I think we need to focus less on the horror of editors being paid, more on quality generally, and more on efficiently working as a collaborative team. The amount of sniping at other good editors from those self-appointed &quot;senior editors&quot; in power (in their own mind at least) is far more of a problem than UPE. Also it makes tasks like SPI uselessly inefficient, when that's bunged up more with personal sniping than exposing real sock editors pushing an agenda for hire. Andy Dingley (talk) 18:38, 21 September 2017 (UTC)
The short answer is that paid editing (or advocacy of any kind) corrupts a consensus-based process. . More at . Alexbrn (talk) 18:48, 21 September 2017 (UTC)

* Doc James, I get that argument a lot. Bad content becomes a model and justification for more of the same. Jytdog (talk) 19:19, 21 September 2017 (UTC)
**In this example the company in question copied from their press releases into Wikipedia because they see other companies copying from their press releases into Wikipedia.
**The article quality is exceedingly poor and promotional as is typically. We would not be here if paid editors created good content. They simply do not. I do not think I have seen a competent undisclosed paid editor every. And by far the majority of disclosed paid editors are also not competent and a greater harm than benefit. Overall disclosed paid editing is an overall harm and paid editing, taking over all, is a serious harm.
**CU is already verging on useless when it comes to experience / professional paid editors as it only picks them up when they become lazy. Saying that the real problem is &quot;senior editors&quot; is basically the saying the volunteers who have built up Wikipedia and put it in the top ten of Google hits should now simply hand it over to those who want to make a profit off the site.

Assessment and comments for this article and its Talk page. If basic-stage phytochemical research is published in Nature Medicine [https://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v22/n8/full/nm.4132.html here], does that elevate it as MEDRS? --Zefr (talk) 23:59, 13 September 2017 (UTC)
 Nope. The quality of the journal publishing is just one factor that makes a source MEDRS-compliant. Primary studies (such as &quot;Urolithin A induces mitophagy and prolongs lifespan in C. elegans and increases muscle function in rodents&quot;) are not really what we need for biomedical claims. Nor for that matter would it be a good idea to extrapolate studies in roundworms and rats in order to draw conclusions in other lifeforms. On the plus side, the research is indexed at , and it is cited in other works such as [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5054377/ PMC5054377], but my advice would be to wait for a sober review to do some analysis before trying to use it.

Sources for lack of evidence

Unfounded health claims are regularly made, and people come to Wikipedia to check them. Most discussions of fads suffer from a lack of of genuine scientific evidence, which is bad for the public understanding of science, and some fads even harm public health. It would be good to have reliable sources for statements like &quot;As of January 2017, no good clinical evidence for this claim has been published&quot; or &quot;The two studies frequently cited in support of this claim both had major flaws, which...&quot;. Could we as ask the Cochrane Foundation (, ) to publish such statements? For a researcher in a field, an authoritative statement that there is currently no adequate evidence of X would presumably be fairly easy to make. In some cases, they might even be able to give an expert view of the plausibility of claims. HLHJ (talk) 16:05, 30 September 2017 (UTC)
This is a very important question The short answer is yes. EBM language has a lot of false friend vocabulary which readers mistake: see recently at  for the common misconception that &quot;more research is needed&quot; is a phrase that offers some kind of validation.

Thanks, Alexbrn. I made you an article on more research is needed. Abstruse academic language is a separate issue, but I remember once reading a sentence in a published and presumably peer-reviewed case study three times before realizing that it meant &quot;The patient died&quot;. The authors were clearly not happy that their patient had died. Your example, on the other hand, retreats into dry, detached, unemotional, abstruse language to deal with conflict. I think open access will make the ability to read academic English much more common. Sadly, marketing dressed up in academic language will probably become more common, too. — Preceding  comment added by HLHJ  (talk • ) 18:22, 1 October 2017 (UTC)

Some other recent reviews on this subject include [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28477657 this recent review] with a negative conclusion and [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23553240 this older one] (from 2013) with a more mixed conclusion (though there were some critical letters published in response to this latter review).

Thanks for those refs! Have requested the Clinics one; am looking forward to seeing what it says. 2 reviews from this year would be great. Jytdog (talk) 07:00, 2 October 2017 (UTC)
* Two thoughts:
*# First, before looking at the papers:  Is there some reason not to cite both, even if most individual editors disagree with the POVs in one or both of the reviews?  I thought that the mainstream consensus was that there are no simple answers.  The rate of PTSD presumably depends not just on the procedure, but also on cultural factors, your social situation, and individual issues, such as [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/23/india-gender whether your mother-in-law wants to murder you because she unfairly blames you (and not her son) for conceiving a girl].  Which reminds me:  In keeping with the educational needs of a global encyclopedia, most of our articles related to this subject should probably be pointing out that the sex of a baby is determined by the father rather than the mother.  That's almost &quot;the sky is blue&quot; for those of us who know a thing or two about genetics, but maybe making this fact easier to find could result in fewer murdered mothers.  (And if you know any lawmakers in India, then maybe those ubiquitous signs at ultrasound clinics could be updated to say &quot;Sex determination testing is illegal, and, anyway, it's entirely your husband's fault if you conceived a girl.&quot;)
*# After, looking at the papers:  I went into this biased in favor of the newer one, but is that second one actually a review?  PubMed's labels aren't perfect.  The abstract says, &quot;The Turnaway Study prospectively enrolled 956 women seeking abortion in the USA and followed their mental health outcomes for 5 years. The control group was comprised of women denied abortions based on gestational age limits&quot;, which sounds very much like an original experimental study.  I'm sure that scientists will argue over whether the kind of woman who sought an abortion at &gt;20 weeks is sufficiently similar to a woman who had the money, resources, organizational skills, prompt recognition of pregnancy, decisiveness, etc., to be able to obtain an abortion at a median of 7 weeks, but for our purposes, comparing a thousand individual women over the course of five years doesn't sound like a review article.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 21:11, 1 October 2017 (UTC)
Yes there is a reason not to use pro-life propaganda in Wikipedia. There are discretionary sanctions on abortion topics.  Yes, the second is a review; it discusses the 19 primary sources in Table 1 from the Turnaway study. Jytdog (talk) 21:15, 1 October 2017 (UTC)
Summarizing all the publications from one (1) clinical trial is not exactly what we mean by &quot;a review&quot;.  The point behind a review is to combine multiple, unrelated studies – ideally even sources that happen outside of the US.  Following the Least publishable unit theory and then collecting all of your own previously published work into a single report doesn't really meet the spirit of MEDRS' call for relying on secondary sources.  I'm not saying that it's unreliable for all purposes, but you couldn't really use it to say &quot;the rate of PTSD after an abortion is X%&quot;; you could only use it to say &quot;In one study, the rate of PTSD among American women who sought abortions but were denied because the clinic said the pregnancy was too advanced was X%, compared to American women who sought abortions at those same clinics at an earlier stage in the pregnancy.&quot;
Are there no other sources on this subject?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 17:43, 2 October 2017 (UTC)
WAID.  That source and the higher quality older ones talk about the difficulty of confounders and how conclusions drawn from studies done in the past are tenative at best due to the confounders; the Turnaway study is the first study that was designed to actually address them and was very well powered.  It is immensely important. The Horvath paper is a review that discusses the older studies as well as that one. If you need the source I can send it to you; it is not clear to me that you have actually read it yet. Jytdog (talk) 22:30, 2 October 2017 (UTC)

Too technical (perhaps)

This article is only one sentence long and has been tagged as too technical. I've noticed that tag a lot just lately but anyway I digress because my main concern is that the subject title is a phrase coined by the authors of the supporting ref (PMC4451469); &quot;This makes the present case the first of its kind in the literature, and it has resulted in the coining of the term Dahan's syndrome.&quot; I am not sure what to make of that, unless there is a special case that I am not aware of, I would think it might not pass notability.

Health in Cuba vs Healthcare in Cuba

Hi! I had someone ask me about the articles Health in Cuba and Healthcare in Cuba. They were worried that the articles need to be merged, since they discuss almost the same topic. I wanted to ask about this here since I didn't know if there was a difference between the two articles that I didn't pick up on. I know that health could be more about the general health and healthcare be more about how health is treated, but I wasn't sure. Shalor (Wiki Ed) (talk) 14:37, 4 October 2017 (UTC)
 Yes, I would expect Health in Cuba to be about the health of the population, notable health issues, life expectancy, etc. Healthcare in Cuba should be able the healthcare industry. Natureium (talk) 15:36, 4 October 2017 (UTC)

To mouse or not to mouse

In the spirit of a bar bet, if you're editing remotely (e.g., if you take your laptop to a café), do you take an external mouse and mousepad with you?  

I'm hearing that Wikipedia editors in at least some countries do this, but I can't remember the last time I saw someone using a mouse (away from a desk), much less taking a mousepad along.  What do you think?  Am I just not going to the right places?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 22:18, 2 October 2017 (UTC)

Because touchpads are suboptimal, I do bring a small portable mouse around, but no pad.  This reminds me that I should replace my dead trackball which is even better (small, no need for a surface, more efficient than touchpads).  But I don't think that I really see people with a mouse and pad in cafes.  Even netbooks and laptops are rare versus pads and phones.  —PaleoNeonate – 22:55, 2 October 2017 (UTC)

 Always mouse. I usually find myself using my laptop at events I'm training at, so not only do I take a wireless mouse for my laptop, I take a spare wireless mouse + dongle because there's always one new editor who has borrowed a laptop and finds they can't work the touchpad (or worse, the tiny joystick that some have). --RexxS (talk) 02:26, 3 October 2017 (UTC)
Generally I use a touchpad with a laptop, but if I'm travelling with my laptop I take a wired mouse. Sometimes at home when something is Really Wrong with Wikipedia, I need to decamp to the desktop machine (3 screens &amp; big clicky keyboard) ;-) Alexbrn (talk) 08:40, 3 October 2017 (UTC)
 When I was in grad school (a few years ago) some of my classmates used wireless mice with their laptops (no mousepads), but that was most common among the second-career folks. I've occasionally carried along a wireless mouse when I knew I'd be doing a lot of graphics work (especially after I bought a Magic Mouse) or when the switch(es) for clicking started to get flakey on an older laptop—the tap-to-click thing has never consistently worked for me. —Shelley V. Adams ‹blame› 16:40, 5 October 2017 (UTC)

Clinical equipoise article needs help

I changed Clinical equipoise from Start-class to Stub as it suffers from poor quality writing, which makes it a quite confusing read. This problem was noted six years ago on the Talk page. It seems like a fairly important topic, particularly for medical research. I'll add it to my 'to do' list, but it's not an area I know a lot about, so if any of you have the time and motivation, I suspect it could be substantially improved with a modicum of effort. I did a quick lit search and this article looks particularly good:

Change Antidepressants to Dysfunctional Mood Relievers (DMRs)

I've witnessed that antidepressants are effective for a range of mood maladies beyond depression, anxiety, and obsessive compulsive disorder. They're also effective against anger, aggravation, irritability, temperamentality, apathy, sloth, etc. that individually or collectively cause clinically significant distress/impariment. I feel that the label of DMRs is a better umbrella term for the wide range of disorders antidepressants are effective against. Thoughts/comments?  (talk) 07:43, 8 October 2017 (UTC)
My impression is that antidepressant is still a more widely used term.  Various DMR uses are also off-label, some being controversial (others more substanciated).  Disclaimer: I'm no expert.  —PaleoNeonate – 08:32, 8 October 2017 (UTC)
I know people can be hostile about antidepressants, but surely calling all Mood Relievers &quot;Dysfunctional&quot; is going a bit far... Jheald (talk) 09:21, 8 October 2017 (UTC)
We go with the common name which is antidepressants. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 09:56, 8 October 2017 (UTC)
I can't find any reference in the literature to the term &quot;Dysfunctional Mood Reliever&quot;, abbreviated DMR. Looie496 (talk) 13:43, 8 October 2017 (UTC)
I thought DMR referred to the awful sexual side effects that cause many patients to stop taking SSRI's and SNRI's. ;o)   - Mark D Worthen PsyD (talk) 06:12, 9 October 2017 (UTC)
I concur.  Never heard of a DMR.  There are some antidepressants that make people pretty doggone dysfunctional when stopped abruptly, but I don't think that's what you're getting at... Jclemens (talk) 06:48, 9 October 2017 (UTC)
I think this might be meant as a proposal, which of course is a problem with  (so we won't put it in any articles).  On the other hand, for people interested in the subject area, brainstorming an ideal replacement name for antidepressants (which do both more and less than what the label suggests) is probably interesting, and that the world would be a slightly better place if someone came up with a perfect name (which naturally would have to be adopted elsewhere, etc.).  So, taking this as a proposal, I'll point out that &quot;DMR&quot; doesn't indicate the non-mood effects, e.g., the use of some of these pills to treat physical pain, and thus is perhaps not quite ideal.   WhatamIdoing (talk) 03:32, 10 October 2017 (UTC)
 Mm, I actually coined the term while thinking of antidepressants as being a somewhat restricted label for all the uses this class of medications makes available. But you're right, sufferers of somatic symptom disorder for example can experience relief from pain or other malignant sensations in the body with antidepressants. When I thought of the label DMR, I didn't really spend time to think of more alternatives to naming this class of medications though I'll probably give it some more thought at some point. At any rate, I feel that the label of DMRs, as opposed to the label of antidepressants, draws more focus to the chief symptoms these medications are traditionally used for, with mood being somewhat predominant from my experience (not sure about how it is with others' experience). I'm glad that my idea seems to have drawn some interest to the subject, maybe someone will come up with an even more fitting (while still hopefully pithy) term in the future :)  (talk) 09:19, 11 October 2017 (UTC)
The problem of naming is significant, and can lead to people refusing potentially effective treatment because they're not experiencing depressed mood (so why take an antidepressant?).  Perhaps someone will find a source and expand Antidepressant to talk about the misleading name. 
(I wonder if the converse is true:  the patient feels depressed, and therefore insists upon an antidepressant, although what is really needed is, say, a CPAP machine.)  WhatamIdoing (talk) 21:55, 11 October 2017 (UTC)

* Moderna has raised a staggering amount of money, on the promise that they are going to deliver mRNA as a drug, that will be translated into proteins and do all kinds of magical things. The mRNA does not get incorporated into the genome so this is not really gene therapy but they have been very quiet about what kind of vehicle it will be delivered in, if it is oral (?!) or IV or something else, how it survives degradation, how they get any kind of specificity as to where the mRNA gets translated.. so many questions that nobody knows but them yet.

I have never noticed this type of edit before. Should it be reverted (for reasons other than the typo)?
I assumed that this comment would go on the talk page.

Grant proposal: Wikipedia Cultural Diversity Observatory 

Building on their dissertation, which studied differences in the presence/absence of articles across different language WP's, this person proposes to set up a website that automatedly analyzes and shows via graphs/images, differences in coverage of &quot;all the worlds knowledge&quot; across the language WPs.

A key part of this will be a tool that identifies the &quot;top 100 articles&quot; that are uniquely important to a given language WP (what they call &quot;Cultural Context Content&quot;)  so that editors can act to bring over those articles into all the other language Wikipedias.    Interesting and actionable.   It will be interesting to see how &quot;the most important&quot; will get measured...  if it turns out to be a bunch of popular culture crap I will not care, but this has potential to uncover gaps in our coverage of health content at least. 

A second key part will be cross cultural medicine - that is, an open ness for different cultural approaches to difficult 
to manage illnesses.    The reason for this is two fold - first
any region with diverse population would do well to offer culturally relevant medical approaches.  Secondly, and perhaps more 
importantly, by allowing global medicine to finally happen, we encourage exchange of gold standards for illnesses, new and
old.  An important example is the malarial treatment known as artemesia.  While the nobel prize was recently awarded
to modern scientist Tu Youyou the use of artemesia for malaria is quite ancient and would be commonly known to physicians
in Thailand or even to students of Traditional Chinese Medicine.    

Typically there is a dug in refusal to accept ancient remedies by western trained MD's, and the inclusion of cross
cultural fertilization in wikimedicine could be the answer to this.   

As a side note, since this is the talk page...  I became very ill after travel to the tropics and was given
artimesia, which at the time was not standard nor acceptable.   The insurance company tried to have my doctor
punished for this, although it helped me.  They not only were punative towards the MD but they tried to reverse
the payments made for related medical visits/tests.   We showed them the work by the WHO and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. Finally our CFO threatened to sue and they backed off.   It was initially recommended to me by an
acupuncturist and it saved my life.  It was just lucky I had an open state of mind.  Perhaps that would be the most
important part of a cross cultural wikimedicine ... to help open our minds to create new solutions, because at this point
in time, we are facing many challenges in healthcare - from cost to new diseases.

Paracetamol/acetaminophen and asthma

 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5349720/ This source] from March 2017 looks good. While there might be a small association between paracetamol use and later asthma diagnosis, this could well be a confounding factor. In particular, paracetamol should not be withheld from children with fever/pain. Axl ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 15:00, 18 October 2017 (UTC)
So no aspirin for children because of Reyes and no paracetamol for children because of asthma.  Who wants to take bets on when ibuprofen will be declared unsafe for children, too? 
Oh, and I asked Mr Google whether that had already happened, it appears that be generally accepted that fevers over 39 °C in young children need to be treated, and that ibuprofen can't be used can't be used below age six months.  So we've already got the catch-22 in one age group:  you should treat, and but you shouldn't use the first-line drug for fear of asthma.  And that leaves you with nothing, by my count. 
Looking at the study Axl linked, I'm feeling like the confounding-factor hypothesis is not unreasonable.  You're only supposed to use paracetamol for the first six months, so at least 50% of the paracetamol use during the first 12 months (what some of the studies looked at) is really going to mean &quot;were you sick when you were a baby?&quot;  WhatamIdoing (talk) 15:29, 18 October 2017 (UTC)

Michael Frass
Peoples thoughts? Doc James (talk ·  · ) 16:05, 18 October 2017 (UTC)
the editor[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions/Ventus55&amp;offset=20150529111819&amp;limit=500&amp;target=Ventus55]....the article per should be deleted or trimmed to a greater extent--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 17:39, 18 October 2017 (UTC)

 I took a look at another of the articles he created: Alexander Berghaus. Like Michael Frass, it is devoid of independent sources and simply uses his academic papers to describe his career. I've sent Alexander Berghaus to AfD, , as a test-case. If that is deleted, it probably indicates that the other articles by Ventus55 should be sent down that route.
 For the record: 
 Considering that all of his articles are translations from the corresponding German articles about German scientists/physicians, he is simply a translator who doesn't realise that our requirements for notability are more rigorous than those on the German Wikipedia. See Thomas Vogl, Peter Kranke, Christian-Friedrich Vahl, Roland Mertelsmann, , Joachim Bauer, , Fuat Oduncu, Gerd Rasp, Walter A. Wohlgemuth, , Paolo Brenner, Kai von Klitzing, Thorsten Walles, Johannes Hoffmann (vascular surgeon), Jürgen Brosius, Frank Hölzle, Reinhard Dallinger, and probably others.
 Andreas Plückthun implicates  as well. --RexxS (talk) 18:50, 18 October 2017 (UTC)
 Ventus55 was not active just as translator, he created the corresponding articles at de:wp as well. For example, [https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michael_Frass&amp;oldid=132026008 Michael Frass] as created by him. Overall this appears to be a case of bilingual paid editing. See the [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_Diskussion:WikiProjekt_Umgang_mit_bezahltem_Schreiben#krasser_Fall discussion at de:wp] and in particular this [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Redaktion_Medizin/Qualit%C3%A4tssicherung/Archiv/2016/1#NICO_.28Kieferknochen-Osteopathie.29 quite concerning case from 2016]. --AFBorchert (talk) 22:51, 18 October 2017 (UTC)

 Web of Science lists 253 publications by Michael Frass with an h-index of 30. His most cited article is Outcome and prognostic factors in critically ill cancer patients admitted to the intensive care unit, Critical Care Medicine, vol. 28, no. 5, May 2000, pp. 1322–1328. The article does not appear to be balanced as it mainly focuses on Frass' contributions in the field of homeopathy. He has indeed some publications in this field but they had much less impact. More relevant are his works on the fields of emergency care (about the combitube in particular which he appears to have invented) and cancer. His paper Comparison of a conventional tracheal airway with the Combitube in an urban emergency medical services system run by physicians, Resuscitation, vol. 57, no. 1, April 2003, pp. 27–32 has been cited 72 times. --AFBorchert (talk) 20:11, 18 October 2017 (UTC)

*Comment:  editing often worries me because it's so often promotional and/or biased in some other way. For example, important information might be omitted. Flyer22 Reborn (talk) 20:48, 18 October 2017 (UTC)
**Yup and they so often use sources that do not actually support the text it is attached to :-( In fact sometimes the sources say the exact opposite. Might be cleaner to just ban paid editing to article space all together (with of course the usual exception for WiR that are disclosed and at like minded organizations). 98% of the rest of the paid editors are undisclosed anyway. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 22:08, 18 October 2017 (UTC)
** Unfortunately, last I checked, eight of the nine criteria at  don't require any independent sources, and two of those eight are purely subjective items.  If that wasn't bad enough, I've had editors in that area tell me that as far as they're concerned, everything published by an academic's employer should be counted as an  about the prof and/or the prof's research, because no university would dare publish something false or overly promotional.  So notability according to the GNG might not be demonstrated in the current versions of these articles (which doesn't prove that it couldn't be demonstrated through other sources), but AFD is probably pointless.  (Also, I understand that German Wikipedia's notability standard for professors is actually higher than ours:  e.g., no subjective &quot;had a major impact&quot; claims.)

**: Actually,  is a guideline, but  is policy:
**:* &quot;&quot;
**: According to :
**:* &quot;&quot;
**: I should add that the guideline  is equally clear:
**:* &quot;&quot;
**: Any article that has no independent secondary sources, and where a reasonable search does not find any, should be dispatched to AfD. Policy requires that.
**: Now, in the case of ,  has found two secondary sources that I was unable to find, so it's likely Berghaus now has sufficient sourcing to pass . We'll have to test further with the other creations by Ventus55. In each case, if no independent secondary sources exist, we can clearly demonstrate that NPROF or any other SNG can't save an article that is not based primarily on such sourcing.
**: For what it's worth, NPROF and some of the other SNGs need to be modified to fall in line with policy, and that will be difficult given the vested interests in each guideline. --RexxS (talk) 13:15, 20 October 2017 (UTC)
**::Well, of course I agree that content policies require this, and I will add NOT () to your list of examples.

Sacroiliac joint dysfunction - Hesch-based content

This article contains several large passages based on the research of J. Hesch. Most of it was added by  and  SPAs. I can't evaluate the factual accuracy, but it seems highly problematic when authors just add their own research, especially as these edits seem to promote recent publications and possibly fringe views without any significant 3rd-party verification.
