We would like to activate Wikiproject Anatomy. That's why I'd like to move Anatomical structures' list to Anatomy project. Comments? ser:NCurse|NCurse ser talk:NCurse|work 15:53, 17 June 2006 (UTC)

 New changes 

I have plans with this project, I try to coordinate work because this project is not too active now. So:
* I made a stub-sorting page where I collected all medicine related stub categories, templates.
* I want to organize article lists in a subpage and communicate with other wikiprojects. For example, as a first step I moved anatomy related articles' list to Anatomy wikiproject. 
* I want to reorganize the main page of the project, showing tasks, other projects, subpages, etc...
If anybody has problems with these suggestions, please let me know. ser:NCurse|NCurse ser talk:NCurse|work 19:07, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

 Medical Genetics 

As you may know, own syndrome is currently undergoing peer review.  One of the reviewers wondered why we were not using the format for clinical medicine for the article.  While researching that issue, I came here and was somewhat disappointed that there is virtually nothing in the project concerning Medical Genetics.  None of the numerical abnormalities is listed (other than the generic risomy).  Neither is enetic counseling, n vitro fertilization, ewborn screening, ri du chat, etc.  There are some diseases with genetic origins (ourette syndrome, ystic fibrosis, etc.) that are in the &quot;Other diseases&quot; box.

Unless there are objections, I will make a new box entitled &quot;Medical Genetics&quot;, move the genetic diseases that are in &quot;Other diseases&quot; there, and fill it with the missing medical genetics articles.  Another possibility is that I create the box in the Biology Project under Genetics (with a subsection on Medical Genetics).

I am still struggling with the original issue of whether it is useful to have own syndrome use the Clinical Medicine template, and if so, how best to do it.  If you have any suggestions, post them at ikipedia:Peer review/Down syndrome/archive1 or alk:Down syndrome.ser:TedE|Tedser_talk:TedE|Talk/pecial:Contributions/TedE|Contributions 19:43, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

Attachment therapy / Dyadic developmental psychotherapy 
NEW TOPIC (sorry, i don't know how to do this exactly)   Can anyone provide help on psychiatric/psychological topics where there is considerable disagreement and an ongoing wrangle about the meaning of evidence-based treatment? I refer to Attachment Therapy and to Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy. A look at the histories of these topics will show intense disagreement and periodic POV claims when contradiction of certain contributors occurs. Attachment Therapy (use caps for both words) is especially sensitive because associated practices have been connected with child deaths and injuries. Thank you-- we have a mediator who is doing his best, but this requires specialized knowledge. ser:Jean Mercer|Jean Mercer 15:57, 19 July 2006 (UTC)
There was no consensus on deleting this page. However, there is substantial disagreement between several editors and one editor about the usefulness of this page and what material to include as one contributor appeares to be speaking for a specific group (is a leader and spokesperson for that group: Advocates for Children in Therapy.

The only disagreement about Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy is that created by Mercer...and some by her colleague and fellow leader of Advocates for Children in Therapy, Sarner, who was banned from the Barrett article and &quot;soft-banned&quot; from the Bowlby article.

 Lancet citations in Wikipedia 

Is there any consensus concerning citations to The Lancet, pre-1990?  The original volume numbers were non-standard, and Lancet retroactively changed them in 1990.  Specifically, which of these should be used (or, should a different format be used)?

#ite journal| year=1974| title=Classification and nomenclature of malformation (Discussion)| journal=The Lancet| pages=798| volume=303| issue=7861
#ite journal| year=1974| title=Classification and nomenclature of malformation (Discussion)| journal=The Lancet| pages=798| volume=2| issue=7861
#ite journal| date=1 September 974| title=Classification and nomenclature of malformation (Discussion)| journal=The Lancet| pages=798| issue=7861

Thanks. ser:TedE|Tedser_talk:TedE|Talk/pecial:Contributions/TedE|Contributions 17:20, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

The fuller the information on the citation source the better, so using the template:cite journal as you have idealy have full date and volume number. However forcing date links is, I feel unnecessary with date=1 September 974 is not ideal - either define date correctly using ISO yyyy-mm-dd or split as year and month parameters (later can take day after the month). I would tend favour the current volume numbering, as that is what current readers will search for or, if they have access to the Lancet site, read directly, so

 Either:ite journal| date=974-09-21 | title=Classification and nomenclature of malformation (Discussion)| journal=The Lancet| pages=798| volume=303| issue=7861
&gt;ite journal| date=974-09-21 | title=Classification and nomenclature of malformation (Discussion)| journal=The Lancet| pages=798| volume=303| issue=7861

Or ite journal| year=1974 | month=21 September | title=Classification and nomenclature of malformation (Discussion)| journal=The Lancet| pages=798| volume=303| issue=7861
&gt;#ite journal| year=1974 | month=21 September | title=Classification and nomenclature of malformation (Discussion)| journal=The Lancet| pages=798| volume=303| issue=7861

And is there a consensus about putting a wikilink in a reference to the (well known) journal? 
e.g. this one: Fox IJ, Roy Chowdhury J, Kaufman SS, Goertzen TC, Roy Chowdhury N, Warkentin PI, Dorko K, Sauter BV, Strom SC. Treatment of the Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I with hepatocyte transplantation.  Engl J Med 1998; 338: 1422-1426. MID|9580649
--ser:Stevenfruitsmaak|Steven Fruitsmaak | ser_talk:Stevenfruitsmaak|Talk 12:39, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

One of my concerns is that PubMed uses the old volume numbering system.  As of right now, some of the Lancet references in own syndrome use the PubMed listing, and some use the ScienceDirect listing (new Lancet volumes).  As for wikilinks, I probably should have included that. ser:TedE|Tedser_talk:TedE|Talk/pecial:Contributions/TedE|Contributions 15:01, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

Regarding wikilinks, I normally include them if the journal or reference book has a Wikipedia article (see my current project, rug-eluting stent). — ser:Knowledge Seeker|Knowledge Seeker ser talk:Knowledge Seeker|দ 19:43, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

 Pseudoscience 

Please be aware that there is a lot of activity on WP with regards to POV-pushing about quackery, pseudoscience, and the like. ikipedia:WikiProject Pseudoscience is set up to watch over pseudoscience articles in general, but does not function as a clearing-house for disputes; these would be best taken here. Recent controversies include something about the ental amalgam controversy, and some (I believe baseless) accusations that rthomolecular medicine is pseudoscience. Please help keep WP balanced by keeping an eye out on these and other related topics that draw attention from the &quot;fringe&quot; and &quot;out there&quot; crowds. In the case of orthomolecular medicine, we seem to be dealing with an overzelous debunker who seems to be more quacky than the purported quacks he is fighting off. ser:Linas|linas 15:14, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

 Plea for help: rthomolecular medicine 

The article on rthomolecular medicine is currently embroiled in a very verbose, very contentious edit war. A helping hand from rational clear thinkers is needed.

As one of the supposed &quot;kooks and cranks&quot; Linas is complaining about, let me state for the record that I would be very happy if knowledgeable medical personnel assist in editing rthomolecular medicine|], which until last week, had been entirely under the control of fervent alternative-medicine supporters.  The problem on Linas's talk page came when he burst onto the page and threatened a bunch of skeptics with &quot;bans and blocks&quot; because he disagreed with their edits citing mainstream medical sources.   I hope he and ser:Fyslee patch up their differences, because the two should really be on the same side on most issues if Linas is really a rational skeptic. I certainly consider myself one, and I'm really befuddled why Linas is taking the topsy-turvy position that I'm on the side of kooks and cranks.  -- ser:Cri du canard|Cri du canard 23:22, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

 Baldness treatments 

Hi everyone, aldness treatments needs a lot of peer review in its current state.

Likely,  no expert will touch this page.    They will look at the discussion page and steer off. The problem is a common one on Wikipedia in technical areas with any hint of controversy.  Anybody who knows a technical field well enough to make valid comments is likely to have &quot;Conflicts&quot; and &quot;opinions&quot;,  as do I.  Scientific publications resolve this problem by requiring disclosure.  But it just ain't worth it here.   Rather than continue to engage in the usual and customary fights,  I have just steered off,  even in the arms-length way that is allowed for experts and that I have rigorously followed,  just giving cites to papers and patents,  etc.   So the section is just going to stay the way it is.  And yes,  it is full of factual errors, non-neutral POV's, and OR..
 
Incidentally,   though Wikipedia has very high page rank, as a practical matter a Wiki link out is of no value at all.  In theory,  it might help with Google ranking.  But Wikipedia has millions of out-going links from its 1.4 million pages.  This dilutes any transferred page rank to effectively zero. ser:Pproctor|Pproctor 13:06, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

Hi. If you still have work to do tagging talk pages and assessing articles, my ikipedia:AutoWikiBrowser/Plugins|AWB plugin might be of interest to you.

*Assessments mode, for reviewing articles (pictured)

As of the current version, WikiProjects with simple &quot;generic&quot; templates are supported by the plugin without the need for any special programatic support by me. I've had a look at your project's template and you seem to qualify.

That's not necessary I think: you could put them in a column which indicates specific interests...

But you're right if we were just to throw everyone together. I also disagree with JFW: some people just work with one project, have one specific interest...--ser:Stevenfruitsmaak|Steven Fruitsmaak (ser_talk:Stevenfruitsmaak|Reply) 20:36, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

A question that I've always had is whether the preclinical/clinical project division is actually needed. I'm not sure where the division originated, but it seems more reasonable to just collapse it into the general medicine and, if desired in the future, allow individual Wiki Projects on, say, histology in keeping with gastroenterology, genetics, and nephrology. I suspect that first year medical students are probably the only people interested in just preclinical medicine and, well, they typically enter the clinical years at some point! Everyone else can contribute to both. In any event, I vote that we merge everything into just P:MED while we are discussing the issue! ser:InvictaHOG|InvictaHOG 01:48, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

I think both projects are valuable, since some people are only interested in one thing, messages for one group aren't necessarily important for the others... I say we keep the projects.--ser:Stevenfruitsmaak|Steven Fruitsmaak (ser_talk:Stevenfruitsmaak|Reply) 12:38, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

I don't know if the distinction is really useful either. Here's a short history of how it came to be: The original project was started by ser:Jfdwolff and grew out of a group of editors working in his userspace (this was before my time). It was called &quot;Clinical medicine&quot; and it was the only medical project. Some time later, ser:PhatRita discussed the need for preclinical medicine to have a place to collaborate as well, and set up the preclinical project. The discussions on this also gave me the idea to start the medicine collaboration, which I created at the same time. A little while later, I created the medicine project as kind of an umbrella group, mainly to rate articles and identify areas for improvement. It wasn't my intention at the time for it to take over the role of any other project, though recently it looks like it has greatly increased in scope. — ser:Knowledge Seeker|Knowledge Seeker ser talk:Knowledge Seeker|দ 05:14, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

The following are two options I had in mind. Both would give some indication as to what specific projects the various participants are interested in. (I imagine someone else could do a better job formatting the boxes.) Rather than a list of participants on the &quot;Participants&quot; section of the various pages, perhaps there could be an instruction for people to &quot;register&quot; or indicate interest on the main participant page (i.e. ikipedia:WikiProject Medicine/Participants). -ser:AED|AED 21:12, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

I've got new problems. Should we merge these members into one list? And how? In alphabetic order? And after that, maybe we should send them a message about the new place of the list. It's going to be an enormous job. What if a clinical medicine project member doesn't want to participate in the preclinical work? Is it our task to decide about it? ser:NCurse|NCurse  ser talk:NCurse|work 13:33, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

Yes I think it should be one list.
Alphabetical is a good idea (is there an alternative?).
I would just put a message on the location of the previous list that the list has moved. Or the list could be transcluded on subprojects, or we could put a redirect.
If someone has only listed him-/herself in one project, then we should only list them in that project, like AED has done in the example above. Later on, the participants can change over themselves if they want.--ser:Stevenfruitsmaak|Steven Fruitsmaak (ser_talk:Stevenfruitsmaak|Reply) 15:20, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

I'm OK with all of this. Perhaps there should also be something (i.e. bold or footnotes) to indicate which editors are administrators and which are the Projects moderators. -ser:AED|AED 17:14, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

My alternative solution: we create a new list (option 1 above), and leave a message for every editor on these lists whether they want to list themselves or not. ser:NCurse|NCurse  ser talk:NCurse|work 15:31, 3 October 2006 (UTC)
That would be a good way to weed out who is active and who is not. Another idea is to put everyone into the list, then leave a message asking if they would like to be removed.-ser:AED|AED 17:14, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

It'd be the more complicated solution. In my opinion, leave a message for everyone with the exact place of the new list and then they can decide themselves. The admin-moderator column is a good idea. ser:NCurse|NCurse  ser talk:NCurse|work 17:20, 3 October 2006 (UTC)
In looking over the various participants lists, I see a lot of names of people who haven't contributed to Wikipedia in quite some time.

Merging sounds like a good idea, as long as I get to remain first on the list.

Removing inactives is ok if they have been gone for more than a year or so IMO (call me conservative). 
Moderators: like who??? Admins is a good idea, maybe a column for specific roles; admin, portal maintainer, MCOTW-coordinator and god-knows-what.
I strongly oppose against contacting everyone again about listing them as participants: I add other people as project participants, because either you participate or not, there's no sense in not being listed (and after all this is a wiki). May I remind everyone that we have just contacted a lot of people about listing themselves as participants of WP:MED? I say just merge the lot, weed out long time inactives and put a notice on relevant pages that the lists have been merged. Be bold and don't waste time making countless User_talk-edits.--ser:Stevenfruitsmaak|Steven Fruitsmaak (ser_talk:Stevenfruitsmaak|Reply) 14:56, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

 If we wish people to feel encouraged to sign themselves into the project(s) then the markup table needs be relatively easy. Option 1 has the more complex markup adding in links to the various projects. Also it is the most cluttered with everyones entry linking to P:MCOTW, P:CLINMED, P:PCM - surely just linked column headings would suffice. So my preference is Option 2 (unless anyone cares to persuade me otherwise). 
 To help people insert themselves onto the list, it might help to provide a copy &amp; paste for newer users:ser:Davidruben|David Ruben  ser talk:Davidruben|Talk  18:33, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

 Overlap with Psychology WikiProject 

I'm a part of the ikipedia:WikiProject Psychology|Psychology WikiProject, and I'm trying to decide whether or not sychiatry-related issues should be included in our project. Even though psychiatry is a medical field, it overlaps quite a bit with the field of sychology. Most psychiatry articles (such as those related to mental illnesses) could easily fall under both categories, but I'm not sure whether or not articles specifically about psychiatry (such as the psychiatry article itself) should also be covered by our project. I would like to see what members of this project think about it. —ser:Cswrye|Cswrye 17:53, 4 October 2006 (UTC)
I don't think that projects should be rigid or as well-defined. Obviously there's a great deal of overlap in real life with psychologists, psychiatrists, and general doctors all treating the same diseases - sometimes in much the same way. I certainly think that psychiatry is within the scope of P:MED, though there's not really an active psychiatrist/psychologist that I can think of working under the project. I think that, as long some members of Wikiproject Psychology feels compelled to address some psychiatric articles (even the article psychiatry itself), then by all means they should be supported by the project. Also, we should cross-post any articles which we feel might be of interest to each group (such as the chizophrenia and sychosis articles which are featured but under review). ser:InvictaHOG|InvictaHOG 18:33, 4 October 2006 (UTC)
I am not a project member (because I'm a layperson), but the Psychology Project has been so uninvolved in some of the overlapping articles as to be invisible.  It would be great if they would help out more, and help develop and maintain article to the guidelines at P:MEDMOS.  ser:SandyGeorgia|Sandy 19:15, 4 October 2006 (UTC)
I agree that there can be overlap among projects, so psychiatry articles can legitimately fall under both WikiProjects. Unless anyone objects, I'll go ahead and include them in the list of psychology articles. By including them in the project, maybe we can get more of the psychology people involved in them. —ser:Cswrye|Cswrye 21:48, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

In that list you can see the whole medicine category-tree. We must choose categories and subcategories we want to work on. We can't include other medicine-related wikiprojects' categories.

 yadic Developmental Psychotherapy 

I've been involved in a very tedious debate at yadic Developmental Psychotherapy. It makes claims concerning therapeutic efficacy and evidential basis using a very limited number of credible sources. The vast majority of the references are self-published books,  books published in publishing farms, or totally unrelated works. Moreover, members from the APSAC task-force on Attachment Therapy have very recently cast strong doubt on such assertions in Child Maltreatment. [http://cmx.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/11/4/381 http://cmx.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/11/4/381]. They even called for a noted proponent of the therapy to remove such claims from his website. The APSAC is a highly credible association as far as I can tell. 

Furthermore, claims such as these can be found spread across wikipedia in articles such as hild abuse. This form of therapy has about two peer-reviewed studies to its name (same researcher) and is practiced at about one clinic (associated to the researcher who published the studies). It is the same group of editors that have spread these assertions throughout the psychotherapy related articles. 

This is way out of my expertise and I was hoping that someone with more knowledge than I have could address these things. Thanks! ser:Shotwell|shotwell 19:23, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

Hello. The P:COUNCIL|WikiProject Council has recently updated the ikipedia:WikiProject Council/Directory.  This new directory includes a variety of categories and subcategories which will, with luck, potentially draw new members to the projects who are interested in those specific subjects. Please review the directory and make any changes to the entries for your project that you see fit. There is also a directory of portals, at ser:B2T2/Portal, listing all the existing portals. Feel free to add any of them to the portals or comments section of your entries in the directory. The three columns regarding Category:WikiProject assessments|assessment, Category:WikiProject peer reviews|peer review, and Category:Wikipedia collaborations|collaboration are included in the directory for both the use of the projects themselves and for that of others. Having such departments will allow a project to more quickly and easily identify its most important articles and its articles in greatest need of improvement. If you have not already done so, please consider whether your project would benefit from having departments which deal in these matters. It is my hope that all the changes to the directory can be finished by the first of next month. Please feel free to make any changes you see fit to the entries for your project before then. If you should have any questions regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact me. Thank you.  ser:Badbilltucker2|B2T2 00:11, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

As the primary author of the proposal, I didn't ever mean to suggests – nor do I think I have suggested – that it is a guideline with the consensus of all Wikipedia. It was formulated by editors of the Mathematics and Physics WikiProjects after some recent discussions at P:CITE and P:V. It has now been agreed upon by the editors of these projects. It was always my [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Mathematics&amp;diff=81872802&amp;oldid=81860122 my] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Physics&amp;diff=81872765&amp;oldid=81850226 intent] to submit it to the other science WikiProjects, which is indeed why I named the proposal &quot;scientific citation guidelines.&quot;

In any case, your comments would be very welcome. In particular, the examples are very cosmology-centric, so if any of you can fix them up to make them a little more general, that would be much appreciated. –ser:Joke137|Joke 19:49, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

 Categorization project 

Hi. I have no specific competence in medicine but I'm working on the backlog of uncategorized articles and I happened to notice that Category:Diseases is a bit of a mess. I think it would be a very worthwhile task for this project to create a good system of subcategories and clean all of this up. For instance, I wanted to categorize yelophthisis. Hmmm... So where does this go? The best I could do is the top level category of diseases. If you see a finer cat for this one, please add it of course, but generally speaking I think it would be worthwhile to shoot for a &quot;no disease left-behind&quot; objective: the disease category would simply be the parent of finer categories and any article in it would just be waiting for a finer classification, like Category:Writers, Category:Actors or Category:Lists. ser:Pascal.Tesson|Pascal.Tesson 21:38, 1 November 2006 (UTC)

 Policy dispute regarding primary sources and OR (requested comment) 

Cross posted to P:RS, P:OR and ikipedia:WikiProject Medicine. 
There is a dispute going on at alk:Depo Provera#Disadvantages and side effects WP:NOR violations. One user found primary sources, reliable journal articles, that said depo provera may do certain negative things. Another user is disputing this, citing original research. The argument, I guess, is that the 1st user is interpreting the source, and drawing conclusions not published anywhere else. The studies only dealt with rats (not humans), and there is nothing in the patient drug information (or any other way to verify the claims outside of the studies in question). The logic goes that making a connection that a study dealing with rats may effect the use of this drug in humans as a contraception is original research.  Furthermore, it may be pushing a POV that this drug is unsafe by mentioning these studies (that are not verified outside of the individual study, and not mentioned in patient drug information). I feel like I am repeating myself, sorry. The counter argument is that a) citing primary sources is a good thing b) the claims are cited and verifiable and reliable, fulfilling almost every wikipedia criteria for inclusion. So I guess there are two issues. Is using the information in this  manner original research? And is it giving undue weight to a minority view by citing obscure studies like this?
