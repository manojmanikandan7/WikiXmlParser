We would like to activate Wikiproject Anatomy. That's why I'd like to move Anatomical structures' list to Anatomy project. Comments? NCurse work 15:53, 17 June 2006 (UTC)

I moved it, but my question is whether I should live the same list here or not? NCurse work 20:16, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

I moved it to a new subpage on the Anatomy Project, by the way.  And I hope to devise a list of articles based on the Terminologia Anatomica, which will be a lot larger than the current list. --Mauvila 23:00, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

New changes

I have plans with this project, I try to coordinate work because this project is not too active now. So:
* I made a stub-sorting page where I collected all medicine related stub categories, templates.
* I want to organize article lists in a subpage and communicate with other wikiprojects. For example, as a first step I moved anatomy related articles' list to Anatomy wikiproject. 
* I want to reorganize the main page of the project, showing tasks, other projects, subpages, etc...
If anybody has problems with these suggestions, please let me know. NCurse work 19:07, 22 June 2006 (UTC)

Medical Genetics

As you may know, Down syndrome is currently undergoing peer review.  One of the reviewers wondered why we were not using the format for clinical medicine for the article.  While researching that issue, I came here and was somewhat disappointed that there is virtually nothing in the project concerning Medical Genetics.  None of the numerical abnormalities is listed (other than the generic trisomy).  Neither is genetic counseling, in vitro fertilization, newborn screening, Cri du chat, etc.  There are some diseases with genetic origins (Tourette syndrome, cystic fibrosis, etc.) that are in the &quot;Other diseases&quot; box.

Unless there are objections, I will make a new box entitled &quot;Medical Genetics&quot;, move the genetic diseases that are in &quot;Other diseases&quot; there, and fill it with the missing medical genetics articles.  Another possibility is that I create the box in the Biology Project under Genetics (with a subsection on Medical Genetics).

I am still struggling with the original issue of whether it is useful to have Down syndrome use the Clinical Medicine template, and if so, how best to do it.  If you have any suggestions, post them at  or .TedTalk/ 19:43, 30 June 2006 (UTC)

I plan to make a medical genetics wikiproject. I have 2 exams now, and then I start to work on it. Just give me one week. :) NCurse work 06:44, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

Ok, maybe it should consist of medical genetics, clinical genetics, genetics disorders. NCurse work 13:35, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

Great!  I'll put it off, and contribute when you get started with the project. TedTalk/ 15:31, 1 July 2006 (UTC)

I think medical genetics idea is a good one. When I return from vacation (currently in a cafe in Moscow!) I am planning on starting a portal for pediatrics.

Attachment therapy / Dyadic developmental psychotherapy
NEW TOPIC (sorry, i don't know how to do this exactly)   Can anyone provide help on psychiatric/psychological topics where there is considerable disagreement and an ongoing wrangle about the meaning of evidence-based treatment? I refer to Attachment Therapy and to Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy. A look at the histories of these topics will show intense disagreement and periodic POV claims when contradiction of certain contributors occurs. Attachment Therapy (use caps for both words) is especially sensitive because associated practices have been connected with child deaths and injuries. Thank you-- we have a mediator who is doing his best, but this requires specialized knowledge. Jean Mercer 15:57, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

However, there is substantial disagreement between several editors and one editor about the usefulness of this page and what material to include as one contributor appeares to be speaking for a specific group (is a leader and spokesperson for that group: Advocates for Children in Therapy.  Jean Mercer engaged in behavior that was self-promoting (putting her own reference in the listing).  RalphLender 17:43, 19 July 2006 (UTC)
The only disagreement about Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy is that created by Mercer...and some by her colleague and fellow leader of Advocates for Children in Therapy, Sarner, who was banned from the Barrett article and &quot;soft-banned&quot; from the Bowlby article.  We see the same conflict now being repeated on the attachment therapy page and maybe moving to other pages. Your intervention would be helpful.  RalphLender 17:43, 19 July 2006 (UTC)

Lancet citations in Wikipedia

Is there any consensus concerning citations to The Lancet, pre-1990?  The original volume numbers were non-standard, and Lancet retroactively changed them in 1990.  Specifically, which of these should be used (or, should a different format be used)?

Thanks. TedTalk/ 17:20, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

The fuller the information on the citation source the better, so using the template:cite journal as you have idealy have full date and volume number. However forcing date links is, I feel unnecessary with date=21 September 1974 is not ideal - either define date correctly using ISO yyyy-mm-dd or split as year and month parameters (later can take day after the month). I would tend favour the current volume numbering, as that is what current readers will search for or, if they have access to the Lancet site, read directly, so

 Either:

David Ruben  Talk  21:51, 21 July 2006 (UTC)

And is there a consensus about putting a wikilink in a reference to the (well known) journal? 
e.g. this one: Fox IJ, Roy Chowdhury J, Kaufman SS, Goertzen TC, Roy Chowdhury N, Warkentin PI, Dorko K, Sauter BV, Strom SC. Treatment of the Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I with hepatocyte transplantation. N Engl J Med 1998; 338: 1422-1426. 
--Steven Fruitsmaak | Talk 12:39, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

One of my concerns is that PubMed uses the old volume numbering system.  As of right now, some of the Lancet references in Down syndrome use the PubMed listing, and some use the ScienceDirect listing (new Lancet volumes).  As for wikilinks, I probably should have included that. TedTalk/ 15:01, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

Regarding wikilinks, I normally include them if the journal or reference book has a Wikipedia article (see my current project, Drug-eluting stent). — Knowledge Seeker দ 19:43, 22 July 2006 (UTC)

Pseudoscience

Please be aware that there is a lot of activity on WP with regards to POV-pushing about quackery, pseudoscience, and the like.  is set up to watch over pseudoscience articles in general, but does not function as a clearing-house for disputes; these would be best taken here. Recent controversies include something about the dental amalgam controversy, and some (I believe baseless) accusations that orthomolecular medicine is pseudoscience. Please help keep WP balanced by keeping an eye out on these and other related topics that draw attention from the &quot;fringe&quot; and &quot;out there&quot; crowds. In the case of orthomolecular medicine, we seem to be dealing with an overzelous debunker who seems to be more quacky than the purported quacks he is fighting off. linas 15:14, 10 August 2006 (UTC)

Plea for help: Orthomolecular medicine

The article on Orthomolecular medicine is currently embroiled in a very verbose, very contentious edit war. A helping hand from rational clear thinkers is needed. Caution: I am finding that a band of kooks and cranks are now attacking me on my own talk page; so getting involved may be hazardous for your nerves.  linas 15:32, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

I have a look. NCurse  work 15:36, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

As one of the supposed &quot;kooks and cranks&quot; Linas is complaining about, let me state for the record that I would be very happy if knowledgeable medical personnel assist in editing [[orthomolecular medicine|], which until last week, had been entirely under the control of fervent alternative-medicine supporters.  The problem on Linas's talk page came when he burst onto the page and threatened a bunch of skeptics with &quot;bans and blocks&quot; because he disagreed with their edits citing mainstream medical sources.   I hope he and  patch up their differences, because the two should really be on the same side on most issues if Linas is really a rational skeptic. I certainly consider myself one, and I'm really befuddled why Linas is taking the topsy-turvy position that I'm on the side of kooks and cranks.  -- Cri du canard 23:22, 12 August 2006 (UTC)

Baldness treatments

Hi everyone, Baldness treatments needs a lot of peer review in its current state. It's near impossible for any lay person such as myself to tell the self-promotional cranks from the real experts and the genuine treatments (especially non-FDA approved one) from the snake oil you'd find in your spam box. One particularly ongoing concern is } (talk • ) who is Dr. Peter H. Proctor. Proctor is linking to scans of academic papers on his own website (www.drproctor.com) as well summaries of his approved patents in this article. I honestly can't tell if he is indeed an  who can rightfully and impartially cite his own research. } (talk • ) is engaged in a slow revert war with him right now and some impartial reviewers would be gladly appreciated. --   Netsnipe  (Talk)  17:27, 19 August 2006 (UTC)

Likely,  no expert will touch this page.    They will look at the discussion page and steer off. The problem is a common one on Wikipedia in technical areas with any hint of controversy.  Anybody who knows a technical field well enough to make valid comments is likely to have &quot;Conflicts&quot; and &quot;opinions&quot;,  as do I.  Scientific publications resolve this problem by requiring disclosure.  But it just ain't worth it here.   Rather than continue to engage in the usual and customary fights,  I have just steered off,  even in the arms-length way that is allowed for experts and that I have rigorously followed,  just giving cites to papers and patents,  etc.   So the section is just going to stay the way it is.  And yes,  it is full of factual errors, non-neutral POV's, and OR..
 
Incidentally,   though Wikipedia has very high page rank, as a practical matter a Wiki link out is of no value at all.  In theory,  it might help with Google ranking.  But Wikipedia has millions of out-going links from its 1.4 million pages.  This dilutes any transferred page rank to effectively zero. Pproctor 13:06, 28 September 2006 (UTC)

Seeking help regarding copyright of product label

One editor has claimed on  that the Mifeprex product label found on the [http://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/label/2005/020687s013lbl.pdf FDA site](PDF) is not copyrighted. I asked for further information and didn't get any, so I am coming here to see if anyone knows about the copyright status of these labels. It would make sense that if it was a government job, then the work would be in the public domain like most US government work. However, if Danco labs is the creator of the label, the copyright might be a stickier issue.

The plugin has two main modes of operation:
*Tagging talk pages, great for high-speed tagging
*Assessments mode, for reviewing articles (pictured)

As of the current version, WikiProjects with simple &quot;generic&quot; templates are supported by the plugin without the need for any special programatic support by me. I've had a look at your project's template and you seem to qualify.

For more information see:

Yes seems like a good idea, as long a you can still indicate on a common list that you only belong to, let's say, WP:preclinical.--Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 23:38, 1 October 2006 (UTC)

Great idea, but we must first ask all of the participants in the bigger list whether they want to join all the projects. NCurse  work 05:15, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

That's not necessary I think: you could put them in a column which indicates specific interests... It's just a whole lot easier to have a single directory on a single page, but that doesn't mean that someone needs to list himself/herself for every project I think. But you're right if we were just to throw everyone together. I also disagree with JFW: some people just work with one project, have one specific interest...--Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 20:36, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

Please merge the whole lot. These Wikiprojects have exactly the same aim. JFW | T@lk 19:59, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

A question that I've always had is whether the preclinical/clinical project division is actually needed. I'm not sure where the division originated, but it seems more reasonable to just collapse it into the general medicine and, if desired in the future, allow individual Wiki Projects on, say, histology in keeping with gastroenterology, genetics, and nephrology. I suspect that first year medical students are probably the only people interested in just preclinical medicine and, well, they typically enter the clinical years at some point! Everyone else can contribute to both. In any event, I vote that we merge everything into just  while we are discussing the issue! InvictaHOG 01:48, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

I think both projects are valuable, since some people are only interested in one thing, messages for one group aren't necessarily important for the others... I say we keep the projects.--Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 12:38, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

I don't know if the distinction is really useful either. Here's a short history of how it came to be: The original project was started by  and grew out of a group of editors working in his userspace (this was before my time). It was called &quot;Clinical medicine&quot; and it was the only medical project. Some time later,  discussed the need for preclinical medicine to have a place to collaborate as well, and set up the preclinical project. The discussions on this also gave me the idea to start the medicine collaboration, which I created at the same time. A little while later, I created the medicine project as kind of an umbrella group, mainly to rate articles and identify areas for improvement. It wasn't my intention at the time for it to take over the role of any other project, though recently it looks like it has greatly increased in scope. — Knowledge Seeker দ 05:14, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

The following are two options I had in mind. Both would give some indication as to what specific projects the various participants are interested in. (I imagine someone else could do a better job formatting the boxes.) Rather than a list of participants on the &quot;Participants&quot; section of the various pages, perhaps there could be an instruction for people to &quot;register&quot; or indicate interest on the main participant page (i.e. ). -AED 21:12, 2 October 2006 (UTC)

Option 1:




Option 2:




I prefer option 1, because that would also allow to list other Projects, like for example WikiProject Nephrology. Looks nice!--Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 12:38, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

Steven +1! NCurse  work 12:43, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

I've got new problems. Should we merge these members into one list? And how? In alphabetic order? And after that, maybe we should send them a message about the new place of the list. It's going to be an enormous job. What if a clinical medicine project member doesn't want to participate in the preclinical work? Is it our task to decide about it? NCurse  work 13:33, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

Yes I think it should be one list.
Alphabetical is a good idea (is there an alternative?).
I would just put a message on the location of the previous list that the list has moved. Or the list could be transcluded on subprojects, or we could put a redirect.
If someone has only listed him-/herself in one project, then we should only list them in that project, like AED has done in the example above. Later on, the participants can change over themselves if they want.--Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 15:20, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

I'm OK with all of this. Perhaps there should also be something (i.e. bold or footnotes) to indicate which editors are administrators and which are the Projects moderators. -AED 17:14, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

My alternative solution: we create a new list (option 1 above), and leave a message for every editor on these lists whether they want to list themselves or not. NCurse  work 15:31, 3 October 2006 (UTC)
That would be a good way to weed out who is active and who is not. Another idea is to put everyone into the list, then leave a message asking if they would like to be removed.-AED 17:14, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

It'd be the more complicated solution. In my opinion, leave a message for everyone with the exact place of the new list and then they can decide themselves. The admin-moderator column is a good idea. NCurse  work 17:20, 3 October 2006 (UTC)
In looking over the various participants lists, I see a lot of names of people who haven't contributed to Wikipedia in quite some time. Should there be a guideline stating that inactive Wikipedians may be removed from the list (or have a line drawn through their name after 3 or 6 months? -AED 05:05, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

Maybe we could talk about it here: [irc://irc.freenode.net/wikipedia-science#wikipedia-science]. I'll be there from now, if you have time. NCurse  work 17:24, 3 October 2006 (UTC)

Merging sounds like a good idea, as long as I get to remain first on the list. (Hey, creating both the  and the  should count for something, right?) — Knowledge Seeker দ 05:04, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

I'm just kidding, by the way. That's just bad KS humor. Alphabetical sounds fine. Though I'm going to have to change my username now. — Knowledge Seeker দ 05:07, 4 October 2006 (UTC)

Removing inactives is ok if they have been gone for more than a year or so IMO (call me conservative). 
Moderators: like who??? Admins is a good idea, maybe a column for specific roles; admin, portal maintainer, MCOTW-coordinator and god-knows-what.
I strongly oppose against contacting everyone again about listing them as participants: I add other people as project participants, because either you participate or not, there's no sense in not being listed (and after all this is a wiki). May I remind everyone that we have just contacted a lot of people about listing themselves as participants of WP:MED? I say just merge the lot, weed out long time inactives and put a notice on relevant pages that the lists have been merged. Be bold and don't waste time making countless User_talk-edits.--Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 14:56, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

 If we wish people to feel encouraged to sign themselves into the project(s) then the markup table needs be relatively easy. Option 1 has the more complex markup adding in links to the various projects. Also it is the most cluttered with everyones entry linking to , ,  - surely just linked column headings would suffice. So my preference is Option 2 (unless anyone cares to persuade me otherwise). 
 To help people insert themselves onto the list, it might help to provide a copy &amp; paste for newer users:David Ruben  Talk  18:33, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

It seems there is a consensus to combine the lists, so I'll probably start doing that shortly. I'll use Option 1, with the understanding that columns can be added to make it like Option 2 should that become the general preference. -AED 01:26, 9 October 2006 (UTC)

Overlap with Psychology WikiProject

I'm a part of the , and I'm trying to decide whether or not psychiatry-related issues should be included in our project. Even though psychiatry is a medical field, it overlaps quite a bit with the field of psychology. Most psychiatry articles (such as those related to mental illnesses) could easily fall under both categories, but I'm not sure whether or not articles specifically about psychiatry (such as the psychiatry article itself) should also be covered by our project. I would like to see what members of this project think about it. —Cswrye 17:53, 4 October 2006 (UTC)
I don't think that projects should be rigid or as well-defined. Obviously there's a great deal of overlap in real life with psychologists, psychiatrists, and general doctors all treating the same diseases - sometimes in much the same way. I certainly think that psychiatry is within the scope of , though there's not really an active psychiatrist/psychologist that I can think of working under the project. I think that, as long some members of Wikiproject Psychology feels compelled to address some psychiatric articles (even the article psychiatry itself), then by all means they should be supported by the project. Also, we should cross-post any articles which we feel might be of interest to each group (such as the schizophrenia and psychosis articles which are featured but under review).

I am not a project member (because I'm a layperson), but the Psychology Project has been so uninvolved in some of the overlapping articles as to be invisible.  It would be great if they would help out more, and help develop and maintain article to the guidelines at .  Sandy 19:15, 4 October 2006 (UTC)
I agree that there can be overlap among projects, so psychiatry articles can legitimately fall under both WikiProjects. Unless anyone objects, I'll go ahead and include them in the list of psychology articles. By including them in the project, maybe we can get more of the psychology people involved in them. —Cswrye 21:48, 4 October 2006 (UTC)
What/where is this list of psychology articles?  Sandy 21:54, 4 October 2006 (UTC)
You can find it at . —Cswrye 02:49, 5 October 2006 (UTC)
Thanks:  that's a troubled list.  Four of the top five don't meet current FA standards, and AS recently barely squeaked by FARC.  Those articles really could benefit from some sustained attention. Sandy 06:00, 5 October 2006 (UTC)

 announcement

Invitation to an excellent beginning: Announcing the birth of !! Its up and running as part of the medicine project! I hereby invite everybody interested in Vision and Eye care to contribute to the long awaited wikiproject on Ophthalmology. Many thanks to AED for getting this project page working and sorting out the details. For a start, we need a shortcut to point to this page. Here's a readymade  manual of style for starting Ophthalmology articles. For the past 4 months, I have been working to add articles, relevant info and clinical images to the current sections of Ophthalmology - am currently looking to get some more input and requests, so that we can get cracking - to get some really good articles, raise them to featured status and turn the project Ophthalmology into a resource which is one of the best in whole of Wikipedia! Cheers!!! EyeMD 05:33, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

Article rating

The  used our article rating system.

I make every step required just I need some support votes. :) NCurse  work 12:38, 16 October 2006 (UTC)

Please help me fixing that list. Categories that are coordinated by other wikiprojects must be removed. NCurs  work 18:09, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

I would gladly be of help, but please explain in some more detail what needs to be done.--Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 14:44, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

Ok. Our article rating page is old-fashioned, it is hard to use and maintain. I want this project to join to the assessment teamwork. That's why I asked a bot to tag every article our project works on with the unassessed template (WP:MEDGENP) so we'll know exactly which articles we have to rate. In that list you can see the whole medicine category-tree. We must choose categories and subcategories we want to work on. We can't include other medicine-related wikiprojects' categories. That's why we must choose the ones we need. NCurs  work 14:50, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

How to help? Just remove categories that are covered by other medicine-related projects. NCurs  work 14:51, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

And how do we know that? Some WP are very inactive...--Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 15:19, 24 October 2006 (UTC)

In my opinion, we should start with the sure categories. Don't care about the risky ones now, because Betacommand will help us anytime we need. So after the sure ones, we can ask him to finish up with the rest. So two options left: 
# removing the cats that are not our part
# creating a list for the sure ones

Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy

I've been involved in a very tedious debate at Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy. It makes claims concerning therapeutic efficacy and evidential basis using a very limited number of credible sources. The vast majority of the references are self-published books,  books published in publishing farms, or totally unrelated works. Moreover, members from the APSAC task-force on Attachment Therapy have very recently cast strong doubt on such assertions in Child Maltreatment. [http://cmx.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/11/4/381 http://cmx.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/11/4/381]. They even called for a noted proponent of the therapy to remove such claims from his website. The APSAC is a highly credible association as far as I can tell. 

Furthermore, claims such as these can be found spread across wikipedia in articles such as Child abuse. This form of therapy has about two peer-reviewed studies to its name (same researcher) and is practiced at about one clinic (associated to the researcher who published the studies). It is the same group of editors that have spread these assertions throughout the psychotherapy related articles. 

This is way out of my expertise and I was hoping that someone with more knowledge than I have could address these things. Thanks! shotwell 19:23, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

Project directory

Hello. The  has recently updated the .  This new directory includes a variety of categories and subcategories which will, with luck, potentially draw new members to the projects who are interested in those specific subjects. Please review the directory and make any changes to the entries for your project that you see fit. There is also a directory of portals, at , listing all the existing portals. Feel free to add any of them to the portals or comments section of your entries in the directory. The three columns regarding , , and  are included in the directory for both the use of the projects themselves and for that of others. Having such departments will allow a project to more quickly and easily identify its most important articles and its articles in greatest need of improvement. If you have not already done so, please consider whether your project would benefit from having departments which deal in these matters. It is my hope that all the changes to the directory can be finished by the first of next month. Please feel free to make any changes you see fit to the entries for your project before then. If you should have any questions regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact me. Thank you.  B2T2 00:11, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

MEDMOS proposal

The  is entering a critical stage: I'm informing people to visit the page, make corrections where possible, and then state there support or disagreements on the talk page, so we can see if there is consensus to turn this proposed guideline into a consensus-supported guideline.--Steven Fruitsmaak (Reply) 21:29, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

Proposed guideline
Please weigh in on this discussion: .  It is currently listed as a &quot;science&quot; &quot;guideline&quot;, without review of areas such as Medicine and biology.  Sandy (Talk) 17:49, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

Hi. I think Sandy's comment above could be construed to imply that there was an attempt to sneak the proposal by as a Wikipedia-wide guideline without consulting with other WikiProjects or the Wikipedia community as a whole. As the primary author of the proposal, I didn't ever mean to suggests – nor do I think I have suggested – that it is a guideline with the consensus of all Wikipedia. It was formulated by editors of the Mathematics and Physics WikiProjects after some recent discussions at  and . It has now been agreed upon by the editors of these projects. It was always my [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Mathematics&amp;diff=81872802&amp;oldid=81860122 my] [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Physics&amp;diff=81872765&amp;oldid=81850226 intent] to submit it to the other science WikiProjects, which is indeed why I named the proposal &quot;scientific citation guidelines.&quot;

In any case, your comments would be very welcome. In particular, the examples are very cosmology-centric, so if any of you can fix them up to make them a little more general, that would be much appreciated. –Joke 19:49, 26 October 2006 (UTC)

I'm sorry, Joke, I have never meant to imply any &quot;sneakiness&quot;, and I apologize if my concern has come across that way.  I am concerned that the title including &quot;guideline&quot; and &quot;science&quot; was used at , which implied broader consensus than currently exists in the *proposal* run by Math and Physics, but you didn't add the entry to CITE—I have never meant to imply any sneakiness.

Hello, I've just put my lung transplantation article online. I still need to learn how to properly cite references, and I intend to do that in the future.

Categorization project

Hi. I have no specific competence in medicine but I'm working on the backlog of uncategorized articles and I happened to notice that  is a bit of a mess. I think it would be a very worthwhile task for this project to create a good system of subcategories and clean all of this up. For instance, I wanted to categorize Myelophthisis. Hmmm... So where does this go? The best I could do is the top level category of diseases. If you see a finer cat for this one, please add it of course, but generally speaking I think it would be worthwhile to shoot for a &quot;no disease left-behind&quot; objective: the disease category would simply be the parent of finer categories and any article in it would just be waiting for a finer classification, like ,  or .

Policy dispute regarding primary sources and OR (requested comment)

Cross posted to ,  and . 
There is a dispute going on at . One user found primary sources, reliable journal articles, that said depo provera may do certain negative things. Another user is disputing this, citing original research. The argument, I guess, is that the 1st user is interpreting the source, and drawing conclusions not published anywhere else. The studies only dealt with rats (not humans), and there is nothing in the patient drug information (or any other way to verify the claims outside of the studies in question). The logic goes that making a connection that a study dealing with rats may effect the use of this drug in humans as a contraception is original research.  Furthermore, it may be pushing a POV that this drug is unsafe by mentioning these studies (that are not verified outside of the individual study, and not mentioned in patient drug information). I feel like I am repeating myself, sorry. The counter argument is that a) citing primary sources is a good thing b) the claims are cited and verifiable and reliable, fulfilling almost every wikipedia criteria for inclusion. So I guess there are two issues. Is using the information in this  manner original research? And is it giving undue weight to a minority view by citing obscure studies like this? Sorry if I am missing anything or misrepresenting a side. Please direct comments to . Thanks!--Andrew c 03:31, 3 November 2006 (UTC)
