 COI at mmunoglobulin M 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Immunoglobulin_M&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=795228348&amp;oldid=788791054 This series of edits] has mostly been made by ser|Marc Shulman, which also happens to be the name of an author of several sources added to this.

I'm not saying those are wrong/bad sources necessarily (the editor added 28 sources, with only 4 of them to his own work), Shulman does seem to be a rather prolific expert author in this field, but if someone could review them as appropriate and unbiased additions, that would be great. ser:Headbomb|Headbomb {ser talk:Headbomb|t · pecial:Contributions/Headbomb|c · P:PHYS|p · P:WBOOKS|b} 11:47, 19 August 2017 (UTC)

I had already left them a note, what's really needed is a review of the content in the article. If it's all good, great. If not, then some things might need to be updated. I know nothing of the field, so I couldn't even begin to have an opinion. ser:Headbomb|Headbomb {ser talk:Headbomb|t · pecial:Contributions/Headbomb|c · P:PHYS|p · P:WBOOKS|b} 23:01, 19 August 2017 (UTC)

 The article includes five references co-authored by M. J. Shulman. These references seem to be appropriately used. While P:SELFCITE is a potential source of conflict of interest, I don't think that applies here. Indeed I think we should encourage experts such as Shulman to edit these articles. 
 General comments about the article: copyediting is required to improve the flow of the text. The whole article needs to have its formatting/syntax improved. The &quot;Introduction&quot; needs to partially deleted to keep it specific to IgM. Several sections of the article are lacking references. ser:Axl|Axl ¤ ser talk:Axl|[Talk] 12:25, 21 August 2017 (UTC)
Like I said above, it was more of a concern for a potential issue than anything else. If the references are appropriately used (independent of Doc James' P:MEDRS concerns), I'm fine with removing the COI template and moving on. And yes, we definitely need experts like Shulman [who apparently doesn't unduly promote himself!]. ser:Headbomb|Headbomb {ser talk:Headbomb|t · pecial:Contributions/Headbomb|c · P:PHYS|p · P:WBOOKS|b} 14:01, 21 August 2017 (UTC)

The article is appropriately critical, leaving little-to-nothing in content that crosses the MEDRS line.

I added mention of FDA response back in 2001 to initial plans to market the product with unallowable claims. The products are so many, and the ingredients in them so many-many (and the science so flimsy) that I am loath to start introducing criticism of claims for individual products that are not mentioned in the article. Some of the products have 20-40 ingredients, perhaps a few in amounts that may justify a Structure:Function claim, the rest is such small amounts that in effect &quot;in-name-only.&quot; Potential consumers recognize ingredients, but do not understand the amounts are too low to be effective. Immoral, but not a regulatory issue unless claims specify those ingredients, or else claim that the combination is what is effective. ser:David notMD|David notMD (ser talk:David notMD|talk) 02:07, 23 August 2017 (UTC)

 ertraline: sigma agonist, antagonist, or what? 
I see the ertraline article has been added to Category:Sigma antagonists, yet we don't have any mention of this in the article. Given that this article was previously in Category:Sigma agonists (see [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sertraline&amp;diff=797262654&amp;oldid=797227933 this diff]), this is a non-trivial distinction.

It looks to my layman's eye like &quot;antagonist&quot; is perhaps more likely to be correct: see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2881105/ . However, this: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24508523 says only that sertraline &quot;may be&quot; an antagonist, and web searches show a lot of discussion on various non-P:MEDRS Internet fora as to whether it is one of the other. I have no medical knowledge whatsoever, so I'm not in a position to judge: it would be nice if someone with actual medical knowledge could review this article, and add some mention of it in the article itself, with a relevant cite. -- ser:The Anome|The Anome (ser talk:The Anome|talk) 23:35, 25 August 2017 (UTC)

There doesn't yet seem to be a MEDRS-level source answering this one way or the other.  However, policy regarding categories is a lot less well defined than the policy regarding article text.  If we view categories as search tools rather than as assertions of fact, it might make sense for the category to be there even if we can't justify putting the information in the article. ser:Looie496|Looie496 (ser talk:Looie496|talk) 14:26, 26 August 2017 (UTC)

 oreskin article 

Anyone interested in helping to watch rticle|Foreskin? I ask this because I know that ser:Sugarcube73|Sugarcube73 is interested in helping, but he often adds poor sources on this matter and on the matter of circumcision. See [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Foreskin&amp;diff=796681740&amp;oldid=795897576 this edit] that I [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Foreskin&amp;diff=796720970&amp;oldid=796681740 just reverted], for example. ser:Zad68|Zad68 used to analyze such edits by Sugarcube73 and [https://tools.wmflabs.org/sigma/usersearch.py?name=Zad68&amp;page=User_talk%3ASugarcube73&amp;server=enwiki&amp;max= try to advise him], but I don't think that Sugarcube73's sourcing has improved, at least by much. Zad68 has been missing in action since May 2016. And I do miss him.

Anyway, when reverting Sugarcube73 moments ago, I invited Sugarcube73 to discuss his sourcing here. ser:Flyer22 Reborn|Flyer22 Reborn (ser talk:Flyer22 Reborn|talk) 17:45, 22 August 2017 (UTC)

Hi Flyer22:

I thought the paper by Frisch et al was a very good paper. It was published in December 2016, so it is quite recent.  It reports on a very large scale study carried out in Denmark. It adds significant information about the protective function of the foreskin.

I wonder why you don't like it.

ser:Sugarcube73|Sugarcube73 (ser talk:Sugarcube73|talk) 20:36, 22 August 2017 (UTC)

Just from the quickest skim of the abstract (indeed, just from the quickest skim of the title) I can see that you're misrepresenting the source. It's explicitly a comparison of Muslim and non-Muslim populations in Denmark, not a study of circumcision per se—yes, it finds that Muslim populations display higher rates of meatal stenosis, but that could be down to different diet, sexual behavior etc. As I suspect you're well aware, in studies in countries like the US where the circumcized/non circumcized populations are more similar in cultural background, any differences drop drastically. ‑ ser:Iridescent|Iridescent 20:57, 22 August 2017 (UTC)
You need to do a bit more than a quick skim... It is a population wide study, and in the subset of native danes there is also a statistically significant increase in meatal stenosis. (5% of native danes are circumcised yet 44% of all cases of MS is in this 5%) In fact there is an increase in MS in all population groups, if you are circumcised. But i could be wrong, i'm no expert, and i only looked at this because the scientists are danish :)--ser:KimDabelsteinPetersen|Kim D. Petersen 10:26, 24 August 2017 (UTC)
Wouldn't use Frisch - an anti-circ campaigner. Best to stick to non-problematic sources. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 10:57, 24 August 2017 (UTC)
Erm? Since when is it acceptable to dismiss a source on the basis of who a researcher is, and what his or her views are? --ser:KimDabelsteinPetersen|Kim D. Petersen 13:48, 24 August 2017 (UTC)
If the source is known to be biased, if other MEDRS-compliant sources state so. See P:MEDRS. This is why we don't have Soviet psychiatry sources or Chinese acupuncture sources on WP. 
No comment on the validity of the source in question, I'm taking Alexbrn's word that this is mentioned in other sources. ser:CFCF|Carl Fredrikser talk:CFCF| talk 13:50, 24 August 2017 (UTC)
Well quite, Frisch has known beliefs[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/body/should-religious-circumcision-be-banned/]. What's ironic here is that the same POV-warriors who scream blue murder if a (pro-circumcision) Brian Morris source is used (to the degree that the circumcision articles have accommodated this, by swerving these sources in favour of others) they are all over Frisch sources. Frisch has published research laying the blame for many things at the door of circumcision, from ADD to Autism to sexual dysfunction. We need as editors to be very wary of what has been termed &quot;advocacy research&quot; and need to keep P:REDFLAG in mind. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 14:14, 24 August 2017 (UTC)
First let me state quite clearly: I have no bone/knowledge or whatever about this topic area at all! But if a paper written by a specific person is a P:REDFLAG no matter what the views are - then P:MEDRS has gone too far. Arguing the journals quality etc. is fair game - but the authors views expressed in public or elsewhere isn't. And that goes for pro and contra arguers.--ser:KimDabelsteinPetersen|Kim D. Petersen 14:24, 24 August 2017 (UTC)
P:REDFLAG is not part of P:MEDRS. But it is policy. But since the Frisch article is merely an &quot;investigation&quot; of two cohort studies it hardly rises to the level required by P:MEDRS in any case. (We really could do with an article on dvocacy research). ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 14:35, 24 August 2017 (UTC)
To translate this into other contexts - can we now dismiss papers on lectronic cigarettes because one or more of the authors have expressed advocacy arguments in newspapers? If you are going to say Yes, then i would oppose your view. If you say No, then please explain what the difference is. --ser:KimDabelsteinPetersen|Kim D. Petersen 14:42, 24 August 2017 (UTC)
There is no hard-and-fast rule since this level of source evaluation within the context of WP's wider goals is at the point were it's not possible to &quot;legislate clue&quot;. Remember Wikipedia's mission is to reflect &quot;accepted knowledge&quot;. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 14:48, 24 August 2017 (UTC)	
You have got to be kidding me! What use is journal peer-review, and the quality of it then? Impact factor etc etc. Lets just throw that in the bin - the author has &quot;views&quot;! --ser:KimDabelsteinPetersen|Kim D. Petersen 14:55, 24 August 2017 (UTC)
Of course there are many factors. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 15:04, 24 August 2017 (UTC)
You are dismissing a paper based upon two population based studies (with &gt;4 mio. participants), in (what so far) is a respected journal, based upon the author having been quoted in the media for having views on the topic. That seems to be it - that indicates POV, don't you think?  --ser:KimDabelsteinPetersen|Kim D. Petersen 15:09, 24 August 2017 (UTC)
&quot;Many factors&quot;. As it typical in cases like this we are looking at primary research in a low-impact journal from an advocate who has originated a lot of surprising research all pointing in one direction. It would be hard to think of a more problematic source for the attempted use. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 15:50, 24 August 2017 (UTC)
Finally you are talking journal instad of person. And you may also want to argue P:WEIGHT, relevance etc. All relevant factors - person is not. And btw. this result is not in any way surprising (look up our ircumcision article. You may btw. try to adhere to P:BLP by documenting that &quot;an advocate who has originated a lot of surprising research&quot;, since from everything i've read so far, just to research this, is that he is regarded highly in his field, despite his views. --ser:KimDabelsteinPetersen|Kim D.

cExcuse me? &quot;If the source is known to be biased&quot; is not based on who the authors are, but on the journal and the scientific response. That is what Peer-review is all about, removing methodological problems, personal biases etc. - isn't it?
Since when is &quot;The Surgeon&quot; (journal of the Royal Colleges of Surgeons of Edinburgh and Ireland)[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog?term=101168329] comparable to Russian and Chinese journals? Eh? Or have we come to the point where Russian or Chinese scientists are out of the picture as well? --ser:KimDabelsteinPetersen|Kim D. Petersen 14:21, 24 August 2017 (UTC)
This journal seems to have an impact factor that is equivalent to the typical academic journal for orthopedic surgery and dentistry.  That's not bad, even if it's lower than what editors who are accustomed to big-name journals might guess.  I believe that Doc James' rule of thumb is that anything above 1.0 is probably okay, and this clears that threshold. 
CFCF boldly added a section on Bias to MEDRS last year.  I'm not sure that it's the ideal approach (and someday, I will go fix the punctuation errors in it), because it can be claimed to support POV editing.  It also may not align with P:BIASED (the general guideline, which also applies to biased sources that are writing about medicine-related subjects).  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:37, 24 August 2017 (UTC)

Here's a quotation from the introduction of [http://www.thesurgeon.net/article/S1479-666X(16)30179-2/fulltext the paper in question]:
it is widely agreed that one of the more common late complications of circumcision is meatal stenosis, a pathological narrowing of the urethral opening. Indeed, as early as 1881, surgeon William M. Mastin reported that meatotomy to treat meatal stenosis was so common in Jewish males that “the operation had been designated by many of them as their “second circumcision”” and that, among Jewish males, a “marked narrowing is believed to exist in, at least, 95 per cent. of all cases”.4 Subsequent accounts confirmed the impression of a problem largely restricted to circumcised males.5, 6 In 1921, pediatrician Joseph Brennemann wrote that his “attention was drawn with increasing frequency to a peculiar lesion of the meatus urinarius occurring only in circumcised male children”. What he described was meatal ulceration and its likely sequel, meatal stenosis,6 whose symptoms may include painful urination, spraying or deflection of the urinary stream, urgency and frequency of the need to urinate, hematuria and enuresis.7
Contemporary research also supports the view that meatal stenosis is a frequent, if not the single most common, late-occurring (i.e., occurring months to years after the operation) complication of childhood circumcision.8, 9, 10, 11, 12 In 1984, the American Academy of Pediatrics wrote in a pamphlet with guidelines for parents with genitally intact boys: “The foreskin shields the glans; with circumcision this protection is lost. In such cases, the glans and especially the urinary opening (meatus) may become irritated or infected, causing ulcers, meatitis (inflammation of the meatus), and meatal stenosis (a narrowing of the urinary opening). Such problems virtually never occur in uncircumcized penises. The foreskin protects the glans throughout life”.13


So let's pretend that this particular source – despite coming from a reasonably average medical journal with normal peer-review processes – is somehow deficient for the actual claim (which is adding the four underlined words to this sentence:  &quot;The foreskin can protect the glans from ammonia and feces for infants in diapers, thereby preventing eatal stenosis&quot;).  It's citing a bunch of sources across two centuries about this.  eatal stenosis#Causes, incidence, and risk factors agrees with it.  Multiple medical textbooks make the connection between foreskin removal and meatal stenosis (e.g., [https://books.google.com/books?id=IKexq6xCRmIC&amp;pg=PA215&amp;q=diapers+circumcision], [https://books.google.com/books?id=dwr-pwmlsuMC&amp;pg=PA479] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=1B3mCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA162&amp;lpg=PA162&amp;dq=ammoniacal+meatitis] – note that &quot;ammoniacal meatitis&quot; is exactly the condition of &quot;the meatus has been irritated by ammonia in a wet diaper&quot;). 

From what I've read, this condition largely exists in circumcised males, and skipping circumcision would indeed prevent the most common cause of this condition.  This fact appears to be generally accepted knowledge, and I've seen no evidence that anyone even disputes the idea.  A decent (perhaps not ideal, but decent) source was produced for the claim.  Why are we even debating this?  Circumcision seems to have some medical benefits (fewer UTIs) and some medical harms (more meatal stenosis).  Meatal stenosis is even listed as a possible complication in ircumcision.  Surely Wikipedia is NOTCENSORED enough to mention this apparently undisputed fact in oreskin, even if that mention might possibly change some parent's mind about whether to choose an elective circumcision for their baby boy? 

And, you know, if you don't like this source, then maybe you'd like to swap in one or more of the others that say the same thing.  It wasn't hard to find them.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 19:14, 24 August 2017 (UTC)

I would use a better source. But my main issue with ser:Sugarcube73|Sugarcube73 is that he keeps pushing &quot;the foreskin is better&quot; POV on articles. Do review [https://tools.wmflabs.org/sigma/usersearch.py?name=Zad68&amp;page=User_talk%3ASugarcube73&amp;server=enwiki&amp;max= the number of warnings that Zad68 gave him]. Also see [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Foreskin&amp;diff=797095520&amp;oldid=797087359 this recent edit of his that I reverted]; he added the following: &quot;The prepuce is primary, erogenous tissue necessary for normal sexual function.&quot; This is contradicted by better sources in the Circumcision article. The foreksin is not necessary for &quot;normal sexual function.&quot; ser:Flyer22 Reborn|Flyer22 Reborn (ser talk:Flyer22 Reborn|talk) 23:19, 24 August 2017 (UTC)
Great.  Can I count on you to do that soon?  I'm kind of inclined to specify (and perhaps it's better in a separate sentence, instead of wedged in there) that the foreskin prevents ammoniacal meatitis, which can lead to meatal stenosis (because my impression is that it usually doesn't, especially if the inflammation is treated with steroid cream), but I trust you to find a couple of good sources and add what seems reasonable.
In general, I think that fighting POV pushing by blanking uncontested facts is not an effective strategy.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:51, 25 August 2017 (UTC)

The WHO has not made up their mind and they don't have any information or a clear opinion. They are still &quot;debating&quot;. Therefore, their publication is unsuitable as a reference for Wikipedia. It is offensive to include such a source in the article. It detracts from the article. 

On the other hand, the Nordic Association of Clinical Sexology professional association has made up its mind and has a very clear position. Furthermore, the Nordic position is supported by numerous other authorities, so the Nordic position is appropriately included in the article. I hope this is clear.

Time is moving on and more information is being produced so it is necessary to update articles form time to time.

 Are you a potential WikiFactMine collaborator? 

I spent three days on a stall at Wikimania not long ago, and have been updating the :Wikidata:WikiFactMine|WikiFactMine pages on Wikidata to give a quite full view of the project. It applies fact mining to recent open access papers downloaded from urope PubMed Central. Custom sets of search terms called &quot;dictionaries&quot; are used, and recently we have almost completely switched over to Wikidata and SPARQL queries to generate these dictionaries. This can give quite slick results in dictionary creation, though sometimes going over data is also required.

One significant outcome of my interactions in Montreal was the creation of dictionaries of ell lines and of accines. 

If you are interested in trying out our highly-parallel search technology, I'd be glad to help you. So far we have concentrated on plants, diseases and drugs.

Wikimed App - Light edition 
Hello all,

Just a quick note to announce that we released this morning a new version of the WIkimed App* called [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kiwix.kiwixcustomwikimedmini Wikimed Mini]. It basically complements the earlier app in that it is much smaller (136Mb vs. 1.2 Gb), and should therefore make it easier to download and store by users who need it most (50% of installs for the English version happen on the Indian subcontinent; for the French one, 80% are in Africa). But apart from this PSA I wanted to share the thinking that went behind the design of this particular app, as it may have some implications as to how you guys work on your articles.

There basically were three reasons for this &quot;mini&quot; version:
# As far as offline goes, size does matter. If you look at the 20+ main offline medical apps out there, you'll see that they all range in the 25-40Mb (the largest being 120Mb). Several of them have 1M+ downloads (150k for Wikimed EN), and even if I am no physician I'd say their content is rather minimal and that WP content is far better: yet people download the other, smaller apps rather than our gigantic, all-encompassing 1.2 Gb one;
# You may have heard that thing about File:Number_of_sections_opened_per_pageview_(m.Wikipedia,_Dec_1,_2015,_percentages).png|60% of mobile readers not going past the Lead section. We did too, and took the drastic step of removing everything below that -  basically keeping only the lead part and infobox. That saved us about 60%, down to 465 Mb;
# Then we looked at what was left and figured that infobox illustrations weren't that helpful: either because they look good but are sperger syndrome|not athology|very epatitis_C|informative, or because if they are in fact informative Kiwix limitations make it impossible to see more than a thumbnail. Don't get me wrong: the ability to see high-res images comes high on the list of requests, but a choice was to be made and that one was a low-hanging fruit. So we removed the illustations as well, and now we're down to 136 Mb, pretty much on target with a 90% smaller app.

So to sum things up: (1) the lead is the most important part of an article; (2) the infobox comes second; (3) users want useful diagrams and illustrations.

Last but not least, I want to thank you all for your work: it is heatwarming to see the comments we get, and testament to that good work is the fact that Wikimed is rated higher (4.7) and kept longer (25% uninstalls at D30) that most apps (4.2/80%, respectively on average). I'll keep you posted on how this new app takes off, but if you have any specific question, feel free to hit me up. ser:Stephane (Kiwix)|Stephane (Kiwix) (ser talk:Stephane (Kiwix)|talk) 14:25, 23 August 2017 (UTC)

* Agreed that increasingly accessibility is a good thing; I appreciate the tradeoffs. Inclusion of the lead provides further motivation to make those as accurate and well-balanced as possible. The best writing (and reading) is succinct, but it's also highly subject to POV-pushing so we'll have to be careful. If we get more eyes, I hope we'll get better content. — ser:soupvector|soupvector (ser_talk:soupvector|talk) 14:01, 25 August 2017 (UTC)
I agree with |Jytdog especially since hiding and not defining the refs in the first section of a med article is pretty standard. Also, the lack of side effects/allergies/over use of antibiotics describing a med is pretty concerning. And also know this, the shortened articles identified for translation into over 100 languages have the exact same problem. ser:Barbara (WVS)|Barbara (WVS) ser talk:Barbara (WVS)|✐ pecial:Emailuser/Barbara (WVS)|✉ 13:00, 26 August 2017 (UTC)

 MEDMOS question - effect on family/caregivers 
ile:VSD image.jpg|thumb|130 px|VSD image
So, a chunk of content was added to the ongenital heart defect article about effects on the parents and family.   I have moved it to Talk for now, but you can see it [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Congenital_heart_defect&amp;oldid=795712289#Caregiving_for_a_Child_with_CHD here].

This is not about the disease per se... is kind of a &quot;Society and culture&quot; thing... but the content is P:Biomedical information in my view as there is epidemiology about what the effects on the family are and about treatment of the family per se.  

Where should this kind of content go, in an article about a disease or condition? ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 07:15, 16 August 2017 (UTC)
per ikipedia:Manual of Style/Medicine-related articles#Diseases or disorders or syndromes I would agree...society and culture section...IMO(an alternate possibility is a 'subsection' of prognosis section as caregivers would be relevant in CHD)--ser:Ozzie10aaaa|Ozzie10aaaa (ser talk:Ozzie10aaaa|talk) 10:41, 16 August 2017 (UTC)
I think it depends upon the specific content.  &quot;You can't manage diabetes in a young child without active monitoring by family and caregivers&quot; belongs in Management.  &quot;Desperate parents waste whole fortunes on ineffective treatments for kids with autism&quot; probably belongs in Society and culture (but could also go in Treatment, if ineffective treatments are being discussed there).  &quot;Family support correlates with positive outcomes for people with alcoholism&quot; belongs in Prognosis.  
For some things, such as caregiver burnout in Alzheimer's, I think that content could reasonably be placed in several locations, and the main thing is to make sure that it's somewhere in the article (and probably infused throughout the article, in that example).  In a few cases, social/emotional factors (that's the individual's own ocial history (medicine) and emotional fallout, not societal factors) may need their own sections (e.g., schizophrenia, infertility, abuse, and any condition likely to provoke the process of djustment to disability).
I am concerned about relegating everything about family to Society and culture.  For some conditions, family and social support is a key factor in survival, and it wouldn't be appropriate to bury that in a section with popular culture references, laws, activism, and religious POVs.  It wouldn't be neutral to treat the parents of a child with a devastating congenital heart condition as if they were of no more relevance than an awareness advertisement.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:43, 16 August 2017 (UTC)

I hear that.  I brought this here because it is a real question - chronic disease in an individual does affect and is affected by  environment (eg family) a great deal and it seems to me that the literature is dealing with this kind of stuff more and more. (and with respect to affecting, the literature often deals with managing those effects)  I am unsure how we should handle this kind of content, generally.  This content is a good case study - children with congenital heart problems.  ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 23:53, 16 August 2017 (UTC)
Using this as a case study (I agree with you that it's likely to be a good one), the first paragraph makes me think:  Where do you put &quot;People freak out when they hear the 'C-word'&quot;?  I think I'd put &quot;Parents are frightened when they learn that their children have a potentially life-threatening heart condition&quot; in the same section as &quot;Patients are frightened when they learn that they have cancer&quot;.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 15:02, 18 August 2017 (UTC)

It's a bloody good question to ask, though, because it stirs up some of those language differences between nations. Thanks for asking me that:- it usefully challenged my thinking.  In the UK nowadays, when parents separate, they don't get &quot;custody&quot; of a child; the child is awarded &quot;residence&quot; with a parent.  The hildren Act 1989|relevant law doesn't talk about the child's best interests, but the &quot;welfare of the child&quot;.  I think that, as regards England and Wales, the content you're talking about would belong in elfare of the child (a redlink that urgently needs to go blue) or possibly in hild Arrangement Order.  Here in the UK most best interest decisions are along the lines of &quot;Now granny's dementia is getting worse, should we sell her house and put her in a nursing home?&quot;
I'm now inclining to the view that &quot;best interests&quot; might be the wrong title because although it's the language used in the sources, it's unhelpful to an international audience.

Custody is more than the child's place of residence.  Which parent gets to make legal decisions for the child (e.g., to sign a form releasing a sports organization from all claims in case of injury)?  Which parent gets to decide which school the child attends?  Joint egal custody is common in much of the US, but I don't think that it's universal anywhere (e.g., if one parent is abusive, imprisoned, missing, or incapacitated).

 Failed merger proposals 

I have been looking at merger proposals recently and I made a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:CV9933/sandbox list] of merger proposals that come under the scope of WikiProject medicine. I then looked at all the proposals and tried to determine if consensus was reached. Guidlines state that a merge tag should be placed on the source and destination page and also a merge proposal discussion should be started on  only one of the talk pages to prevent having two separate discussions. You can see many articles where I found that the procedure wasn't observed correctly. I think it would be a good idea for me to de-list (detag) as appropriate since many of these are stale anyway, but others might have different suggestions to make about that. Notice the proposals where there was support but didn't get merged, most likely because there are several thousand articles in general, waiting to be merged. Quite a few articles didn't generate any discussion; I have been guilty myself of making minor edits to articles whilst turning a blind eye to the merge banner. At a minimum it would be good if we could have some kind of buddy check to ensure a merge proposal was made correctly, although it would appear to me that one should propose a merge only if they are prepared to carry it out themselves. ser:CV9933|CV9933 (ser talk:CV9933|talk) 09:58, 16 August 2017 (UTC)

ser:CV9933|CV9933, the main reason why merge proposals hang around forever is because we don't have enough editors who like organizing/curating content this way.  The exact process is relatively unimportant, because everything done during a merge can be undone just like any other edit.  
Please, if you're interested in this, please go through the ones that were tagged more than a few months ago, and either remove the tags (if nobody's particularly interested in the merge and you personally don't think it's a good idea), or merge the articles yourself (if nobody's particularly opposed to the merge and you personally support it – just follow the steps at P:MERGETEXT).  Feel free to skip the ones that you don't have an opinion about.

This is interesting to me because I often find enough sourcing for a separate article based upon the content in an existing article. Usually I can turn four sentences into a brand new article that has enough references to stand on its own. I suppose this could be regarded as the 'opposite' of a merge since there is more information on a topic in the new article than can fit into the paragraph of an existing article. Another editing activity I engage in is to fill out a redirect to a full fledged article on the actual topic of the redirect. Frankly, there are probably not enough editors to even become involved in merge discussions. Besides, I have had the content removed and merged into existing articles with no notification to me as the article creator, no discussion and no consensus many times. I guess that is being bold on the part of the editor doing the merging.

If you think that a tagged article shouldn't be merged, and nobody's commented after a reasonable time, then please take the tags off.  Even if you don't have time to adding the sources and expand it, just getting it off the list of potential merges is an improvement.

Someone who knows more about cardiac medicine than me needs to go through pecial:WhatLinksHere/Retained blood syndrome and see which, if any, of the redlinks should be deleted outright and which should be replaced with something else. ‑ ser:Iridescent|Iridescent 19:03, 30 August 2017 (UTC)

@ser:Jytdog|Jytdog, pecial:WhatLinksHere and pecial:LinkSearch are always quite handy when it comes to catching spammers—the more intelligent PR agencies don't create an article on their client directly, but instead create a bunch of redlinks and citations to the client, to give the appearance that there's a strong demand for an article on their client and thus someone else will create the Wikipedia article after which they can insert their puffery. It's a slower process, but one in which the spam is much more likely to stick as the article will show up in logs as having been created by an established and neutral Wikipedia editor and thus won't be flagged to new page patrol. If you know the name of the client, it's always worth doing a straightforward Wikipedia search on the client's name to see if someone is systematically slipping it in as a citation on multiple articles to try to make it appear that the person in question is a notable and much-cited author ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Search&amp;limit=500&amp;offset=0&amp;profile=default&amp;search=Andy+Mabbett this] is something of a low blow but is nonetheless a good example of the process in action). ‑ ser:Iridescent|Iridescent 10:11, 31 August 2017 (UTC)

Assessing readability of articles?

I had this question on Teahouse in March and in August but am copying it here in case people from WikiProject Medicine have some additional thoughts to add? Are you assessing articles based on readability, too? I am currently doing it for the Top-100 articles on sanitation topics and the results are very poor, meaning the articles are very very difficult to read &amp; comprehend!

I'm copying below a question by ser:PlanetCare and answer from the archive (from 22 March) as I don't think it was discussed sufficiently yet (I will put a new answer at the end):

I've been using &quot;copy and paste&quot; to put text into an MSW doc, and then doing the readability test from there.  This can't go on!......there must be a way to do a check inside Wikipedia.  Help. and Thank You.ser:PlanetCare|PlanetCare (ser talk:PlanetCare|talk) 00:39, 22 March 2017 (UTC)
Hi, |PlanetCare. Are you referring to eadability test|this sort of readability test? I'm afraid I can't find any evidence of on-Wikipedia readability tests. There was a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_(proposals)/Archive_18#Suggestion:_readability_test.28s.29_for_Wikipedia_articles proposal in 2008] where a bunch of editors said it was a good idea but apparently no one ever did anything about it. Sorry, but it looks like there is no way to do such a check in Wikipedia right now. ser:Howicus|Howicus ser talk:Howicus|(Did I mess up?) 01:02, 22 March 2017 (UTC)
Oh, there is a tool I found [https://tools.wmflabs.org/wikipedia-readability/ here], not on Wikipedia but Wikipedia-related, which gives the readability of all pages in a given category (up to 50). There's a similar tool [https://tools.wmflabs.org/most-readable-pages/ here]. But that's maybe less convenient still since you can't just copy-paste the article text. ser:Howicus|Howicus ser talk:Howicus|(Did I mess up?) 01:06, 22 March 2017 (UTC)

The tool for assessing 50 pages all at once is worth something.  but it's not the kind of specific tool that will &quot;drive action.&quot;  I want to be able to show my co-writers that if they pay attention to readability they can actually influence the score, and increase the chances that people will understand what they have to say.

Any chance of restarting the conversation, to see if we can get a better tool inside of wikipedia?   I'm very new to wikipedia and have been working on sanitation related pages in the lead up to World Water Day. ser:PlanetCare|PlanetCare (ser talk:PlanetCare|talk) 01:49, 22 March 2017 (UTC)

I have found this tool which calculates automated Flesch scores for readability:
http://www.readabilityofwikipedia.com/
Any good?

Secondly I came across an old project page from 2012 which provided metrics to assess readability and other quality parameters of Wikipedia articles manually: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Ambassadors/Research/Article_quality#Metric (I also wrote on the talk page there).

However this doesn't solve your desire to have an automated readability assessment tool. - Does anyone else know anything in that respect, other than the replies given so far? From our experience with ikipedia:WikiProject_Sanitation|WikiProject Sanitation, the readability score of many Wikipedia articles is quite low (meaning the articles are difficult to read and understand). This means we are potentially not reaching a huge number of people who are less educated and unwilling to read through a cumbersome, complicated Wikipedia article (or those who are not native English speakers).  ser:Doc James, has WikiProject Medicine looked at assessment tools to quickly assess readability scores of its articles? ser:EMsmile|EMsmile (ser talk:EMsmile|talk) 08:36, 14 August 2017 (UTC) ser:EMsmile|EMsmile (ser talk:EMsmile|talk) 21:32, 30 August 2017 (UTC)
If the Babbletics was under an open license we could maybe integrate it as a gadget. Otherwise it could be added as an add on maybe? Would be cool to have a tool that color coded text based on difficulty to help guide editors.
Tech support is super hard to find for creating tool though :-( I have a bunch of projects I need but am unable to find tech support for. There are a number of places one can post project proposals that are looking for programmers. ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk · pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 06:32, 31 August 2017 (UTC)

 That's because you never ask me. Most readability tests work on formulas relating to two metrics: average syllables per word and average words per sentence. It's relatively easy to find the number of words and the number of sentences in a block of text, but the number of syllables is a tad harder. [https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/47322/how-to-count-the-syllables-in-a-word Stack Exchange has some algorithms] as does [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9096228/counting-syllables-in-a-word Stack Overflow]. I think that the most important text to determine readability for would be the lead, which in html is all of the paragraphs between the opening div and the first h2 tag. I'm not sure what language would be best to use - probably php has the easiest way to access to the text of our articles, but I suppose you really want something in JavaScript that could work inside a gadget? --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 15:43, 31 August 2017 (UTC)
When I was at RUK they were intensely interested in this, and their writers for the general public somewhat horrified by our readability levels. Letters per word is a reasonable proxy or alternative for syllables per word.  If you want to know what medical text with a good readibility score looks like (and fully SEO-d), look no further than NHS Choices or CRUK pages for the public - at least one of these was written to a reading age of 12. Or some of the American etc equivalents.  But they typically take a very long time (and often many different rather short pages) to get round to the unavoidable long words which people need to be aware of (if only because their doctor is likely to use them), and which completely sink the readability score.  My (sadly unpublished) research with adult general public subjects doing online research on a health topic suggested many preferred a quicker run-in to the hard stuff, and also that they liked to sample a number of sites.  I agree we should concentrate on a comprehensive lead with a reasonable readability score, which is already in our guidelines, and is hard enough to do. Shortening sentence length by simple rewriting, or just splitting, is often relatively easy to do, and we should be sure to quickly explain important terms, even if linked. ser:Johnbod|Johnbod (ser talk:Johnbod|talk) 16:12, 31 August 2017 (UTC)
The two metrics may be convenient and relatively easy to automate, but they don't tell you everything. One word which is completely unfamiliar will make the sentence more difficult to understand than several familiar polysyllabic words, even if the unfamiliar word has only one syllable. Hooray for links. • • • ser:Pbsouthwood|Peter (Southwood) ser talk:Pbsouthwood|(talk): 16:59, 31 August 2017 (UTC)

 Thanks for this very interesting feedback, everyone! eply to|PlanetCare And I like your idea, ser:Doc James to have a tool that highlights the difficult sentences in colour. This tool gives the overall score and basis stats (like % of Wikipedia articles that are harder to read than this one):  http://www.readabilityofwikipedia.com/ It is based on the lesch–Kincaid readability tests|Flesch readability score and you can also analyse just the lead on its own. I am not sure how it determines syllable numbers though. And it's for free which is good. I have contacted the person at Babbletics who is listed under &quot;about&quot; but no response yet. The second person was a PhD student who did his thesis on &quot;Trust in online information&quot; in 2013 using Wikipedia as a case study. Available [https://ris.utwente.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/6061925 here]. Readability was one parameter that was determining trust in online information. - I am totally admiring what the people behind WikiProject Medicine have achieved so far, by the way.

ser:RexxS would love to see a gadget that would highlight the sentences of the lead based on your two rules. I try to structure articles so that the lead is easier to read and allow the body of the article to be more complicated. Would it be possible to look at the frequency specific words are used in the EN language? Maybe use google books? This could be a proxy for how common and thus understandable a word is. ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk · pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 08:58, 1 September 2017 (UTC)
I've used http://hemingwayapp.com (free for desktop web, at least; I don't know about the downloadable app).  It highlights long and complex sentences, assive voice verbs, and adverbs (which are often, but not always, unnecessary).  It also provides some statistics and a grade-level reading score.  
Something I think is important is that it doesn't choke on jargon.  It highlights specific words that could be replaced by shorter words (try &quot;use&quot; instead of &quot;utilize&quot;), but it accepts the simple sentence, &quot;Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is the most common form of blood cancer&quot; without complaint, and gives it a Grade 9 rating.  It accepts the slightly more accurate, but still simple, sentence &quot;Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is the most common form of hematological malignancy&quot; without complaint, and gives it a Grade 14 rating.
If you want to try it, then just copy your text, go to the website, and paste it into the middle of their webpage (as if to replace the description/instructions there).  (Maybe it would be possible to create a user script that essentially automates the copying and pasting step?)  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 15:21, 1 September 2017 (UTC)

One approach might be to focus on improving articles which have been rated as &quot;Top&quot; or &quot;High&quot; importance but relatively low quality (&quot;Stub&quot;, &quot;Start&quot; or &quot;C&quot; class) in the article categories to the right; i.e., the [https://tools.wmflabs.org/enwp10/cgi-bin/list2.fcgi?run=yes&amp;projecta=Medicine&amp;importance=Top-Class&amp;quality=C-Class top importance C-class articles], [https://tools.wmflabs.org/enwp10/cgi-bin/list2.fcgi?run=yes&amp;projecta=Medicine&amp;importance=High-Class&amp;quality=C-Class high importance C-class articles], [https://tools.wmflabs.org/enwp10/cgi-bin/list2.fcgi?run=yes&amp;projecta=Medicine&amp;importance=High-Class&amp;quality=Start-Class high importance start-class articles], and [https://tools.wmflabs.org/enwp10/cgi-bin/list2.fcgi?run=yes&amp;projecta=Medicine&amp;importance=High-Class&amp;quality=Stub-Class high importance stub-class articles], which encompasses roughly 600 articles. The disadvantage to this approach is some of these articles might be slightly mis-categorized (i.e., the importance rating is set too high).
Another approach to finding articles to work on improving is to look at popular medicine-related articles with low quality ratings.  P:TOPMED lists the top 5000 most popular articles that are associated with this Wikiproject; the C-class, start-class, and stub-class articles in that list need the most work (see the table legend on that page). ser:Seppi333|Seppi333 (ser Talk:Seppi333|Insert 2¢) 17:21, 4 September 2017 (UTC)

A P:WikiProject is a group of people.  If there's only one participant, then there is no WikiProject, regardless of whether someone created some pages for a (presumably) hoped-for group of people to use in the future.
The average lifespan of newly created WikiProjects is very short.  This page wasn't created by a newbie, so it might do somewhat better than average, I doubt that anyone really needs to worry about it becoming a magnet for, well, anything.  If there are a few people who are keeping up with their watchlists at the moment, it'd be kind of you to put this (and all of our neglected task forces) on your watchlist, in case someone asks questions there. 
(Editors could have a nice friendly argument over whether it'd be more appropriate as a task force of P:ALTMED or here, but since it's just not important, it's probably better to leave the pages alone.)  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 05:25, 2 September 2017 (UTC)
 Was just linked to this discussion by PaleoNeonate's post on WP:Skepticism. I just made the project active today after trying to set it up the best I could. The reason I didn't make it a task force of WP:MED is because chiropractic isn't medicinal at all, so I figured it wouldn't fit in too nicely. I discussed the possibility of a WikiProject on this topic in the past with a few others who have displayed interest. Since opening up the project I've slowly been reaching out to them (which is how Paleo led me here!) so hopefully in the coming weeks it won't be my solitary name on the members list. (This is an open invitation if any of you would like to join as well!) The basis for the WikiProject is to maintain all chiropractic-related pages in an easy to manage location, and help combat biases seen in these pages. As I've gone through the pages I've seen just terrible writing and awfully biased statistics in favor of chiropractic on the many school pages, organization pages, etc. I also want to have a group who can flesh out the role of chiropractic in other articles on this site (i.e. Low back pain, Neck pain, etc). This I can't do myself as I'm the first to admit my naivete in all things chiropractic. What I do not want the project to become is a cesspool of group-think and pro-chiropractic bias. I don't want any page to become pro-chiro, just as much as I don't want any page to become anti-chiro. I just want the facts presented and supported as best they can.

Many claims of chiropractic are in the realm of P:Biomedical information and so in scope for this Project; it also sometimes comes up at P:FT/N.

Thanks for the link to WP:Biomedical info and WP:FT/N, i'll make sure to refer back to the frequently. While I share the understanding that WP:ALTMED is dead, I've never seen a task force become successful from an otherwise dead parent Wikiproject. Usually a task force relies on the greater WikiProject for support, but if that life-line is non-existent I don't see a point in being intrinsically tied to it. Keep in mind it's been less than a day since the Project opened, and while the other two projects I'm a part of boast large memberships, only 4-5 people are actively working on each, so I'm not too worried at this very early moment that we're too narrowly focused or that the interest is not there. ser:Semmendinger|SEMMENDINGER (ser talk:Semmendinger|talk) 13:37, 6 September 2017 (UTC)

I think that the base problem is something more broad than music therapy. There is a general concept of &quot;ecreational therapy&quot; or &quot;activity therapy&quot; in which a health care provider recommends a hobby and social activity as a medical treatment. Some examples are quine-assisted therapy, rt therapy, ibliotherapy, and orticultural therapy. These have no Wikipedia category and so someone would have to either find a source which lists these or do original research to categorize them together. Any of these can overlap with counseling, occupational therapy, or psychotherapy. Instead of trying to merge the music articles with each other, I think they all need to be connected to a core article which presents the common elements then the specific practices and research associated with each one can go in the individual articles. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 14:46, 23 August 2017 (UTC)

I don't think that's the best approach for an article like this.  How about finding a good source, reading it, and then figuring out how much of the stuff that's currently followed by a &quot;poor&quot; (by MEDRS's appropriate, but untraditional standards) source could be left in the article and replaced by the kind of source that we happen to prefer?
Blanking content that might be good just because the currently cited source isn't the kind we idealize often results in articles that are unbalanced, POVish, or incomplete.

I sort of agree with WAID on this point.  Music likely does have a clinical effect for certain conditions (even in healthy individuals, listening to music and auditory stimuli impacts cognitive functions and task performance), so the MEDRS non-compliant article refs should be replaced where possible.  Merging redundant content is the simplest approach to take at first.

Well, over half the sources -- but given the quality of the sources he appears in (Nature Reviews Microbiology, for example) I don't have any really serious concerns about the legitimacy of the article.  The main issue, as I see it, is that there is a bit too much reliance on primary sources. I expect that MID|28018352 and MID|28859312 could substitute for a number of the citations. ser:Looie496|Looie496 (ser talk:Looie496|talk) 13:24, 9 September 2017 (UTC)

Similarly, I'm a bit concerned that M.P. Jennings appears as a (usually senior) author on 13 out of 16 papers cited in that draft.  Of the three remaining papers, two don't use the term phasevarion in the body text. A quick [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?cmd=search&amp;term=Phasevarion PubMed search for phasevarion] only returns 17 total papers (published over the last 12 years); 14 of those were coauthored with Jennings.  (The two editors who wrote most of the draft also have usernames which strongly suggest that they are coauthors of a number of those papers, as well.)
Is the relative paucity of independent groups using this term because this is a minority choice of nomenclature for this concept, or perhaps because it's a small (but possibly important) part of a larger concept, or for some other reason?  Does this content perhaps belong in another article or under another title?  This kind of feels like a situation where this scientific concept (and associated nomenclature) needs to be placed in a larger context, with some additional secondary sources. ser:TenOfAllTrades|TenOfAllTrades(ser_talk:TenOfAllTrades|talk) 01:43, 11 September 2017 (UTC)

Frankly, I'd be embarrassed  to have my name on that paper given the abhorrently shitty quality of some of the sources they cited (study.com / amphetamines.com) ... lol.

 Therapeutic touch, reiki &amp; cancer 

From MID|27194823 we learn
alkquote|Based on the results of this review, an affirmation can be made regarding the use of therapeutic touch as a non-invasive intervention for improving the health status in patients with cancer. It also seems that this method can be used as a safe method in the management of physical function, pain, anxiety, and nausea in cancer patients. Training TT to those interested to the field can possibly be of great help in caring for cancer patients and reducing complications of the disease.
Again, this is arguably P:MEDRS; I say P:REDFLAG. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 06:25, 11 September 2017 (UTC)

It was [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reiki&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=800017954&amp;oldid=799912017 this]. I beginning to wonder whether we would benefit from a P:MEDFRINGE saying that while P:MEDRS guidance is useful for sources within mainstream medicine, for areas of P:FRINGE medicine where claims would overturn well-established precepts of basic science it does not mean sources can be used in contravention of P:PSCI and P:REDFLAG. (Even legitimate EBM is sometimes worthless because it does not always pre-qualify the thing-being-studied to see whether it's simply impossible: witness any number of homeopathy studies). ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 12:59, 11 September 2017 (UTC)
 It would be useful to have some statement that allowed editors to use common sense concerning violation of physical laws or other aspects of mainstream science. We ought to be able to reject out-of-hand a source that makes claims based on nonsense such as alkquote|1=&quot;Special theories underlying TT include Dora Kunz’s model of human energy fields, electromagnetism and quantum physics, interpersonal psychology, Martha Roger’s theory of human unity, (relying on quantum and whole system theory, and Eastern science and philosophy)&quot; (from mid:27194823). Even if that's asking too much, we ought to be able to treat a so-called &quot;literature review&quot; as garbage when it uses clear bias in its selection criteria - see [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4860206/ the full text at PMC] where we read alkquote|1=&quot;The number of 334 articles was found on the basis of the key words, of which 17 articles related to the clinical trial were examined in accordance with the objectives of the study. A total of 6 articles were in the final dataset ... Moreover, any trials with TT as part of their complex intervention, aimed at the development of methodologies for TT procedures without having any clinical outcomes, and those in which no data or statistical comparisons were reported, and healthy participants were also assessed, were excluded from the study.&quot; In other words, any of the 334 articles studied that didn't have positive outcomes were excluded! It's hardly surprising that if you remove over 300 studies that didn't show any effect, you might end up with 6 that apparently showed some effect. But to then base conclusions solely on those 6 is tantamount to academic fraud, IMHO. Should we be flagging &quot;Med Arch&quot; (Medical Archives, Journal of the Academy of Medical Sciences in Bosnia and Herzegovina) as a problematical publication, because I don't see much evidence of peer review or editorial oversight in that article. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 14:35, 11 September 2017 (UTC)
 We can and do use common sense to rule out such sources, but it seems to me to be happening increasingly (with the rise of &quot;fake news&quot; journal articles) and requiring the same Talk page argument pattern over and over. And then P:MEDRS is quoted back at us thus: this is a MEDLINE-indexed journal and we shouldn't be engaging in peer review (like assessing their selection criteria) should we? but be treating the conclusions of review articles as sacrosanct. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 14:43, 11 September 2017 (UTC)
 That's the point I wanted to make, |Alexbrn|Alex, and I'm sorry if I wasn't clear. We have agreed rules that stop sources that don't meet certain standards being used to promote fringe nonsense, but those aren't guaranteed to cover all of the garbage. And we can't do amateur analysis of sources because that would open up the good sources to similar review by the POV-pushers. The problem is that we really need an asymmetrical set of &quot;rules&quot; that favour mainstream science and medicine and create a much higher bar for obvious fringe. One might have thought that REDFLAG and FRINGE would be enough, but nobody working to keep our medical articles honest believes that they are enough alone.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2816237/ This] is a better review and I would suggest using it in the article. The biggest flaw in the article for me is that it is entirely plausible that &quot;therapeutic touch&quot; makes people feel better without the biofield stuff being true. Something like reiki can be quite pleasant. That's different from saying reiki works as reiki is meant to work. ser:Bondegezou|Bondegezou (ser talk:Bondegezou|talk) 15:08, 11 September 2017 (UTC)
 Of course, |Bondegezou and thank you for that review. It's clear that placebo often has a powerful effect; and we know that simply paying attention and being sympathetic to someone often makes them feel better. I'm pretty sure acupuncture relies on that, for example. But without double-blind trials where some participants get &quot;theraputic touch&quot; from a real person and others get the same &quot;touch&quot; from an inanimate object realistically masquerading as a human hand, we've no way of disproving the notion that the touch actually has an effect through some kind of magical &quot;energy field&quot; that people are supposed to have. The problem, as ever, is that nobody is going to take the time and effort to set up these kind of experiments, because no sane person is going to think them necessary, and the &quot;true-believers&quot; won't want to run the risk of having their beliefs shattered. How do we hope to fix that? --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 16:18, 11 September 2017 (UTC)
 This makes me wonder: would there be a way, or is there an existing initiative, to pressure medline into being more rigorous about what it indexes in the future?  Have some already addressed a possible corruption issue (if any)?  If this sounds irrelevant, I'm sorry, my field is computer science, not medicine or legal.

Yep.  Would be interesting if there was some semi-automated tool that could provide us with some kind of quality rating for a given article and the journal and its in. Enter a PMID and it would output whether the publisher or journal was on beall's list or that new one, what its IF is, who indexes it... for the article, what kind of article the journal classified it as, the pubmed classificaiton, and the number of citations or something...  Without that it is always going to take humans to judge source quality.

I think that ser:Bondegezou|Bondegezou is on the right track.  We need to acknowledge that people feel better when they encounter pleasant, harmless things like therapeutic touch.  (With cancer patients in particular, their families may be afraid to touch them (for fear of spreading germs), so this maybe doubly important.)  We don't have to say &quot;Therapeutic touch is scientifically proven to treat pain and anxiety&quot; to do that.  It would not be UNDUE to say something like &quot;Pleasant experiences, such as a gentle massage, can make people feel better.&quot;  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 02:47, 12 September 2017 (UTC)
