Two weeks ago, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Right_axis_deviation&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=750388690&amp;oldid=749490687 I deleted] an incorrect image from the article &quot;Right axis deviation&quot;. My edits were subsequently reverted by an anonymous IP editor and . I asked for further opinions [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine/Archive_90#Student_Editing_2.2C_Imperial_College_London here]. (Thank you, Ozzie10aaaa.) Dr sunflowers did not respond.

I asked for deletion at Wikimedia Commons, but the admin there ([https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User_talk:INeverCry INeverCry]) deleted the talk page rather than the file. I have pointed this out.

I would appreciate if someone fixes the problem on the page &quot;Right axis deviation&quot;.

;Biomarkers 
In the modern time, large amounts of biomarkers could be used in various neurological practices to provide better decision for patient prognosis or in prediction of treatment affects. Although future validation of these biomarkers is needed before utilizing them into standard clinical diagnose algorithms, the importance of personalized medicine will be considered significantly to achieve more effective, cheaper and better-tailored treatment for different neurological diseases in the future. In Parkinson’s disease, there is no validated diagnostic biomarker for PD yet. However, like Alzheimer’s disease, perspective biomarkers are such as dopamine metabolism, oxidative stress, α-synuclein, auto antibodies against α synuclein and inflammatory markers. The reliable results are obtained from studies of α synuclein, the major component of lewy bodies, and it can be found in saliva, serum, plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In addition, inflammatory markers such as higher level of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and soluble tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-1 are associated with PD or early onset of disease. More than 25 genetic factors have been reported to affect the risk factor for PD and the major risk factor is shown to be homozygous and heterozygous mutations of the glucocerebrosidase gene. For PD, one biomarker and a single measure are not efficient to provide useful information. The combination of different biomarkers with clinical relevant patient’s characteristics can be considered to offer better and integrated information on disease.


That was a small part of a much larger edit.  

The ref is ok as is its formatting, but the content is just oy. (I don't understand why people get dates of references wrong all the time; this one is just off by 6 months but i have been seeing decades-sized errors)

The Education Program's metrics seem to be all about quantity (e.g. [https://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/Education/About here]: &quot;In four years, more than 10,000 students, many of whom were women, have participated in the Wikipedia Education Program, adding 12 million words, the equivalent of 45,000 printed pages, to more than 10,000 Wikipedia articles in multiple languages.&quot;) 

I wonder if a productive conversation could be had with them about quality metrics, and re-thinking what they are doing somewhat to more closely manage student editing.  Jytdog (talk) 07:05, 5 December 2016 (UTC)

We can ask. , any thoughts on quality metrics? I helped out with  to try to help combat this situation (low-quality inputs). I became a Regional Ambassador, back when that existed. I have a hunch we still need to elevate some principles to a community guideline or policy to regulate the situation. Wikipedia assignments force students to become compensated editors (they are compensated to receive a grade). Why not create a policy that states no one is allowed to compel another person to edit live Wikipedia articles? Just as anyone is free to edit Wikipedia, shouldn't everyone be free to not to edit or create live Wikipedia entries? Instituting this philosophy (which in my mind already exists implicitly on the website) would leave students in sandboxes. I don't see a problem with assignments that teach students about Wikipedia and use sandboxes to do so. We could also state that student edits should only go live 1) when a professor is confident the work is of a professional quality (not easy for undergrads, I would say) 2) the student is doing so voluntarily, with all the expectations of a volunteer editor and without grade compensation, and 3) the professor and student are committed to work towards consensus on the content. Regarding the quality of student edits, I know  has studied it in the past. Any ideas on this, Mike? Hello, by the way. The way I see it is this: on one side, we have millions of dollars being thrown by the Stanton Foundation to employ people to promote this idea (student assignments). On the other hand, you have &quot;&quot;, which is disorganized, dealing with low-quality inputs. In the past, I spent a lot of my wiki-time trying to remedy the flaws I saw, by trying to engage professors directly. , you are experienced in devising policies or guidelines if I remember correctly. What do you think about my aforementioned policy proposal (in italics)? On a whole, the whole idea of compelling students to edit or create live Wikipedia articles seems, is at its core, an anti-Wikipedian thing to do; I'd like for us to find a solution. Biosthmors (talk) pls  me (i.e. {{}}) while signing a reply, thx 17:43, 5 December 2016 (UTC)
Hi, , long time no see.  I'm not too concerned about a class compelling a student to edit; a student doesn't have to take the class, after all, if they don't want to.  This seems no different to me than a student who avoids a class involving dissection because of personal preference.  And have we ever heard of a student complaining on this basis?
I haven't been involved with the WEF, or looked at quality of student edits, in a couple of years: I'll be interested in what Ian says, but I would think examples of bad edits are just as anecdotal as examples of good edits.  Certainly if it can be shown that student edits have a net detrimental effect that would be a concern.  For quantity metrics I think it's the same issue -- a large number of edits is a bad thing if they're bad edits, and a good thing if they're good edits.  So yes, we need metrics on overall quality.  I suspect we also need metrics on a per-class basis -- that is, are some professors likely to produce classes with high-quality edits, and others likely to generate poor edits?  We've certainly had at least a class or two that were disastrous, but I don't know how common that is among the hundreds of classes that have been run.  Mike Christie (talk -  -  library) 18:28, 5 December 2016 (UTC)

Broadly speaking as I understand it it the education program strongly discourages teachers from grading students on their actual edits.   fwiw i attempted a while ago to mention student editing in the COI guideline and that got shot down with fire.  See .   To be frank most of the opposes there were a) from people with axes to grind about COI generally and b) who didn't grasp the situation that students are put into (or feel that they are in; sometimes even when instructors make it clear that the grade doesn't depend on edits &quot;sticking&quot;, students still take it that way).   but this kind of derailment is very common in community discussions of COI guideline changes. 
 Going back to how students feel and the very obvious COI between their relationship to their school and their role as WP editors, see [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJessica_Kurf&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=753170708&amp;oldid=753109534 this note] from the student who added the above.  The COI is so clear there. 
But I intentionally didn't frame this as changing the behavior of students or instructors or trying to address anything by a community policy or guideline change.   I don't think that is productive. 
From a management perspective, we can try to change the metrics for the Education program and by changing them, change the behavior and rhetoric of WMF WEF employees who work in the progam and generate its marketing materials.  As I said above I feel that their goal is to get more and more instructors working with them.   I feel like every fall and spring a firehose turns on and I spend way too much of my time trying to deal with edits like the one above.  I feel exploited - structurally I am forced into the role of a TA.  (&quot;forced&quot; is strong language and I can unpack that if anybody doesn't understand it).  I don't want to be a TA.  I am not here to educate students about how to research and how to write. 
So I am saying - how do we incentivize the WMF WEF to spend its resources managing the output of students in the program, so the community doesn't have to?  I think that could be productive. Jytdog (talk) 18:49, 5 December 2016 (UTC) (redact Jytdog (talk) 21:28, 5 December 2016 (UTC))
Just to clarify: the WMF has nothing at all to do with the education program.  The Wiki Education Foundation was launched by the WMF but no longer has any organizational connection to it at all, as far as I know; it's an independent non-profit.  (I used to be a board member.)  To your point about that student edit, yes, that is a problem.  If a professor's grading scheme requires the student's material to stay in the article, that's unfair to both the student and to the WP community.  A rev link should be enough.  I'd be interested in the WEF's comments on this point. Mike Christie (talk -  -  library) 19:02, 5 December 2016 (UTC)
Thanks for clarifying; redacted above.  My points are a) that an organization is paying people and incentivizes them to act and talk in a certain way, which I believe promotes quantity not quality of the results and b) we (including students) would all be better off if those incentives addressed quality. Jytdog (talk) 21:28, 5 December 2016 (UTC)

 We are more interesting in quality than quantity; quantity is easier to measure and report, but we definitely prefer quality. To that end, we've done a lot to improve the training and editing resources we're giving to students. Of course the resources aren't any good if the students don't read them, so that's something we're working to improve. We're also working to try to teach instructors the best way to do things. Unfortunately, things fell apart a bit them semester when Adam had to take extended leave. 
My personal goal for next year is to look at the points where students go wrong - look at what the students who mess up do, and what the ones who do well do. The problems aren't (as much) in the courses that set out to work on medical content - the problem comes up when someone from a writing class decides to write about a disease. Guettarda/Ian (Wiki Ed) (talk) 21:12, 9 December 2016 (UTC)

  I appreciate the work that WEF does in helping education in the USA and Canada. Those of us who volunteer to help similar projects outside of those countries would benefit from good quality materials produced that were made available to everyone. It's worth noting that the WEF spent $3 million in 2015–16 and has one of its three programme focuses &quot;create educational material targeted at instructors and students to ensure best practices&quot;. If I had one criticism, it's that the WEF seems to have a system where a single missing individual has a large enough impact on programmes for it to be worth you commenting on. It's a shame that  has not had work done on it for some time (my comments on the some of the talk pages date back over two years) and students following that guidance – unlike those in USA and Canada who follow the [https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/training/students/wikipedia-essentials WEF training] – still have only a single paragraph to read at  and the peculiar interpretation of :  No wonder we get problems with new users and FRINGE. --RexxS (talk) 22:19, 9 December 2016 (UTC)

I am uninterested in criticism. I want structural change.  I have about had it dealing with students, who often work in s, who are almost always in a &quot;this is my homework leave me alone&quot; bubble, who try to force badly written, badly sourced, badly cited, UNDUE, unintegrated content into WP, to get a grade.   I want the WEF to change how it manages edits that it is bringing more and more into WP.    I am not a TA and i am tired of being forced to act like one - which I am,  between my obligation to not bite newbies and my commitment to quality content. 
As an example, maybe the WEF can hire and train more staff to review student drafts before they are added to articles.   And make sure that there are sufficient staff for each class and that those staff are actively managing the class output.  Those are all measurable things.   In other words, let the WEF act as a primary filter, managing the output of students. 
 I also want the materials used to promote more teachers entering the program, and that are used to train students, to change.  Concrete things - they should clarify the COI issues for students, require students to have edits reviewed by somebody who understands WP and and the subject matter before they are submitted, and emphasize the difficulty of some subject areas, and the maturity of the content in some articles. 
that's the kind of stuff i want. and i am owning that -- other people might not want this kind of stuff.  Jytdog (talk) 22:39, 9 December 2016 (UTC)

  You have valid concerns. If you have a chance to work through https://dashboard.wikiedu.org/training/students/editing-medical-topics (disclaimer: nothing that I've had any direct input to), do you think that getting more students and instructors to work through that would be a help to us in meeting your concerns? --RexxS (talk) 00:06, 10 December 2016 (UTC)
I've looked at the training material.  It has been worked on by WP:MED members and is ~OK~.   But in my view the training material should be strengthened as I mentioned above - explaining to students that even though it is homework, editing WP is nothing like doing homework, and that once they log in they must put the encyclopedia first and their grade second.   There is some good discussion about the difficulty of editing health topics and there is good discussion of the difficulty of improving GA and FA articles.  
But the structural changes as I described above are more important - WEF staff should review proposed edits before they even get to the encyclopedia and the community, coming here only if the proposed edits are OK with regard to policy/guidelines (including what they do to WEIGHT in the overall article) as well as basic writing.  This will increase the likelihood that students have a good experience and might come back, and protects WP and the community.  Everybody would win. Jytdog (talk) 01:03, 10 December 2016 (UTC)

Articles tagged with this this wikiproject's banner

You should follow the recommendations (to the best of your ability, using your best judgment, etc.) in MEDRS when you are writing about .  You should not follow those recommendations when you are writing about other things (e.g., who said what, where something is, when something happened, etc.).

It would be good to have stricter reference requirements more widely applied but as we all know we are all volunteers. As such application is somewhat uneven. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 22:08, 25 November 2016 (UTC)
To be a little clearer about the implied question:  Having  on the talk page is meaningless for this question.  The project supports all sorts of articles, including hundreds or thousands of biographies.  You shouldn't follow MEDRS for Leonardo da Vinci or Oxford University Medical School; you should follow  (and probably also take a look at the essay ) for those.  But you should follow MEDRS whenever you're writing about biomedical information, even if this project doesn't support that article.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 04:24, 26 November 2016 (UTC)
I have just added information to Thalidomide that I am sure is not  MEDRS. Let's see if it gets reverted like most of my edits are.  Ottawahitech (talk) 23:49, 27 November 2016 (UTC)
 Don't hold your breath waiting for a revert. Nobody is insisting on MEDRS sourcing for the fact that the Canadian government doesn't compensate every thalidomide victim. Your sourcea TV news programmeisn't exactly copper-bottom, but I doubt if anyone will challenge it in this case.

 It may be clear to you that my edit was not medical in nature, but it is a fine line sometimes, don’t you agree? BTW do you want to be pinged? Ottawahitech (talk) 15:35, 29 November 2016 (UTC)
 it is pretty clear - MEDRS applies to . MEDRS itself also defines its scope.  Jytdog (talk) 16:30, 29 November 2016 (UTC)
Actually, I think its very, very good for newer editors to ask these questions, to ask for clarification of what the fine points are. Doing so creates a faster learning curve and a better sense of how a community sees its own guides. Understanding of the finer points of MEDRS is critical, seems to me, in an encyclopedia  that may be seen  by readers as offering medical information.(Littleolive oil (talk) 17:51, 29 November 2016 (UTC))

Jytdog, please avoid personalized ad hominen attack phrases such as the above.  Focus on the content, please.  Montanabw(talk) 05:48, 30 November 2016 (UTC)
Montanabw, you missed a spot.   Jytdog (talk) 06:45, 30 November 2016 (UTC)
Thanks Jytdog. I said newer not new and let me explain what I meant by that. My comment was  general and referred to a tendency many of us have to tell someone to go and read rather than discussing the finer points of a policy or guideline.  I respect highly both Rexx and WhatamIdoing  to be  mature in their sense of how to apply policy and my cmt was meant to reflect that. I didn't check Ottawahitech's edit count; it wasn't important to me, but I do understand the confusion my last cmt may have created.(Littleolive oil (talk) 19:53, 29 November 2016 (UTC))
  To be fair, Ottawahitech's normal editing area is finance, and our requirements for sourcing in MEDRS do have a much stricter regimen, which can surprise even otherwise-experienced editors. From that point of view, they are new to our topic area and their initial query was understandable, if a little naive. I'd much rather someone who was unsure about MEDRS posted here for help first, than breach its guidance and end up being reverted. Wouldn't everyone agree? --RexxS (talk) 20:03, 29 November 2016 (UTC)
I would agree. I've seen way too many protracted arguments on MEDRS to feel that deeper understanding via collaboration with other editors with experience in an area is not a good thing.(Littleolive oil (talk) 20:13, 29 November 2016 (UTC))
I would agree completely.  This area is filed with landmines for the uninitiated. One need not be a newbie overall to be &quot;new&quot; to MEDRS and its written —and unwritten— rules. I am frequently concerned with the level of unkind, personalized attacks emitted by some members of this project over simple matters of debate.   I've had substantial (and often rather unpleasant) dealings with users in this area and am particularly concerned with the inappropriate rapidity with which some project members threaten others.   It feels like there is a level of burnout here.  On one hand, I respect the work folks do to combat fraudulent claims that could cost lives (i.e. debunking Laetrile and such). I also think it's right to expose true quackery and to point out with precision the nature and type of research or proofs available on a given topic. BUT there is, at times, an adamant refusal to assume good faith or to acknowledge that there are issues in the public eye that require analysis as opposed to outright dismissal.  I have often argued for things like  [https://ncse.com/evolution/education/teach-controversy this] and have been pretty frustrated by such suggestions for discussing issues being conflated with &quot;false equivalency&quot;.  I am also concerned when asking a simple question, as with  here, gets a person's head bit off.  Maybe we need a MEDRS teahouse or something, where users unfamiliar with this area can ask questions and have their mistakes explained without losing large chunks of flesh.  It would also be nice if folks here could learn to tell the difference between good faith users who are working toward the same goals of WP:V, RS, NPOV, and so on versus the trolls who are arguing for a flat earth or the purveyors of snake oil who are trying to promote their own talk show or something.  Montanabw(talk) 05:48, 30 November 2016 (UTC)
 The problem is,  that some of us are genuinely burning out because every way we look in the coverage of medicine on Wikipedia, there really is a Big Pharma shill, or a snake-oil salesman, or a True Believer™ who wants to get rid of all the sources they find inconvenient and substitute ones that affirm their business/sales pitch/crusade, no matter how poor the sources are. When you've spent all of your time swinging a hammer, every target looks like a nail. And I know I'm as guilty of that as anybody. The only therapy that works for me is to take a week or two off editing Wikipedia completely, and I guess I'm due for another wikibreak quite soon. Cheers --RexxS (talk) 18:13, 30 November 2016 (UTC)
Montanabw yes &quot;teach the controversy&quot; is .  We don't do that here.  I am sure the folks at Discovery Institute would love to have your help. And nobody bit off Ottawahitech's head. Jytdog (talk) 18:40, 30 November 2016 (UTC)

A contributory factor may be that  implicitly gives MEDRS defenders &quot;permission&quot; to deal harshly with editors percieved as violators. Roger (Dodger67) (talk) 18:40, 30 November 2016 (UTC)

I've harped on this before but will say it again. Health related articles whose content falls under MEDRS should be written, vetted by health professionals, and locked. The imagination boggles at the harm an article could do when not controlled and under the &quot;anyone can edit&quot; umbrella. Editors who are both neutral and have not lost perspective on their mission to protect the MEDRS articles and content are hard to find; as our load of articles in this area grows so does the work load, and we don't seem to bring on many new editors willing to wade into these areas. In that vein, I have seen editors who really want to do the right thing but are hounded off the site. We need to be working with and training people. An editor who agrees to be trained, to spend the time, is less likely to be an editor with a fast fix agenda. Training could be a simple as following a round another editor for a determined amount of time. We have brilliant scholars who with the of best intentions do  not understand the culture; we can't afford to lose them. We should be supporting them, helping them. And I agree, if civility only applies to those we agree with or like we are  and will be in trouble and our site will have a toxic, vitriolic tone. I know that in many cases its the civility, the sarcasm, and the nastiness that drives prospective, good editors away or that leads them to retaliate with behaviours that don't support the site mission. 

Its wise and mature to know when to take a break seems to me, and we all get to that point.(Littleolive oil (talk) 19:29, 30 November 2016 (UTC))

There are multiple issues here; one is copyright violation/ infringement which James, Jytdog and Rexx  rightly noted  and dealt with. Another is whether the source is reliable for the content it supports; Jytdog indicates it isn't because the article content is not referenced in the source . The third issues is whether the source is potentially reliable, and verifiable and per WhatamIdoing I believe it is as long as content added is directly supported by the source. This is the professional association for, &quot;professionals in audiology, speech–language pathology, and speech and hearing science, and to advocate for people with communication disabilities.&quot; as noted in our own article, and can be used as a source for basic information. Whether it is being used as spam is different than whether it is a spam site itself and improper use does not mean the source itself is  not usable.

 There's certainly nothing wrong with the ASHA site and it will be a reliable source for a lot of information. My concern was how it was being used in these cases. It's worth considering as well that in our striving for the best possible quality sources we sometimes don't provide the interested reader with as broad a variety of sources as we might. Sites like ASHA can often be more accessible to the lay reader than a scholarly journal, largely because they will have made an effort to reduce jargon. --RexxS (talk) 10:51, 3 December 2016 (UTC)

This is a good and important point. &quot;Sites like ASHA can often be more accessible to the lay reader than a scholarly journal, largely because they will have made an effort to reduce jargon.&quot; which assumes sources whether more scholarly or less are always reliable per content.

Splitting articles about endogenous molecules used as drugs

So we recently split testosterone, and there is a discussion at WT:PHARM about leads generally, where the issue of similar articles, like  like dopamine, insulin, norepinephrine, cortisol epinephrine, and oxytocin  was raised.  Shall we split all these two and any others?  I think we should do. Jytdog (talk) 21:46, 22 November 2016 (UTC) (redact Jytdog (talk) 23:35, 22 November 2016 (UTC))
* Dopamine, norepinephrine, insulin, and cortisol already contain separate pages for the medication.  If the leads of the other articles can't be revised to adequately reflect the biological aspects of these compounds in addition to the current information related to medical uses, then I think splitting them will be necessary.  Some of them probably don't really need to be split based upon their size though. Seppi333 (Insert 2¢) 22:05, 22 November 2016 (UTC)
*Not now We had a sloppy process, a sloppy discussion, and there are some unanswered questions. In the case of testosterone, the discussion happened at , , and . That is not okay. Discussions need to happen in one place. The split is tedious and makes it impossible to collect all the comments. When the testosterone split happened it influenced about 2000 links. The links in circulation are Testosterone (disambiguation), Testosterone (medication), and Testosterone (for the natural steroid). That's fine, but we need to establish a coherent rationale for determining the primary topic and that rationale needs to be backed with some data and consensus. We do not have that yet. I propose that before additional action is taken, someone draft a process for how this is supposed to work for the general case and why. It would be wise to use testosterone as a model and to go back to critics and get their buy in. This talk just happened in the past few weeks. This change applied to many articles will affect billions of pageview experiences in a given year, so this is a big deal that merits advance planning and discussion. I am ready to confirm that this is a worthy topic to consider and that I think if someone had a plan for the general case then that plan would attract thoughtful and constructive discussion.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 22:08, 22 November 2016 (UTC)
 The central discussion was at . This &quot;&quot; was not a discussion, but rather a link to the discussion.  , was not a discussion about if the split should take place, but a complaint about how the split was done that has subsequently been resolved. Boghog (talk) 05:27, 23 November 2016 (UTC)
You are correct that the discussion is not as I described but it is still a discussion that is related in some way, and part of the consequence of the proposal. There ought to be a cleaner more certain way to do this in the future. The process which is done should not trigger complaints anywhere.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 22:41, 23 November 2016 (UTC)
 It is highly unlikely that any process around here will be completely free of complaints ;-) Most of the complaints were about redirects. They were being cleaned up, but just not fast enough for some editors. Another compliant is why we needed to do this experiment in the first place when it was obvious from the very beginning what the primary topic was. So one reasonable conclusion from this experience is that we should not do further tests (because of all the unnecessary redirects that are generated), but rather decide what the primary topic is based on consensus. Finally many of these problems would go away if the there wasn't such a rigid adherence to .  For example, why is it impossible to first state that a substance is a natural hormone/neurotransmitter that is also used as a drug?  To state it is a drug that is also a hormone puts the cart before the horse.  Also why not put function before medical uses? This order will make it a lot easier for readers to understand why the hormone is used as a drug.  Boghog (talk) 15:46, 24 November 2016 (UTC)
Completely agree with this - in particular, the primacy of biology/physiology as a context for pharmacology, rather than the other way around. I was surprised by the precipitous split without consensus, but hope that was a learning experience. — soupvector (talk) 16:28, 24 November 2016 (UTC)
Well, I agree that the natural hormone should usually be mentioned before the drug, but I'm not sure about putting function before medical uses.  I'd rather use editorial judgment to decide what the average (e.g., person without a university degree in medicine or even science) reader will actually understand.  &quot; is a fleedle sprotz genamecowit that is used to treat &quot; is not the best we can do for these readers.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 20:08, 24 November 2016 (UTC)
 Primary male sex hormone ≠ fleedle sports genamecowit. I agree that editorial judgment and common sense should always apply. Boghog (talk) 20:20, 24 November 2016 (UTC)
In this example, and assuming that &quot;primary sex hormone in males&quot; is the alternative.  One could equally write that &quot;testosterone is the primary androgen receptor agonist in vertebrates&quot;, which is a more precise description of the function and has the additional benefit of not making the hormone seem like something that only males should have – but it wouldn't be either intelligible or relevant to normal people.  My !vote is for writing what normal people care about and can understand.  Function in simple words (e.g., &quot;Primary male sex hormone&quot;) = good.  Function in words that most people don't understand = bad.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 09:24, 25 November 2016 (UTC)
 Good point, testosterone has important physiological roles in females as well as males. Nevertheless due to the higher concentration of testosterone in males, testosterone has a more profound effect on males. The reverse is true for estrogen in females. Further complicating matters is that testosterone is a biosynthetic precursor of estrogen. Finally both testosterone and estrogen have effects above and beyond those mediated by nuclear androgen and estrogen receptors.  It is impossible to condense all these nuances in the lead paragraph. It is more practical to concentrate on the most important physiological roles in the lead paragraph and discuss the &quot;second order perturbations&quot; in the body of the article. Boghog (talk) 17:16, 25 November 2016 (UTC)
*I understand some of the reasons for splitting (different audiences), but am also against splitting such articles. Once in the circulation, epinephrine is the the same whether it arrived by intravenous injection or released from the adrenal medulla, and its actions on the body are the same. Medical uses and pharmacological modes of action are easily separated using subheadings, and the question of an appropriate lede should be able to be managed in a balanced way. There may be cases for splitting articles, and testosterone might be one because of the range of societal factors which influence its use and mis-use, but shouldn't create a precedent for other articles. Klbrain (talk) 22:14, 22 November 2016 (UTC)
*: have a look at epinephrine and its current structure. that is a mess. how do we structure that better with the two sets of content together?  To be really concrete - think about where the Adverse effects section should go.   It is just awkward where it is now.  What do you think? Jytdog (talk) 23:43, 22 November 2016 (UTC)
*:::Regarding the specific question of the structure of epinephrine (response to Jytdog): it is currently undergoing significant changes as material moves in and out; much of this material has not been integrated, and you're right that a structural rethink is needed. I'd reduce the lede by about a half, as most of the material there is minor and better included in the body. I'd also move the physiology above the clinical uses, because the clinical uses make more sense to a lay reader once you can see that this hormone usually does. Several of the major heading should be more more minor headings - so, nothing that a strong editorial hand couldn't do. This doesn't need a split as the normal functions and mechanisms greatly aid the understanding of the medical uses. Klbrain (talk) 18:51, 23 November 2016 (UTC)
*::I think I'd create a section for the &quot;drug&quot; content, and put the usual (non-duplicative) drug information in that. 
Adverse effects
would become the
Adverse effects
subsection under that.  Generally, I think I'd provide basic information about what the molecule does naturally before introducing anything about the drug.  Perhaps there are better solutions, but that's at least one approach that seems reasonably functional.  It'd also be very convenient in the event that an article needed to be split for reasons of size:  Swipe the whole section on its use as a drug and paste it into the new article; replace that with a proper  summary about the drug.  The drug needs to be described in the &quot;physiological&quot; article anyway; the only real question is whether it's described in full detail or whether it's described in a couple of paragraphs and preceded by a link to a page that contains the rest of the information.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 07:08, 23 November 2016 (UTC)
*::: I would also support creating a single drug section with adverse affects as a subsection with basic information about the neurotransmitter/hormone before that. That would be a big improvement for an article like epinephrine. The problem is that this approach conflicts with . Furthermore if the article is already very long, splitting is probably preferable.  Boghog (talk) 07:27, 23 November 2016 (UTC)
* Support – There are significant conflicts between  and  that make it difficult to write a coherent article that covers both the endogenous hormone and its use as a drug.  It is much cleaner to split the two.  Generally the endogenous hormone should be the primary topic as it is more fundamental concept. Boghog (talk) 05:09, 23 November 2016 (UTC)
* Support - As in complete agreement with proposer and Boghog. As a general reader it's very confusing to have the article as it is, mixing up its existence as a medication in the same sentence as the hormone.  And as argued by others - it necessitates the use of two infoboxes. --Iztwoz (talk) 01:18, 26 November 2016 (UTC)

*Unsure These splits are a lot of work. The redirects need to than be pointed to the correct article and there are thousands. Someone needs to go through them. Whatever we decide it needs to be done gradually. The disambig tool helped a lot with the testosterone split. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 01:45, 26 November 2016 (UTC)

*Support I have a pet opinion that medical details are too often given too much WEIGHT on WP relative to basic facts on natural function. Splitting the two frames helps create coherent narratives from both the basic and applied perspectives. I'm coming here from oxytocin, a chemical whose dominant role in neurobiology and social neurobiology is the topic of many, many books' worth of research [https://books.google.com/books?id=RWC9CwAAQBAJ] [https://books.google.com/books?id=8ZasDMxSI0UC&amp;] [https://books.google.com/books?id=riLqCAAAQBAJ&amp;] [https://books.google.com/books?id=OZ7v2ZiW-C0C] [https://books.google.com/books?id=8ZasDMxSI0UC&amp;]—but you'd almost never guess this from the lede, which gives details about administration and side effects which are only relevant to its use as a medication. I greatly admire the work of this WikiProject in tirelessly improving medical coverage, but I think it's important not to crowd out the basics.
That said, I agree with Doc James that this is a big job, and sadly I won't have time to help in the near future. Many thanks to those who can volunteer to do this if there's consensus. FourViolas (talk) 01:18, 29 November 2016 (UTC)

*Support There are lots of relevant points here, but it strikes me that the most cogent factor is that the audiences for medical and biological information about these substances are probably more or less orthogonal:  a reader who is interested in a substance as a drug probably does not want to have to navigate through masses of information about its role in biology.  It makes sense to separate out the information that such a reader will be interested in. (I might be the editor who started this trend, by splitting dopamine and norepinephrine.  At the time my main motivation was frustration at being unable to create a satisfactory infobox that covered both roles, but I now think this was just one manifestation of a wider issue.) Looie496 (talk) 15:21, 30 November 2016 (UTC)

*Chase your Dreams, baby! To whoever proposed this, I would like to say:  Bravo, and well done.  Einstein himself is turning over in his grave at this very minute, green with envy.  You have used at least a few percentage points more of your potential than the rest of us put together.  I am caused to recollect this very point has been irking me to no end for a number of years now. On this subject, I would like to say:  the epinephrine and adrenaline articles should be split.  Epi should deal with the med, and adrenaline should deal with the biochemical/hormone/whatever in the body its produced in.  They should be separate; the way it is now is like merging biochemistry and pharmacology into one article, and all the objections to that apply to this as well.

Adrenaline should deal with the organisms that produce adrenaline, how they do so and the affects on the system its produced in.  Epinephrine should deal with the companies that produce and market it, how it is priduced, where it is produced, what it is used for and medical codes and so on.  Little blurb about how it replaced morphine on the fire trucks (first responder industry) in the 90s and if you wanted to be really bleeding edge, why.  If someone has real balls they can try to tie all that noise to the current war in afghanistan.   Finally, to the people who I suspect lifted the idea for the original merge from my tapped phone conversation about 'youd think the people killing people for their adrenaline would try to hide the fact thats where epi comes from' I would say thank you, you have proved the point and we may now revert from craycray mode.  Secondly, I would like to posit murder is not the primary source of epi/adrenaline and that there are, in fact, other mechanisms for its production.  

Further, these may not even be more expensive overall.  Additionally merging for this reason is unwise because people are going to know what you're up to, and there is a possiblity, however slight, that this will make your 'procurement' more difficult.  Incidentally, if you're trying to hide it, wouldn't the split make it less obvious?  I see no other rationale for the merge.  Lastly, how about a blurb in the newly split Adrenaline article relating the practice of hunting with a gun like you would with a bow and arrow because tracking the deer or whatnot after you shoot it with the arrow scares it and the adrenaline spoils the meat.  See also (imperfectly executed?) halal and the concept of 'clean kill.'

Additionally the adrenaline article should state unequivocably where its produced, in the lede and ideally in the first sentence, ie 'Adrenaline is a purpurshmerbaroid that is produced in the almonderamer of the forebrain (or wherever - this one of those persistent mysteries of [bio]science?). Blah blah blah if you take too much you might poop yore pants etc blah blah...' and there should be a differentiation between the fear for life aspect of the 'flight' effect, the disregard for safety aspect of the 'fight' effect and a section equally devoted to the paralying aspect that makes rabbits freeze in the headlights because eagles and other predators rely on having their attention drawn to the movement, ie the frozen rabbit is esentially invisible (hence the legendary headlight reaction of yore).  I find it very difficult to believe these are all the same chemical with identical mechanisms of action.  Further, theres an unpleasant ('Area denial' aspect as well, such as when a mouse smells the urine of a house cat or a house cat smells the urine of a larger wild cat (something about making kittens be silent or something?  silent and hide?  especially when the mother cat isnt around?)  [edit:  covered or at least good start: 'The concept of the adrenal medulla and the sympathetic nervous system being involved in the flight, fight and fright response was originally proposed by Cannon.']

&quot;Epinephrine, also known as adrenalin or adrenaline, is a hormone, neurotransmitter and medication.&quot;  Incidentally, my understanding is adrenaline is only known as epinephrine if it is removed from the body(?)(is that even possible?  See 'spoiled meat' reference, above.  Otherwise see 'expense' section, directly subordinate there too.  As an aside you may also want to consider 'more trouble than its worth.'  In fairness, I'm going to go ahead and not try to get into 'human growth hormone,' 'human insulin,' jugging or jug band hare - somebody might want to consider why no one recommends eating a lot of veal, or the trope that 'trees can get diseases from children') or if/when it is produced synthetically and stold off the back of a truck as in the infamous 'epi pen.'

Another example might be you're deleting bird, cat and monkey here and adding them under mammal and chopping that down to 'small furry animal.'  Correct, yes, but just beyond infuriatingly inane for a studious encyclopedia intended for reference purposes.  Incidentally, if adderall and amphetamine are split, then so should be adrenaline and epinephrine.  Whats been done here is essentially akin to a merge of ritalin into PCP.  Incidentally, perhaps a reference to the prohibition of using blood in violation of kashrut is worth trotting out here.  Maybe, just maybe these people know what they're talking about here.

One additional gripe:  why are the  all off kilter, tampered with and gaslighted as all heck.  The first result should be adrenaline, the article; failing that it should be epinephrine (redirected from adrenaline) etc.

Just like to leave you with the usual - might want to get yourself some kevlar shorts! 55378008a (talk) 06:29, 10 December 2016 (UTC)

Wikidata and non-MED data
TL;DR following the   talk, can we use non-medical data from WD in  blindly (eg, CAS number, PubChem)?

This is a spin-off topic from . The pneumonia topic is about , , and WD data quality (So far: &quot;do not use WD-med data automatically&quot;). This thread is about using non-medical data from WD, like PubChem CID, and CAS number.

Background: I am preparing the WD connection for  and  (17k articles). Per development choices, these infoboxes are edited in tandem at datarow level (same data item is treated same way). Data in view are the identifiers (mostly el to external resources), pilot now is with d:QID and CAS number. Extensive tracking category set is used (especially those that should be emptied by editing enwiki or WD). Datamodels for chemical compounds, in WD and in both infoboxes, to be handled (eg situation: 'article is not a compound'). First aims: align the pair en:article–d:item, and get CAS number correct for the compounds.

My question is: having read the pneumonia discussion, should I treat the non-medical WD info as suspicious as the medical data? Or can I read &amp; show it? Note: for now, I withhold the proposal because if the discussions here. -DePiep (talk) 09:38, 13 December 2016 (UTC)
I would say it depends on whether the sources are available, and whether the data has been properly vetted so that it isn't polluted like the treatments data was. Carl Fredrik 💌  10:16, 13 December 2016 (UTC)
 My opinion is that the key distinguishing factor here is not the use of biomedical information, but whether there is a large community of individuals whose workflows may be disrupted and/or whether the change would result in a massive number of data changes.  Just for context, the first template our team converted over was for gene pages.  Because we run both the WP bot and the WD bot we could make sure that the content at the initial conversion was essentially identical (both in content and in form).  And even with that change, we created a new template that was moved over in stages (first 10 articles, then 50, etc...)  And all that was done with notifications at .
You may recall [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Chemistry/Archive_39#Wikidata_as_source_for_infobox_data this discussion] over at  about the chemistry infobox.  The primary take-home from that discussion was pretty similar, that we should move slowly and in stages.  We identified PubChem ID as the first identifier we would target.  Sebotic has been doing an analysis comparing PubChem IDs between WP and WD.  We want to get to the stage where the WD data is either the same as WP or demonstrably more accurate.  (For example, there are many examples where WP Pubchem IDs are stale and expired.)  We will be resuming that discussion over at WP:CHEM soon to get some community feedback on those results.
Since we seem to be the primary WD bot owners for statements on genes, proteins, drugs, and diseases, it would be great to ping us before pulling any of those data to WP, just to make sure we don't have any major changes/improvements planned.  And again, there is an open invitation for anyone to participate at [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:MB WD:MB].  Best, Andrew Su (talk) 14:10, 13 December 2016 (UTC)
Thanks for these great clarifying words, . But still: I am intimidated by the WD-enwiki effects. I am a serious enwiki template editor, but by now I feel I have to give it up to WD-bots (with smart people) organising it for me. -DePiep (talk) 00:17, 14 December 2016 (UTC)
  I too am intimidated by the WD-enwiki interface... ;)  But I'm 100% sure we can find a way to work together productively.  In retrospect, we probably could have used your talents when we created .  But moving forward (if I may humbly suggest a few ideas), you are certainly welcome over at WD:MED and WD:MB, either as a bot developer or to help chime in on our proposed data models.  Or, if you prefer to focus on WP, a long time ago we tried to prototype a few ideas of how to display related genes/drugs/phenotypes in .  Or open to brainstorming other ideas!

I'm sure this topic has been mulled over before, but I'm sorta curious what folks think about a potential .

The obvious question is - are you going to define drugs approved eg by the EMA and not the FDA as &quot;experimental&quot;? And why should the FDA be the primary benchmark, when EMA covers more people? And then why not India, Australia and so on... Sounds like a bit of a can of worms to me. Le Deluge (talk) 20:15, 13 December 2016 (UTC)
 I think that would be a good idea. The FDA is more well-known than other regulatory bodies, but I suppose other categories could be created if necessary. Is there a dash between FDA and approved (FDA-approved)? Natureium (talk) 20:18, 13 December 2016 (UTC)
 - re &quot;already exists&quot; - Duh! You're right. I feel silly for missing that.
 - That's a good question; maybe call out in  that you're talking about any drug seeking approval, but not yet approved by a major regulatory body (e.g. FDA, EMA, PMDA)?
 - re &quot;Is there a dash&quot; - Good question. Not sure what the right answer is there. NickCT (talk) 20:36, 13 December 2016 (UTC)

NickCT (talk) 13:52, 14 December 2016 (UTC)
 As someone who does a lot of work on categories - the answer is, that things can linger in the wrong categories for years. But at least the status of something in medieval metalwork is unlikely to change - and nobody dies if it's classified as Ancient Roman metalwork rather than medieval. I'm exaggerating of course, but instinctively I tend to shy away from categorising articles by &quot;ephemeral&quot; characteristics. They're a lot of work to maintain that could be better done off-Wiki, and one wonders if they are  - one has to beware .Le Deluge (talk) 14:05, 14 December 2016 (UTC)

I don't really see the point. However my criticism is mainly towards categories, not so much your proposal. This is very much what Wikidata is meant to handle. Does anyone know if there is a way to autocreate categories based on Wikidata properties? Carl Fredrik 💌  14:07, 14 December 2016 (UTC)
I think there is, but it will rely on accurate &quot;properties&quot; set up on Wikidata being picked-up from the standard info in the articles. And then when a drug is approved, it still has to be updated. Johnbod (talk) 15:00, 14 December 2016 (UTC)
The FDA's data is open so we can use that. It's probably already there as well. The EMA's data is similarly open (one of very few EU bodies that actually does open data). Carl Fredrik 💌  18:33, 14 December 2016 (UTC)

Medical centers in the United States

What are the criteria for listing on Medical centers in the United States? The centers listed are all big, but there are others that are just as big or prominent. Where is the line supposed to be? Natureium (talk) 04:22, 15 December 2016 (UTC)

Thanks Natureium (talk) 15:14, 15 December 2016 (UTC)
Natureium, the scope of that list is described in the introduction.  Based upon that, inclusion requires:
* large size,
* association with a medical school,
* a &quot;full spectrum&quot; of healthcare services, and
* a research program.
The list looks incomplete; for example, Stanford University Medical Center and Yale-New Haven Hospital probably belong in the list.  If you were to add large teaching hospitals that seem comparable to the existing ones, I think that you are unlikely to be wrong.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 01:13, 16 December 2016 (UTC)
 Is there really a purpose for the listing of some big medical centers? It's not a list article. It seems like the article could talk about the purpose, general info, and shared characteristics of medical centers in the US, and that would be sufficient. Natureium (talk)
This is a &quot;list&quot; article, even though it doesn't say &quot;List of&quot; at the top of the page.  I suppose that it would be useful to medical students who are seeking prestigious residencies; perhaps that's its &quot;purpose&quot;.
I think that the article you have in mind is at Academic health science centre.  (It's also a series of country-based lists, but it ought to contain more general information on the concept.)  WhatamIdoing (talk) 20:15, 17 December 2016 (UTC)

Yes, it depends on the underlying disorder. If the epilepsy is caused by a structural disorder of the brain surgery can definitely stop it, and there is also the possibility of outgrowing juvenile epilepsy and that way being &quot;cured&quot;.

Antibiotics
reverted here[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antibiotics&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=754974502&amp;oldid=754968569] this 1999 review[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10515903]...more eyes appreciated, thank you--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 20:25, 15 December 2016 (UTC)

This looks like a question of DUE weight.  It's indisputably true that &quot;traditional healers have long used plants to [attempt to] prevent or cure infectious diseases&quot; (to quote one of several claims made in this series of edits), and it's trivial to find recent sources that say as much.  The possibility of deriving antibiotics/antimicrobials from plants (rather than, e.g., from fungi) might even be interesting and relevant to researchers, investors, policy makers, etc.  What needs to be considered is whether that statement (in that place, phrased that way, etc.) misleads the average reader by putting too much emphasis on the supposed efficacy and naturalness.  OTOH, it is in the
Research
section.  
IMO the bottom line is that this probably needs more &quot;figure out the best thing to say about research on the next generation of antibiotics as it relates to plants&quot; than &quot;immediately enforce rules on all changes&quot;.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 01:00, 16 December 2016 (UTC)

 Actually, I think that the statement is okay. Ideally, perhaps a more recent review could be found. (I had a quick glance on PubMed.) I also added another sentence based on a 2015 review paper. Axl ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 15:35, 17 December 2016 (UTC)
Ozzie10aaaa I understand your point about due weight.  I agree that maybe the topic of phytochemicals was given more than the necessary attention in a wikipage about antibiotics.  A discussion about phytochemicals would be more appropriately placed in an article about plant medicine, plant-based medicine, or herbalism.  That being said, does the scope of our WikiProject cover plant medicine?  What is our scope?  Do we limit ourselves only to allopathic and osteopathic medicine?  One cannot forget that several different medicines are plant-derived or synthetic isomers of plant-derived compounds (e.g. vinca alkaloids, digitalis/digitoxin, ouabain, paclitaxel, warfarin, etc.), so where do we draw the line? NJ (talk) 18:40, 17 December 2016 (UTC)
The effect of this newly added material was to remove &quot;altmed&quot; stuff (e.g., the
Supplements
section heading) and substitute serious mainstream pharma-based scientific research that uses plants (which do contain anti-bacterial chemicals), rather than fungi (which are known to produce anti-bacterial chemicals), as a potential source of the next generation of antibiotics.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 20:08, 17 December 2016 (UTC)

I find Ozzie's line here to be the best one here. I am not aware of any classes of antibiotics currently in use which are derived from plants. However there is quite a following in alternative medicine of using so-called &quot;plant-based antibiotics&quot;. This doesn't mean that the concept is false, but we should be careful about using a 17-year-old review, especially considering there are newer ones available.

E.g.:
* Plant-derived antimicrobial compounds: alternatives to antibiotics. 2012 

Carl, this is the

Acadesine and AICA ribonucleotide

The two drug articles Acadesine and AICA ribonucleotide are about two closely related chemical compounds.  Both apparently are sometimes referred to by the same abbreviation AICAR.  This appears to have caused some confusion and I think much of the content of the AICA ribonucleotide article is actually based on references that discuss Acadesine.  One could certainly imagine the two chemical compounds being interconverted in the body (they differ only by a phosphate group), so maybe the effects of one are directly relevant to the effects of the other, but since I'm not able to access much of the references in order to sort this out, I'd like to ask others with some medical and/or pharmacology experience to have a look.

Males of many, and perhaps the majority of, long-lived species, express periodic changes in testicular activity and behaviour during their normal life cycle. In the most extreme examples, as illustrated by the Soay ram, males continually cycle between the sexually active/fertile state and the sexually inactive/infertile state, often on an annual or long-term basis. In individuals, testicular activity may vary with changes in social status, nutrition, health, age and other factors. This also applies to man.&quot;

Researching effects of high-potency marijuana

The University of Colorado has received a grant for the study of the effects of high-potency cannabis.

  there might be something there usable to discuss the facts that concentrated cannabis is produced; that people inhale the heated vapours (is &quot;dabbing&quot; a neologism yet?); and that it's illegal to actually conduct trials in Colorado. As the research is a single &quot;trial&quot;, not randomised, no double-blinding, with no control group - or even any measurement of dosage - the study falls into the lowest class of evidence, and so isn't usable to support any biomedical claim such as cognitive impairment or otherwise. It might be usable as evidence for the claim that stoners tend to get stoned. --RexxS (talk) 20:04, 20 December 2016 (UTC)

Tools are here on Commons. We now need to build consensus to expand what licenses of data we accept [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Village_pump#Common_data_sets_licensing_issue here].
