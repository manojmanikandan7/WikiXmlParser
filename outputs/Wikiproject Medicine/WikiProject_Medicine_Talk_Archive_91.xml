Two weeks ago, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Right_axis_deviation&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=750388690&amp;oldid=749490687 I deleted] an incorrect image from the article &quot;Right axis deviation&quot;. My edits were subsequently reverted by an anonymous IP editor and . I asked for further opinions [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine/Archive_90#Student_Editing_2.2C_Imperial_College_London here]. (Thank you, Ozzie10aaaa.) Dr sunflowers did not respond.

I asked for deletion at Wikimedia Commons, but the admin there ([https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User_talk:INeverCry INeverCry]) deleted the talk page rather than the file. I have pointed this out.

I would appreciate if someone fixes the problem on the page &quot;Right axis deviation&quot;.

This matter is an indictment of student editing and their so-called supervision. [[User:Axl|Axl]] ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 13:37, 1 December 2016 (UTC)

;Biomarkers 
In the modern time, large amounts of biomarkers could be used in various neurological practices to provide better decision for patient prognosis or in prediction of treatment affects. Although future validation of these biomarkers is needed before utilizing them into standard clinical diagnose algorithms, the importance of personalized medicine will be considered significantly to achieve more effective, cheaper and better-tailored treatment for different neurological diseases in the future. In Parkinson’s disease, there is no validated diagnostic biomarker for PD yet. However, like Alzheimer’s disease, perspective biomarkers are such as dopamine metabolism, oxidative stress, α-synuclein, auto antibodies against α synuclein and inflammatory markers. The reliable results are obtained from studies of α synuclein, the major component of lewy bodies, and it can be found in saliva, serum, plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In addition, inflammatory markers such as higher level of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and soluble tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-1 are associated with PD or early onset of disease. More than 25 genetic factors have been reported to affect the risk factor for PD and the major risk factor is shown to be homozygous and heterozygous mutations of the glucocerebrosidase gene. For PD, one biomarker and a single measure are not efficient to provide useful information. The combination of different biomarkers with clinical relevant patient’s characteristics can be considered to offer better and integrated information on disease.

There are of course lots of mistakes on Commons. I wouldn't bother with the talk pages, which surely no one ever sees, but when completely sure I just edit the description, or leave a query there. What I see most of is mis-described images of real things rather than illustration-type ones that are just wrong. But I doubt even many editors looking for images to use see those comments. Images that are just wrong or very misleading should be put up for deletion I think.  () 18:55, 15 December 2016 (UTC)

 On the few occasions when I have found errors in diagrams, it has proven very difficult to gain the attention of anyone. I suspect that a template would be similarly ignored. [[User:Axl|Axl]] ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 13:45, 19 December 2016 (UTC)

Antibiotics
reverted here[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antibiotics&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=754974502&amp;oldid=754968569] this 1999 review[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10515903]...more eyes appreciated, thank you-- () 20:25, 15 December 2016 (UTC)

This looks like a question of DUE weight.  It's indisputably true that &quot;traditional healers have long used plants to [attempt to] prevent or cure infectious diseases&quot; (to quote one of several claims made in this series of edits), and it's trivial to find recent sources that say as much.  The possibility of deriving antibiotics/antimicrobials from plants (rather than, e.g., from fungi) might even be interesting and relevant to researchers, investors, policy makers, etc.  What needs to be considered is whether that statement (in that place, phrased that way, etc.) misleads the average reader by putting too much emphasis on the supposed efficacy and naturalness.  OTOH, it is in the
Research
section.  
IMO the bottom line is that this probably needs more &quot;figure out the best thing to say about research on the next generation of antibiotics as it relates to plants&quot; than &quot;immediately enforce rules on all changes&quot;.   () 01:00, 16 December 2016 (UTC)
 I think that the first link should be [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antibiotics&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=754974502&amp;oldid=754968569 this]. [[User:Axl|Axl]] ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 15:19, 17 December 2016 (UTC)
 Actually, I think that the statement is okay. Ideally, perhaps a more recent review could be found. (I had a quick glance on PubMed.) I also added another sentence based on a 2015 review paper. [[User:Axl|Axl]] ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 15:35, 17 December 2016 (UTC)
 I understand your point about due weight.  I agree that maybe the topic of phytochemicals was given more than the necessary attention in a wikipage about antibiotics.  A discussion about phytochemicals would be more appropriately placed in an article about plant medicine, plant-based medicine, or herbalism.  That being said, does the scope of our WikiProject cover plant medicine?  What is our scope?  Do we limit ourselves only to allopathic and osteopathic medicine?  One cannot forget that several different medicines are plant-derived or synthetic isomers of plant-derived compounds (e.g. vinca alkaloids, digitalis/digitoxin, ouabain, paclitaxel, warfarin, etc.), so where do we draw the line?  () 18:40, 17 December 2016 (UTC)
The effect of this newly added material was to remove &quot;altmed&quot; stuff (e.g., the
Supplements
section heading) and substitute serious mainstream pharma-based scientific research that uses plants (which do contain anti-bacterial chemicals), rather than fungi (which are known to produce anti-bacterial chemicals), as a potential source of the next generation of antibiotics.   () 20:08, 17 December 2016 (UTC)

I find Ozzie's line here to be the best one here. I am not aware of any classes of antibiotics currently in use which are derived from plants. However there is quite a following in alternative medicine of using so-called &quot;plant-based antibiotics&quot;. This doesn't mean that the concept is false, but we should be careful about using a 17-year-old review, especially considering there are newer ones available. [[User:CFCF|Carl Fredrik]]  19:39, 17 December 2016 (UTC)
E.g.:
* Plant-derived antimicrobial compounds: alternatives to antibiotics. 2012 

Carl, this is the
Research
section.  Whether plant-derived antibiotics are currently in use is irrelevant.  What matters in this section is whether plant-derived antibiotics are being researched, i.e., are plants an area of active scientific research for future antibiotics?   () 20:11, 17 December 2016 (UTC)

Right, though I tend to use antibiotic to refer to antibacterials. I could have been clearer with regards to that.[[User:CFCF|Carl Fredrik]]  15:40, 19 December 2016 (UTC)
I think some of us are getting confused by terminology, given that there's the terms &quot;antibiotics&quot;, &quot;antibacterials&quot;, and &quot;antimicrobials&quot;.  The first term is probably most inclusive, while antimicrobials may pertain specifically to organisms invisible to the naked eye.  Antibacterials are both antibiotics and antimicrobials.

Acadesine and AICA ribonucleotide

The two drug articles Acadesine and AICA ribonucleotide are about two closely related chemical compounds.  Both apparently are sometimes referred to by the same abbreviation AICAR.  This appears to have caused some confusion and I think much of the content of the AICA ribonucleotide article is actually based on references that discuss Acadesine.  One could certainly imagine the two chemical compounds being interconverted in the body (they differ only by a phosphate group), so maybe the effects of one are directly relevant to the effects of the other, but since I'm not able to access much of the references in order to sort this out, I'd like to ask others with some medical and/or pharmacology experience to have a look.

This is a made-up thing.  There is no such thing as &quot;acute allergy syndrome&quot;.

 The only use of the term that I could find is in , which is used as a reference in the article.

Males of many, and perhaps the majority of, long-lived species, express periodic changes in testicular activity and behaviour during their normal life cycle. In the most extreme examples, as illustrated by the Soay ram, males continually cycle between the sexually active/fertile state and the sexually inactive/infertile state, often on an annual or long-term basis. In individuals, testicular activity may vary with changes in social status, nutrition, health, age and other factors. This also applies to man.&quot;

As the research is a single &quot;trial&quot;, not randomised, no double-blinding, with no control group - or even any measurement of dosage - the study falls into the lowest class of evidence, and so isn't usable to support any biomedical claim such as cognitive impairment or otherwise.
