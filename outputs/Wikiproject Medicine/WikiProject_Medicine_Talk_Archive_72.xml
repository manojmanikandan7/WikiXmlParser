 Dislocation of spine due to Marfan's Syndrome 

I have been searching for information on Dislocating the Spinal Colomn and all I come up with is is the chiropractic version.  I have, since Janruary this year dislocated my spine three times.  each was extreemly painful and caused spinal cord injury.  I have Marfan's Syndrome, SLE, and osteoarthritis. My vertebre actually poped out and folded my spine. I have compression and the 2nd time I dislocated, I fractured my spine.  I lost the ability to walk and can not feel my right leg. I am 15 weeks post fracture and still in wheel chair.  I can walk some but legs give way and I fall.  Does anyone have any info on this kind of dislocation? I really bneed to get some or even web sites to some where, wher I can get info.  At present I aqm in rehab and need to  prove what is happenning when legs give way and why. Thank you for any help. pecial:Contributions/76.119.167.238|76.119.167.238 (ser talk:76.119.167.238|talk) 19:32, 8 September 2015 (UTC)Desperate Debbiepecial:Contributions/76.119.167.238|76.119.167.238 (ser talk:76.119.167.238|talk) 19:32, 8 September 2015 (UTC)
I'm sorry, but Wikipedia policy prohibits us from giving medical advice related to specific cases.  Our job here is to write articles that contain information that is generally valid and helpful; that's really all we can do. ser:Looie496|Looie496 (ser talk:Looie496|talk) 00:15, 9 September 2015 (UTC)
I'm sorry for not being able to help, but not only is it against policy, but there is almost nothing we can do over the internet.
On a side note the relevant articles pondylosis &amp; pondylolisthesis &amp; pinal compression fracture are in need of work. I suggest you contact your doctor or various support groups such as marfan.org for more information. -- ser:CFCF|CFCF ser talk:CFCF|üçå (pecial:EmailUser/CFCF|email) 08:50, 9 September 2015 (UTC)
I believe that the OP is requesting a Wikipedia article on actual, severe dislocation of vertebrae, i.e., something that has nothing to do with chiropractic and one of the things that some of our anti-chiropractic editors say cannot happen (apparently on the grounds that there is a magical force that makes it impossible for this one type of joint to leave its proper location, even though dislocation obviously can happen to every single other mobile joint in the body).  If anyone can find sources about vertebrae being dislocated that has nothing to do with chiropractic or its cousins, then now would be a good time to speak up.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 22:39, 9 September 2015 (UTC)

Doc James mentioned Elance above; the website is being merged with Upwork.  If anyone's curious about how one searches for paid editing there, then these search results might give you an idea:
* https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/browse/?q=wikipedia ‚Äì Freelancers who advertise Wikipedia skills
* https://www.upwork.com/jobs/?qs=wikipedia ‚Äì Some of the clients seeking paid editors

I just took a quick look, but it looks like most of the jobs are about BLPs and businesses.  Also, please remember that there's no verification of whether anyone claiming to be &quot;User:Example&quot; actually is, so please don't believe everything you read in the profiles.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 00:04, 3 September 2015 (UTC)
Yes we have at least one person claiming to be an admin. But there is no indication that they are actually them. Pictures may be false. Name may be false etc. But it does not take much time to come up with jobs that are paid for and then find a new spammy article on Wikipedia that was recently created by some brand new account.
It is unclear if you are allowed to post links such as ser:WhatamIdoing just did so be careful. If you find cases of undisclosed paid editing feel free to forwards them to me. I am willing to enforce our P:TOU. Also Elance is willing to take down accounts that are infringing upon our terms of use. Unless / until we change them this means we need to have evidence that they have not disclosed their paid editing before we can shut down their account. ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk ¬∑ pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs ¬∑ pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 04:13, 4 September 2015 (UTC)

Ischemic Cardiomyopathy

Hi, I recently created a page for &quot;Ischemic Cardiomyopathy&quot; which was rejected by LaMona. 
The reasons was, is that it was too similar to the page, or the information could be contained within the page &quot;Cardiomyopathy&quot;. 

I was alarmed that &quot;ischemic cardiomyopathy&quot; was not included as one of the causes of secondary cardiomyopathy, in the page &quot;cardiomyopathy&quot;, as it is arguably the most common cardiomyopathy by far. Therefore, the explanation for ischemic cardiomyopathy I believe needs its own page. Several of the other cardiomyopathies listed in the page for cardiomyopathy have links to their own page. Therefore, I think that it is important that ischemic cardiomyopathy have it's own page, and I think that it is even more important then the other rarer forms of cardiomyopathy. It is a very large, and important topic, for which needs its own page. 

Therefore, I make a request to have a page for &quot;ischemic cardiomyopathy&quot;, with links from &quot;Cardiomyopathy&quot;.

I proposed a change to P:MEDRS that I hope you find reasonable. It's still only an early draft and I think there may be better pyramids we could use, so feel free to give any suggestions on how I can improve it. I believe that section needs an update.

Clinical practice guidelines don't quite fit the traditional hierarchy. Guidelines should be based on the best evidence, but if there's no RCTs, say, on a subject, then the guidelines will be based only on weaker evidence. At the same time, what guidelines say is probably something Wikipedia should cover, whatever they're based on. What would be best, I suggest, is to say &quot;Guidelines say this...&quot; and then &quot;They are based on...&quot;.
I would also note that the whole hierarchy thing comes from evidence-based medicine and there are plenty of valid criticisms of EBM. There are health topics that are not well served by RCTs or Cochrane-style systematic reviews. ser:Bondegezou|Bondegezou (ser talk:Bondegezou|talk) 10:02, 4 September 2015 (UTC)
Couple of critiques of EBM: [https://www.rnzcgp.org.nz/assets/documents/Publications/JPHC/June-2012/JPHC-Vol-4-No-2-June-2012.pdf#page=5 Greenhalgh, 2012]; [http://www.bmj.com/content/348/bmj.g3725.short Greenhalgh et al., 2014]. COI declaration: I've worked with Greenhalgh, e.g. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-0009.2009.00578.x/abstract this paper] takes a different approach to the traditional EBM hierarchy (and has had 157 citations, so I don't think we were completely mad to do so). ser:Bondegezou|Bondegezou (ser talk:Bondegezou|talk) 10:08, 4 September 2015 (UTC)
We sort of have our own hierarchy which is based on summaries of the research and can be found P:MEDRS  ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk ¬∑ pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs ¬∑ pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 12:43, 4 September 2015 (UTC)
More accurately, our hierarchy is based upon summaries of the sources, which may or may not involve research, and may or may not agree with the evidence.  An encyclopedia is not a systematic review.  Our purpose is to summarize what good-quality sources say, and not to include statements (judgments) about whether those sources are recommending unproven nonsense (unless, of course, you have a high-quality source that judges the others, e.g., a practice guideline that recommends no food after abdominal surgery despite evidence that this ancient practice harms patients and a review that says the practice guideline's recommendation is stupid.  You can include both in that instance, but not a statement based upon your own opinion that there's no evidence for what the practice guideline recommends).  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 15:51, 4 September 2015 (UTC)
My concern would be that there are good-quality sources working off secondary and primary research that don't appear in those pyramids: qualitative or non-meta-analytic systematic reviews, qualitative observational studies, ethnographic studies. ser:Bondegezou|Bondegezou (ser talk:Bondegezou|talk) 17:52, 6 September 2015 (UTC)
Anything like this also reinforces our systematic P:DUE weight problem, in which evidence of treatment efficacy (or, in rare cases, diagnostic accuracy) is elevated above absolutely everything else.  
When was it invented?  Who cares!  Nobody knows whether it works!  
What is it?  Who cares!  Nobody knows whether it works!  
What is the typical patient's experience?  Who cares!  The only thing that matters is which treatment has the best evidence!  
Will the patient agree to the treatment with the best evidence?  Who cares!  All that matters is evidence!
But despite these frustrating problems, and the narrow, biased articles that we're creating as a result, I think it's probably desirable to have an explanation available for people who are trying to learn about this subject.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 21:37, 6 September 2015 (UTC)
Yes, this is something of an issue at lectronic cigarette, where RCTs are few and small but survey evidence pretty plentiful, as befits a consumer-led innovation that US and other doctors are still discouraged from recommending as a NRT. ser:Johnbod|Johnbod (ser talk:Johnbod|talk) 15:07, 11 September 2015 (UTC)
 eply to | Bondegezou I'm certain the pyramids don't pretend to be an exhaustive list, but are illustrative of the many areas of classification. The actual guidelines are in the adjacent text and I'm sure that the subsequent paragraph could be improved to discuss other the good quality sources you mention and their comparative merits as medical sources. Why not give it a go?
 eply to | CFCF I hope you don't mind, but I've increased to size of the images in P:MEDASSESS to match those you used in your proposal. Unfortunately the smaller size puts them beyond the limit of what I can read - and my vision is not untypical of that of older readers. I've also added textual indicators of the sources and removed the ag|small because I couldn't make out that they were links to references on their own. It may be that someone whose vision is worse than mine still needs the images to be larger to be legible. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 18:02, 11 September 2015 (UTC)

 ex differences in intelligence‚Äé article  

Eyes from this project are needed at the rticle|Sex differences in intelligence‚Äé article. Suddenly, there has been a wave of edits being made there, starting with ser|2003:5b:4b47:d72c:f94d:cc91:b3b6:840c and followed by ser|Esailija, ser|John Deranjo Smith, and ser|Ssjh thus far. Instead of P:Student editing, I think it's a matter of someone at a website having spotted the article and having pointed people to it to make certain edits to it. If it were WP:Student editing, it's usually the case that I would see signs, such as sandboxes and/or the editors having listed their name at a course, by looking at the editors' contributions. It's easy to see why people would send others to edit this article. It's a very controversial topic. It relates to this project because it is mostly a biomedical topic. I might also alert P:WikiProject Neuroscience and P:WikiProject Evolutionary biology to this matter, but these WikiProjects aren't as active as this one. ser:Flyer22|Flyer22 (ser talk:Flyer22|talk) 06:08, 11 September 2015 (UTC)

Welcome to Wikipedia.  I don't know anything about ser:John Deranjo Smith|your edits, but a common mistake in a subject like this is to pick a couple of sources that say what you expect (NB that &quot;what you expect&quot; is not the same as &quot;what you like&quot;, but rather sources that overall agree with ideas you've heard or picked up over the years and that, as far as you can tell, other people seem to believe), and not look for anything else.  
For example, it's common in the US to believe that there are more males at either end of the curve (and it may be true, here in the US), so if someone found a source that looks good and said that, then it probably wouldn't occur to the editor to see whether a high-quality academic source [http://www.ams.org/notices/201201/rtx120100010p.pdf like this one] ([http://io9.com/5867401/there-really-is-no-difference-between-men-and-womens-math-abilities summary]) has de-bunked this idea and proven that this pattern is only seen in some countries, and in other countries, exactly the opposite is true, and in still others, there is no difference.  Similarly, it's common to see people say that there are more males in the ends of the curve and more females in the middle (at least here in the U.S.), but to leave out the fact (because they weren't told, or don't understand enough about statistics to understand what they were told) that the difference is so tiny that if you drew those two curves the size of a regular sheet of paper, using a fine-point marker, then the male and female lines would be overlapping and essentially indistinguishable. 
Our wiki-jargon for this challenge is &quot;due weight&quot; (often linked as P:DUE or P:WEIGHT), and it means giving appropriate attention to what high-quality sources say, rather than what we &quot;just know&quot; (even if there are some sources that repeat the things that we &quot;just know&quot;).  The solution to the problem is usually to seek out more and better sources.  It's some work, but it can also be fun and interesting.   ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 07:48, 11 September 2015 (UTC)

This may be a primary source but, as stated above, it is included in at least 10 reviews, had a cross-sectional design, was very large (1.1 million) and was in the highest impact medical journal.  This is epidemiological science rather than medical advice or a few dozen rodents.  I think this is exactly the kind of study that should have at least a passing, but specific, mention in WP (rather than just an arbitrary selected secondary review).

 Problem today.. 
My daughter was out in the woods today and I went to WP to see what a tick bite looked like. We're going to the physician anyway. No info! I was redirected to tick borne diseases, not very useful for someone like me who just wants info on the bite-not the disease. Best Regards,

It's been decades since I've seen one, but I believe the usual way to determine that there has been a tick bite (at least back in the day...) is that the tick is still attached.  I don't believe that there is a characteristic appearance, especially not within a few hours.  I doubt that we're going to find a source that lets us support a statement like &quot;If a tick bites and then detaches itself, it'll look pretty much like any other tiny bug bite&quot; (which is what I'd assume the appearance would be).  But perhaps someone else knows the literature better than I.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 03:24, 12 September 2015 (UTC)
True, the bull's eye that is commonly known is a symptom of orreliosis, and does not appear instantly. The bite is no different from other insect bites, except when the tick is still lodged or the head is left in the skin. (Note: the head alone doesn't transmit any disease). The shorter time the tick is attached the less the risk of transmission of disease is.Good catch though, we should elaborate on how transmission occurs, how bites look and when it is recommended to visit a doctor. -- ser:CFCF|CFCF ser talk:CFCF|üçå (pecial:EmailUser/CFCF|email) 13:55, 12 September 2015 (UTC)

 Opinion requested at Hyperbaric medicine 

I would like a consensus medical opinion on what the scope should be for the yperbaric medicine article. Specifically, whether it should be about hyperbaric oxygen treatment only, or include therapeutic recompression, or whether the article should be renamed to yperbaric oxygen treatment and exclude herapeutic recompression , which is a large enough and notable subject for a separate article, though there is overlap. The current article is vague and possibly misleading about several details, and quite a bit of work will be necessary to fix it. Much of the vagueness is in failing to distinguish between HBOT and TR, and the chambers used for them. Please leave all comments and discussion at alk:Hyperbaric medicine.

 Excuse me replying here, but this subject really warrants more eyes on it than it would get at the article talk page (probably just you, me and Gene). I'll look again at the article, but it doesn't seem to be anywhere near big enough to warrant a split, especially as much of the article ought to apply to both HBOT and TR. I do agree that it needs re-organising, but I would warn you that we have suffered in the past from fringe views taking over large parts of the HBOT sections. The problem is that some parents of autistic children believe that HBOT has improved their child's condition and feel it is important to inform the world of their discovery via Wikipedia. Such &quot;true believers&quot; are a well-know phenomenon in fringe topics and often make some articles uneditable with their unshakeable zeal. That is another good reason not to have an article titled yperbaric oxygen therapy or yperbaric oxygen treatment as they act as a magnet for such contributors. A trawl through the article history shows that that somebody has suggested that HBOT is effective for everything from treating cerebral palsy to accelerating the growth of piranha fish - and that I've been cleaning it up since 2008 (along with Doc James, Boghog, etc.). Anyway, Peter, sorry for the rant, I do appreciate your efforts and I will do what I can at the article as time permits. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 13:32, 15 September 2015 (UTC)

 Promotion of wiki-partnerships with organizations 

Hello. My colleague |Hexatekin (Dorothy) wrote this. I reviewed it.
*[https://medium.com/@DorothyR_Howard/10-wikipedians-partnering-with-medical-organizations-to-improve-online-health-information-a7707a72b7d3 10 Wikipedians partnering with medical organizations to improve online health information]

It is a cool article, consider reading it. Here are some thoughts.
*I want more organizations to consider having their expert staff contribute time to developing Wikipedia. I want high quality long term partnerships, of course, not short term advertising.
*The article emphasizes individuals, which is nice. I would have preferred highlighting organizations instead, but of course in many cases, organizations have delicate relationships with their Wikipedians. In many cases the Wikipedian represents an organization in a public way beyond comfort or precedent in traditional organizational hierarchies. For this reason, I suggested to Dorothy that she talk about the Wikipedians over the organizations.
*I have doubts about highlighting individual Wikipedians. Any Wikipedian who has a Wikipedia job does a fraction of the work for which they get credit, and the Wikimedia community does 90%+ of the rest of the labor. This article presents some Wikipedians favorably, and I think that helps people on the outside understand Wikipedia better. The deeper understanding is that no individual can take majority credit for anything in-wiki, and that most thanks should go to contributors who do quieter support roles. I wish I could imagine a better way to profile contributors here who do not post their photos, reveal their identities, speak in public, and announce their organizational affiliations. If anyone feels a need for greater recognition then talk to me because I want to find ways to recognize more people more effectively.
*Dorothy works with me, I made myself available to be profiled here, and I questioned whether it was appropriate to have this article published when it partially promotes me along with other Wikipedians who work with health organizations. I went with it because I thought some public documentation would be worthwhile.
*I want more external journalism around what Wikipedia does in the health space.
I hope this is useful. Feedback is welcome, especially criticism for what to do differently next time. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 15:47, 14 September 2015 (UTC)

I don't like such stories too much but journalists apparently do. As a reader, I found it quite digestible overall, but the title just puts too much stress on those 10, while it would be easy to expand the list. For NIH, for instance, ser:Hildabast might well have been a better fit. A series of portraits ‚Äî starting with those not mentioned amongst the 10 ‚Äî would seem like a good follow-up if they manage to stress that there are many ways to contribute and highlight how the individuals have found their way here, what turned them into active participants, and why they are still around. -- ser:Daniel Mietchen|Daniel Mietchen (ser talk:Daniel Mietchen|talk)  23:27, 15 September 2015 (UTC)

 Gynostemma pentaphyllum 

The article ynostemma pentaphyllum makes some claims about the medical uses of this plant and its &quot;therapeutic qualities&quot;.  The text relies heavily on primary sources and has been tagged with l|medref since last year.

In light of this, I've moved the two extra references I had added from &quot;References&quot; to &quot;Further reading&quot; as they contain extra material on both the test and its use in diagnostics in case anyone ever wishes to expand the article. I've also added a third piece of further reading, the original 1957 article by aymond Carhart who developed the test. ser:Voceditenore|Voceditenore (ser talk:Voceditenore|talk) 12:47, 15 September 2015 (UTC)
Yes, one good source can be enough.  Wikipedia is not a bibliography service.  It's an encyclopedia.  We need an article that provides a neutral summary of a subject.  One method‚Äînote that I wrote one method, not the sole possible method‚Äîof achieving the neutral-encyclopedic-summary goal is to use, and therefore to cite, multiple good sources.  However, if you can achieve that goal while only citing one good source, then that's okay.  It is not unusual for a stub to have a single source, and so long as that source actually supports all of the P:MINREF|necessary material, and so long as the result is an P:NOTFINISHED|approximately neutral encyclopedia, then that's fine.
This is an important thing to keep in mind, because reverting and tagging discourages contributors.  I've talked to several people who have done research on Wikipedia editors, and one of the common stories from high-quality former contributors is that they tried to help, and the work was reverted or tagged as being inadequate.  The lesson they learned‚Äîand that we taught them‚Äîis that even though they are experts in their subject matter, they aren't &quot;good enough&quot; to contribute to Wikipedia.  If you want people to stick around, you should build on what they have done (whenever remotely possible), rather than just telling them that they did it &quot;wrong&quot; by your standards.  For example, if you want two sources, then add a second one yourself.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:31, 16 September 2015 (UTC)

meh. microcategorization. people will do as they will but it is best to understand the tree before you start adding branches. 20:01, 10 September 2015 (UTC)
This discussion should be had at T:ANAT. There is a TA-group for fascia, so I guess one could create a category from those. But honestly it doesn't matter ‚Äì categories are not really utilised within the anatomy project because they will be defunct once Wikidata takes over. Creating this category is a waste of time‚Äìit has no utility. ing|LT910001. -- ser:CFCF|CFCF ser talk:CFCF|üçå (pecial:EmailUser/CFCF|email) 21:41, 10 September 2015 (UTC)¬†
In my opinion it is not a waste of time to create this category. Articles describing fascias has been sorted into a number of various categories, e.g. Category:Soft tissue or Category:Muscular system; this behavior made me think that autors of these articles actually didn‚Äôt know how to categorize theirs articles, because there wasn‚Äôt any category clearly describing fascias. To sort an article about a fascia in the category muscular system (maybe because a fascia is very related with the muscle) is like to sort an article about an muscle in the category bone, because a muscle is related with a bone. But a fascia is not a muscle as a muscle is not a bone ‚Äì and because of this there are these various categories. I can better understand the point that the category connective tissue already exists, but it is a wider topic what Matthew Ferguson already said (and fascia is a subcategory of connective tissue already). And CFCF what do you mean saying categories will be defunct? --ser:Sonabi|Sonabi (ser talk:Sonabi|talk) 22:23, 10 September 2015 (UTC)
I don't mean that they are pointless, just that working on them right now is. A categorization system is massively useful, but the Wikipedia one isn't‚Äìit often hides things and makes it very hard to get a good overview of various nested categories.We recently imported the entire A98 as well as oundational model of anatomy|FMA into Wikidata and linked it through l|Infobox anatomy, and these are far more useful.What I meant is that it would be a better use of time to use Wikidata to automate category creation using FMA entries‚Äìor even to just wait until someone goes and does this. -- ser:CFCF|CFCF ser talk:CFCF|üçå (pecial:EmailUser/CFCF|email) 22:36, 10 September 2015 (UTC)
Ah, ok. So if I understood you right, you are against that I created the category, because it would have been better to do something else, but you are for creating the category (by a bot or something like that)? --ser:Sonabi|Sonabi (ser talk:Sonabi|talk) 23:04, 10 September 2015 (UTC)

And furthermore I can not comprehend why a category that contains two subcategories itself and at least 50 pages should be kind of microcategorization? --ser:Sonabi|Sonabi (ser talk:Sonabi|talk) 23:08, 10 September 2015 (UTC)

|CFCF how would this work for pathology articles, would it follow the ICD 10 (or 11 when it comes out)? ser:Matthew Ferguson 57|Matthew Ferguson (ser talk:Matthew Ferguson 57|talk) 02:34, 11 September 2015 (UTC)

@|Sonabi please feel free in future also to post at T:ANAT|WikiProject Anatomy as with several editors in this project we have gradually been moving the care of anatomy articles to that wikiproject. As for a category of Fascia I am somewhat ambivalent. If it is easily done then so be it, otherwise if it requires a lot of effort, I'd advise that the effort probably won't make a material difference to users and is expended in a more reader-orientated direction. --ser:LT910001|Tom (LT) (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 22:55, 11 September 2015 (UTC)

 PBC 
ile:Primary biliary cirrhosis intermed mag much cropping.jpg|thumb|Primary biliary cirrhosis 
There has been an initiative to change the name from rimary biliary cirrhosis to rimary biliary cholangitis.  Initially patient support groups advocated for this, but their views have now been accepted by professional organisations such as the AASLD.[https://www.aasld.org/name-change-pbc-cholangitis-replacing-cirrhosis] Articles reviewing the name change have now just appeared together in Gut, Hepatology [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hep.28140/epdf] and J Hepatol, with further reviews in J Hepatol and in Can J Gastroenterol Hepatol.

The changes I have made to reflect this have been repeated reverted by |Jytdog -- admittedly initially when the cited references were weaker.  He justifies this by saying this is advocacy.  He may be an expert on Agro business and GMO but I think he is on weak ground here.   I have written on his talk page.

It's not a neologism, as it's been suggested for about two decades or so, and it's not actually a contradiction:  it's &quot;an idiopathic type of environmental intolerance&quot;, not &quot;an idiopathic‚Äìenvironmental type of intolerance&quot;.

The way that you promote an article to B-class, or to anything except A, FA, FL, and GA, is this:  Change the ara|class parameter in the banner at the top of the page, and save the page.  Any WPMEDder who has a basic idea of what the standards are is welcome to do this.  Any WPMED folk who want to read about the standards can visit P:MEDA.  You are encouraged to fix ratings on articles that you have improved, on the grounds that you know their strengths and weaknesses better than anyone else.  
As a general rule, we tend to (accidentally) under-rate articles, so if you're waffling between Start and C, or between C and B, then consider picking¬†the higher rating.  The worst possible¬†outcome is that I'll revert you and maybe even leave an explanation for why I did.  You are even permitted to disagree with me if I do so.  Seriously:  P:Be bold instead of bureaucratic with these things.  If you truly can't decide, or if you don't want to bother, then you can leave a note at the bottom of P:MEDA.  Someone usually goes through that list every month or two to deal with requests.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:47, 16 September 2015 (UTC)
Agree. The assessment table on our main page has a number (125,000 last I looked) that represents the number of changes that we need to incrementally make to article ratings to get all our articles to FA class. In order to avoid 125,000 discussions (or 32,000 B-class discussions) we need to be bold and make these changes, and be forgiving and assume good faith if we disagree with the assessments of others. --ser:LT910001|Tom (LT) (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 20:20, 16 September 2015 (UTC)

 Engaging academic experts in creation of WP content 
I am unsure of the &quot;right&quot; solution for engaging academic experts in WP content creation. Obviously, the best approach will be multi-faceted, but as a physician-professor I'm not sure that directly editing WP is the best way for me to contribute. If that seems anathema, please tell me why after noting the following:
# The standards for sourcing biomedical academic manuscripts (e.g. journal articles and book chapters) differ significantly from WP standards (e.g. MEDRS). While this difference can be learned and is actually a helpful perspective (in my estimation), it's a barrier for new WP editors who have experience as academic authors.
# Biomedical experts are expected to synthesize prior work (with their own in primary reports) to generate new knowledge. This is as it should be, but is another important difference from editing WP.
# The forces that drive academics to create secondary sources (i.e. MEDRS) are currently almost arbitrary - an invitation to write a chapter of a textbook that will be ridiculously expensive (and therefore of limited distribution), a tenuous decision to write a review article (perhaps driven by a perceived misunderstanding in the field, or the need for a trainee to have a mentored writing exercise). I speak from experience on this.
Consider an alternative approach (leveraging that last point):
# Convey to experts WP editors' need for MEDRS addressing particular topics (e.g. create a sortable list).
# Encourage experts to publish in open-access, rigorously peer-reviewed journal (or similar medium) with WP-friendly CC licensing. Note that as an author it may cost me in excess of US$3000 to make a paper open access in a first- or second-tier journal.
# Consider creating/supporting a new open-access, rigorously peer-reviewed journal to serve these purposes.
If I (and my colleagues) spent writing energies doing this, it would advance WP's goals in a qualitatively-different way from direct involvement as a WP editor (the two are not mutually exclusive, of course). In a peer-reviewed publication I would be able to use my expertise, modulated by co-authors and peer referees, to make clear statements that could find their way into WP. Similarly, I would have motivation to make high-quality vector graphics that could be re-used in WP.
These are just some off-the-cuff thoughts that I've been mulling for a [http://wikiconferenceusa.org/wiki/Submissions:2015/Are_the_Obstacles_Academic%3F possible discussion at the upcoming WikiConference in Washington DC]. Perhaps something like this has been proposed before (and shot down, perhaps)?  Stuart Ray ser:Soupvector|soupvector (ser talk:Soupvector|talk) 20:39, 14 September 2015 (UTC)
The journal (#3) has certainly been proposed. Really the problem is not the availability of sources (we have unfilled offers of access to (some) Elsevier and BMJ content for example), but a shortage of editors with the knowledge to understand the sources and (much easier to accquire) the Wikipedian experience to write them up in articles for a wide general readership. Suggestions as to sources (#1) on talk pages are helpful, but don't think that there's a pool of editors who will fall on them &amp; write them up. There isn't.  The first factors you mention are true, but can be relatively easily overcome - the different style required for a broad audience is actually probably more difficult (or so many of our articles suggest). If you already have the knowledge, improving, correcting and updating articles within your area of expertise is probably the most efficient way to help.  ser:Johnbod|Johnbod (ser talk:Johnbod|talk) 00:25, 15 September 2015 (UTC)
The journal has been proposed but only would publish the 61 Project Medicine Featured Articles, according to the description. Sixty one articles does not a journal make. The guidelines for a WP article to be included in such an open access journal would have to be altered OR a massive effort to improve med articles to FA status would have to begin. It is difficult enough to get an article to GA status in Project Medicine. |Soupvector I would love to see your ideas take hold and come to be.

This is not about re-publishing WP articles in journals.  It the opposite - it is about getting review articles written that we want or need, so we have sources on which to base WP articles.  Soupvector says that experts (doctors, scientists) generate reviews randomly/haphazardly and it costs them money if they publish the review in an open access journal. What soupvector is proposing is that Wikipedia somehow sponsor/drive/commission/promote the writing of reviews that it needs written to keep medical articles up to date.  My take on the suggestion, is that I am uncomfortable with it. There is something cart-driving-the-horse about it. ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 16:49, 17 September 2015 (UTC)
I don't generally think that we need reviews on whole subjects; outside of the (jillions of) rare diseases and experimental treatments, we can usually find something on what we need.  But we fairly often need a source that explicitly states some fact that experts consider too P:BLUE to bother writing down‚Äîespecially when we're dealing with a MEDRS warrior or POV pusher who is demanding a recent review article in a decent journal for not-exactly biomedical things, like how long a surgery usually takes or how satisfied patients are with the treatment or something like that.  But these are idiosyncratic things, and there's no good way to predict what we might find handy.  As a systematic issue, though, reviews that &quot;compare and contrast&quot; actual practice in different countries is very helpful.  An open-access source that says, &quot;In Rich Country, when we suspect malaria, we run all these tests, we treat with X and Y, we test again (and ignore the patient's social situation entirely), but in Poor Country, when we suspect malaria, we just tell them to go down to the corner store and pick up some anti-malarials over the counter (and then make sure that there's an auntie nearby to take care of the house and kids this week)&quot; is incredibly important.  A lot of review articles (especially systematic reviews) talk about what ought to be done in developed countries.  Finding good sources about actual reality, in all of its breadth and diversity, is harder than finding good sources about the ideal treatment.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:09, 18 September 2015 (UTC)
Heck yes |WhatamIdoing|WAID reliable sources that discuss actual clinical practice would be amazing; the compare and contrast b/n rich/poor countries would be amazinger.

I have been talking a bit with some people at PLOS Medicine about a wiki-collaboration. I am especially interested in PLOS's continued outstanding success of integrating with reddit to convene scientific conversations of hundreds of participants multiple times weekly, and to format, document, and archive the discussion with a doi on it. I think history is being made with this project of theirs, and I wish Wiki could be a part of it merely by being a partner to be sure to include the paper discussed in a relevant Wikipedia article. I wrote some about this at meta:Grants:IdeaLab/Reddit Science AMA + PLOS + Wikimedia. A couple of weeks ago I met in person with a PLOS staffer doing communications outreach and discussed doing more. He is open to hearing proposals and I am still thinking of what to suggest. If anyone wants to talk through something with me then consider pecial:EmailUser/Bluerasberry|emailing me for a video chat.

I can see advantages to making a list of topics for this purpose, as long as a few safeguards are in place. So e.g. I'd say that entries should be subject to consensus, they shouldn't be too specific (like a request for reporting of a specific fact or a specific research result), there shouldn't already be reviews available, and there should be enough primary literature available to support one - otherwise, we might end up promoting biased or low-quality sources. The list could double as a collection of topics for which editors could search for MEDRS that others may have missed. I also wouldn't prioritize open-access status over journal quality, since a few editors will still be able to access the articles, and the increased weight would let us include more information. ser:Sunrise|Sunrise (ser talk:Sunrise|talk) 00:01, 18 September 2015 (UTC)

Some time ago, I came upon ervous system, which [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nervous_system&amp;oldid=632605740#External_links at the time] had an insane collection of navboxes - three containers with a total of 10 navboxes, each of which had a complex structure. With the help of | Tryptofish, I narrowed the list down to two. But each of these templates, in addition to a large number of its own links, transcludes two &quot;Indexes&quot; to more templates. This was my first hint of a broader problem.

The articles in this WikiProject are in an advanced state of ikipedia:Avoid template creep|template creep and need surgery. I have never seen such a maze of templates before. Indeed, medical articles have a monopoly of the so-called index templates, also called subnavs, which are footer templates that provide links between templates instead of articles (see Category:Medicine navigational box footer templates).

I would like to explore a recent example of the supposed usefulness of these subnavs provided by at ikipedia:Templates_for_discussion/Log/2015_June_7#Template:Infestation_navs|a recent TfD:

*Case study 1: A person is diagnosed with heart disease and wants to know more about treatment and relevant anatomy. The subnavs provide easy links.

To see how this works, I go to eart disease, which redirects to ardiovascular disease. At the bottom of the page, I see four navboxes. If I expand the second (l|Heart diseases), I see a three-layered hierarchy of link groups. Seeing something like that, my inclination would be to abandon the navbox and try a search (see below). But suppose I carry on, wading through dozens of terms like onckeberg's arteriosclerosis, and eventually make it down to a box titled &quot;Index of the circulatory system&quot; (which is l|Vascular navs). And there I see a link to anatomy and a group devoted to treatment. If I click on &quot;Anatomy&quot; I get another template, l|Arteries and veins, with another two-level hierarchy and l|Vascular navs transcluded at the bottom. At which point only the fear of death would keep me from giving up.

But is that how someone is likely to look for this information? The first thing I would try is searching ardiovascular disease for &quot;anatomy&quot; and &quot;treatment&quot;. If I search &quot;anatomy&quot; and the navboxes are in their normal, hidden state (because there are four of them), I get no hits. So how about &quot;treatment&quot;? Now here is something really strange. The word appears nine times in the article - and none of them are linked to anything, despite the existence of anagement of heart failure. There is a section, ardiovascular disease#Management, with a single sentence in it: &quot;Cardiovascular disease is treatable with initial treatment primarily focused on diet and lifestyle interventions.&quot;

Anyone who really wants to help that person diagnosed with heart disease would do something like this: Expand ardiovascular disease#Management into a decent summary of anagement of heart failure and link to it with a l|main template. Or, if that is not general enough, create anagement of cardiovascular disease and summarize it.

So much for &quot;easy links&quot;. But it goes much further than that. Say we click on one of the less general links in l|Heart diseases, like itral valve. This is an anatomy article, and does not itself transclude l|Heart diseases. But it does transclude l|Heart anatomy, which transcludes l|Heart navs. So this anatomy article has access to several templates for drugs. How likely is it that a user will find this useful?

Wikipedia provides P:NAVBOX|guidelines that are intended to make navboxes useful. It states,
uote|Navigation templates are particularly useful for a small, well-defined group of articles; templates with a large numbers of links are not forbidden, but can appear overly busy and be hard to read and use. Good templates generally follow some of these guidelines:
# All articles within a template relate to a single, coherent subject.
# The subject of the template should be mentioned in every article.
# The articles should refer to each other, to a reasonable extent. 
# There should be a Wikipedia article on the subject of the template.
# If not for the navigation template, an editor would be inclined to link many of these articles in the P:SEEALSO|See also sections of the articles.
But what is the subject of l|Heart navs - eart or eart navboxes? As for the other guidelines, how would you even check them? Over 750 articles transclude l|Heart navs, but it wasn't placed directly on any of them. However, it is pretty obvious that any given article will refer only to a very small fraction of the others. When you add a subnav to a template, you are, in effect, giving up on the guidelines.

The guidelines also suggest, &quot;If the collection of articles does not meet these tests, that indicates that the articles are loosely related, and a list or category may be more appropriate.&quot; I am going to make a proposal here rather than at a TfD, because I would like to give editors the chance to cooperatively brainstorm a solution.

Proposal: Delete all of the templates in Category:Medicine navigational box footer templates, or replace them by lists or categories. ser:RockMagnetist|RockMagnetist(ser talk:RockMagnetist|talk) 21:27, 9 September 2015 (UTC)

Clarification: Replace some of the templates in Category:Medicine navigational box footer templates by lists or categories, delete the rest. ser:RockMagnetist|RockMagnetist(ser talk:RockMagnetist|talk) 22:46, 9 September 2015 (UTC)

so..you do seem to have a point, however something &quot;in between&quot; 1. deleting all the templates (in Med[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Medicine_navigational_box_footer_templates]) and 2.replace with lists might be more balanced (having said that, I believe more opinions would be best)--ser:Ozzie10aaaa|Ozzie10aaaa (ser talk:Ozzie10aaaa|talk) 21:47, 9 September 2015 (UTC)
If you mean, delete some and replace others by lists, that sounds reasonable (I wasn't really implying an all or nothing scenario). Some templates might convert into good categories or lists, others may not be suitable. ser:RockMagnetist|RockMagnetist(ser talk:RockMagnetist|talk) 22:26, 9 September 2015 (UTC)

Rock, this may seem a little indirect, but I can offer you a complete and immediate, if superficial, solution to the problem.  Just go to https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease and you will see the the navbox problem is completely removed.  Also, if you are reaching the age at which resbyopia becomes an issue, then you may find that you like that display anyway.  Quite a few readers using that even on desktop systems.  And, on a more serious note, if anyone's hoping that readers will use navboxes to reach important, related articles, you should note that navboxes are completely invisible to 30% of our readers.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 22:46, 9 September 2015 (UTC)

I mean &quot;not able to be seen&quot;.  Follow the link, scroll to the bottom, and see what ser:RockMagnetist|you see.  Navboxes are not displayed on the Mobile site, and that's about 30% of our page views.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 21:15, 10 September 2015 (UTC)

O.k., here is a demo where I replace l|Ear navs by ikipedia talk:WikiProject Medicine/Outline of the ear|Outline of the ear. Mostly the links in this demo are to articles, but &quot;Inner ear&quot; links to ikipedia talk:WikiProject Medicine/Outline of the inner ear|Outline of the inner ear. There would also be outlines of the outer and middle ears, but the rest of the links would continue to be to articles. This outline cuts across the templates listed by l|Ear navs, many of which have a group for the inner ear. Links to these outlines would have to be added to the See also section of articles. This would increase the likelihood of it only being added where it is useful. ser:RockMagnetist|RockMagnetist(ser talk:RockMagnetist|talk) 04:16, 10 September 2015 (UTC)
Thanks for your gentle introduction to this topic, |RockMagnetist. Links between medical templates have existed since at least 2008, and recently with some other users I attempted to make these templates somewhat more useable, with a goal to reduce the (huge) amount of navboxes plastered on our many articles by linking them . 

Part of your frustration with this template series seems to relate to the incomprehensible jargon we use to describe medical articles and medical diagnosis. This is a frustrating fact of life and with any luck will improve within the next 200-300 years as we move away from Latin and Greek-based names. 

For these &quot;indexes&quot;, I use these links occasionally myself but having been editing them I am not too impartial about their use. I would love to hear from any editors who have used these to good end. A question that hasn't been asked at any point in the last 6+ years is are these templates actually useful. A few long-term editors agreed last TFD but I am really unsure what other users think and if actual readers use them. 

If we get rid of them we should consider removing them completely, as in my experience in the dusty corners of Wikipedia outlines are either forgotten for many years and unusable for that reason, or excessively edited with links from all and sundry that they are also unusable. On the other hand I fear if we remove these links we may end up with users adding more and more navboxes again. Hoping to hear from other users, --ser:LT910001|Tom (LT) (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 09:06, 10 September 2015 (UTC)

eply to|LT910001|label=Tom (LT) Thanks for keeping an open mind on this - always hard when something you have worked on is challenged. I hope that anyone who has found them useful will provide some details. In the TfD, you were the only one who did. Some people will go to a deletion debate and more or less equate &quot;navbox&quot; with &quot;useful navigation tool.&quot; But is it as useful as it could be? ser:RockMagnetist|RockMagnetist(ser talk:RockMagnetist|talk) 15:52, 10 September 2015 (UTC)

As for delete vs. outline, I lean towards delete; I just provided the demo as an option to consider. Also, I don't think the way to prevent users from adding navboxes is to add meta-navboxes; that just changes the baseline for template creep, and navboxes get added anyway, as the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nervous_system&amp;oldid=632605740#External_links Nervous system example] demonstrated. ser:RockMagnetist|RockMagnetist(ser talk:RockMagnetist|talk) 15:57, 10 September 2015 (UTC)

I think that considering specific examples will make it easier to think about these templates. So I will do two more case studies from the TfD. I will describe my experience as I try the exercises:
*Case study 2: A student has an exam on the nervous system. The subnav provides links to all the relevant anatomical templates for the said area.
*:The first thing that occurs to me is, if I were facing an exam, would I rely on Wikipedia instead of a textbook? But, pressing on, I go to ervous system. I look at the table of contents and see ervous_system#Anatomy_in_vertebrates|Anatomy in vertebrates. This section has a link at the top to ist of nerves of the human body, and it has a discussion in prose of how the nervous system is organized. Possibly good enough already. Now I go to the bottom of the page, and see l|Nervous system. This has a nice, compact list of articles on the main parts of the nervous system. Below it are l|Central nervous system navs and l|Peripheral nervous system navs, with links to templates on many of the same subjects. However, if I want to know more about the eninges, I have already clicked on the article link. I know that emplate:Meninges|meninges is different from eninges; but that would never occur to a first-time user. ser:RockMagnetist|RockMagnetist(ser talk:RockMagnetist|talk) 16:18, 10 September 2015 (UTC)
*Case study 3: A lay reader wants to know about what bones we have in our body, but don't know their names. The templates provide easy links to said bones by body part.
*:I start at one. A quick scan gives me the impression that this article is mainly about the structure, development and so on of individual bones. I try uman anatomy, which redirects me to uman body. Browsing this, I see a link to uman skeleton (now why didn't I think of that immediately?). This has the section uman skeleton#Divisions|Divisions, with a few lines each for xial skeleton and ppendicular skeleton. Now, I must admit, this is a bit slow, so I try going to the bottom. I find a box, &quot;Bones of the human skeleton&quot;, with 7 templates inside of it, all but one of them massive and multi-leveled, and all of them transcluding l|Bone and cartilage navs, which in turn links to all of them. Just think of the reduction in complexity if l|Bone and cartilage navs were here instead of all those templates! But l|Bones of skeleton without any subnav might be even better. 

At this point it occurs to me that I went to the navboxes earlier than usual because I am discussing them. Normally, I would look at uman_skeleton#See_also|See also first. So I go there, and what do I find? ist of bones of the human skeleton. ser:RockMagnetist|RockMagnetist(ser talk:RockMagnetist|talk) 16:45, 10 September 2015 (UTC)
I must be crazy, because I don't find this system terribly difficult to navigate, and these little user vignettes read to me like scripts for the wiki-equivalent of those late-night infomercials involving someone who sets their kitchen on fire trying to boil water. I don't object to simplifying it - it's certainly unusual to have meta-templates that navigate between other templates - but converting to outlines doesn't really appeal to me; those things are un-watched and un-edited backwaters, and the vertical-ness makes them harder to read than the condensed navbox format. ser:Opabinia regalis|Opabinia regalis (ser talk:Opabinia regalis|talk) 17:10, 10 September 2015 (UTC)
No doubt the more you use this system, the better you get at using them - and the less you need them. Each of the indexes has a doc page that says &quot;These are geared towards lay readers&quot;. I am an appropriate person to test them on - lots of experience with Wikipedia, but not a lot of medical knowledge. And the thing to note about my case studies is that I can get the information I'm looking for very quickly if I ignore the navboxes. Hardly setting the kitchen on fire. ser:RockMagnetist|RockMagnetist(ser talk:RockMagnetist|talk) 17:24, 10 September 2015 (UTC)
Well, I don't really use this system often - I work on molecular biology articles; anything as big as a bone is beyond me ;) - though I did look into it when one of these was TfD'd awhile ago. No doubt the navbox pileup at the bottom of an article like uman skeleton is a problem, but I'm not sure what the best solution is. Separate &quot;outline&quot;-type articles with navbox-y formatting maybe. ser:Opabinia regalis|Opabinia regalis (ser talk:Opabinia regalis|talk) 17:43, 10 September 2015 (UTC)
The truth is, the above scenarios are how I would search for information if I started within Wikipedia (because otherwise navboxes couldn't possibly help me). But that's not how I really look for information. I would go to Google and do the following (by case number):
# Search [https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;es_th=1&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=heart+disease+treatment heart disease treatment]. No Wikipedia pages in sight, so maybe I would go to the Mayo Clinic page.
# Search [https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;es_th=1&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=anatomy%20of%20nervous%20system&amp;es_th=1 anatomy of nervous system]. No Wikipedia pages in sight, so just for the heck of it I [https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;es_th=1&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=anatomy+of+nervous+system+site:en.wikipedia.org restrict it to en.wikipedia.org]. The first hit is for ervous system, and I follow &quot;Jump to anatomy in vertebrates&quot;, which lands me at the section by that name, where the link to ist of nerves of the human body is at the top.
# Search [https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;es_th=1&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=bones%20in%20the%20human%20body&amp;es_th=1 bones in the human body]. The top link is to ist of bones of the human skeleton. 
That was 30 seconds or less for each search. I think the moral of this story is, structure the articles well and you won't need navboxes at all. ser:RockMagnetist|RockMagnetist(ser talk:RockMagnetist|talk) 17:44, 10 September 2015 (UTC)
On the question of usefulness:  They are doubtless &quot;useful&quot; for de-P:ORPHANing articles.  They may be used significantly by a small number of editors.  Whether anyone else uses them is unclear.  It seems unlikely that typical readers use them very much.  As I said above, they're systematically stripped out of the mobile version.  You can't see them, and therefore you can't use them (even if you go to the navbox's page in the template namespace) there.  Therefore we can guarantee that 30% of readers aren't using them, and despite these being invisible on the mobile site for a very long time, I have never heard a complaint about their absence.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 21:39, 10 September 2015 (UTC)

@|RockMagnetist I think you are conflating three issues, all quite relevant:
# We do not name articles in a way that is easy for readers to understand
# We use way too many navboxes in our articles
# Our navboxes are overburned by these internal link boxes.
Issues (1) and (2) won't be solved in this discussion but will be by editing away -- and I've opened a thread at T:ANAT|the talk page of Wikiproject Anatomy to see what we can do there, also. With regard to these internal navboxes, what would you think about moving them to template space or template documentation? You may a good point as to why they may not be used by readers, but they are supremely useful in part because they help keep track of our project's numerous templates, ensuring that we don't start to have duplicate ones. So one option would be to move them all so they only display in template namespace. This will mean readers are no longer confused. An alternate option would be to include all of the 'index' templates as collapsed, so that only a line &quot;Index of...&quot; is displayed and users can open it at will. --ser:LT910001|Tom (LT) (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 22:59, 11 September 2015 (UTC)
Conflating these issues is hard to avoid in a case study. I think the naming is not a big problem because the redirects work well. Article content may be more of an issue (more below). Absolutely you use too many navboxes and the navboxes have too many links. I'm not sure what you mean by moving the internal navboxes to template space, since they are already there; but moving them to documentation pages is a good idea. ser:RockMagnetist|RockMagnetist(ser talk:RockMagnetist|talk) 23:55, 11 September 2015 (UTC)
And now I would like to say something positive about the internal navboxes. They are well organized; I like the division into description, disease and treatment. Some of the articles like ardiovascular disease would benefit from closer alignment with their content. And, converted into regular templates linking to articles, they would be an improvement over some of the existing regular templates. ser:RockMagnetist|RockMagnetist(ser talk:RockMagnetist|talk) 23:55, 11 September 2015 (UTC)
While a navbox may appear redundant to a category or list, it is not the same as a single category, a group of categories under one parent category, or a list. Each section of a navbox may seem to be a carbon copy of a category or list, but that is not always the case, and in many cases, the navbox &quot;categories&quot; do not reflect Wikipedia's custom for creating and organizing categories or for lists.,,,The success of navboxes can be seen in ser:Sebwite/navbox study|this (uncontrolled) study of emplate:Commercial air travel|this navbox, which has shown that in the month following its creation, readership of the articles contained within increased by 8.5% (an average of 406 views per article) and editing of these pages increased by 37% from the month prior to its creation [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:A_navbox_on_every_page]--ser:Ozzie10aaaa|Ozzie10aaaa (ser talk:Ozzie10aaaa|talk) 22:44, 16 September 2015 (UTC)

Reading through the above, I'm not convinced you've really shown a convincing reason or consensus for a change. I've minimised the extraneous comments in your case studies to illustrate this. I think unfortunately most of your frustration emerges from the way we've structured our articles. I just don't see a way to solve the problem you pose (how to keep navboxes small and compact in an up-to-date way) without using a system like this to ensure that the templates are compartmentalised. Perhaps &quot;Index of...&quot; could be renamed to be even more clear, or a small (?) question mark could be provided with an explanation for lay users to explain what these subnavs do.--ser:LT910001|Tom (LT) (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 10:21, 23 September 2015 (UTC)

*Case study 1: A person is diagnosed with heart disease and wants to know more about treatment and relevant anatomy. The subnavs provide easy links.

To see how this works, I go to eart disease, which redirects to ardiovascular disease. At the bottom of the page, I see four navboxes. If I expand the second (l|Heart diseases), I see a three-layered hierarchy of link groups. Seeing something like that, my inclination would be to abandon the navbox and try a search (see below). But suppose I carry on, wading through dozens of terms like onckeberg's arteriosclerosis, and eventually make it down to a box titled &quot;Index of the circulatory system&quot; (which is l|Vascular navs). And there I see a link to anatomy and a group devoted to treatment. If I click on &quot;Anatomy&quot; I get another template, l|Arteries and veins, with another two-level hierarchy and l|Vascular navs transcluded at the bottom. At which point only the fear of death would keep me from giving up.
*Case study 2: A student has an exam on the nervous system. The subnav provides links to all the relevant anatomical templates for the said area.
*:The first thing that occurs to me is, if I were facing an exam, would I rely on Wikipedia instead of a textbook? But, pressing on, I go to ervous system.

Below it are l|Central nervous system navs and l|Peripheral nervous system navs, with links to templates on many of the same subjects. However, if I want to know more about the eninges, I have already clicked on the article link.

Just think of the reduction in complexity if l|Bone and cartilage navs were here instead of all those templates! But l|Bones of skeleton without any subnav might be even better.
So basically you're saying, skip the article and the regular navboxes and go straight to the index boxes? All the rest is &quot;extraneous&quot;? I think you're having a hard time visualizing how a first-time user might approach this page because you have been developing these indices for so long. One view of how regular users behave is to look at page views, because if you use a link in an index box, you actually visit a navbox. In the last 30 days, 29,049 readers visited ardiovascular disease, 492 visited l|Arteries and veins. And the latter is linked to over 50 other navboxes through l|Vascular navs. One of the links in l|Arteries and veins is to enous plexus. This is a stub with no references, yet it got 781 hits in the last 30 days. Unfortunately, I know of no way to determine how often a regular navbox is used because readers can click one of its links without visiting it. But clearly it's the index boxes that are extraneous. ser:RockMagnetist|RockMagnetist(ser talk:RockMagnetist|talk) 16:19, 24 September 2015 (UTC)
On second thought, I can get some idea of how often the regular navboxes are used because a lot of them duplicate lists. For example, l|Heart diseases duplicates a lot of ist of ICD-9 codes 390‚Äì459: diseases of the circulatory system, which got 4430 hits in the last 30 days, and ist of ICD-9 codes 760‚Äì779: certain conditions originating in the perinatal period, which got 2606 hits. And they got all of these hits even though most of the links to them are through navboxes. ser:RockMagnetist|RockMagnetist(ser talk:RockMagnetist|talk) 16:51, 24 September 2015 (UTC)
Actually I'm equally confused about what you're saying, |RockMagnetist. You identify that index boxes are confusing. Yet you also lump together a whole lot of other concerns about they way our articles are linked. My point is that removing index boxes won't fix any of those other concerns. So by fixing index boxes (or removing them) we get rid of any of the problems in clear text. However the preceding problems (which I have struck through) remain. --ser:LT910001|Tom (LT) (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 23:43, 26 September 2015 (UTC)
These things you refer to as &quot;conflating&quot; and &quot;lumping together&quot; are what I call &quot;context&quot;. The purpose of all those numbers is to compare the use of an index box with the use of links from the article itself and in regular navboxes. The answer is not definitive, but it does seem to suggest that index boxes are used very little compared to the alternatives. However, I think it is worth exploring the usefulness of certain groups of regular navboxes as well. ser:RockMagnetist|RockMagnetist(ser talk:RockMagnetist|talk) 01:09, 27 September 2015 (UTC)

Here is another statistic that might be easier to understand: l|Vascular navs links to 32 navboxes. Collectively, in the past 30 days, they were visited 13,856 times.for an average of 433 per navbox (the min was 142 and the max was 676  - a remarkably tight grouping). The index box appears in about 1600 articles. Thus, it was used an average of 9 times per article over 30 days.What we don't know is how many of the people who arrived at the navboxes actually made use of them At the other end, I would estimate the navboxes have a total of about 1000 links, so on average each target article was accessed about 13 times. Is it really necessary to gather more information? ser:RockMagnetist|RockMagnetist(ser talk:RockMagnetist|talk) 02:12, 27 September 2015 (UTC)

Note that the above only provides information on access to the navboxes through the index template. The navboxes themselves might be useful because they are transcluded in each of the articles that they are linked to. That is the kind of thing that could be studied by the method described below. ser:RockMagnetist|RockMagnetist(ser talk:RockMagnetist|talk) 07:09, 27 September 2015 (UTC)

Decision point
Okay, guys:  How serious about this are we?  I see some comments here that may degenerate into my-link-is-better-than-your-link, but the fact is that nobody has the overall data.

There is a kludge that will let us see how often links in navboxes get clicked on, if we really want the information.  It won't let us separate search engine spiders from real humans, but it will let us get page view counts for clicking a link in a navbox vs other ways of reaching the page.  It's not elegant, and it's got some small P:PERF costs, so we shouldn't do this on a grand scale, but we could certainly try it out for a small number of links in one or two navboxes.  

Is that interesting to you?  More to the point, is it interesting enough to two or three editors to do the work involved?  It'll take an hour to pick templates and links, an hour to set it up, a few minutes each day to check the links for problems/potential corruption, and (after a few weeks or so) an hour to revert the whole setup, and an hour or two to collect the data and write it up.  Whether anybody uses these navboxes would actually be a useful thing for WPMED to know, and the results would probably be more or less applicable to all subject areas at the English Wikipedia.  But it takes sustained work over the course of a month, and there's no point in starting if the project won't be finished.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 19:10, 24 September 2015 (UTC)

I like that. It would be interesting to gather some information. I can't guarantee that I could be involved the whole way - next month, real life will be pretty demanding for me. I think the experiment should be carefully designed, with links to closely related and more remote articles. Here is one possible set:
One article that is mentioned frequently in ardiovascular disease: e.g., ascular disease
*in article body
*in l|Medical conditions as a lower level link to an article
*as a main article for l|Vascular diseases
*as a top-level entry in l|Cardiovascular system symptoms and signs (accessed through l|Heart navs)
One that is not mentioned as such but is in at least one regular navbox: e.g., itral stenosis
*link in l|Heart diseases:
*link in l|Congenital heart defects (accessed through l|Heart navs)
One that is not linked in the article or any regular navbox: e.g., uperficial vein
*link in l|Arteries and veins (accessed through l|Heart navs)
For a bonus, we might want to look at connections between these lower-level articles.
A possible control experiment: replace any templates that duplicate lists by links to the lists in ‚Äò‚ÄôSee also‚Äô‚Äô:
*e.g., l|Heart diseases -&gt; CD-10 Chapter IX: Diseases of the circulatory system, ist of ICD-9 codes 390‚Äì459: diseases of the circulatory system.

There's no rush.  If somebody else volunteers to help out (always good to have more than one editor involved, because real life happens) and nobody objects, then we could start by picking a couple of navboxes and targets, which will save us some time when we actually want to do it.  We could make a list of things to test and how to do it at a page like P:WikiProject Medicine/Navboxes.  
I kind of like the idea of using an actual random number generator to pick which links we'll test in the navbox.  We can change some links and not others.  Does that sound good to you?    ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 14:25, 25 September 2015 (UTC)
Yes, a separate page sounds like a good idea. I think random choices are good in principle, but some thought still needs to go in the implementation. I think it's best to have controls in the experiment, which is why I suggested comparing different ways of getting between the same pair of articles. Also, since the purpose of index boxes (as I see it) is to provide links that are not in the article or regular navboxes, we should compare links from each of the three groups I described above. Another control experiment is my idea of replacing navboxes by lists and monitoring them for the same length of time as the navboxes. ser:RockMagnetist|RockMagnetist(ser talk:RockMagnetist|talk) 14:57, 25 September 2015 (UTC)
I'd be very interested in a data-driven approach that may have implications for our navboxes in general. emplate_talk:Medicine_navs is a place we've been centralising discussion about this and may be a suitable hub while we investigate what impact (if any) these index boxes have. --ser:LT910001|Tom (LT) (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 23:43, 26 September 2015 (UTC)

It might be slow, but it'll be higher traffic than a brand-new page.  Why don't we copy this whole thing over there, and make some plans?  We can always post reminders here about it if we need extra input.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 15:23, 27 September 2015 (UTC)
Good point. I think it should be prefaced by a set of proposals, so we know what we're trying to find out. I will do that in a new subsection. ser:RockMagnetist|RockMagnetist(ser talk:RockMagnetist|talk) 15:53, 27 September 2015 (UTC)

Proposals
Here are my suggestions for how to fix the template creep in the articles covered by this project. They go beyond my initial point about index templates, but that is necessary because the index templates themselves were designed to fix template creep. I think the suggestions below are consistent with the ikipedia:Navigation templates#Properties|principles behind good navbox design.

# Delete the index templates or move them to project space.
# Before deleting each index template, examine each navbox that they link to, and do two things:
## Eliminate excessive levels of hierarchy (for example, in l|Arteries of head and neck, go no deeper than the link to axillary artery).
## Make sure that each navbox is transcluded on the remaining pages that it links to and only those pages.
# If there are still a lot of boxes on some pages, for each page see if the article subject is closely related to the other subjects in each navbox (i.e., the articles are likely to link to each other directly). If not, take them off the template.
 
I would also recommend removing those templates that duplicate lists of ist of ICD-9 codes|ICD-9 codes and CD-10#List|ICD-10 codes and replace them by links to those lists in See also. In general, these templates are long and intricate, and the information is better presented as a list. ser:RockMagnetist|RockMagnetist(ser talk:RockMagnetist|talk) 16:09, 27 September 2015 (UTC)

Dear medical experts:  Is this draft: ser:Pawangangwar/sandbox about a recognized medical condition?‚Äîser:Anne Delong|Anne Delong (ser talk:Anne Delong|talk) 12:02, 29 September 2015 (UTC)
No evidence of such on PubMed and nothing on Google Scholar either. Not a recognized medical condition based on this I'd say. More like a colloquial term for a discomfort, I guess.ser:Jo-Jo Eumerus|Jo-Jo Eumerus (ser talk:Jo-Jo Eumerus|talk, pecial:Contributions/Jo-Jo Eumerus|contributions) 12:11, 29 September 2015 (UTC)
