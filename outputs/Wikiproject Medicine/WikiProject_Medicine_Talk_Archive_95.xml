 Problem pages, ibration therapy again 

Last month you guys took a good look at a page which was subsequently deleted: Cycloidal vibration therapy, particularly ing|user:RexxS who looked at all the citations for MEDRS. Unfortunately there looks like a whole industry of pages out there usually being edited by the same editors, and I would appreciate if someone has the time to look at these two: alileo (vibration training) (incidentally one of the editor's IP (217.92.49.4) is novotecmedical.de which you can probably guess what they make). And hole body vibration which is again being edited by a bunch of single issue editors, like Samvesey, Rrawer, Belsius (to whom ing|user:DGG has kindly given a final warning) and that same IP editor from the Galileo page. seems to me they could all be the same editor, or working as a team but i've no idea how you would find that out without looking into their accounts. I expect if you look through their edit histories there are more pages like this. Anyway, I appreciate it's a drag but if someone can look at these and check i'm not being paranoid, and see if these pages are giant adverts again, hopefully get rid of them, I would really appreciate your help. As an aside can you let me know if it's ok to bring things here to be checked for MEDRS or is there an piece of software I can use to save you having to check that aspect? I have no medical background although I have a BSc degree. Many thanks ser:Mramoeba|Mramoeba (ser talk:Mramoeba|talk) 16:19, 2 March 2017 (UTC)

Thanks for following up on this.  
I'm going to guess that there's some demand for an article about the idea of vibration as a weight-loss or exercise tool.  Sometimes, creating a half-decent article reduces spam.  It could start with the [http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/objects/display?id=92808 Battle Creek Health Builder], which seems to be the original model, and progress up to the modern versions.

Efficacy depends upon the condition.  It could be effective for certain sub-types of CP without being effective for (e.g.,) weight loss or frailty syndrome.  A well-written article will point out both the nonsense (&quot;Buy this belly-vibrating machine to lose weight without diet or exercise!  Only $39.95 if you act now!&quot;) and the sense. 
Is everyone okay with ibration therapy for the main article name? ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 20:34, 5 March 2017 (UTC)
Or more likely, more effective for those at more severe MFCS levels (who are also more likely to have bone density issues) than those at milder levels - although the article doesn't say much about the variance in CP.  I've currently got WBV in the optimistic 'other' section of the P management article, rather than the 'alt med' section. :/ --pecial:Contributions/122.108.141.214|122.108.141.214 (ser talk:122.108.141.214|talk) 20:45, 5 March 2017 (UTC)

 P:UNDUE at nterior cruciate ligament? 
ile:Knee diagram.svg|thumb|Knee diagram/Anterior cruciate ligament(left side)
In amongst some useful information there is a lot of what looks like rubbish being inserted by what appears to be a P:SPA. 

&quot;Arthrometry is considered the most reliable technique of laximetry. The medical devices using arthrometry are called arthrometers and are used to put the Anterior Cruciate Ligament under stress in a controlled manner (this was not always the case as the first arthrometers required the user to use his own strength to run the tests). Over time, tests progressively evolved from static tests (single force applied on the tibia) to dynamic tests which are now considered much more precise (several forces applied on the tibia). The reason to this change is that dynamic tests allows the drawing of the ACL's stiffness curve which is a biomechanical parameter of knee ligaments. It is highly correlated with the clinical symptoms of instability. It is more accurate than laxity which is a numerical value without mechanical significance.ite journal|last=Rohman|first=Eric M.|last2=Macalena|first2=Jeffrey A.|date=2016-03-16|title=Anterior cruciate ligament assessment using arthrometry and stress imaging|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4896874/|journal=Current Reviews in Musculoskeletal Medicine|volume=9|issue=2|pages=130–138|doi=10.1007/s12178-016-9331-1|issn=1935-973X|pmc=4896874|pmid=26984335&quot;


Perhaps this is cutting edge but this is not something I have ever heard of. Seeking some advice from other editors. Is this cutting edge or P:UNDUE to be placed on nterior cruciate ligament? The pseudoscience gobbledegook and palindromic tautologous structure are what worry me most (&quot;which is a biomechanical parameter of knee ligaments. It is highly correlated with the clinical symptoms of instability&quot;) Thoughts? --ser:LT910001|Tom (LT) (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 11:33, 1 March 2017 (UTC)

Perhaps a more general form of your question is, &quot;Is cutting edge UNDUE?&quot; (assuming that it's actually cutting edge, which is something that someone else will have to comment on).  I think that the answer might be that it depends upon context – what else is in the article and where it's placed.
I don't might the effort to explain things in plain English.  But overall, I think it needs some copyediting.  For example, I'd change the bit about &quot;this was not always the case&quot; to a plain statement of fact about the contrast between different device models over time:  &quot;Early arthrometers were mechanical devices operated by a person's own strength; some newer ones are electrical&quot; (or whatever the actual facts boil down to).  Is that a helpful approach to the more stylistic part of your question?  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 20:23, 1 March 2017 (UTC)
It does sound quite a lot like an advertisement. From my own experience laximetry is not common at all, and the being absolutely accurate (or even reliable ) isn't than important. 
Whether a knee is operated on depends on a number of factors, of which the exact degree of laxity seems arbitrary and of minor importance. The degree of symptoms and their severity seem far more relevant, especially considering the newer meta-analyses which show how ACL-reconstruction is no more effective than placebo.
Now this is off the top of my head, and I could have something mixed up, but it seems like a good idea to check who wrote this and look into whether it actually belongs. ser:CFCF|Carl Fredrikser talk:CFCF| 💌 pecial:EmailUser/CFCF|📧 23:19, 1 March 2017 (UTC)

Actually much of their information is pretty horrible, and the composition is very opaque: does not show sources, does not take into account any COI, and often does not give an accurate or full picture. Anyone can partner with doctors, without systematic methodology that does not mean any good will come out of it.

In my experience, the DMOZ pages have not been very good in recent years.  I just spot-checked a few:  half have seen no updates during the last year.  On the one about autism, which was allegedly updated just a few weeks ago, one of the NIH links is broken, the most recent news story is from 2006, one goes to a dead internet forum (most recent post from July 2016), and one of the links is filled with ads for &quot;natural viagra&quot;.  I don't think that's really helping readers, and I'm pretty sure that we could find a better option.
All of DMOZ is mirrored by several sites (including the one that the template has been redirected to), but I don't think that a link to a copy of a page that was last updated a year or two ago by a DMOZ volunteer is going to continue to have value for readers in the long-run.  Websites get re-arranged.  Links die.  Information goes out of date.  And even if you think a DMOZ mirror or an archived copy of DMOZ pages is a good way to ward off spam here, MEDMOS shouldn't say that DMOZ itself exists, because that is false.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 22:20, 15 March 2017 (UTC)

As far as I can tell, there wasn't a real consensus developed in the previous discussion.  To completely remove the OR issue, a new ara|pubmed-type parameter in l|cite journal may be needed.

One of the main concerns I have with putting the 'review' field on l|cite journal is that the template is used for many other disciplines' articles, so it might confuse them.  Is there a ARC standards|MARC field for &quot;Review&quot;, &quot;Original Research&quot;, &quot;Case Study&quot; etc.?

Would not be original research. We would be using pubmed as a source. Pubmed calls it &quot;publication type&quot; and the type we would be recording is &quot;review&quot; which is what they call it.

 It would appear that MARC standards apply to books and serials (journals and magazines), not individual articles within a journal. Various citation style guides mention magazine departments or article types.  For example,   Per Chicago 16: &quot;14.202 MAGAZINE DEPARTMENTS. Titles of regular departments in a magazine are capitalized headline-style but not put in quotation marks.&quot;  The National Library of Medicine Style Guide refers to an optional [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7282/#A32443 Article Type] that if present should appear in brackets after the article title. Likewise both the APA and MLA styles require that citations of [http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k70847&amp;pageid=icb.page363226#a_icb_pagecontent763087_review reviews] and [http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k70847&amp;pageid=icb.page363226#a_icb_pagecontent763087_letter letters to the editor] be designated as such after the title. ser:Boghog|Boghog (ser talk:Boghog|talk) 06:34, 7 March 2017 (UTC)

Hey all,

Just a quick heads-up that no one will be able to edit for about 30 minutes on either Wednesday, 19 April and Wednesday, 3 May 2017.  The time hasn't been set, but it will probably happen in the European afternoons/American mornings – maybe 14:00 UTC.  More information is at m:Tech/Server switch 2017.  The official schedule is at ikitech:Switch Datacenter.  (That page is also the place to check for any last-minute delays; the most likely sizes of delay are one hour/one day/one week.)

The fact that so few hard endpoints are used in psychiatric research is a valid criticism made by most of those in academic medicine. 
The same criticisms are raised in other areas of medicine as well. Surrogate markers have led us astray many times. Ie lower HbA1C is not necessarily better quality of life or better long term outcomes. Estrogen replacement improved surrogate markers for high disease but was later determined to increase rates of heart disease.

However we might view this book, the fact of the matter is that there is a long history of tragic pediatric mistakes in psychiatric and general practice, in uses of psychoactive medications, designed for safety in adults, and being prescribed off-label with regard to age of patient (but for same disorder), and even experimentally, off label both for age and for different disorders—based on research-like suppositions made by individual clinicians, and many based on the errant notion that children are nothing more (physiologically, pharmacologically, etc.) than &quot;little people&quot;.

 There is a distinct, unique, alarming, and specific issue in pediatric cases, widely recognised by experts, given the way in which therapeutics are brought to market (e.g., in the way in which clinical trials have historically been restricted in design to adult populations), and the way in which adult clinical trial results have been used by clinicians to justify application of adult-safe therapeutics in yet-developing children in pediatric populations.

 Carcinogenesis 

Ok, so there's a recent paper at 
Cristian Tomasetti, Lu Li, Bert Vogelstein. &quot;Stem cell divisions, somatic mutations, cancer etiology, and cancer prevention&quot; Science 24 Mar 2017: Vol. 355, Issue 6331, pp. 1330-1334 OI|10.1126/science.aaf9011 

It has lots of quick-reviews such as 
[https://medicalxpress.com/news/2017-03-cancer-mutations-due-random-dna.html New study finds that most cancer mutations are due to random DNA copying 'mistakes'] Medicalxpress

It essentially confirms the same authors' earlier work:
Cristian Tomasetti, Bert Vogelstein. &quot;Variation in cancer risk among tissues can be explained by the number of stem cell divisions&quot; Science 02 Jan 2015 Vol. 347, Issue 6217, pp. 78-81 OI|10.1126/science.1260825 

In essence, it's a detailed analysis to back up and quantify the apparently-obvious (at least to the lay reader) assertion that cell types which are very common and which divide often are more likely to mutate and become cancerous. The articles arcinogenesis, auses of cancer, and ancer seem to overlook this line of thought.

Would someone care to address this? ser:LeadSongDog|LeadSongDog ser talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl! 21:04, 24 March 2017 (UTC)

Some editors tried to add some information about this last time, and (grossly oversimplifying), and they (we?  I can't actually remember whether I was directly involved) were told that it violated the letter of MEDRS because it was &quot;only&quot; a primary source, and more incidentally, that we should censor this information on the grounds of public health, because people who are smoking/obese/sedentary/eating nothing but beer and pizza won't change their lifestyles if they were told (accurately) that &quot;most&quot; cancer can't be prevented through diet and exercise.  I've got more sympathy for the former, although the latter is absolutely true:  people, including me, are bad at statistics.  On the practical-editing side, I doubt that attitudes among editors have changed, so I saw the paper and decided to not even bother trying to add anything about it myself. 
The leading storyline back then among researchers who were trying to believe this paper and that cancer can almost always be prevented ran like this:  &quot;Sure, it's a random mutation, but if you don't have the right diet, then you'll get more random mutations&quot;.  Except, of course, that if the mutation is triggered (e.g., by alcoholic beverages), then it's not &quot;random&quot; in the sense that is used in this paper.  Scientists are no less human than the rest of us, and it takes humans a while to drop their cherished old stories and consider a new one on its own merits.
On the subject of the paper itself, I'm glad that this one included breast and prostate cancer, and given the results – and the guilt that most cancer patients feel – I hope that rostate cancer gets a big &quot;This is not your fault and there was nothing you could do to prevent it, so stop feeling guilty already&quot; slapped into the lead.

For me personally, the fun in this research is the variation.  95% of prostate cancer is non-preventable, but 66% of lung cancer is realistically preventable.  (You &quot;just&quot; have to ban anything that makes people breathe smoke [including non-tobacco sources of smoke].)  These studies have concluded that more than 90% of cancers are due to non-hereditary causes, and that less than half of those non-hereditary cancers are due to any factor within the control of the patient.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 06:45, 25 March 2017 (UTC)
 Multiple mutations must occur before a cell becomes cancerous. Hence it is possible and perhaps even likely that environmental factors, random mutations, and heredity all contribute to a single malignant transformation.  The arcinogenesis article at the moment has far bigger problems. The lead was enormous and far too detailed.  I have split out a lot of the material from the lead into sections.

Movement Strategy for the coming 15 years
Hey All. Am working to help facilitate discussion and creation of the movement strategy. [https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Strategy/Wikimedia_movement/2017/Process/Briefing Here] is some background information for the process.

We also get a voice as a community. I guess the question is what do we see as our priorities over the next 15 years? Some I would include would be:
#Accessibility
##Improve offline access such that more of the world can get dependable access to our content (much of the world's population does not have 24/7 access to the Internet even if they can afford it, yet most have cell phones)
##Accessible language is also of a great importance. One of the primary reasons medical students say they use WP is because we are easier to understand.
#Quality content
##Put in place further measures to address undisclosed paid promotional editing. This is one of the greater threats to the neutrality of our content and needs to be addressed in order to maintain our independence and keep us free from advertising.
##Working on improving ability to handle rich content. This was one of the most requested features in the last reader survey. We did have someone working on maps and graphing tools within the Discovery team unfortunately this was put on hold.
#Collaborate
##Develop and expand upon collaborations with like minded organizations such as the CDC, ILAE, WHO, Cochrane, etc.
##Improve relations and expand upon collaboration between the formal organizations within the Wikimedia Movement and the communities. The community tech team has been doing amazing work in this area and should be further resourced. ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk · pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 17:02, 17 March 2017 (UTC)

 Class of diseases; format of article? hakomatosis and ser:MKoehler/sandbox 

So we right now have hakomatosis.  A student group has decided to improve this article, and their draft is at  ser:MKoehler/sandbox. 

There are some obvious problems with sources and lack of inline citations, but I am asking a bigger question here - should the hakomatosis article basically be a brief overview with wikilinks to the actual diseases, or should it be expanded as the class plans to do, and treated like it, itself, is a disease or condition?

In my view this is bad meta-editing - the hakomatosis is unlikely to remain in sync with the subarticles, and little in the Phakomatosis article will be about anything.

I guess in my view if the Phakomatosis article were to be expanded, it should be done by a) updating each of the disease articles; b) adding citations to the lead of each disease article, and c) copying those leads to the main article.  If there is anything that is specific to the class, that could go in a brief discussion of the class itself.   That would be good meta-editing.  

Thoughts? ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 20:03, 27 March 2017 (UTC)
As it is a broad group of conditions rather than a single condition better to keep it as it is rather than try to make it out like a single disease.
One could expand the &quot;Examples&quot; section with a paragraph on each condition.
ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk · pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 05:39, 28 March 2017 (UTC)
In general, the same objections can be, and probably have been, made for kin cancer, eukemia, arcoma, eart disease, utoimmune disorder, iver disease, and the many other class-of-diseases articles that we have.  It's still probably a good thing to have such articles.  The class might want to consult some of those articles to see if there are any useful ideas about how to structure this one. 
(BTW, until [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Summary_style&amp;diff=757206856&amp;oldid=756916679 this bold edit] by ser:Sunrise a couple of months ago, P:Summary style said that the summary in the parent article would often be twice as long as the child article's lead.  I don't know if anyone cares any longer, but &quot;just copy the lead&quot; used to be considered lazy and poor writing, in addition to a great way to spread uncited information across the encyclopedia.)  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 22:32, 28 March 2017 (UTC)
 You ignored b) above and I won't bother writing more. ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 00:25, 29 March 2017 (UTC)
We should likely make many of the above articles mentioned by WAID more like ronchitis were we have a section for an overview of each condition that then links to that condition. 
This needs to be done when each individual condition is very different from the others. Likely we should do it for skin cancer and leukemia as jamming much of this information together is confusion. ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk · pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 13:34, 29 March 2017 (UTC)
By the way eriodontal pathology was just switched from a disease based layout to a class of disease based layout by ser:Matthew Ferguson 57 and IMO a big improvement. 
Merely copying some sources into it doesn't make the same paragraph(s) ideal for, or even adequate for, both the lead of one article and a good summary of the subject in another article (and specifically its relationship to the main article). 
James, I don't think that I'd convert eukemia to a long list of individual diseases.  The main theme for leukemia in the sources is &quot;there are four main categories&quot; rather than &quot;there are more than a dozen separate versions, depending upon how you count&quot;.  I suspect that most people on that page are either looking for general information, or for a link out.  (Perhaps my expectations are too low, but I consider it an educational triumph if readers leave that article knowing that most leukemia doesn't involve photogenic children.  Before the page was semi'd, we used to have problems with people changing the stats to say that 90% of cases are in children, rather than 10%.)  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 01:15, 30 March 2017 (UTC)

Theoretically, it's fine; even reputable journals such as the NEJM have paid advertising programs.[http://www.nejm.org/page/about-nejm/how-to-advertise]  However, depending upon the details, it can make editors wary of the source.

Yes AHFS is excellent. There are non ad covered versions however they are not free to see.

LeadSongDog posted a paper just above that I thought was interesting.  I've got a few things on my list in the medical-humanities line, especially [http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2017/03/these-are-the-most-prestigious-diseases.html this one] that ranks specialties and diseases by the amount of prestige that the medical profession accords them (and therefore everything from how well patients with various conditions are treated to how much specialists are paid).

A ~20% cut would affect a lot of research.  If you assume that the average work runs on a five-year grant cycle, it would pretty much mean that no new projects could be started next year.  I don't expect it to work out that way, though.  Some of the patient lobbies are just too strong for it.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:24, 26 March 2017 (UTC)

If the article is correct, they're talking 18% of 0.9%, or just 0.162% of the US federal budget. This smells more like a bargaining chip than a serious policy choice. ser:LeadSongDog|LeadSongDog ser talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl! 19:10, 27 March 2017 (UTC)
Anyone who has had NIH grants in the US, or otherwise worked in concert with the various NIH translational agencies know that the agencies are in trouble, not because of these threatened cuts, but because of poorly executed fiscal planning in the period when the NIH pungent was doubled over a 5 year period. The current situation in the US is that median age of a scientist receiving the R01 is now in the 40s, and (relatedly), in the molecular biosciences, that 3 and 4 serial postdoctoral appointments en route to first academic appointment—or worse, perpetual postdoctoral limbo—are increasingly the norm. Add to this now, that the eventual flattening of the growth rate after the doubling period, and the contraction in real terms that took place when the economy has taken hits—these now impact an artificially enlarged pool of individuals needing funding. So, as critical to the amount expended, is how the system is shaped, to accommodate whatever expenditures are provided. I have some confidence in Collins, in that regard. Otherwise, anyone who has been both in pharma and academia can also tell you that things could be done better, and more cost-effectively, than they are, at universities, where the 20% you speak of is easily wasted each year. [In pharma, investment recovery is the department redistributing, refurbishing, reselling , or donating no longer used equipment that represents significant investment—down to pieces as small as a rotary evaporator (&lt;$5K). Investment recovery in academia is the hallway corridor, the tops of storage cabinets, and ultimately, the dumpster.] Small example, but as a process guy, I can tell you it gets no better—no more efficient or cost-effective—when discovery workflows are designed, i.e., how to get ADME-Tox data on a new small molecule, when no experience or expertise is present, no alliances/partnerships exist, and everyone's ego and funding residual is a stake in the game. Add the propensity for last minute decisions and efforts—who has never been on an academic grant writing team that did not hit send on the very last day—and the matter of cost inefficiencies are all the clearer.

 More Wikidata funk - infobox gene 

So I was just looking at our article on CNB1, where the emplate:infobox gene is deployed.  The infobox had a disease associations with obesity, and also said this channel &quot;interacts&quot; with inoleic acid.  (I have fixed that so you can't see it now)

I went to Wikidata and saw that the association with obesity was added by ProteinBoxBot [https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q18028136&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=466393145&amp;oldid=459281559 here]. based on [http://chibi.ubc.ca/Gemma/phenotypes.html?phenotypeUrlId=DOID_9970&amp;ncbiId=3745 this database].  If you look at that database, you will see that this protein was associated with obestity based on MID|23251661, a primary source (at least it is of a GWAS in humans) and that this gene has also been linked to ongenital diaphragmatic hernia based on a primary source in rats, MID|15088113.

At our article, I only see the infobox template and cannot see how to suppress these things.  For some reason only the obesity thing was showing in Wikidata, but in any case I [https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q18028136&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=472377066&amp;oldid=469269994 removed it].  Which may well upset some people there. 

As for the lineoleic acid thing, that came from a different Wikidata entry altogether, and I [https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Q21107884&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=472377160&amp;oldid=439605508 removed it] from there, as this is just bizarre to have in a WP article.  Linoleic acid is a common dietary acid and from where I sit drawing associations between stuff we eat and modulation of ion channels is just not good.

 More Eyes Needed at epsis 

A lot of recent activity at the epsis and eptic shock pages recently strongly advocating the addition of information about Dr. Marik's recently proposed IV thiamine/Vitamin C therapy for sepsis/septic shock. This is despite the lack of rigorous study and no mention yet (that I'm aware of) in secondary sources that meet P:MEDRS criteria (not even a recent robust RCT yet).  Discussion here [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sepsis#Norfolk_doctor_found_a_treatment_for_sepsis]. ser:TylerDurden8823|TylerDurden8823 (ser talk:TylerDurden8823|talk) 12:53, 3 April 2017 (UTC)

I'm not surprised, since it made a big splash in the news recently.  The news reports that I saw indicated that a proper study was underway, which means that it was neither complete nor published (although, if the results are actually as good as he's claimed, he needs to be talking to his IRB about ending early on ethical grounds). 
Generally, with this sort of thing, it's more effective to mention the claims in a restrained, limited manner, rather than trying to excise them completely.  A complete absence makes people think that editors merely haven't heart about it; a limited statement, perhaps along the lines of t|&quot;In 2017, Edward Example claimed that outcomes could be dramatically improved by giving patients Vitamin C, thiamine, and some unspecified steroids; however, these claims have not been scientifically proven&quot; helps people feel like their area of interest was included (and some of them will learn that &quot;I got my name in the news!&quot; is not the height of scientific evidence).

 It's the same user, of course, from Mountain Grove, MO. But dynamic IPs are not socks; they are just IPs that change each time the user logs on. It's important to realise that some editors simply prefer to edit as IPs and we should respect their choice. Some IP editors may be very experienced, and this one does appear to know what he's talking about, especially on the topic of categories. They ser talk:64.85.216.208|claim to have been editing for almost ten years and I can't see any reason not to AGF on that. If it's any help, there is guidance on best practice for categorisation at ikipedia:Categorization #Categorizing pages: &quot;q|... each categorized page should be placed in all of the most specific categories to which it logically belongs. This means that if a page belongs to a Subcategorization|subcategory of C (or a subcategory of a subcategory of C, and so on) then it is not normally placed directly into C.&quot; there are exceptions, but they are only in very particular circumstances. In the case of erry Gibson, he belongs in Category:Negro league baseball players, but because that is a more specific sub-category of Category:Negro league baseball, he does not belong in that category. Similar considerations apply to several of the other categories the IP removed. Your best bet, if you think that exceptions are appropriate, is to raise the issue on the article talk page, which the IP claims to be monitoring, so you should be able to discuss the issue and, hopefully, reach an agreement that is best for the article.

Thanks so much for your response, especially when many people are getting ready for the holidays. I think I can understand what you are saying, but a when a different IP is used whenever this one editor reverts allows such a user to revert anything they wish without having to be concerned about the '3-revert-rule'.

 ye color surgery

But the merican Academy of Ophthalmology has spoken out on it, as seen [https://www.aao.org/newsroom/news-releases/detail/iris-implant-surgery-to-change-eye-color-can-be-da here] and [http://www.aaojournal.org/article/S0161-6420(12)00234-5/abstract here], and I think we should devote at least two sentences to the topic in one of our eye surgery articles. I've looked at the ye surgery article. I've looked at  ens implant, but it redirects to ntraocular lens, which is specifically about implanting a lens in the eye to treat ataracts or yopia. And besides implants, there's also laser surgery to change the iris color; see [http://www.stromamedical.com/page/physician-info Stroma Medical].

Discussed in March at ikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine/Archive_95#Popular_page_tool_.28by_month. ing|Axl I see 3k/day traffic for that article in 2016, which does seem plausible to me. Check out [https://tools.wmflabs.org/pageviews/?project=en.wikipedia.org&amp;platform=all-access&amp;agent=user&amp;range=last-year&amp;pages=XXX_(2002_film) 2016 traffic] for XX (2002 film)|the world's most popular film, consistently for 10+ years, judged by Internet search. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 15:05, 21 April 2017 (UTC)
Yup pageviews for 8,_XXXX have were about 25k per day[https://tools.wmflabs.org/pageviews/?project=en.wikipedia.org&amp;platform=all-access&amp;agent=user&amp;range=last-month&amp;pages=48,_XXXX]. Maybe it was featured in a TV show? Down around 5K per day now. ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk · pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 19:42, 21 April 2017 (UTC)
Leonardo did a lot with respect to anatomy and physiology.eonardo_da_Vinci#Anatomy_and_physiology They are marked as low importance.

 hiropractic at the Help Desk 

There's ikipedia:Help desk#Chiropractic article biased and doesn't reflect latest research|a query at the Help Desk that someone here might like to respond to. ser:Rivertorch|Rivertorchpecial:Contributions/Rivertorch|FIREser talk:Rivertorch|WATER 21:50, 21 April 2017 (UTC)

I think that's probably a hopeless article.  We have too many entrenched, biased editors involved in the article to make any real progress.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 01:11, 22 April 2017 (UTC)
I can remove all the original research with one click. When uninvolved admins decide to move all other editors aside I can make one edit and fix all the text. ser:QuackGuru|QuackGuru (ser talk:QuackGuru|talk) 02:03, 22 April 2017 (UTC)
Also a paid editor? So chiropractors are hiring a PR firm to try to adjust WP to their liking? Gah. The research is controversial. ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk · pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 03:08, 22 April 2017 (UTC)
Quack, I implore you not to edit war in that article, especially since almost no editor in all of Wikipedia agrees with your twisted idea of &quot;original research&quot;.
James, it sounds like the PR firm was hired for a chiropractic school in general, and not necessarily for the purpose of improving this article.  I can imagine that a chiropractic school might think that a stridently anti-chiropractic Wikipedia article (which it's been at various points) or one that misrepresents current practice (which the recent versions probably do, to some extent) could discourage potential students from wanting to become chiropractors.  An admin has blocked the account over &quot;promotion or advertising&quot; (ser:Orangemike, were there any edits beyond the single still-visible edit at the Help desk?) and its username, without first offering the standard opportunity to change the username without first being blocked.  I doubt that complying with the COI guideline and the Terms of Use by publicly disclosing a COI at the Help desk is what P:U really means by a &quot;clearly offensive username, disruptive or vandalizing edits, or edits that show a history of problematic bias or conflict of interest&quot;.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 05:45, 22 April 2017 (UTC)
Wow, just got banned and never edited an encyclopedia article yet [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/CGPR]. I'm pretty sure there are no &quot;promotional edits&quot; if an editor has never made an edit in the first place. ser:Matthew Ferguson 57|Matthew Ferguson (ser talk:Matthew Ferguson 57|talk) 14:28, 22 April 2017 (UTC)
Article does have some issues, agree.
They were blocked for &quot;Promotional username&quot; as their username is that of a PR firm. ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk · pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 14:38, 22 April 2017 (UTC)
Nonetheless, you all do have a point. I've changed the block to the &quot;softerblock&quot; mode, although the help desk post shows they have serious NPOV problems with the edits they want to make. --ser:Orangemike|Orange Mike | ser talk:Orangemike|Talk 15:38, 22 April 2017 (UTC)
Thanks, Mike.  I appreciate your response.
James, merely having a username that matches your business name isn't actually grounds for blocking (and hasn't been for at least several years), which is why I asked Mike if there were other problems (e.g., deleted edits).  I know it's hard to keep up with changes in policies, but usually, when COI editor is trying to learn and follow our rules, then it's safe to try to respond with as much kindness as we can muster – even if we are fairly certain that we are going to disagree with their suggestions.  It's not in Wikipedia's best interests to punish people that are voluntarily self-identifying their businesses or properly disclosing COIs.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 01:35, 23 April 2017 (UTC)
