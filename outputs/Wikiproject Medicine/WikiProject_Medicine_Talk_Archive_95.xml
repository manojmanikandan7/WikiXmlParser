Last month you guys took a good look at a page which was subsequently deleted: Cycloidal vibration therapy, particularly  who looked at all the citations for MEDRS. Unfortunately there looks like a whole industry of pages out there usually being edited by the same editors, and I would appreciate if someone has the time to look at these two: Galileo (vibration training) (incidentally one of the editor's IP (217.92.49.4) is novotecmedical.de which you can probably guess what they make). And Whole body vibration which is again being edited by a bunch of single issue editors, like Samvesey, Rrawer, Belsius (to whom  has kindly given a final warning) and that same IP editor from the Galileo page. seems to me they could all be the same editor, or working as a team but i've no idea how you would find that out without looking into their accounts. I expect if you look through their edit histories there are more pages like this. Anyway, I appreciate it's a drag but if someone can look at these and check i'm not being paranoid, and see if these pages are giant adverts again, hopefully get rid of them, I would really appreciate your help. As an aside can you let me know if it's ok to bring things here to be checked for MEDRS or is there an piece of software I can use to save you having to check that aspect? I have no medical background although I have a BSc degree. Many thanks Mramoeba (talk) 16:19, 2 March 2017 (UTC)

Thanks for following up on this.  
I'm going to guess that there's some demand for an article about the idea of vibration as a weight-loss or exercise tool.  Sometimes, creating a half-decent article reduces spam.  It could start with the [http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/broughttolife/objects/display?id=92808 Battle Creek Health Builder], which seems to be the original model, and progress up to the modern versions.  What do you all think?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 02:22, 3 March 2017 (UTC)
Agree would be good to merge to one good overview article. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 04:16, 3 March 2017 (UTC)

Efficacy depends upon the condition.  It could be effective for certain sub-types of CP without being effective for (e.g.,) weight loss or frailty syndrome.  A well-written article will point out both the nonsense (&quot;Buy this belly-vibrating machine to lose weight without diet or exercise!  Only $39.95 if you act now!&quot;) and the sense. 
Is everyone okay with Vibration therapy for the main article name? WhatamIdoing (talk) 20:34, 5 March 2017 (UTC)
Or more likely, more effective for those at more severe GMFCS levels (who are also more likely to have bone density issues) than those at milder levels - although the article doesn't say much about the variance in CP.  I've currently got WBV in the optimistic 'other' section of the CP management article, rather than the 'alt med' section. :/ -- (talk) 20:45, 5 March 2017 (UTC)

Autoinflammatory syndrome

Autoinflammatory syndrome redirects to Periodic fever syndrome.  Is that right?  I'm mostly wondering whether people might confuse &quot;Autoinflammatory&quot; with &quot;Autoimmune&quot;.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 20:49, 12 March 2017 (UTC)

 at Anterior cruciate ligament?

In amongst some useful information there is a lot of what looks like rubbish being inserted by what appears to be a . 

&quot;Arthrometry is considered the most reliable technique of laximetry. The medical devices using arthrometry are called arthrometers and are used to put the Anterior Cruciate Ligament under stress in a controlled manner (this was not always the case as the first arthrometers required the user to use his own strength to run the tests). Over time, tests progressively evolved from static tests (single force applied on the tibia) to dynamic tests which are now considered much more precise (several forces applied on the tibia). The reason to this change is that dynamic tests allows the drawing of the ACL's stiffness curve which is a biomechanical parameter of knee ligaments. It is highly correlated with the clinical symptoms of instability. It is more accurate than laxity which is a numerical value without mechanical significance.&quot;


Perhaps this is cutting edge but this is not something I have ever heard of. Seeking some advice from other editors. Is this cutting edge or  to be placed on Anterior cruciate ligament? The pseudoscience gobbledegook and palindromic tautologous structure are what worry me most (&quot;which is a biomechanical parameter of knee ligaments. It is highly correlated with the clinical symptoms of instability&quot;) Thoughts? --Tom (LT) (talk) 11:33, 1 March 2017 (UTC)

Perhaps a more general form of your question is, &quot;Is cutting edge UNDUE?&quot; (assuming that it's actually cutting edge, which is something that someone else will have to comment on).  I think that the answer might be that it depends upon context – what else is in the article and where it's placed.
I don't might the effort to explain things in plain English.  But overall, I think it needs some copyediting.  For example, I'd change the bit about &quot;this was not always the case&quot; to a plain statement of fact about the contrast between different device models over time:  &quot;Early arthrometers were mechanical devices operated by a person's own strength; some newer ones are electrical&quot; (or whatever the actual facts boil down to).  Is that a helpful approach to the more stylistic part of your question?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 20:23, 1 March 2017 (UTC)
It does sound quite a lot like an advertisement. From my own experience laximetry is not common at all, and the being absolutely accurate (or even reliable ) isn't than important. 
Whether a knee is operated on depends on a number of factors, of which the exact degree of laxity seems arbitrary and of minor importance. The degree of symptoms and their severity seem far more relevant, especially considering the newer meta-analyses which show how ACL-reconstruction is no more effective than placebo.
Now this is off the top of my head, and I could have something mixed up, but it seems like a good idea to check who wrote this and look into whether it actually belongs. Carl Fredrik 💌  23:19, 1 March 2017 (UTC)
They are trying to add the same content across 4 articles. Belongs some at ACL injury but not everywhere else.Doc James (talk ·  · ) 04:23, 3 March 2017 (UTC)

New Google feature

Interesting:  [https://theconversation.com/dr-google-probably-isnt-the-worst-place-to-get-your-health-advice-73835 Dr Google probably isn’t the worst place to get your health advice] - apparently now Google will be employing doctors to provide short glosses for health-related searches.  I wonder what kind of impact this will have on people accessing Wikipedia's health information?  -- (talk) 00:08, 14 March 2017 (UTC)
Actually much of their information is pretty horrible, and the composition is very opaque: does not show sources, does not take into account any COI, and often does not give an accurate or full picture. Anyone can partner with doctors, without systematic methodology that does not mean any good will come out of it. The fact that this implies they have been writing medical information without the input of doctors before is rather scary. Carl Fredrik 💌  10:40, 14 March 2017 (UTC)
Thanks IP. This launched more than a year ago in the USA. Google just linked to health information before. They are now actively creating health information in house. They have some really nice illustrations. 
They have corrected their hep C entry since the launch following feedback. (used to say sexually transmitted which it likely isn't)
Google says 5% of all searches are for health information. They are partnered with Mayo on this and do reference them as a source sometimes. Competition in &quot;health information&quot; is increasing. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 16:26, 14 March 2017 (UTC)

MAP and CD

Ignoring the cite error, I can't help but feel that recent good faith edits to this MAP article are confusing, the lead says that MAP is a causal agent in CD. However I read [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4177485/ this] paper which surmises “The present data do not demonstrate that MAP is the causal agent in CD, however, a certain degree of involvement of this bacterium in the physiopathological steps of the disease is reasonable.” Is there a more recent review article relating to this?

DMOZ is dead

DMOZ was turned off today.  The  template has been redirected to a mirror as a temporary measure.   needs to be updated to remove any mention of the site, and it would probably be appropriate to remove links/templates from articles as you run across them.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 05:43, 15 March 2017 (UTC)
Not so quick. All of DMOZ is mirrored by internet archives. We can just change the template to link to internet archives instead. Maybe someone else will take up the project. It is under a CC BY license. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 06:02, 15 March 2017 (UTC)

Was the WMF interested in taking them aboard? Carl Fredrik 💌  09:42, 15 March 2017 (UTC)
In my experience, the DMOZ pages have not been very good in recent years.  I just spot-checked a few:  half have seen no updates during the last year.  On the one about autism, which was allegedly updated just a few weeks ago, one of the NIH links is broken, the most recent news story is from 2006, one goes to a dead internet forum (most recent post from July 2016), and one of the links is filled with ads for &quot;natural viagra&quot;.  I don't think that's really helping readers, and I'm pretty sure that we could find a better option.
All of DMOZ is mirrored by several sites (including the one that the template has been redirected to), but I don't think that a link to a copy of a page that was last updated a year or two ago by a DMOZ volunteer is going to continue to have value for readers in the long-run.  Websites get re-arranged.  Links die.  Information goes out of date.  And even if you think a DMOZ mirror or an archived copy of DMOZ pages is a good way to ward off spam here, MEDMOS shouldn't say that DMOZ itself exists, because that is false.

I was in favor, but other argued that classifying primary vs. secondary citations amounted to original research. Also  refers to the media type and therefore is probably not appropriate.  is probably more appropriate. Boghog (talk) 20:11, 6 March 2017 (UTC)
I assume this is meant primarily for medical articles, in which most citations already have PMIDs. You could just extract the PMIDs and use the PubMed API to retrieve the data for your study ([https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esummary.fcgi?db=pubmed&amp;id=11850928,11482001&amp;retmode=json example query], though you'd probably want to use the Entrez History feature for large sets), without the need to make any actual edits or store the data on-wiki.

 — that's just crazy. It would be automated, using the data that exists in a database already. It objectively isn't . If that was the basis of the consensus we can just overturn it here by stating that it was wrong. Carl Fredrik 💌  23:37, 6 March 2017 (UTC)
As far as I can tell, there wasn't a real consensus developed in the previous discussion.  To completely remove the OR issue, a new  parameter in  may be needed. If one extracts the PubMed [http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/pubtypes.html Publication Type] for each citation and uses those directly without modification, then it is not OR. Translating PubMed Publication Types into primary (clinical trial) or secondary (review/meta-analysis/monograph) may be OR. Boghog (talk) 04:58, 7 March 2017 (UTC)

One of the main concerns I have with putting the 'review' field on  is that the template is used for many other disciplines' articles, so it might confuse them.  Is there a MARC field for &quot;Review&quot;, &quot;Original Research&quot;, &quot;Case Study&quot; etc.?  What do they call that field? -- (talk) 05:49, 7 March 2017 (UTC)
Would not be original research. We would be using pubmed as a source. Pubmed calls it &quot;publication type&quot; and the type we would be recording is &quot;review&quot; which is what they call it. Happy to go with &quot;|pubmed-type=&quot; as boghog suggests. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 06:34, 7 March 2017 (UTC)
&quot;|pubmed-type=&quot; would be fine--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 10:45, 17 March 2017 (UTC)

 It would appear that MARC standards apply to books and serials (journals and magazines), not individual articles within a journal. Various citation style guides mention magazine departments or article types.  For example,   Per Chicago 16: &quot;14.202 MAGAZINE DEPARTMENTS. Titles of regular departments in a magazine are capitalized headline-style but not put in quotation marks.&quot;  The National Library of Medicine Style Guide refers to an optional [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7282/#A32443 Article Type] that if present should appear in brackets after the article title. Likewise both the APA and MLA styles require that citations of [http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k70847&amp;pageid=icb.page363226#a_icb_pagecontent763087_review reviews] and [http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k70847&amp;pageid=icb.page363226#a_icb_pagecontent763087_letter letters to the editor] be designated as such after the title.

The article should mention the existence of urethral occlusion devices; this isn't the only brand on the market.  If you have a look at http://preventdisease.com/diseases/urinary_incontinence.shtml and search down the page for the word &quot;adhesive&quot;, you'll see three brands just for the adhesive foam type, plus several non-adhesive devices that I don't think are mentioned in this article yet.
A quick look at the article has led me to discover that we have articles on vaginal cones and vaginal weightlifting.  Does anyone know why these are separate?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 00:43, 19 March 2017 (UTC)
They could probably be merged.  On a semi-related topic, I tried to add some criticism to Gwyneth Paltrow's article about her Goop writings, but I think someone looks after that article a lot and it was removed, even the MEDRS review article.  -- (talk) 02:11, 21 March 2017 (UTC)

This new medicine-related article could use the review of an experience medical editor.  The article appears promotional to me and article's creator has a disclosed conflict of interest, but I'm not really able to evaluate the article's medical claims. A related article, Generation ucan, created by the same editor is at AFD () as well if anyone wants to contribute to the discussion.  Deli nk (talk) 20:38, 20 March 2017 (UTC)

 Having trouble reproducing the problem. Could you please be a bit more specific as to where you saw the problem? Was it for a specific article? On the ca language Wikipedia? Or was it more general? LeadSongDog come howl! 13:45, 8 March 2017 (UTC)

Otherwise, it links correctly when  is set. For example in autism ().

Review of edit from an IP address on Cough Medicine

https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cough_medicine&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=771611518&amp;oldid=771384512

I noticed this new edit that removes a reference from the first paragraph of Cough Medicine. Given that the RCTs reviewed in the Cochrane systematic review are weak, (quoted from review conclusion) &quot;The results of this review have to be interpreted with caution because the number of studies in each category of cough preparations was small&quot;, I agree with this edit and it may not be necessary in the intro paragraph. 

Just looking for a second opinion. This review is also used two other times in the article to state the same thing.

Thanks. JenOttawa (talk) 02:09, 23 March 2017 (UTC)
Have restored the edit in question. Rpark90 (talk) 08:57, 23 March 2017 (UTC)
I've copyedited.  In general, &quot;There is no evidence&quot; is jargon that confuses most people.  They tend to think that it means &quot;there is evidence against this&quot; rather than &quot;this has not been studied enough&quot;.  That confusion may have been what prompted the logged-out editor to remove the statement.  I think that we should try to avoid that language whenever we can.

I want another move...
