Hi all, Some of you are aware of the prolonged discussions with WMF to try to sort out the problem of inaccurate, inappropriate, and vandalised Wikidata descriptions being used on mobile view and in other places in association with Wikipedia titles, and that the agreed solution is that these short descriptions should be considered text content and Wikipedia content should be stored in Wikipedia. The consensus of the recent RfC to immediately shut down Wikidata short descriptions and provide them in Wikipedia, however, was rejected by WMF and they plan to impose their preferred solution, which continues to display Wikidata descriptions unless there is a short description on Wikipedia, until Wikipedia has 2 million or more local short descriptions. I have started a  to eventually all Wikipedia articles, and it will be a major undertaking. WikiProject Medicine is a strong project, with an real-life impact scope  and some fairly dedicated members, and as such seems a likely group to provide the short descriptions needed to accurately and reliably describe their project's articles. Medical articles should preferably be defined by people who, if not necessarily experts, at least have a clue about the topic, so I hereby invite those of you who can spare the time to start adding  to medical articles. The template we are using adds a maintenance category so it is not too difficult to keep track of the ones that are done. I have already done a few medical short descriptions that overlap with WikiProject Scuba diving. Some of these may not be optimal, so feel free to improve them whenever you can. Like any other content, short descriptions can be improved later, but should be at least fit for purpose. Cheers, · · ·  : 15:23, 16 February 2018 (UTC)
I think WP:MED should at some point come to a consensus on - for example - where to put the -templates in the articles. I suggest far at the bottom, near other templates such as authority control, and similar, in near relation to categories. But this might not be the place to discuss it, perhaps TALK:MEDMOS is better. Also this isn't really enforced yet as I understand it, so we might want to wait a bit. -- () 14:32, 17 February 2018 (UTC)

 I've been encouraging the use of the template as the very first item of wikitext on the page. The reason is that it is intended to be the short description displayed on mobile view immediately after the page title, and before any other content. In that sense, the top of the wikitext would most closely mirror the place where it would be most commonly seen. -- () 14:36, 17 February 2018 (UTC)
My fear is that it is too easy for vandals to find and edit when it's the absolutely first thing available to them, especially on WP:BLP. But I see your point. Do you know where there currently are discussion(s) about this, and could link us there? :) -- () 15:36, 17 February 2018 (UTC)
This was exactly my first thought.  I don't think short descriptions should necessarily be prominent in the edit window.  Once created, short descriptions should generally be very stable text that requires little editing, especially by new or inexperienced editors, so &quot;hiding&quot; them at the bottom doesn't seem like a problem to me.  --  () 15:47, 17 February 2018 (UTC)
 If you want to  and see what Wikidata has (i.e. what mobile viewers using the Wikipedia app see now), then you want to see the text where it would appear, not multiple screens down. The whole argument to base short descriptions on text that was easily editable from Wikipedia was to make it easier to combat vandalism that was hard to find. If I saw vandalism on the second line of an article, I wouldn't expect to find the text I needed to fix at the bottom of the page, would you? -- () 16:02, 17 February 2018 (UTC)
If combating vandalism is the motive behind this, making the short description slightly less obvious to find will help in that regard.  It will shift the balance toward vandal fighters (typically experienced Wikipedia users who will have no trouble learning where to find it) and away from vandals (who who go after easy targets and typically aren't dedicated Wikipedia users).  --  () 16:08, 17 February 2018 (UTC)
 In that case, you might as well give in to the WMF and leave the text for the short descriptions on Wikidata, because that's even more &quot;less obvious to find&quot; and &quot;experienced Wikipedia users ... will have no trouble learning where to find it&quot;. That argument was rightly discredited in the RfC. We know that vandalism will happen, and the easier we make it to fix the more rapidly it will be fixed - remember that the majority of short edits to Wikipedia are make by IPs, folks who spot a problem and fix it. -- () 16:18, 17 February 2018 (UTC)
Finding vandalism in the wikitext of an article is not at all comparable to finding vandalism imported from another website.  --  () 20:02, 17 February 2018 (UTC)
 Of course it is. Your &quot;experienced Wikipedia user&quot; will quickly learn it's one click away in either case. Unfortunately most of the vandalism fixing isn't done by them, so it's sensible to keep things simple: problem at top of page =&gt; fix it at the top of the wikitext, not the bottom. -- () 00:48, 18 February 2018 (UTC)
I agree with RexxS on all points above. Having the short description embedded in a template may reduce vandalism in source edit, but who knows. I don't even know what it looks like in VE yet. Having it at the top will make life easier for good faith editors, so I suggest we put it there until there is convincing evidence that the top is a bad place. There may be problems with displaying it in a logical place on desktop view for those who want to see it if it is hidden in a strange place, and hiding it from our editing community means vandalism is more likely to be missed.· · ·  : 06:33, 18 February 2018 (UTC)
, I don't know what you mean by &quot;enforced&quot;, If you mean the magic word is not working yet, WMF predict it will be by the end of the month, give or take unforeseen contingencies. As to whether it will happen or not, short of intervention by the board, it seems inevitible. The short descriptions we are adding will only show when the software has been installed. The Wikidata descriptions will only be turned off when there are enough short descriptions on Wikipedia to convince the WMF people that they can't hold out any longer. Starting sooner means that that point can be reached sooner, and the bottleneck will be the writing of descriptions. anything that can be automated will go so much faster that it is effectively not a delay. Like everything on Wikipedia, we only do it if we think it is worthwhile. I think is is important, so am demonstrating my conviction by doing what I consider most constructive, i.e. writing short descriptions as part of another project. Not contributing to writing short descriptions just makes the Wikidata descriptions remain for longer. If that is your preference then that is what you should do. If you really don't care, you are probably with the majority of Wikipedians. Things here only get fixed by people who do care. I think that accurate short descriptions are important for medical articles, so where I consider myself sufficiently competent, I will write them, as and when I see the need. I am systematically working on other projects, where I am more expert, so I don't edit medical stuff very much, but I will fix what I can in passing. · · ·  : 10:07, 18 February 2018 (UTC)
*I see there was [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_(proposals)/Archive_145#RfC:_Populating_article_descriptions_magic_word an RfC] about this that ran from December to February
I should not have pulled the RFC I started to get the rest of the descriptions pulled and to community ban the people at WMF Reading Team responsible for them.  (it was [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_(policy)/Archive_137#RfC:_Description_field_from_Wikidata_in_any_view_of_en-WP here]
I remain furious about this.  Volunteer time is the lifeblood of WP.  Because of the clueless arrogance of the WMF reading team, volunteers now are starting a &quot;major undertaking&quot; to fix their damage - doing that instead of building and updating content. (e.g the Cipro article is still out of date with regard to medical guidelines for use of these drugs. Nobody has had time to get to that.)  And these short descriptions will inevitably lead to disputes about precisely what to say, which will be yet a further waste of time. 
They never should have intervened into content this way in the first place.  Clueless and arrogant breach of the basic deal here - the editing community generates content; the WMF just publishes it. Now the tail is completely wagging the dog. 
I am not going to participate in this project.  I recognize that the community has basically accepted this power play/blackmail, but it is horrible. Because of the December/February RfC I will not remove these tags, but I am going to ignore this except to remind everybody from time to time that our work has been hijacked, and that this is a capitulation to an exercise of power by our publisher over us. Raw power.   () 15:50, 17 February 2018 (UTC)
While I completely agree with you on some points, like the wasted time arguing about this with WMF, which is a complete pain, I disagree with you on others. Such is life. The short descriptions do have a useful function, and more useful functions will be found. Refusing to help contribute to useful functions because you rightfully resent the way they were imposed is your choice, but perhaps not a particularly constructive one. Shit happens. I choose to take the opposite approach and try to make this work for us. It is not the short descriptions that are the abomination, it is the way they have been handled. Cheers, · · ·  : 06:23, 18 February 2018 (UTC)
Are you planning to re-open the RFC calling for a community ban? You made some good points there that could be examined in more detail. · · ·  : 07:09, 18 February 2018 (UTC)
, You mention a . Is this basic deal formally defined anywhere? If this is a breach of contract matter it is something the Board and Legal must deal with. Cheers, · · ·  : 05:48, 19 February 2018 (UTC)
, replying...
The ToU say for example:
* in the summary  (emphasis in the original).  
* In the Overview section 1st paragraph 
* In the &quot;Our Services&quot; section: 
That is on the level of content. The ToU also make it clear that the editing communities govern themselves, with regard to behavior (as defined for example in the [https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use/en#10._Management_of_Websites Management of Websites] section . 
This whole thing that editors govern content and behavior and WMF just publishes (with a few very well defined exceptions) is the &quot;the basic deal&quot; here. It underlies everything that happens here.  Besides being really the foundation of everything we do, it also does 2 things - the autonomy we have itself drives volunteerism and it brings WMF under the DMCA shield.
When I say &quot;clueless and arrogant&quot; I mean they:
* did not understand or consider the content maintenance issues
* did not understand or consider the cross-project governance issues between the WD and enWP (at least) editing communities
* did not even consider the basic governance deal, the &quot;constitution&quot; if you will, which like many simple fundamental principles, matters in many, many ways. They just blew right past that. 
That was all bad enough when they first did it.  It was more infuriating when they narrowly interpreted the RFC about removing the short descriptions from the mobile view and left it in the app, and was utterly infuriating when they refused to take it off the app even when they started to become aware of the issues. I worry about the idea now being out there in the WMF staff, that it is just fine for them to intervene this way.  () 15:27, 19 February 2018 (UTC)
, I find your arguments compelling. I suspect that a lawyer would weasel their way out of it, or at least give you a run for your money, but it probably should be taken further, because it was a shabby piece of work, and the lines are getting smudged by precedent. The problem is that I dont actually know how to take it further. This appears to be beyond the scope of Arbcom, and the Ombudsman committee. Legal is officially the tool of WMF, so not sure they would touch it, or be sympathetic to our side of the story. The only recourse that seems appropriate is the board, since this does appear to be a governance issue. However, I have no idea of how they should be approached. Any suggestions? · · ·  : 16:10, 19 February 2018 (UTC)
Thanks for taking the time to consider these issues.  The only tool we have is to ban them. 
I have been listening to them, btw. They say that this serves readers, and they have better insight into what will serve them, who have no voice here, than the editing community does.
What I believe, is that the seed of this was planted during the whole Knowledge Engine (Wikimedia Foundation) fiasco, where the WMF was trying to figure out what it is really good for as a corporate entity itself -  where it could bring value and have a better-defined identity internally and among all the other companies out there.  It set up this Big Goal of being The Search Engine for Knowledge and started to take definitive re-organization steps, and setting goals, to make content from all the projects (and other free content) available under their rubric. 
You can see this now also in search results in en-WP, where they have introduced search results from other projects in the margins.  This is the same thing, but less intrusive.   The &quot;short descriptions&quot; imported from Wikidata and displayed in en-WP content (and used elsewhere, for instance in the &quot;blurb&quot; that appears when you search on mobile or in the app) is just the most glaring edge of this bigger thing.
I think that is the root of this -- the mindset that produced this.   Yes I think that is a board level thing, as this set of ideas seems to be internalized in the employees there and what they think they should be doing, and I don't know that anybody thought it through with respect to the basic deal -- with respect to what it means for the WMF to play mixmaster this way and where the limits should be.
Before I got too angry and frustrated to be able to continue talking in a civil manner with them, I talked to a couple members of the reading team via skype. They acknowledged that they had not considered the fundamental deal or the inter-project governance issues, or the content maintenance issues, at all, when they did this short descriptions thing. But they still held fast to their &quot;we know the readers and we serve them&quot; rationalization in maintaining their power play/blackmail. They also keep repeating the horrible shit that by recruiting en-WP editors to work on these descriptions, Wikidata will be improved and everybody wins.  I say that is both foolish and is despicable blackmail. What that means in reality is &quot;we are going to force this content into en-WP; if it violates an en-WP policy then you can and should go to Wikidata and fix it&quot;.   I do not volunteer to improve Wikidata and I don't want to argue with Wikidatians about whether BLP and V should matter. I have no interest in that nor any desire to change Wikidata governance. That editing community has its own autonomy that i respect, and its content governance will develop as it develops. 
The new &quot;magic word&quot; is that same blackmail, one step removed.  &quot;We are not removing the Wikidata descriptions. If that is such a problem then make your own content and we will use that instead&quot;. 
What nobody at the Reading Team seemed to be able to see, was this radical new thing - that the WMF has set itself up as an entity having its own interpretation of the movement mission and that its interpretation trumps everybody else. That is the raw power play here - &quot;We unilaterally made this decision; we think it is best. We published it, and we are not changing it&quot;.  And we can do precisely nothing about that.  They are the publisher.   () 16:36, 19 February 2018 (UTC)
I have seen a similar tendency in the 2030 vision statement survey, or whatever it was called, where the WMF basically cherry-picked the input to mash into something which can be interpreted to mean more or less whatever you want it to mean at the time. 
This little circus reminds me of the days at Wikitravel when the management of Internet Brands forced their preferences on the community and it all went pear-shaped and we ended up forking off to Wikivoyage. Doc James will remember how that went down. Rule 1 of crowdsourcing is don't alienate your crowd. Annoy them enough and they will drop you and leave. Perhaps the board should consider whether it is easier to replace the volunteers who create the product or the staff who seem to spend a lot of time and money producing things that annoy the volunteers and distract them from building the encyclopedia. · · ·  : 20:06, 19 February 2018 (UTC)
I do remind others of these facts. Wikipedia only works with a strong community and the existence of such a self governing community is not to be taken for granted. Expecially as new competitors are beginning to pick up steam. With respect to the short descriptions, I believe they are useful in the mobile age and thus will write some.
We could add initial ones by bot such as &quot;is a medical condition&quot; to all articles that have &quot;infobox medical condition&quot; in the lead and is a drug&quot; to all that have the &quot;drugbox&quot; in the lead. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 04:02, 20 February 2018 (UTC)
As Jytdog points out, disrespecting the community's primary method of self-government by WMF staff is very dangerous to the stability and morale of the community and a dangerous precedent. Whether the intentions were good or bad, WMF has basically told Wikipedia that our governance system, which has evolved from anarchy and survived all these years in spite of being theoretically impossible is of no importance when they have a whim to enforce. They do not take it for granted, they consider it irrelevant. If Wikipedia is to survive in its present form, this should not be ignored. It is a blow to our very basic foundations. WMF staff who do not understand how Wikipedia works should not be allowed to have this sort of power in negotiations. The Board should remind the Reading Team of these facts.
The two suggestions for conditions and drugs would be helpful in two ways: They would probably provide a correct, though very limited description to a lot of articles which don't have a description on Wikidata, and would override any incorrect descriptions on Wikidata. I would suggest they also add a maintenance [[:Category:Bot generated short description]], so editors of a gnomish persuasion will be encouraged to look at them and improve them where they can. I will list them as suggestions on the project page. · · ·  : 08:21, 20 February 2018 (UTC) 
*Having not participated or heard of these problems about short descriptions until today.. if the issue was vandalism affecting the short description in the first place, what would stop a vandal from just editing the &quot;short description&quot; template added to the page? With this in mind, I agree with those in the above chain of comments that if we decide to add these (which seem to be inevitable) they should be at the bottom of the pages so they aren't the easy target for first things vandalized. Because at that point why even add the template at all? [[User:Semmendinger|SEMMENDINGER]] ([[User talk:Semmendinger|talk]]) 22:04, 17 February 2018 (UTC)
The major concern regarding vandalism is that it is much less quickly reverted on Wikidata than it is here on Wikipedia.  --  () 22:20, 17 February 2018 (UTC)
That makes sense - but if the template is a wiki-data only inclusion, now we have editors spanned across both projects spending time much better suited elsewhere on reverting vandalism tasks. Eh. [[User:Semmendinger|SEMMENDINGER]] ([[User talk:Semmendinger|talk]]) 15:10, 19 February 2018 (UTC)
Vandalism is one part of the issue. Storing text content on Wikidata is another, Incompatibility of function between projects is a third. · · ·  : 06:23, 18 February 2018 (UTC)
*I support the descriptions going at the beginning of our medical articles. This will make it easier for me to keep an eye on them. Plus that is were they occur in our articles. I consider having them at the top to be a greater benefit than the risk of increased vandalism. IMO the ideal solution would be to create the ability to ONLY watchlist items from Wikidata used on Wikipedia. I consider this to be a less preferred solution. With respect to policies between WD and WP being different, I think we can likely work that out if issues occur. It is undetected WD vandalism that is the big issue. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 03:21, 18 February 2018 (UTC)
*:Doc, you are not taking into account that while a short description on Wikidata may be suitable to use to describe a Wikipedia article, this is not necessarily the case. As far as I can make out the description on Wikidata is intended as an in-house description of the data item which is linked to the Wikipedia article, not the Wikipedia article itself. There is no concept definition requiring that the article in English Wikipedia is the basis for the data item, it could be based on any original, and the linked articles may diverge over time and require different Wikidata items and descriptions. We cannot insist that English Wikipedia takes priority. · · ·  : 06:48, 18 February 2018 (UTC)
*::In such cases the Wikidata item would need to be split. If two Wikipedia articles in different languages are attached to the same Wikidata item but the articles are about disparate topics, then they should not be attached to the same Wikidata item.  (, ) 10:12, 18 February 2018 (UTC)
*::: Simple vandalism is not the real problem. It is actually subtle spin that causes trouble. One of the things that would be done by POV-pushers is to add ethnicities to descriptions at Wikidata, so  might be described as &quot;Jewish American politician, senator for Vermont&quot;. The naive folks over at Wikidata wouldn't see anything wrong with that, so it would show up on the English Wikipedia app, contrary to our established policy on stating ethnicities/religious views, etc. Despite all the argument that has gone on on the English Wikipedia to resolve those sort of issues, we would be powerless to insist on changing the displayed content on our own Wikipedia article because it is out of our control. The  is our way of regaining control of our content on the English Wikipedia. Once we have the text of the short description editable from English Wikipedia, we can use our own anti-vandalism systems to maintain policy-compliant descriptions. It is important though, to make it easy for vandal fighters to fix the vandalism, and having the wikitext in the same position as it is displayed in mobile or app view is the best bet unless shown otherwise. The present template an interim measure can be enabled to display on desktop view for any editor, so that they can get an idea of how it looks, or if they want to work on adding short descriptions. -- () 17:08, 18 February 2018 (UTC)

*Comment. I haven't followed all of the links in this discussion through, but this strikes me as yet another case of the Wikidata tail trying to wag the Wikipedia dog. I have met several cases of Wikidata-based templates importing bad data into Wikipedia, and it's often very difficult (to say the least) to do anything about them or to fix the erroneous dataespecially if the Wikidata item links to a DAB page and there is no relevant Wikipedia article. Wikipedia is explicitly stated not to be ; and, in all frankness, I do not trust Wikidata at all. It's unsourced, and IMO badly policed compared with Wikipedia.  () 22:01, 19 February 2018 (UTC)
*: You really ought to start reading the discussion before embarking on yet another round of mindless Wikidata-bashing. Nobody from the Wikidata community is trying to wag the Wikipedia dog. This entire problem is caused by WMF staff deciding to use a particular piece of text from Wikidata as a &quot;strap line&quot; for English Wikipedia articles. Not only that but they chose text that has no means of being sourced on Wikidata (and was originally intended merely as an aid to disambiguate Wikidata entries that otherwise would have the same label). Hopefully that's clearer for you now. -- () 23:16, 19 February 2018 (UTC)

Existing descriptions on Wikidata
I don't know whether the following are useful, but here are a couple of pages showing the existing descriptions on Wikidata, that are currently being shown to readers on mobile:

* 
* 

Column 1 gives a count of how many different articles each description is used on; the link in column 2 will give a list of them.

One big caveat is that the pages only include Wikidata items in the subtree on Wikidata below a given target item, looking down first by , then  below those.   This might not include everything that has eg infobox medical condition or the drugbox.

The lists will update automatically every 24 hours, or can be re-generated at will by clicking the &quot;Automatically update the list now&quot; link at the top right.

Similar pages can be created to see the current state for other topics by copying amd pasting the wikitext of [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:WikiProject_Short_descriptions/wd/diseases&amp;action=edit&amp;oldid=826729936], then going to the third line and changing the value specified for ?target from wd:Q12136 to some other Q-number, for a new top item.   Saving the page and hitting the &quot;update&quot; link should then generate the new page.

It should be possible to adapt the underlying queries to show only articles that don't yet have  templates here on en-wiki, to give a countdown list of articles still needing it in a particular field.  That's information I think can be hoisted into the query, based on the category the template sets, but I've never used that to date, so it might take a bit of experimentation, if people think that would be useful.

Anyhow, this should give an idea of the baseline that we start from.   () 18:56, 20 February 2018 (UTC)
It's nice to see these in one place to get an idea of which descriptions are just plain wrong (e.g. Alcuronium chloride: &quot;operation theatre&quot;), and which ones are just bizarre (Geographic atrophy: A form of MACULAR DEGENERATION also known as dry macular degeneration marked by occurrence of a well-defined progressive lesion or atrophy in the central part of the RETINA called the MACULA LUTEA. It is distinguishable from WET MACULAR DEG&quot;). Were these originally written by a human or a bot?  () 20:07, 20 February 2018 (UTC)

A lot of these (particularly the more generic ones) will have been added en-bloc by a Wikidata editor to all the items for articles in a particular category or with a particular template in some wiki (not necessarily en-wiki); occasionally in the process sweeping up items for articles that may have been included in the category for somewhat oblique reasons, leading to them being given completely inappropriate descriptions, and possibly inappropriate statements too. 
Some may have been added later en-bloc after a query for items with no description, but with particular statements.  Some may have been added using machine-generated descriptions from the &quot;autodesc&quot; script (see below), when the item had no other description, perhaps when it also had fewer statements that it does now.  Some may have been paraphrased by an editor from the start of an en-wiki article.  Some may have been translated from a description originally added in another language or from another wiki.  Some may have been lifted from whatever source came top of a Google search for that phrase that day.  Some ... goodness knows.
Added: a further route: if a Wikidata item has been created as a new item via the [[:m:Mix'n'match/Manual|Mix'n'match]] tool, a description for it will be imported from the description in the catalogue it has been matched from.  This I think is how the description for  came about, taken from the &quot;MeSH Diseases&quot; catalogue. [https://tools.wmflabs.org/mix-n-match/?#/search/geographic%20atrophy].  () 12:25, 21 February 2018 (UTC)   
Overall they have been assembled by no systematic process; and until now, perhaps more importantly, there's almost certainly not been any attempt at systematic quality control or assessment or review.
But that's what's there at the moment, and being served to people reading articles on mobile.
And, for all their faults, they at least give us a rough-and-ready starting set we can look at, and think about what descriptions we like and what we don't, and why.  () 22:25, 20 February 2018 (UTC)

A further group to also consider are articles where there is currently no description on Wikidata.  For these a machine-generated description is currently shown on mobile, created by Magnus's [https://tools.wmflabs.org/autodesc autodesc] script:

*  (224)
*  (3361)

(Note -- I haven't checked whether these are or not exactly the descriptions being shown on mobile; but if not exactly the same, they're likely pretty close.)   () 22:54, 20 February 2018 (UTC)

Thanks for compiling these useful tables . I have linked them from the main Short descriptions project page at :. · · ·  : 08:37, 21 February 2018 (UTC)
A quick scan through the autodesc generated descriptions does not fill me with enthusiasm for its utility for purpose. It may work well enough for other fields, but for medicine it does not often add anything useful. If the reading team are really using these on mobile view they are not doing the readers any favours. On average a blank space would be more informative and less confusing. · · ·  : 08:54, 21 February 2018 (UTC)
Will adding a short description on the Wikipedia article have any effect on these tables? How will we know if there is already a Wikipedia short description? Some people will want to concentrate their efforts to improve the description on Wikidata to articles which do not already have a description on Wikipedia.  · · ·  : 08:54, 21 February 2018 (UTC)
 I've been looking into whether I can do that.  There is an experimental service to access category data from Wikidata-style queries ([[:mw:Wikidata_query_service/Categories]]), but
(i) Access to it isn't currently enabled for ordinary Wikidata queries -- I have put in an ask for this to be allowed: [[:mw:Topic:U819g8g0y4r5cgu1]]
(ii) It uses a copy of the category information that is only updated once a week -- not so good for a cross-off list, that one would want to be able to update at will.
An alternative approach would be to use [https://petscan.wmflabs.org/ Petscan], which can take a list of articles from a query, and can remove those in a category.

Drug withdrawal &amp; Withdrawal syndrome

Can anyone think of any reason why Withdrawal syndrome should not be merged into Drug withdrawal? [[User:Seppi333|Seppi333]] () 07:19, 9 February 2018 (UTC)

 Not sure if that would really work, I think it would be less messy if Withdrawl syndrome was just a dismabiguation page. () 20:31, 11 February 2018 (UTC)
Hmm.  Well, given that Neonatal withdrawal, Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome, and Antipsychotic withdrawal are not mentioned in drug withdrawal, but are forms of drug withdrawal, I suppose the best option would be to merge and redirect these to a subsection of drug withdrawal titled &quot;Other withdrawal syndromes&quot; or something similar.  By definition, those are all withdrawal syndromes that arise from discontinuation of drug use/exposure. While it's possible to be dependent upon a non-drug stimulus, the withdrawal syndromes that arise from dependence to non-drug stimuli are not normally referred to as &quot;withdrawal&quot; (e.g., separation anxiety is a form of psychological dependence upon a person or location). [[User:Seppi333|Seppi333]] () 00:47, 20 February 2018 (UTC)
  Yes in principle you can make some merger proposals and see what responses you get. I had a look at most of the merge proposals that are within the scope of this project last year, to try and fathom out why so many weren’t getting completed. Some subjects which seemed to be obvious candidates for a merger didn’t get merged for a variety of reasons and getting consensus can get a bit messy in my opinion. I can imagine some reasons against might be that merging might create a bloated article, or not all withdrawal syndromes are drug related such as gambling or sugar cravings etc. I don't have any strong feelings either way, but I would suggest you only propose a merge if you are prepared to carry it out yourself. Feel free to take a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:CV9933/sandbox peek] in my sandbox to see where I am coming from. Regards  () 16:00, 21 February 2018 (UTC)
I do not agree with merging with a redirect neonatal withdrawal, antidepressant discontinuation syndrome and antipsychotic#Withdrawal to drug withdrawal article as these subjects are notable enough for their own articles and commonly searched for information. Another reason is that someone looking for information on antipsychotic withdrawal, neonatal withdrawal and antidepressant discontinuation syndrome is not going to search for 'drug withdrawal'. The lack of mention of these specific drug withdrawal/discontinuation syndromes in the drug withdrawal article should, I suggest, be solved by adding in a mention to said article via reliably sourced material, rather than merging substantial and notable articles.--[[User:Literaturegeek|Literaturegeek]] | [[User_talk:Literaturegeek|T@1k?]] 17:16, 21 February 2018 (UTC)
  The only article pertaining to my merge proposal is Withdrawal syndrome, not neonatal withdrawal, antidepressant discontinuation syndrome and antipsychotic#Withdrawal.  When I said &quot;merge and redirect these&quot; in my reply above, I meant merge only the bullet entries in Withdrawal syndrome for these pages and redirect Withdrawal syndrome to a section titled . I did a bad job at explaining that earlier. I'm very strongly opposed to the idea of merging entire sub-articles into the drug withdrawal article; that would be grossly NPOV unless every sub-article were merged, which is also a bad idea due to article length IMO. [[User:Seppi333|Seppi333]] () 08:11, 22 February 2018 (UTC)
Oh, okay - I see. No worries. I wonder if it would be better to merge the 'drug withdrawal' article into the 'withdrawal syndrome' article because I think that 'drug withdrawal' is not the . The ICD-10 calls it 'withdrawal state' and most authors (and possibly DSM V?) call it 'withdrawal syndrome'. So, I am leaning towards the idea that the 'withdrawal syndrome' article should be the target of the merge - with 'discontinuation syndrome', 'withdrawal state' and maybe 'drug withdrawal' bolded as alternative names in the first sentence.

Leprosy in Malta - second pair of eyes

Hello! I have recently completed a translation on Leprosy in Malta from French to English and could do with a second pair of eyes to look at it to check that everything looks okay as I am not a medic or medical historian - do rates of contagion among the population look right, for instance?

Deleting Cochrane Reviews more than 10 yrs old?

A few editors are going back and forth on the Acupuncture page removing/re-adding Cochrane Reviews that are 10-11 years old. Generally speaking, Cochrane Reviews are an exception to  as they are updated when more evidence becomes available. How do you feel about these [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Acupuncture&amp;action=history edits]? 
Thanks,
 () 03:50, 12 February 2018 (UTC)
I don't see a strong basis for making general exceptions for Cochrane reviews; your qualification &quot;Generally speaking&quot; illustrates the fact that the update schedule is not uniform, so it should not be assumed. Cochrane reviews are useful, but they are by no means the last word (as illustrated starkly by their recent [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28585310 HCV fiasco]). Cochrane reviews are quite valuable but not positively exceptional. —  () 04:40, 12 February 2018 (UTC)
I am happy to still provide the Cochrane reviews for acupuncture even if 11 years old. MEDDATE is not written in stone. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 10:48, 12 February 2018 (UTC)

 MEDDATE is inexact guidance which is predicated on the assumption that in a well researched field, a review will have been superseded after somewhere between 5 and 10 years. There's nothing special about those time spans; they are simply a reasonable estimate of the average time between significant reviews in the same field. However, when we are examining a niche topic outside of mainstream, the review cycle may well be longer than that. We certainly don't want to throw out what we know about the effect of acupuncture on knee pain, for example, simply because the last significant review was in 2007. On the other hand, if the last review of a topic was in 1977, then it is appropriate to ask whether there really has been no further research since then (It does happen: Christian Lambert's analysis of the factors governing oxygen toxicity onset has not been repeated to my knowledge since the late 1970s, but modern diving medicine is still based on its findings). Obviously it is difficult to codify, but surely a good dose of common sense would go a long way towards settling these issues. -- () 12:42, 12 February 2018 (UTC)

I sometimes tell editors not to use WP:MEDDATE so strictly. I even point to what WP:MEDDATE states about not being so strict with its use. Despite what it states, and it having been tweaked to not be interpreted too strictly, we still editors interpreting it strictly.  () 14:14, 12 February 2018 (UTC)
I tried to improve the  guidance [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources_(medicine)&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=825435467 here], but  keeps reverting.  { ·  ·  · } 13:26, 13 February 2018 (UTC)
Your change, which you keep trying to stuff in without discussion despite being reverted, is redundant and makes for clunkier wording.  Ask around, you'll find that I'm as strong an advocate as any for recognizing the limits of WP:MEDDATE (and I get incredibly frustrated whenever someone slavishly and robotically declares a source &quot;isn't MEDRS compliant!&quot; solely because it's five years and one month old).  Nevertheless, adding more and more qualifiers and caveats to the text of MEDRS isn't going to fix the problem.  We already have:
*&quot;This page...is a generally accepted standard that editors should attempt to follow, though it is best treated with common sense, and occasional exceptions may apply.&quot; (At the very top of the page)
*&quot;Keeping an article up-to-date while maintaining the more-important goal of reliability is important.&quot; (Emphasis added)
*&quot;These instructions...may need to be relaxed in areas where little progress is being made or where few reviews are published.&quot;
*&quot;In many topics, a review that was conducted more than five or so years ago will have been superseded by more up-to-date ones, and editors should try to find those newer sources, to determine whether the expert opinion has changed since the older sources were written. The range of reviews you examine should be wide enough to catch at least one full review cycle, containing newer reviews written and published in the light of older ones and of more-recent primary studies.&quot;
*&quot;While the most-recent reviews include later research results, this does not automatically give more weight to the most recent review...&quot; (Emphasis added)
*&quot;There are exceptions to these rules of thumb... A newer source which is of lower quality does not supersede an older source of higher quality.&quot;
You're always going to have editors who want to interpret the guideline as a strict rule rather than a heuristic, no matter how much we water the wording down.  Adding just one more caveat isn't going to magically turn on the lightbulb for an editor who isn't getting it.  And if there is an article where the use of older reviews seems contentious, it's not necessarily a bad thing to have an actual discussion about it—not every problem is solved by smacking down your opponent with a WP:SHORTCUT link. () 15:24, 13 February 2018 (UTC)

* There is no reason to keep a laundry list of reviews on the same topic; we generally just use the most recent one or two.  A 13 year old Cochrane review has no value when there are four (already too many) more recent, good quality reviews as with lower back pain in [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Acupuncture&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=825310217&amp;oldid=825258502 this diff]. Likewise there are two more recent reviews for RA in that diff. Both of the knee pain reviews should have been kept as there are not more recent ones cited. There is nothing especially sacred about cochrane reviews; we should think about them like we do any other (generally) good quality reviews.   () 14:09, 13 February 2018 (UTC)
* I generally agree with Jytdog:  There's nothing magic about an old Cochrane review.  If it's that old, and if we have other, equally good sources, then we should use the other ones.  (It is important to check the dates carefully on Cochrane reviews, because you don't want to confuse the old original publication date with the newer date for an updated edition.)  I also agree with :  The English Wikipedia has many mindless rule-enforcers, and many POV pushers (on all sides), so whatever we write is going to be applied overly strictly in too many situations.  If I were trying to improve MEDDATE, I'd add:
** explicit language about the &quot;ten years&quot; rule-of-thumb.  If you go read , you'll find that only the &quot;five years&quot; part of that rule is written down.  You have to hang out at this page to know that we actually mean five to ten, depending upon the details.  IMO it would be useful to say &quot;Five years for areas of active research, such as hypertension, and up to ten years for areas without significant active research, including most rare diseases&quot;.  This was discussed a couple of years ago, and was rejected partly because we worried that people would use it to cram in six-year-old review articles that editors disagree with (e.g., any review article that presents a positive POV about altmed).
** explicit language that permits several of the most recent high-quality secondary sources that we can find, for those conditions that don't even manage to get a few reviews in a decade.  For example, the dates of the three most recent review articles at PubMed for congenital methemoglobinemia are:  2016, 2008, and 1991.  We shouldn't ban the second one when it hits its tenth birthday in May.   () 03:59, 15 February 2018 (UTC)
agree w/ WAID and Jytdog-- () 11:28, 25 February 2018 (UTC)
I would actually go further and suggest that the &quot;ten year rule-of-thumb&quot; isn't widely known as rule of thumb.  (To be honest, I've never heard it cited until right here and now; it may well come up and be used casually on a subset of topic areas.) It feels like a bit of a shortcut, to essentially change the existing waffling &quot;five or so years&quot; to a still-waffling &quot;five or maybe ten years&quot; to push back the timeframe where we need to discuss the quality and currency of older sources.  'Any' attempt to codify additional time windows and conditions is going to be subject to both confusion and gaming, and I'm not sure that we should write in another specific time horizon to deal with older sources that are already handled by the list of caveats and conditions above.
Sometimes the best source will be a review from a year ago, and a three-year-old source will be wildly out of date.  Sometimes the best source will be a review from eight years ago, or twelve, or more.  There's an unhealthy focus on date of publication because it's the easiest and least-subjective criterion for editors who lack familiarity with the literature to employ.  If anything, we should strike the existing language that refers to &quot;five or so years&quot; and replace it with something less specific.  Editors should be well-nigh forced to engage with the quality and content of sources, rather than the publication date. () 13:57, 15 February 2018 (UTC)
That said, I do agree that we should encourage more flexibility and awareness of the value of using multiple sources – including ones that may be older, or even 'dated' – to provide extra support and additional context.  We do our readers a disservice when over-zealous trimming leaves the misleading impression that (a) no science occurred before 20122013, and (b) no scientfic or medical fact is supported by more than one scholarly work.

Kallmann syndrome

Hello,

I made a bold edit today and moved the genetics table off the main article onto a new page on its own Genetics of GnRH deficiency conditions.
After advise from other readers / editors I am hoping this will make the main article less technical and a bit easier for readers new to the condition to read. I hope this is suitable. 

I would like to try to get this article up to at least &quot;B&quot; standard if I can.

Serious cleanup needed at adrenaline/epinephrine

It looks like the article epinephrine was split into two articles, one for medical uses and one about its action as a hormone (which is fine with me), but there seems to be cleanup still needed related to this.  The article currently titled epinephrine (medication) should be located at epinephrine - the disambiguation in the title is no longer needed. Epinephrine currently redirects to the article at adrenaline, which doesn't seem right to me.  Plus I think because of cut-and-paste moves, there are revisions that are misplaced in the article histories.  And lastly, I think many of the incoming links to the two separate articles are going to the wrong article.   This was a complicated article split and I don't think the logistics of doing it properly were well thought out before it was done.  () 14:22, 26 February 2018 (UTC)

Death from dementia

Wikipedia has these categories:

*&quot;Deaths from dementia&quot; (should its contents not be moved to &quot;People with dementia&quot;?). 
*Deaths from Alzheimer's disease‎
*Deaths from dementia with Lewy bodies‎ 

Surely this is wrong. Is it not the case that (as with HIV or AIDS) death by these afflictions alone is impossible. 

Do you agree that the cats should be changed to example &quot;People with Alzheimers disease‎&quot; (no apostrophe).

Agreed. Just a comment on use in possessive form: One of my mentors (Victor McKusick, who developed OMIM and was a leader in description of genetic diseases) was strongly against use of the possessive for a variety of reasons, not least because of clarity and consistency - e.g. people often think Graves disease should have an apostrophe between &quot;e&quot; and &quot;s&quot;; compound forms (e.g. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome) are never possessive. There is some published analysis on this topic (e.g. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3642700/ MacAskill and Anderson 2013]), suggesting that there is time- and specialty-specific variation in the use of possessives. Since we must represent consensus, there's no one rule to guide WP's use of medical eponyms. —  () 02:48, 26 February 2018 (UTC)
 What's this about apostrophes? Its a medical opinion I'm after! In any case, apostrophes are simple affairs. There is no letter missing, therefore no apostrophe is the rule. There is no stylistic choice rule. Rules are there to keep ideas in check. -- () 15:05, 26 February 2018 (UTC)
That's 's opinion, obviously.  Oh, wait:  There's no letter missing there, so did you want me to write &quot;That's BeckenhamBears opinion&quot; instead?  
I think you will find that apostrophes are somewhat more complicated than just &quot;if you have a missing letter&quot;.  
That said, the stylistic choice is between &quot;Down's syndrome&quot; (possessive) and &quot;Down syndrome&quot; (not possessive).  Some sources/fields/people choose one style, and some choose the other.   () 16:55, 26 February 2018 (UTC)

The CDC lists Alzheimer's as one of the most common causes of death.[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm]  IMO it is therefore medically reasonable to consider Alzheimer's a cause of death. 
&quot;People with Alzheimer's&quot; (living and dead people together) is a much broader category compared to &quot;People who died of Alzheimer's&quot; (dead people only).  Whether one or the other is preferred by editors is not really a medical question.  () 18:24, 27 February 2018 (UTC)

A &quot;commentary&quot; in a journal

So per [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/acta-neuropsychiatrica/information/instructions-contributors this page], the journal Acta Neuropsychiatrica has a category of articles called &quot;Commentaries&quot;. Here is how the linked page describes them:

Commentaries focus attention on scientific issues in the field of the journal, and should highlight, discuss and amplify these issues. Commentaries may contain up to 5,000 words (not including references, figures and tables) and should include an abstract of up to 250 words and 3–5 keywords in strict accordance with Medical Subject Headings (https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/search). Commentaries are invited by the Editor-in-Chief.

There is an IP editor,  who is wanting to use , which is such a commentary, to counter the summary of a recent review, , in the Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor article.

So, do we &quot;count&quot; that commentary as a &quot;review&quot; that should have equal WEIGHT with the actual review, or is this a classic case of somebody wanting to use a weaker primary source to &quot;counter&quot; a review as discussed in ?

I have a left a note at the article talk page where this has been discussed; i imagine the IP editor will be along presently.  () 22:13, 20 February 2018 (UTC)

In my opinion a commentary of this type, invited by the editor of a highly reputable journal and almost certainly carefully peer-reviewed, should count as a MEDRS-level source. It shouldn't necessarily be given equal weight with the BMC Psychiatry review, but it should justify a statement that the views expressed in that review are not universally accepted. At a more general level, commentaries in medical journals should not be disqualified as sources for Wikipedia.  () 00:12, 21 February 2018 (UTC)
Thanks. This is an interesting question to me and I am really interested in folks' thoughts.  () 02:38, 21 February 2018 (UTC)
Some commentaries are (usually well-informed) opinion pieces, and therefore not equivalent to a review.  Others might be closer to narrative reviews, or at least secondary sources that analyze some particular point.  However, when you're talking about a reputable journal, even those written in the style of an opinion piece can be used to support non-biomedical claims (e.g., &quot;I.M. Portant says that this is the most important/neglected/promising area of research&quot;) or to report the non-biomedical fact that a certain study was criticized or not accepted.  You might also read a reputable commentary and then use  to consider how or even whether you choose to use a particular source. 
It's probably important to note that what's called a &quot;Commentary&quot; varies dramatically.  They are not always invited, and in one case that I'm aware of, the &quot;Commentaries&quot; were a response to an open call with a promise from the editor to publish anything that was on topic.  The same confusion can happen with &quot;Letters&quot; in some older journals.  &quot;Letter&quot; can mean short articles of original/primary research (which are presumably peer-reviewed) rather than a Letter to the editor.   () 17:31, 21 February 2018 (UTC)
Often one will have multiple reviews on a topic. If they come to different conclusions you will then have a bunch of commentaries from &quot;both sides&quot; explaining why the other side is wrong. And then replies explaining why the commentaries on the reviews are incorrect.
I guess the question is how much details should we go into as an overview? If the paper has been withdrawn sure, we remove it. But most commentaries do not result in that. I am hesitant to include these and not sure they deserve much weight. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 00:06, 22 February 2018 (UTC)

A 2017 systematic review stated that &quot;SSRIs versus placebo seem to have statistically significant effects on depressive symptoms, but the clinical significance of these effects seems questionable and all trials were at high risk of bias. Furthermore, SSRIs versus placebo significantly increase the risk of both serious and non-serious adverse events. Our results show that the harmful effects of SSRIs versus placebo for major depressive disorder seem to outweigh any potentially small beneficial effects&quot;. The review was criticized for being inaccurate and misleading.

I'm not really seeing the problem with this proposed change.  It would actually be surprising if a review that concluded SSRIs were possibly useless and definitely harmful hadn't been criticized.   () 23:35, 26 February 2018 (UTC)

More links to DAB pages
As threatened earlier, I have other pages bookmarked. I am not posting all of them now, because a help-please post longer than a screenful is doubtless annoying.

If a DAB page contains every option, and every link to that general topic will mean all of them, turning it into a  may be appropriate. The problem with SIAs is, that bad links in will never be spotted and corrected.

If a link to a DAB page is appropriate, the approved technique is to link to FizBuz (disambiguation) not to FizBuz. See .

Hyperglycinemia

Hello everyone! On the hyperglycinemia article I suggested that it should be made into a disambiguation page, pointing readers to the Propionic acidemia and Glycine encephalopathy articles. My reasoning is that this article as it stands is poorly formatted and largely duplicates those two. What little sourced content is here but not in one of the other two can be merged for reader convenience, so they don't have to look through multiple pages to get the full picture of these diseases. I haven't gotten any responses there, so I'm asking here before making the edit, because this is a pretty huge change. Do you agree with my reasoning?

That's a duplicate of another task.  This behavior exists because editors asked for it (in the context of infoboxes).  You can avoid it by not marking these parameters as &quot;suggested&quot; in the TemplateData.  However, it's worth remembering that different editors use different parameters.

Thanks  that talk page discussion is quite revealing but I don't see it going any further.

It does correlate with the PMC in that cite, but that PMC has been wrongly added per our discussions above. It is a 2009 version replacing a 2002 paper. I'm not sure why Rjwilms added a pmid when it should have been reverting the incorrect PMC. Oh and it does get worse because the DOI 10.1542/peds.112.6.1215 parameter in that citation is unstable leading to a resource locater issue - the correct version can be found [http://www.pediatrics.org/cgi/content/full/112/6/1215 here].

 In a nutshell, the addition of a  PMID /PMC to a citation template is a wonderful thing in my opinion, Rjwilms is very good at it.

I am not an anesthesiologist, but I have some knowledge of the area. It is not a specifically defined medical term per se, but its meaning would probably be understood by most anesthesiologists. The term &quot;hypercapnic arousal response&quot; is quite a bit more widely used, with essentially the same meaning. Regarding the second question, I think it is possible in principle, but hypercapnia would exacerbate the effects of hypoxia on body metabolism, so there is a competition between effects that go in different directions.

Unfortunately no, I don't know a good reference. For complete anoxia, the general rule is that you have about 5 minutes, give or take.

Faith healing RFC
An . There are two questions: should reliable sources be incorporated into the article describing it as a pseudoscience; and the more difficult question is, whether Wikipedia should categorise it as a pseudoscience, which implies of course Wikipedia believes that faith healing resembles or masquerades as scientific. Since faith healing is currently classified as pseudo-medicine, I felt members of this project might be interested in this tricky RFC.--[[User:Literaturegeek|Literaturegeek]] | [[User_talk:Literaturegeek|T@1k?]] 07:17, 10 March 2018 (UTC)
I responded to that a while ago (and promptly unwatched), and think this is not a very honest summary of the discussion (there is only ONE question in that RfC, and your &quot;of course&quot; angle is contended) — and so savours of canvassing. But yes, medical editors might want to have a look.  () 07:47, 10 March 2018 (UTC)
I think you are wrong Alexbrn. I feel you should have checked the RFC question before suggesting that I am canvassing. There are indeed two parts to the RFC question (1. content 2. category), so I accurately summarised the RFC above. This was the RFC question: &quot;Should we include content and category describing Faith healing as a pseudoscience?&quot;.--[[User:Literaturegeek|Literaturegeek]] | [[User_talk:Literaturegeek|T@1k?]] 07:54, 10 March 2018 (UTC)
Looks like a single question to me, hence my direct answer was &quot;Yes&quot; - though last time I looked those on the apparently &quot;losing&quot; side were trying to reframe it as two questions to muddy things. Your canvassing came from your injection of your &quot;of course&quot; opinion as though it were a given basis of the RfC.  () 08:16, 10 March 2018 (UTC)
Now you are making fun and belittling the other side, which looks like an attempt to influence how people here vote. Seems like you are doing a bit of canvassing yourself! If my use of the words &quot;of course&quot; was inappropriate, I suggest that you have counteracted it and we should leave it for there.--[[User:Literaturegeek|Literaturegeek]] | [[User_talk:Literaturegeek|T@1k?]] 08:23, 10 March 2018 (UTC)
*Clearly off-wiki canvassing is going on there. Don't let me examine how many of those editors ever edited that article before or they ever edited any other medical article or participated in any medical discussion or any other recent RfCs. Nothing is &quot;tricky&quot;, unless  is involved and it is clearly involved here. See . Not even much older and more sophisticated medical systems like Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese medicine articles have evaded this label. Let us not make Wikipedia look biased towards Faith healing.  () 02:59, 11 March 2018 (UTC)
I think you are assuming bad faith, unnecessarily. Most of those editors, who had not watch listed that article, probably found it because it was widely publicised on relevant noticeboards/projects, such as fringe, a number of religious ones and now medicine. Personally, I have the fringe and medicine project on my watch list, and have had for years. I actually don't care a lot (I do care a little) about whether there is a small blue category link at the bottom of the article, that few people will see and even fewer will care about. I just have an opinion and I am enjoying the intellectual debate and strong, somewhat passionate, exchange of viewpoints. Whatever way the vote goes, I had a good time. Ugh, am I getting addicted to Wikipedia again? LoL.--[[User:Literaturegeek|Literaturegeek]] | [[User_talk:Literaturegeek|T@1k?]] 05:47, 11 March 2018 (UTC)</segment>
