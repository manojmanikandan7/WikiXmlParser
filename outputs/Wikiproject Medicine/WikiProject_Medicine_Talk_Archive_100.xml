What are folks thoughts about this kind of detailed presentation of Trifluoperazine#Effects? (copied below).

;Effects 

|}


I have seen this kind of thing with regard to receptor binding affinity but have never seen this before, that I recall.   () 00:21, 20 July 2017 (UTC)

* There is another one here: Paliperidone#Medical_use  () 00:43, 20 July 2017 (UTC)
The Cochrane folks seem to be doing this. Lena08041993 would you please explain the plan here? thx  () 00:44, 20 July 2017 (UTC)
Look useful on the page about the medication in question. Might be useful to abbreviate it further and remove some bold as:


Trifluoperazine is an effective antipsychotic for people with schizophrenia but it increases the risk of extrapyramidal adverse effects.

* I am pretty opposed to this.  This gives a tremendous amount of WEIGHT to Cochrane content, which as I have noted several times here is too often driven by some ax the authors of specific publications are grinding, and is being added by people affiliated with Cochrane.  This is GLAMish activity gone awry, in my view.  () 11:34, 20 July 2017 (UTC)
*What are you thought if we tone it down / simplify it as above? I think it is a useful concept to provide further details from a systematic review. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 11:39, 20 July 2017 (UTC)

It is better.  We already regularly present data-driven content about adverse effects, in the Adverse effects section, and we ~sometimes ~ (not always) present content about evidence for efficacy in the Medical use section.   Have wondered for a while now about how and if we should present detailed content about evidence. People keep wanting to add clinical trial data from primary sources and that is definitely not good.  At least this is from reviews. 
In terms of the format, it is unclear to me why there is an &quot;economic outcomes&quot; row.  Did some folks decide there should be a standard template and if so where was that discussion?   And no, I don't like the table.  We write prose.  And the table gives a tremendous amount of WEIGHT and is spammy for Cochrane in my view.  
In terms of implementing, this has been getting stuck in various places.  It should be under &quot;Medical use&quot;. 
In the specific content implemented above, each &quot;Findings in words&quot; notes the strength of the evidence, and there is a redundant column for &quot;strength of evidence&quot;.  The repetition is not needed.  That is just bad execution in this one instance, perhaps. 
I have not reviewed the actual content to see how well it reflects the source yet, nor checked to see if this specific source is mainstream or another wacky one.  I no longer take it for granted that Cochrane reviews are solid. Also two cochrane reviews were done at the same time -  and  but this only summarized the latter.  Which is odd.   It does raise the question of how to deal with multiple reviews in this table format.   () 12:10, 20 July 2017 (UTC)
Agree should go under &quot;medical uses&quot; of the medication in question.
Agree that we do not need duplication between the &quot;findings in words&quot; and the &quot;quality of evidence&quot;. Best to go in the latter. I imagine the row for economic outcomes is there as evidence was looked for regarding that. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 12:37, 20 July 2017 (UTC)
The table also conflicts formatting-wise with the infobox now at Trifluoperazine and creates a big white space (e/g [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Trifluoperazine&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=791464547 this version]).  No idea how this would function on mobile.  We shouldn't be using this table format i think.  () 12:41, 20 July 2017 (UTC)
Have fixed the conflict formatting wise. On mobile the infobox takes up the whole width. This is why for diseases we moved much of the prior infobox to the bottom of the article. We should likely consider shortening infoboxes. Show / hide does not appear to work on mobile (something I did not know). [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 12:53, 20 July 2017 (UTC)

There is a big slew of these  and   () 13:25, 20 July 2017 (UTC)

Hello! Sorry for not replying earlier and causing this confusion . I used the subpages you mentioned to create/work on these tables. The plan with the table is to share the &quot;Summary of Findings&quot; from a review with people who might be affected by the topic (patients/providers of healthcare) and this table layout seemed best to oversee all the information. Since the table can get quite big (such as Trifluoperazine) the collapse function was added. It was not my intention to promote or spam content about Cochrane, thats why I used the wording &quot;A systematic review&quot; instead of &quot;A Cochrane review&quot; when posting to articles (unless the review was already mentioned). But I get your concerns about the posts now.   () 14:26, 20 July 2017 (UTC)
Thanks so much for replying and for working to improve WP!   
This is interesting on two levels - first, should we more regularly provide this kind of detailed data on efficacy, across our drug/intervention articles?  We typically don't now.  And second, is the table format OK, or should this be prose?  This thread just opened and folks will weigh in over the next few days.  If you could hold off on implementing further until we get a sense of the consensus that would be great.  () 14:27, 20 July 2017 (UTC)
re collapsing (&quot;Since the table can get quite big (such as Trifluoperazine) the collapse function was added&quot;). I note that table-collapsing does not work in mobile view (table is always uncollapsed=shown; no show/hide button). The design should keep this in mind. Best general solution I can think of is: try to use a section(header) to contain the large table (which is collapsible in mobile view). Of course this works best if the table is ~alone in the section. - () 17:50, 20 July 2017 (UTC)

Another design feature we could look at is: 

&quot;A review of trifluoperazine found low quality evidence that it was effective for people with schizophrenia, however, it appears to increase the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms. ()&quot;

I've been involved with the group at Nottingham University on the design of these tables and on the tracking of their use, so I'm naturally happy to see them continue as I believe they add a useful precis of information in that particular field (schizophrenia) which helps to make those articles more easily comparable with each other. I think we should always be open to new techniques to present information on-wiki and I'm keen to see how this one works out. I've promised to assist in an evaluation of how this initiative turns out in six months time or so, and everyone would be welcome to add their views. As the discussion here has petered out, I'm going to suggest to Lena that she now continues to add the tables and invite other WPMED regulars to track of how the roll-out is working. Cheers -- () 15:44, 26 July 2017 (UTC)

Lana has continued, like [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Risperidone&amp;curid=185381&amp;diff=792613249&amp;oldid=792445075 this], which i reverted.  I do not agree that these tables are a good thing, pretty strongly, for the reasons described above. How shall we arrive a consensus on this?  () 15:49, 27 July 2017 (UTC)

 As I stated above that I would suggest she continues, I've re-instated the table at Risperidone. There is no requirement for consensus prior to making an edit, and Lana has already waited a week now as you asked earlier. How long do you want someone to wait for consensus to develop from a moribund discussion? I do believe, also strongly, that these tables are worth experimenting with, for the reasons I described above. As the presence or absence of the tables is a binary choice, I don't see any possibility of common ground to form a consensus on, sorry. -- () 16:35, 27 July 2017 (UTC)
 Thinking about it, perhaps I should expand on why I see these tables as an improvement to the articles. Examples of the readers that I think would benefit are those who might read Management of schizophrenia and want more information than is available from the table there. That table is reasonably good by the way, but has almost no sources later than 2014, so may be due for an update. I envisage that we should be creating a category something like [[:Category:Treatment of schizophrenia]] or [[:Category:Management of schizophrenia]] (which is best?) that encompasses Risperidone and the other anti-psychotics as well as Music therapy and similar treatments that have been examined. In each case, a standard layout showing the strength of evidence for differing treatments allows for better comparisons by ensuring that all the factors are presented. I certainly don't see these as 'set in stone', but I do think that this sort of presentation offers something that we don't presently have. -- () 17:07, 27 July 2017 (UTC)
 And now I seem to have been unfortunately drawn into an edit-war with  over this issue. While I appreciate the work he does in WPMED, in this case I disagree completely with his objections on the grounds of . I have no reason to promote Cochrane, other than that I respect the work they do, and I believe they generally (not always) represent the highest quality of sourcing we have available. I would very much appreciate more opinions on this issue. TIA. -- () 17:16, 27 July 2017 (UTC)
 Thanks for giving your further thoughts.  As I noted in my OP, adding this kind of content is being done across a large swath of articles, exclusively using Cochrane reviews, by people interning with Cochrane.  This is GLAMish activity and like much GLAMish activity it falls very much on the borderline between promoting Cochrane and improving WP.  The singular use of Cochrane reviews (have these folks looked to see if there are more current meta-analyses done outside the Cochrane library?); the starkly different formatting; and otherwise great WEIGHT given to these tables pushes it over toward PROMO.  
And while this whole project invites people to be bold, there is also a very clear ethos that if you are going to do systematic changes across a whole set of articles, the general practice is that you get consensus first.  
Pressing forward after objections have been raised is a further sign of COI/PROMO.  This is what I mean by PROMO. 
Am just looking for clear enough buy-in from everybody that this makes sense... also the concerns about how this works on mobile are pretty important.  Would you please weigh in on that Rexxx? thx  () 17:19, 27 July 2017 (UTC)
Concerning the mobile version of the pages: There are already lots of not-collapsed tables in the articles- especially when it comes to pharmacological data. The Risperidone article mentioned above is a good example for this. There are no more tables to be posted and by now there was no solution to the mobile-view issue, but I will have another look for it (and possibly auto-collapse the other tables I come across?)  () 18:03, 27 July 2017 (UTC)
 Thanks for the further clarification, . I do understand your concerns and I appreciate that there is a often a thin line between enthusiastic newcomers and promo. On the one hand, Lena is doing an internship with the Cochrane Schizophrenia group, so is mainly involved with their work and may not be aware of other other, newer reviews. On the other hand I've always felt that Cochrane is &quot;on our side&quot;: they are crowd-sourced and dedicated to the same objectives as us – making the best health-related information available to everyone, but they do have a much larger base of actively-involved experts than we do. I believe we have the opportunity to tap into their resources and develop relationships as &quot;natural&quot; partners, We're a long way from that at present, because outside bodies still have a steep learning curve to manage before they can contribute comfortably to Wikipedia. Nevertheless, I'm encouraged by the fact that they seem willing to try, as in this initiative. I really don't want to see them discouraged, so I'm prepared to AGF on their intentions for the present, and I hope I can persuade you and other WPMED regulars to do so as well.
 As for the issues of collapsing tables on mobile view: in my humble opinion, that is a problem for the developers on mobile. There is a clear need for collapsible content in many places, and we don't do ourselves and the project any favours by compromising the desktop view, simply because the devs haven't implemented the same functionality in mobile yet. Unfortunately, my experience is that unless there is pressure for improvement, nothing much gets done – and that is a shame, considering the ever-increasing use of mobile by our readers. I can quite happily write collapsible content in apps that I develop for my own phone and tablet, so I'm not expecting any potential arguments about it being &quot;too difficult&quot; to hold water. Anyway, I know that it's terribly helpful in this case, but my position is remains that these sort of issues need to be sorted out by the devs, not the editors. -- () 14:29, 28 July 2017 (UTC)

 I think you'll find that the paper has been taken down by the three sites that published it. It seems that may have been embarrassed by the thought of leaving it up, so I doubt we'll need the template applied. It's worth noting here the &quot;journals&quot; that accepted the fake paper:
* International Journal of Molecular Biology: Open Access (published)
* Austin Journal of Pharmacology and Therapeutics (published)
* American Research Journal of Biosciences (published)
* American Journal of Medical and Biological Research (wanted $360 to publish)

While you're working on that article, would you mind saying what the diet actually involves?  &quot;It's a fad diet&quot; is not sufficient information to differentiate it from the candy bar diet.

() 21:45, 25 July 2017 (UTC)

*The Pritikin diet is actually one of the least faddish of diets.  It essentially amounts to incorporating the FDA recommendations of ten or twenty years ago into a specific diet:  minimize fats and cholesterol, eat lots of whole grains, fruits and vegetables, limit alcohol, don't smoke, minimize salt, etc.  There is indeed little hard scientific evidence for it, but really it's hard to find solid science supporting any sort of dietary recommendation.

Saturated fat and cardiovascular disease controversy

*
Is this really a &quot;controversy&quot; that is documented in pertinent RS? Much of the sourcing seems to be synthesizing the topic from sources that do not discuss any such &quot;controversy&quot;. (Also posted to ).  () 12:55, 24 July 2017 (UTC)

 I think there is some evidence for a difference of opinions among good quality reliable sources. The table at Saturated fat and cardiovascular disease controversy #Summary table of data shows several conflicting views from multiple sources. I would have thought that our  policy would dictate that we report and attribute those differing views without taking sides. I agree that there's nothing I could see that calls this a &quot;controversy&quot;, but I'm pretty sure that the topic of &quot;Saturated fat and cardiovascular disease&quot; is notable and the sources are good.  specifically warns against combining multiple sources to reach a conclusion not stated in any of them, but I don't see that the article reaches any conclusions (perhaps except calling the topic controversial). Would the solution be to rename the article to Saturated fat and cardiovascular disease and replace the word &quot;controversial&quot; in the opening with &quot;differing&quot;? -- () 13:36, 24 July 2017 (UTC)

 We have Cardiovascular disease#Diet which spins out into two articles: Salt and cardiovascular disease and Saturated fat and cardiovascular disease controversy. So I think just ditching &quot;controversy&quot; from the title might do it. What concerns me is that Out There there seems to a conspiracy theory that runs something like this: we have been subject to the malign influence of Big Sugar™ who generated a lot of fake science about cholesterol's harms to keen us in sugar's thrall. But now The Truth is coming out and the evil of carbohydrates is being fought against and we should all be eating high-fat diets. That I believe is why this is being framed as a &quot;controversy&quot; (see e.g. [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BVHgCwAAQBAJ&amp;redir_esc=y this book]). So far as I can see, reputable sources don't see it this way. (Add: If you look at Sugar#Cardiovascular disease you will see a lot of non-MEDRS sources being used to make that case that sugar is the real culprit here, while fat is a-okay).  () 14:31, 24 July 2017 (UTC)
The story about how the recommendations against fat came into existence is an interesting one. Was initially based on really poor evidence.
Over the years the evidence have not supported concern regarding total fat intake. The recommendation remains to replace saturated with unsaturated based on tentative evidence. Concerns regarding dietary colesterol have also been removed. Agree with removing &quot;controversy&quot; [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 20:03, 24 July 2017 (UTC)
I happened to notice this thread while trying to figure out if Wikipedia has a clue yet. It looks like things are glacially moving along. As a student of natural foods for 46 years I, and most people into natural food, have long known that the issue that matters most is expeller-pressing (the colder the better) versus [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Vegetable_oil#Article_is_missing_info_on_dangers_of_trans_fats_and_other_synthetic_chemicals_produced_during_refining high-temperature solvent extraction] [http://www.fao.org/docrep/v4700e/V4700E0a.htm#Potential%20side%20reactions%20during%20high-temperature%20processing]. The latter method creates synthetic chemicals not found in nature, and so the body has not evolved to deal with it. Looking at the reviews in Saturated fat and cardiovascular disease controversy shows that the real problem is that they are getting contradictory results due to the fact that they don't differentiate between those 2 forms of extraction in their studies. If they did, then the studies would come to more definitive conclusions in my opinion. This is my point about reviews sometimes being just a stirring of crap. If the reviewers are clueless, and the studies are clueless, then the review is clueless. I don't see much real peer review of reviews. At least this article allows more  significant viewpoints, and no single review is written as holy writ in the narrative voice of Wikipedia. Peace out. -- () 21:35, 1 August 2017 (UTC)

Overfat

The concept of being overfat is in the news this week.  (This is too much adipose tissue, regardless of height/weight ratio.)  We don't seem to have an article on it yet.  Normal weight obesity the closest related concept that I could find, but overfatness additionally includes most people who are overweight and obese, so it's not the same thing.   () 05:08, 27 July 2017 (UTC)
If there isn't enough for an article; a subsection at Adipose tissue + redirect would be an option (cf. Organ fat.  () 12:09, 27 July 2017 (UTC)
There's also underfat.  I've seen claims that the WHO is going to recommend the overfat/underfat concept as a useful approach, so I expect that we could find sufficient sources.  They're looking at a simple waist circumference measurement, which is cheaper than scales – you are overfat if your waist circumference is more than half your height.  To determine that, you just need a piece of string.  It doesn't even need to be a measuring tape.   () 15:27, 27 July 2017 (UTC)
And at what ratio is one underfat?  () 20:40, 27 July 2017 (UTC)

Overfat is obesity. Underfat is a type of malnutrition specifically underweight. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 22:24, 28 July 2017 (UTC)
I don't think that's quite right.  Obesity is usually defined by BMI (which is purely a height:weight ratio), which means that some bodybuilders are defined as being &quot;obese&quot; but not &quot;overfat&quot;, and that many people are &quot;not obese&quot; but are actually &quot;overfat&quot;.  Similarly, bodybuilders can be underfat without being underweight.
Underfat seems to be defined by the percentage of body fat.  I think that &quot;underfat&quot; is anything under 10% for men and 20% for women.  
Anyone who's interested in the subject could start reading papers such as .   () 15:59, 29 July 2017 (UTC)

Overfat appear to me to simple be a newly invented term for obesity. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 04:56, 31 July 2017 (UTC)

This is a viewpoint without formal support from WHO etc. I would not create stubs but appropriate redirects. Were these terms to gain traction in the literature, we can always create longer articles based on the best quality sources.  |  22:44, 1 August 2017 (UTC)

But what are the appropriate redirects?

Doc James has redirected overfat to obesity.  Problems:  That article's second sentence defines the concept in terms of BMI.  And you can be overfat while being overweight but not obese, and you can be overfat while having normal weight.  The redirect implicitly defines &quot;overfat&quot; as meaning someone with a very high weight:height ratio, when the main point of the concept is to identify people who have a normal weight:height ratio but still have too much adipose tissue.

Doc James has also redirected underfat to underweight.  Problem:  The article sentence defines the concept entirely in terms total weight (compared to height or age).  It also implies that every person who is &quot;underfat&quot; will also be &quot;underweight&quot;.  Competitive body builders have normal weight or higher, but are significantly underfat (half to two-thirds the lower end of healthy fat tissue).  A person with muscle atrophy can be underweight but still have normal fat levels.

So far, I've been unable to find a good target for redirecting these to.  Everything I've considered feels misleading.  () 00:03, 2 August 2017 (UTC)

It's a concept introduced by independent authors but without much authority. I really think the redirects are reasonable, and I don't think we should be creating articles specifically to accommodate the new coinages just because there's some chatter in the press about it. Happy to be shouted down, but I think we risk .  |  00:06, 2 August 2017 (UTC)
I'm always up for a good redirect.  I'm just not convinced that these are very good.  Perhaps it's a problem to be solved by expanding the subjects of those articles.   () 02:02, 2 August 2017 (UTC)

 I don't accept that it's the place of Wikipedia to cater for every neologism coined by trying to pander to the media's continuous need for fresh copy. If &quot;overfat&quot; does eventually become accepted as being defined as &quot;too much adipose tissue, regardless of height/weight ratio&quot; by a significant number of reliable medical sources, then I'd be happy to see that as an addition to the obesity page – and we'd have the sources to accurately write a section describing the phenomenon. In the meantime, Doc James' definition (&quot;it's the same as obese&quot;) or [https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/overfat the Collins English Dictionary] (&quot;having a higher proportion of fat in the body than is normal or healthy&quot;) are just as good a description of the term as anything coined by [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5206235/ Maffetone, Rivera-Dominguez, and Laursen], and a redirect to obesity is adequate for now. -- () 18:21, 2 August 2017 (UTC)
Overfatness, as contrasted with overweightness, appears in , which is a review written more than half a century ago.  [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=OyYiSJtqSkEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA64&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q=overfatness&amp;f=false This 1906 pediatrics book] says that overfatness in infants is due to overfeeding and interferes with walking.  This [https://search.proquest.com/openview/267102b38cb90d000c1a597383ab1765/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=1818403 1936 paper] says that overfatness causes causes heart disease in women.  The word appears in PubMed in reviews in every decade since the 1960s (and in hundreds of non-reviews), and outside the veterinary context, it commonly appears specifically in contrast to the focus on body weight.
Outside the human medical context, the word overfat itself appears in 1572, in the Antwerp Glossary.  While I admire a certain amount of conservatism in language, I do not think that we can sustain the claim that it is a neologism.   () 19:58, 2 August 2017 (UTC)

 And yet, outside of PMC5206235, I don't see a single article that defines overfatness as &quot;too much adipose tissue, regardless of height/weight ratio&quot;. The other articles you cite all seem to be concerned with the relationship to &quot;excess morbidity and mortality&quot;, i.e. &quot;a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have a negative effect on health&quot; – which is the definition of obesity according to our article. Although I accept that overfat is not technically a neologism, it is a deliberate re-purposing of an existing word to a new, more specific meaning, which is about as close as you can get to a neologism for a word that somehow already exists. -- () 22:07, 2 August 2017 (UTC)
I don't know about that.   Overfat has always meant too much adipose tissue.  How could it be re-purposes to mean something that it has always meant?  That 1936 paper says that the difference between women who have heart disease and women who don't is overfatness, which sounds exactly like the kind of thing that modern sources are saying.
Obesity, on the other hand, says , right next to a nice little table that indicates that no matter how overfat your body composition is, and regardless of whether you have accumulated excess body fat to the extent that it has harmed your health, if your weight:height ratio is okay, then you might have normal weight or be overweight, but you're definitely not obese.  (But maybe that part of the article just needs to be corrected?)
I wonder, in a historical context, if we might say quite the opposite:  About forty years ago, the term obesity was narrowly re-purposed to a new, more specific meaning, that of a height:weight ratio that tends to strongly correlate with overfatness in Class I, II, and III obesity, but which assumes that everyone else is fine.

The author seems to have found it under the new name of Alcohol and drug use among university students, so that's a relief.  A new page patroller tried to redirect it to Drug education, which is only tangentially related (e.g., mostly about programs rather than actual drug use, and mostly about children instead of young adults, etc.).

Our readers

The recent survey at [[:m:Strategy/Wikimedia movement/2017/Sources/Brand awareness, attitudes, and usage research (July 2017)]] may interest those of you who talk about Wikipedia and its readers (e.g., to funders and universities).  It includes information about whether people know that they can edit (three-quarters of them already do), why they haven't edited themselves (leading reason:  fear of making a mistake), etc.   () 21:06, 2 August 2017 (UTC)

Another bit of work [https://meta.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:July_2017_Monthly_Metrics_Meeting.pdf&amp;page=28 about Readers' motivation]:

* The most common reason to read the English Wikipedia:  You saw something in the news, and you wanted to learn more about it.  This is about 30% of the surveyed readers:  at that moment, they were at Wikipedia because of something they'd seen in the media.  
* If you are already familiar with the subject that you're reading, then you're probably reading popular, central topics on leisure subjects, and you like long articles.  This is the guy who is reading up on his favorite sports teams.
* People who are reading for work or school tend to read exactly the subjects you would expect, and they are more likely to read the whole page than others.  If education is your main motivation, then work on basic subjects that students will read when they're trying to complete their homework.

Change to each of MEDMOS and PHARMMOS re leads

This hasn't been contested, but i just wanted to note that last week I updated discussion in MEDMOS about the LEAD [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AManual_of_Style%2FMedicine-related_articles&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=792028891&amp;oldid=791939384 here] and likewise at PHARMMOS [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AWikiProject_Pharmacology%2FStyle_guide&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=792029739&amp;oldid=763664896 here].  

This was to help solidify the move many of us have been making toward de-cluttering the first sentences, which is especially important for mobile viewers.  In case anybody wasn't aware of it, the WMF reading team found en-WP leads to be generally so cluttered that they decided to start adding the &quot;description&quot; field from Wikidata to en-WP articles, so that people on mobile could quickly see what articles were actually about.  Which they stopped doing, but left us with an obligation to actually address the issue.   A good discussion about this was held at FAC, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Featured_article_candidates/archive68#First_2.5_paragraphs_of_the_lead here].

 There is just one very major issue with this — that I'm not sure many here have noticed. Google ranks our pages by relevance, and one of the most important factors that ties a page to a search query (if not the single most important factor) is whether it appears early in an article in bolded text. I've experimented with this a few times, including names or moving them to the rather new synonyms section of the infobox — and the effect is massive. It can bring a page from the top result to appearing on the second or third page. 

This has a major impact on readership — and I think we need to have a long and hard discussion about synonyms before we decide on relegating them to the infobox. Until Google takes into account synonyms in the infobox we need to be very wary of this. [[User:CFCF|Carl Fredrik]] 23:56, 30 July 2017 (UTC)

I agree with Carl that a long and hard discussion about synonyms and trade names is warranted before we make changes to two longstanding guidelines that apply to thousands of articles, including several FAs.

Sure, I do not think we are proposing moving ALL alternative names, we are just talking about moving the uncommon ones and keeping just the common one in the first sentence. This is what I take from &quot;raft of alternative names&quot;
Pronunciations do not belong in the first sentence. We are an encyclopedia not a dictionary. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 06:02, 31 July 2017 (UTC)

*I would agree that we should discourage unusual names, but when names makes up to ~20% of mentions in the literature or common vernacular it is likely to bring in a fair amount of search traffic.

I stated in  that we should use notes to include alt names for drugs since they often have many synonyms, but I'm not sure if/how text bolding impacts search rankings if/when it occurs in notes. So, based upon the effects of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Amphetamine&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=793766607&amp;oldid=793156157 bolding that I've added today to the alternate names] which I've also listed below on their future search rankings (redirect traffic is a proxy for this), using bolded names in a note could be an ideal solution to avoid cluttering the lead with names while increasing search rankings.  I realize that these rankings can vary across devices, so the search rankings I've listed here are really just here for personal reference; the effect of bolding on the redirect views statistics is likely the better measurement for me to compare here.
*α-methylphenethylamine - the article is [https://www.google.com/search?safe=off&amp;q=α-methylphenethylamine 3rd in google search]; the &quot;alpha-methylphenethylamine&quot; redirect page appears 2nd in that search

Keep in mind that the effect on search rankings and traffic that I'm testing here is not necessarily the same thing as the effect of including bolded names in the first lead sentence.  So, CFCF may still be correct even if this bolding produces no effect on search rank or traffic. [[User:Seppi333|Seppi333]] () 20:36, 3 August 2017 (UTC)

On an unrelated note, I'd suggest using the [https://tools.wmflabs.org/redirectviews/ redirect views tool] to assess the impact of redirect traffic on total article traffic instead of the page views tool. [[User:Seppi333|Seppi333]] () 20:38, 3 August 2017 (UTC)

I feel pretty retarded for stating that redirect views would be a (decent) proxy earlier; redirects obviously contribute to their target's webpage ranking (based upon the number+weight of incoming links to the redirect), but bolding an alternate name intuitively would increase the webpage ranking of the article itself, not redirect page with the same name.  Redirects are seldom highly ranked in google search.
In any event, testing what CFCF proposed isn't even necessary; there's ample literature on the weighting of text styles in webpage ranking: [https://books.google.com/books?id=zdlZ2rrcZWEC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=pagerank+text+style+bold&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SEKL0h2NmX&amp;sig=xHumrI85eFYbm58lYQVOeCbhgxY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj6sdKFqL7VAhVO8WMKHRmgCisQ6AEIUjAI#v=onepage&amp;q=pagerank%20text%20style%20bold&amp;f=false] [https://books.google.com/books?id=KsHTl_2Pfl8C&amp;pg=PA19&amp;lpg=PA19&amp;dq=pagerank+text++bolded&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rNdS0vc0VI&amp;sig=iUVVMTsBlU_pU65cppBmm5Kt7Pc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiv_I7QqL7VAhVT0WMKHZcGAwcQ6AEIMTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=pagerank%20text%20%20bolded&amp;f=false] [http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/INF5100/h11/undervisningsmateriale/google.pdf] [http://edshare.soton.ac.uk/1706/93/webgraph_update.pdf] [https://www.opentracker.net/articles/improve-google-ranking-and-pagerank], among others.  The effect of bolding a term on article webpage ranking is likely most significant in the instances where a specific phrase is bolded in just 1 Wikipedia article; I'm assuming the bolded terms in a Wikipedia article are weighted according to some variant of the tf-idf algorithm, since bolded terms that occur even in the middle of an article, like the &quot;blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier&quot; term in the middle of the choroid plexus article, seem to significantly boost pagerank for the article even when other articles use the unbolded term more often (e.g., [https://www.google.com/search?q=blood–cerebrospinal+fluid+barrier&amp;oq=blood–cerebrospinal+fluid+barrier &quot;Choroid plexus&quot; occurs on the 1st page of search for the BCSFB]; the redirect page &quot;[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blood%E2%80%93cerebrospinal_fluid_barrier&amp;redirect=no blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier]&quot; and the incoming links to that redirect also contribute to this ranking though). 
Bolding the same term in 2 WP articles that are highly relevant to the term still seems to significantly boost webpage ranking for both pages; I'm basing this statement on &quot;signaling cascade&quot; being bolded in signal transduction and biochemical cascade, where signaling cascade redirects to the former article; those articles are the first 2 results I get when I search the term &quot;signaling cascade&quot; in google.  [[User:Seppi333|Seppi333]] () 20:40, 4 August 2017 (UTC)
I have not see any evidence that bolding makes a difference or having alt names in the first sentence makes a difference with respect to pagerank / pageviews.
I prefer putting alt names in the infobox than putting them in a &quot;note&quot; after the first word in the article. Also believe that alt names should be covered under society and culture within the body of the article aswell. I prefer less bolding rather than more. A wall of bolded text I find annoying.

Is your intention to allow Checkusers to  for sockpuppets when someone is suspected of having an undisclosed conflict of interest?   () 18:51, 4 August 2017 (UTC)
It is pretty evident there that James is looking for clearer WMF policy support for permitting the existing WP usage: it should be usable to more completely find the socks of an existing puppetmaster. I can't see any good reason we wouldn't want that. There's a secondary issue where a puppetmaster runs socks just to mask a COI. Again, why wouldn't we want that to be detectable by CU?  [[User talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl!]] 20:21, 4 August 2017 (UTC)

Am looking for clarification to run CUs on accounts involved with paid editing which appear to be socking. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 02:41, 5 August 2017 (UTC)
Unfortunately, that's not what you wrote.  What you wrote is that you want to run CUs on accounts that you suspect of being paid editors, regardless of whether they appear to be socking.  You did not include any limitation about &quot;which appear to be socking&quot;.
Your proposed wording, &quot;to prevent contributions without disclosure as defined by the TOU&quot;, means &quot;It's okay to checkuser *anyone* that *any* editor suspects of being an undisclosed paid editor, without limitation&quot;.  It does not mean &quot;anyone that any editor suspects of being an undisclosed paid editor AND we have some reason to suspect socking, but NOT if we don't have any reason to suspect socking (beyond the fact that at least one person suspects the account of being a paid editor)&quot;.   () 15:54, 5 August 2017 (UTC)
There is judgement required for making all these decisions. When is there enough evidence to suspect socking? Really anyone could be socking which does not mean we run CUs on everyone. The same applies to suspected paid editors. It needs to be an obvious case before a CU should be run IMO. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 23:26, 5 August 2017 (UTC)
The question is whether it should be reasonably &quot;obvious&quot; to someone solely that the account is (possibly) paid – even if there is no &quot;obvious&quot; reason to suspect socking (that's what you wrote) – or if it needs to additionally be reasonably obvious that the account is socking (the original policy). 
Two accounts that add similar content in similar ways indicates a risk for socking.  A single account waxing enthusiastic about a product might be paid (or might be someone who confused Wikipedia with the Amazon customer reviews section), but it does not indicate a risk for socking.  Is it your desire to checkuser all of them, or just the first one?   () 03:26, 6 August 2017 (UTC)
I am interested in checking a specific type of undisclosed paid editing account. These account make 10 to 12 very minor edits and wait 7 days to become auto confirmed. They than publish a 2,000 word article perfectly formatted in a single edit and never edit again. They are always socks. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 03:34, 6 August 2017 (UTC)
What you wrote isn't limited to consistent patterns like that.  The breadth of &quot;checkuser anyone that anyone suspects of paid editing for any reason&quot; is probably drawing more opposition than your goal needed.  &quot;Socks (for example, a new account that behaves like a previously identified paid editing account)&quot; probably would have sailed through with almost no opposition.  () 17:15, 6 August 2017 (UTC)
Yes &quot;new accounts that behaves like a previously identified paid editing account&quot; would work as well. I guess I could try that on the next round. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 01:12, 7 August 2017 (UTC)


 Maybe something like &quot;a new account that behaves like a previously blocked paid editing account&quot; would be clearer? The current difficulty is that even when a new account is editing like a previously blocked paid editing account, unless those other blocked accounts have been active in the last 3 months CUs often deny the request saying that it is stale. Would be good to specify that the other accounts have been blocked not just identified to limit the use to this specific case. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 15:17, 7 August 2017 (UTC)
That would be clearer, but (a) I'm not sure that you want to limit it only to blocked accounts or (b) that you will ultimately be satisfied with something quite so narrowly drawn.
It would probably makes sense to talk it over at Meta, if a subsequent round is needed.   () 20:48, 7 August 2017 (UTC)

Oshtoran syndrome


I stumbled upon Oshtoran syndrome this morning. At quick glance, this article seems almost hoaxish.

I found nothing in Google Scholar or Google Books, and barely anything in a plain old web search (after excluding ebook copies of the Wikipedia article). 
While it may not be a &quot;hoax&quot; (which implies an intention to deceive), it is probably not verifiable as a recognized disease entity in any reliable,  sources – and certainly not outside the handful of researchers who seem to have 'discovered' it.  
We should probably send this to AFD as being too soon.  Also,  shows links from several other articles, so there will be cleanup work elsewhere.  Before going to AFD, it would probably be useful to strip out or tag unreliable sources.   () 15:16, 8 August 2017 (UTC)
 the reason I was wondering about a hoax is because of this source that they keep providing at this article plus the ones that link to it: https://issuu.com/mostafaabdollahi/docs/oshtoran_case_study. You can only see the title clearly. Then if you go to page two, you can faintly see that the entire page is simply lorem ipsum filler. The case study isn't actually anything more than a title page.  () 15:34, 8 August 2017 (UTC)
If it's a hoax, then they've gone to a bit of work, such as creating https://issuu.com/oshtoran.syndrome and https://patient.info/forums/discuss/oshtoran-syndrome-513740 It's possible, but perhaps that's more work than someone would put in just for a joke.   () 18:53, 8 August 2017 (UTC)
We've had some impressive hoaxes. Whatever the case, people too often use Wikipedia to promote novel ideas, theories, etc., hoping to popularize the matter through Wikipedia and have the topic picked up and spread by other outlets (even decent sources). That is likely what is going on here, hoax or not. Probably best to AfD the article.  () 19:21, 8 August 2017 (UTC)

Rigvir 

Hello, 

I was wondering if editors with more medical knowledge and Wiki experience could have a look at this article about anti-cancer virotherapy drug Rigvir (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIGVIR). It has been discussed [http://wikivisually.com/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine/Archive_33#RIGVIR before] and nominated for deletion due to lack of references and poor quality. At that time there were almost no sources in English available and there is still no new medical research that would match MEDRS, but in the past year Latvian media has written extensively and critically about Rigvir, so I've tried to reflect this in Wikipedia. 

The new sources are the following:
[http://skepticisms.lv/enciklopedija/rigvir-when-science-takes-a-back-seat/ Extensive overview of Rigvir history, problematic advertising and evidence level, article in a pharmaceutical magazine, translated with the help of Latvian Skeptics Association]

[http://www.lsm.lv/en/article/societ/society/latvia-to-review-state-compensation-for-rigvir-anti-cancer-drug.a223586/ Public broadcasting service article - Rigvir registration and compensation status to be reviewed]

[https://archive.is/nM7r8 Article from the main investigative magazine in Latvia - 3 Latvian medical associatons request to remove Rigvir from Latvian drug register due to insufficient evidence of efficacy, to review clinical guidelines and to evaluate conflicts of interest (Google Translate version])

[https://archive.is/1Au9d Extensive story with more details about registration and status, in Russian, from main news portal, Google Translate version] 

There are quite a few more articles in Latvian and Russian from trustworthy media sources in Latvia, but, since I'm a Wiki newbie, I am not certain these would be accepted, unless translated? I would really appreciate some comments from experienced medical editors - how could the article be improved and are these new sources OK?-- () 10:07, 11 August 2017 (UTC)

Hi ,
Any language is good.  (, in case anyone asks you about it.)  Sources do not need to be translated.  If another Wikipedia editor needs to check the source, and does not read Russian or Latvian, then they can use machine translation or ask one of the many multilingual editors for help.  (The same general idea applies to sources that aren't free to read on the internet:  if someone needs to check a page in an expensive book, then we can figure out how to get it, through  or  or old-fashioned methods, like interlibrary loan.)
News articles are usually weak sources for biomedical information, but they can be very good sources for business information (e.g., patents, sales, profits, manufacturing locations, etc.).  An article about a drug should contain both medical and non-medical information.   () 19:42, 11 August 2017 (UTC)

In answer to  question about sources, MEDRS encourages recent review articles from peer-reviewed academic journals, and discourages recent primary sources from peer-reviewed academic journals.  In simpler terms, if the article says that the author read a hundred articles and is summarizing them, than that's usually good, but if the article is about research personally performed by the authors, then that's usually bad ().  Recent textbooks are good, but they tend to be a bit out of date, so they're probably not so helpful in this particular instance.   () 19:35, 11 August 2017 (UTC)

I really don't see that this needs to be its own Wikipedia article.  articles are not ideal. Until this topic has enough content to be more than a stub, it should reside at the Nipple article.  () 23:29, 4 August 2017 (UTC)
I think that depends on whether you think that the subject of the article includes or excludes the same skin condition when it is caused by breastfeeding (i.e., Cracked nipple).   The ICD-10 category includes both fissues and fistulas.   () 00:20, 5 August 2017 (UTC)

I don't see why that would prevent the fissure of the nipple topic from validly residing at the Nipple article. If we want to have a comprehensive Nipple article, both fissure of the nipple and cracked nipple should be mentioned in the Nipple article.  () 17:07, 6 August 2017 (UTC)

I guess that the reason why one should read about nipple fissures/crackles is either breastfeeding difficulties or breast disease, not that one just wonder about nipples. Suggest that fissures/crackles could be mentioned in &quot;Other breast conditions&quot; section in breast disease and &quot;Breastfeeding problems&quot; section of the breastfeeding difficulties article.

Sea buckthorn oil &amp; cancer

*
Some disagreement on how/whether a source should be used to describe the &quot;potential medicinal properties&quot; of sea buckthorn oil. More eyes welcome!  () 20:16, 27 July 2017 (UTC)

* Yeah, there seems to be a feeling that animal and cell line studies cannot even be mentioned in an article, which I find deeply troubling. I'm also quite concerned about  using a buddy to circumvent , but that's possibly another discussion - () 20:19, 27 July 2017 (UTC)
They shouldn't be mentioned to imply health benefits, especially when taken from a very poor source.  () 20:22, 27 July 2017 (UTC)
 But that's what successful animal model and cell line studies do -- imply (potential) clinical benefits. They don't demonstrate those conclusively, or provide hard evidence of them, but they most certainly do suggest them. What you are saying is that we cannot ever mention them at all, which, again, I find deeply troubling (particularly as someone doing cancer research). - () 20:26, 27 July 2017 (UTC)
 I say no such thing. Such research does not imply benefits; it implies rather &quot;more research is needed&quot;. It is deeply ironic that the text you summarized from this article speculated that the &quot;anti-cancer&quot; potential of this oil was down to its vitamin E - which is perhaps the canonical example of how &quot;promising&quot; lab results do not translate into positive human health effects (quite the opposite). We shouldn't be using this old, rather silly source.  () 20:32, 27 July 2017 (UTC)
&quot;More research is needed&quot; is exactly the kind of thing that MEDMOS says that we should not be including in articles.   () 16:17, 29 July 2017 (UTC)


Here are the two versions that have been proposed:

(1) Several studies on rats, mice, and human cancer cell lines have shown that buckthorn oil can have anti-carcinogenic properties, but no human clinical trials have been undertaken to confirm these. Reviewers have suggested that the apparent anti-carcinogenic properties may be due to the presence of compounds, such as vitamin E, with known anti-cancer activity.
(2) Laboratory work is examining sea buckthorn oil for its potential properties, although there is no evidence as of 2017 that it has any effect on human health.

In (1), I like the idea of saying that the effects are probably due to already known compounds.  For editors who are inclined to cry &quot;PROMO!&quot;, I think that this will actually discourage people from buying it.  (Why buy that?  You could just get some Vitamin E instead.)  Also, note the &quot;Reviewers have suggested&quot; line:  This is not a primary source.  

In (1), I also like specifying the &quot;rates, mice, and cell lines&quot;, since I think that more clearly indicates the early-stage nature of the research than the generic &quot;lab work&quot;.  Assuming it's factual, then I'd prefer &quot;basic research&quot; to either of these.  If this has transitioned into applied research, then we could fairly summarize this stage as &quot;early pre-clinical research&quot; if people don't like mentioning rodents and cell lines.

In (2), I kind of like the vagueness of &quot;potential properties&quot;, although I might specify &quot;medical&quot;.  (It is presumably not being investigated as for its nutritional properties or its lubricating properties.)  

In (2), I don't believe that the line if &quot;no evidence that it has any effect on human health&quot; is actually true.  If it contains Vitamin E, then we actually do have evidence that it has &quot;effects&quot; (many of them bad) on human health.  It would probably be more accurate to say &quot;no evidence that it prevents or cures cancer in humans&quot;.  It would unfortunately by too SYNTHy to then add &quot;and Vitamin E, which this oil contains, might cause cancers&quot;, unless we can find a source that explicitly says that in the context of buckthorn oil.  (Also, it cites a 2006 source while saying &quot;as of 2017&quot;).

I think we could probably find a compromise between these two, but overall I think that (1) is somewhat better.   () 16:17, 29 July 2017 (UTC)
Concerning #2a, sea buckthorn oil is available as a dietary supplement and as either a whole oil product or ingredient in skin care products, so there are potentially different effects and clinical studies possible on various body functions, but there have been no such studies on what is a rather rare botanical source notoriously discouraging to cultivate and harvest. For #2b, the current statement represents the vagueness of the one source: sea buckthorn pulp and seeds both contain oil and vitamin E in amounts not yet defined quantitatively for their compartmental differences. Interpreting the sentence specifically for the article topic, it is true that &quot;there is no evidence that it (sea buckthorn oil) has any effect on human health.&quot; -- () 16:39, 29 July 2017 (UTC)
I've found and added a review that says cosmetic/skin care uses are the primary market.
That source additionally contains these sentences:    
That looks like enough quantitative information for even someone like me to be able to figure out some unsafe consumption levels, using nothing more than information contained in Wikipedia at mg% and Hypervitaminosis E, and overdosing is certainly &quot;an effect on human health&quot;.

* I cannot believe that  made it through peer review.  Full of woo and promotional language about these berries like:   Snake oil much?  The authors disclose no COI.  If that is the case, this is clearly an example of overenthusiastic academics. 
 The journal is Lipids in Health and Disease ([https://lipidworld.biomedcentral.com/about about page])  published by biomed central.  The editor in chief of the journal is Undurti Narasimha Das (article created just this March, single editor, promotional) has been trying to develop PUFAs as cancer drugs since the late 1980s' (see [http://www.amity.edu/events/eventdetails.asp?id=2754 here]) and the journal lists his current affiliation as UND Life Sciences, a zombie startup company (been around a while, no evidence it has gotten funding or gotten anything done) trying to develop PUFAs as cancer drugs. 
The journal has an impact factor of just around 2.  
It obviously has very bad peer review, and we should treat articles published by this journal with caution, and use them only as back-up when we have strong sources supporting content. 
Unsurprisingly this piece is cited on the websites of companies selling woo-driven cosmetics, like [https://alix-co-nz.myshopify.com/blogs/blog/16175924-plant-oils-love-your-skin this one]. 
Gah.  () 18:14, 29 July 2017 (UTC)
&quot;Anything above 1&quot; is our usual hope for impact factors, so two's not that bad.
I'm not the least bit surprised by the claim that it &quot;improves skin tone&quot;:  putting any orange dye on your skin would do the same, and outside of Western cultures, that's generally considered a positive quality.  (For white people, &quot;orange&quot; means &quot;you need a different spray-on fake tan&quot;.)
I think that there's nothing quite so reliable for saying that this is basically cosmetics than a recent review from two women from a reputable Polish university extolling its many virtues for cosmetics.  &quot;This is makeup (makeup is not chemotherapy)&quot; is IMO an excellent basic POV for this article.   () 21:28, 29 July 2017 (UTC)
Agree with Jytdog. IMO extra ordinary claims require extra ordinary evidence. Looking at the refs supporting some of the claims in that paper and they simple do not.

WAID  I realized that here, as you have elsewhere, you are just trolling.  I tend to be too earnest and take other people at face value, and completely missed that you do this.  I will stop taking the bait.   () 21:58, 29 July 2017 (UTC)
No, I'm not trolling.  This stuff – even if some shyster is trying to add it to the nearly endless list of Stuff Sold To Desperate Cancer Patients – is actually used in cosmetics.  I firmly disagree with your POV that this is a &quot;bad ref&quot;.  Sure, they're enthusiastic about it, but they also provide details about chemical analysis, extraction methods, and actual, legitimate commercial uses.  I realize that the US $200,000,000,000+ cosmetics industry is of little interest to you or the average WPMED editor, but that actually is what this stuff is used for.  EWG's database lists [https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/browse.php?containing=702863&amp;showproducts=1¬old=1 almost 200 different cosmetics products containing this oil].  It's incomplete (doesn't include [http://www.sephora.com/seaberry-moisturizing-face-oil-P374948 this $1-per-mL moisturizer], for example), but there's nothing about cancer in there.  
I understand the initial reaction to some of the enthusiasm in that report.  &quot;The oil is used as a soothing agent&quot; – sure, but any GRAS vegetable oil is going to be soothing to irritated skin after a chemical peel.  Or butter, if you like that better.  However, the fact that this isn't a unique quality to this particular oil doesn't change the fact that this oil is one of several oils that is actually used in that setting.
But I do not see any reason to believe that this source is wrong in saying that this product is primarily used in cosmetic skin care, or that it has a poor shelf life, or that the oil is used in shampoo (such as [http://www.sephora.com/seaberry-revitalizing-shampoo-P387074,this one] or [https://www.obliphicaprofessional.com/discover-luxurious-hair-care this one]) or any of the other non-medical facts that [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sea_buckthorn_oil&amp;diff=792939938&amp;oldid=792929800 you reverted here].  What makes a source reliable isn't that it is unenthusiastic about a product.  What makes a source reliable is that we can rely on it to get it right for whatever points we're using it to support.  In the end, I think that this source knows enough about the cosmetics industry that we can use it to talk about non-medical cosmetics.   () 06:55, 30 July 2017 (UTC)

I am sorry you do not see anything wrong with using a source that ~looks like~ it is a solid part of the biomedical literature but is a steaming pile of promotional woo.   There were one or two editors who added promotional garbage to this article, the one about the plant species, and the article about the genus and i have gone all the way back to the genus article to rework this.   I will end up back at the oil article later this week probably.  There is actuallyl significant use of this plant and extract in China and Russia and other eastern european countries and significant agricultural production there, and many products on the market using it.  That can all be made clear using sources that are not advertisements masquerading as scientific discussion.  () 19:02, 30 July 2017 (UTC)
If a source mixes stuff that is clearly false unsupported with correct stuff unfortunately the false unsupported stuff tarnishes the entire source.

That is the case for nutrient contents in separate compartments of the seed and pulp oils. Reputable sources have not published methods and results for such analyses, and where nutrient contents are described, such as in the source WAID found, other non-credible statements and claims contaminate credibility of the whole source. WP's usual source for reliable nutrient assays - [https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search/list the USDA National Nutrient Database] - contains no entry for seabuckthorn fruit or its oil, probably because the crop was never successfully farmed in the USA or Canada. Even though seabuckthorn has cultivation success and many products and uses in Eastern Europe, Russia, and China, there appear to be no reliable sources for nutrient assays in these countries. -- () 20:06, 30 July 2017 (UTC)

If not, then I suggest that you might be better off trying sentences like &quot;Parts of this source use language that is common in fashion magazines, such as 'recovering' from oil-stripping hair treatments by smearing a few drops of oil in your hair, and that jargon is completely unfamiliar to old white guys like me&quot; instead of &quot;a steaming pile of promotional woo&quot;.

This bit &quot;sea-buckthorn oil protects against infections, prevents allergies, eliminates inflammation and inhibits the aging process&quot; is unsupported. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 04:25, 31 July 2017 (UTC)
Doc James, &quot;unsupported&quot; does not mean &quot;clearly false&quot;.  I agree that no citations were included in the abstract, but there certainly are citations to support those statements elsewhere in the paper, so I can't even agree that this is &quot;unsupported&quot;.  
To their credit, they don't claim that these are truly unique qualities for this oil; most topically applied oils prevent some infections in certain situations (e.g., if moisturizer reduces the likelihood of the skin cracking), reduce skin inflammation, inhibit that aspect of the 'aging process' known as thin, dry skin, etc.  They cite  and  (both reviews) for one particular mechanism that they mention briefly with respect to this sentence, so I think we can reasonably claim that these are &quot;supported&quot;, even if we're personally skeptical of the effect size, the likelihood of significant benefit for the dose usually encountered, whether plain old vegetable oil would be just as good, etc.  (Other mechanisms for these same effects cite other papers, of course; e.g., the first section after the abstract also deals with skin inflammation.)  () 05:16, 31 July 2017 (UTC)
Generally it is the job of those proposing ideas to support them. If something is unsupported it is not appropriate here. Making health claims as definition as that needs an RCT and non are provided. [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 06:26, 31 July 2017 (UTC)
 click the link to the PubMed abstract for the first review that this paper cites in support of this claim, and find the words &quot;review of the voluminous literature, including randomized controlled trials&quot; under the description of the methods.  If this source actually needs RCTs for us to be able to cite it to say that one commercial application of the agricultural product is putting it in shampoo, then it apparently has met your standard.

That's true, but there's more to it than that.  The template is not appropriate unless &quot;this article&quot; actually &quot;incorporates&quot; text from the source.  Incorporating means that it's &quot;mixed in the body&quot; of &quot;this article&quot;, e.g., without it being obvious to a potential re-user that any &quot;text&quot; in &quot;this article&quot; is licensed by someone other than the Wikipedia editor.

I agree that the &quot;the data&quot; in this paper (i.e., not anything else) is CC-0.  It's possible that the numbers in the handful of tables is meant to be considered &quot;the data&quot;.  However, as a general rule, narrative reviews have very little actual &quot;data&quot; generated by the authors, and this may simply be a license statement that the journal requires and which happens to be irrelevant for this particular paper.  
On the question of which one to use, the answers are:
* If you incorporate sentences and paragraphs from the source into an article, then you use CC-BY.
* If you incorporate &quot;the data&quot; (only), then you use CC-0.
* If you directly incorporate nothing (e.g., you cite it as a source, but write all the sentences and paragraphs yourself), then you use none of these templates.  You cite a CC-BY or CC-0 article exactly like you cite a source with full copyright protection.

There are a few good uses, such as jellyfish stings, and of course first-aid for burns, (though even for that the evidence seems somewhat less than convincing).

Broken image rotation
Here [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=HIV/AIDS&amp;oldid=795805964#Prevention] the image is off by 90 degrees. Anyone know how to fix this? [[User:Doc James|Doc James]] ( ·  · ) 16:25, 16 August 2017 (UTC)
Something looks broken in the image thumbnailer. It's also 90° off in the commons info page and image-history on that page, but the full-sized original image is correct. I tried resizing the thumbnail and that did not fix it, so it's something currently broken not something cached.  () 16:39, 16 August 2017 (UTC)
It looks like editor Utcursch has just an hour ago marked the image to be rotated into correct position by Rotatebot -- this will probably fix the problem once it happens.  (Problems of this sort can easily be caused by incorrect use of image-editing programs, by the way.)  () 17:52, 16 August 2017 (UTC)
Seems to have been fixed.  () 16:27, 17 August 2017 (UTC)
