Wikidata descriptions are short (about half a sentence, and omit ‚Äôthe‚Äô or ‚Äòa‚Äô from the beginning) and contain the kind of information we'd put on a disambiguation page.  You want something that is simple, direct, accurate, and neutral, because these will often get translated and will probably not be updated much.  I just did a few, and it‚Äôs much easier than I thought it would be.  There's no complicated structured data stuff; you just write down what the thing is and save the page.  Here are the steps:

# Go to Wikidata (click here for the main page:  )  Log in, if you want to.
# Search for your favorite class of disease.  [https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?search=cancer&amp;title=Special%3ASearch&amp;go=Go Look at this sample.]
# See how some of them have a page title followed by a disambiguation-style description, and others just have a page title?  Let‚Äôs add some missing descriptions. 
# Click something that is missing a description or that has a description that you want to improve.  Look at the top of the page.  You‚Äôll see the name of the item (the page title), and immediately under it, either a short description (with an edit button) or a blank where there ought to be a short description (with a save button).  
# Edit or add a short description:  &quot;rare genetic disease‚Äù, ‚Äútype of skin cancer‚Äù, ‚Äúviral infection that can be prevented by vaccine‚Äù, or whatever.
# Click the save button right next to the description field.
# Optionally, fill in the ‚Äúalso known as‚Äù blanks, for all of those things that have multiple names.
# Repeat hundreds or thousands of times.

These fields are used to direct editors to the right database records (so that articles about &quot;cancer the crab&quot; won't get improperly linked to &quot;cancer the disease&quot; in Wikidata), but they‚Äôre also used by other services to provide really basic information, e.g., to students in developing countries, who just need to know what ____ in their textbook is.  Consequently, I think we should add this to the list of projects for the medical translation task force.  It should be very easy work, especially if we keep the short descriptions simple.  

I would really appreciate it if several of you would follow through my step-by-step directions and report back here about whether it worked and if you encountered any difficulties.  If we can work out some good, simple directions, then we‚Äôll post them some place useful.  Thanks, WhatamIdoing (talk) 01:03, 6 March 2015 (UTC)
I think this is an excellent idea. Including a ref might be a good idea. The NIH has great simple definitions of disease and could be used as refs. Doc James (talk ¬∑  ¬∑ ) 05:12, 6 March 2015 (UTC)
You are right it was super easy to add. Not sure if a ref can be supplied? Doc James (talk ¬∑  ¬∑ ) 05:16, 6 March 2015 (UTC)
You can add refs by clicking the add button in the gray-shaded area at the bottom of a particular statement/row entry. It looks like this: . Seppi333 (Insert 2¬¢ | ) 09:45, 6 March 2015 (UTC)
 I can't see the reference there . Also just looking very quickly through the linked list [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q172341 ovarian cancer] and [https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q504775 bladder cancer] have very different descriptions, one of which is arguably wrong. There might be a tendency to do them too quickly, and if so they aren't going to be of much use. If the statements aren't referenced they're of no use for Wikipedia. -- CFCF üçå () 09:57, 6 March 2015 (UTC)
Hmm... just do a text search (ctrl-F in most browsers) for the term &quot;reference&quot; and you'll see it... there's 27 instances on that page. The actual reference(s) for each entry is/are hidden in a drop down menu next to &quot;reference(s)&quot;. Seppi333 (Insert 2¬¢ | ) 15:22, 6 March 2015 (UTC)
CFCF, these are -type descriptions.  We use this sort of unreferenced description on about 40,000 pages on wiki, plus about another 100,000 hatnotes.  Sources aren't what makes something usable on wiki, especially when the information is  (&quot;This is cancer-the-disease, not cancer-the-stars&quot;).  For many of these descriptions (&quot;Kidney cancer is cancer of the kidneys&quot;), if you need a source, you're probably doing it wrong. WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:59, 6 March 2015 (UTC)
That's precisely where the problem lies. DABs are so often incorrect it almost frightens me. What does &quot;of the kidneys&quot; signify? A metastasis to the kidney? Because that isn't kidney cancer.
The links I gave say &quot;bladder cancer ‚Äì type of cancer originating from bladder tissue&quot; and &quot;ovarian cancer ‚Äì type of cancer that affects the ovaries&quot;. The first one is correct, but the second one is so vague that it could easily be incorrectly interpreted. If we don't take care to make sure we're correct we're creating something entirely useless, and wasting our time ‚Äì if even only a little of it. That's why I think we should reference these statements as well. -- CFCF üçå () 17:07, 6 March 2015 (UTC)
Mets to the kidneys would be &quot;in&quot; the kidneys, not &quot;of&quot; the kidneys.  
Vagueness is not necessarily wrongness.  When you only get half a sentence, and you need it to be understandable to a person with limited English or education (or to be useless, and therefore a waste of your time), then you may have to give up on providing all the details.  If they need all the details, then they will have to click through to the articles.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 21:06, 6 March 2015 (UTC)
Kidney cancer is &quot;cancer that developed from the kidneys&quot; not in the kidneys. Yes it is subtle. Thus refs useful 
Not being able to add refs is not the end of the world but unfortunate if it is the case. This sentence should be very similar to the first sentence of our article which should be reffed. Doc James (talk ¬∑  ¬∑ ) 21:16, 6 March 2015 (UTC)
I'm not sure I entirely grasp how Wikidata is supposed to work, or perhaps this browser is making a mess of things, but 
with some trial and error, I discovered by examining that
https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P604 is the Wikidata property for the MedlinePlus ID, where one finds https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/$1.htm described as the &quot;formatter URL&quot; for that property. Combining that formatter URL with the value 000889 for the MedlinePlus ID statement under https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q172341 (Ovarian cancer), I constructed https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000889.htm which turns out to be the MedlinePlus url for Ovarian cancer. Now, that would be sufficient as a reference, but there doesn't seem to be a way to indicate that it is the one ref used for the description in English. I suppose it would be reasonable to flag that in the edit comment if all else fails, but it seems there should be a cleaner way. It appears that the error there originates with the use of the [http://disease-ontology.org/ Disease ontology] entry DOID2394 &quot;ovarian cancer: A female reproductive organ cancer that is located_in the ovary&quot;. That entry cites but does not correctly reflect [http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?CdrID=445074 the NCI dictionary of cancer terms entry for Ovarian cancer], which is more elaborate and nuanced. I'd hate to think each entry will need this much exploration to fix. LeadSongDog come howl! 23:09, 6 March 2015 (UTC)
Didn't know NCI had a dictionary, but that means it's public domain, so maybe we could just pull all their definitions?! -- CFCF üçå () 11:11, 7 March 2015 (UTC)
The NIH has lots of simple definitions. Some they are basing off of use after an appropriate review is done. Doc James (talk ¬∑  ¬∑ ) 22:10, 8 March 2015 (UTC)

Can I just add that almost every article on Wikipedia now has a link in the left-hand 'Tools' section called &quot;Wikidata item'. Clicking that link takes you to the Wikidata entry corresponding to the article. For the curious, it's a quick way to check on whether Wikidata has got the correct info on your favourite articles. If it hasn't, then please correct it! You can't break anything because its a wiki and you quickly pick up on how the organisation of the data works. Wikidata has over 13,000,000 data items that anyone can edit and making sure that its medical content is accurate is going to need a lot of eyes. --RexxS (talk) 01:26, 9 March 2015 (UTC)



Hello once more, medical experts.  This old AfC submission has plenty of references, but was never submitted for inclusion in the encyclopedia.  Is this a notable topic, and if so are there changes that should be made before it's submitted?‚ÄîAnne Delong (talk) 17:17, 5 March 2015 (UTC)

it seems to be promotional in nature, and that (if I am not mistaken) seems to be evidenced by the history section editor
unfortunately, articles of this nature are detrimental to the bases of Wikipedia, because as opposed to giving information they are simply &quot;self promoting&quot; and have little interested in educating the reader beyond &quot;go buy my product&quot; (that's not to say it has no redeemable qualities it does), however I believe the pros are outweighed by the cons--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 19:06, 5 March 2015 (UTC)

Dear medical experts:  This old draft about a medical journal is about to be deleted.  Is this a notable journal, and should the page be kept and improved instead?‚ÄîAnne Delong (talk) 10:24, 9 March 2015 (UTC)
though im certain it is a good health-related journal, the information contained in it is little more than promotional.--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 10:30, 9 March 2015 (UTC)
I didn't see an impact factor or any selective databases when I looked at their website. Probably fails  IMO. Everymorning talk 12:39, 9 March 2015 (UTC)
New journals rarely have established impact factors, so that by itself signifies little. The creator/editor logs in very infrequently, and has not edited since requesting the undeletion of that page. Their wikiemail is not enabled. It won't hurt much to leave it in draft space for a few months more in case they return. LeadSongDog come howl! 21:58, 10 March 2015 (UTC)
Okay; I have postponed its deletion for six months.  If the journal hasn't shown signs of notability by then the draft can be left to fade away.‚ÄîAnne Delong (talk) 02:25, 11 March 2015 (UTC)

On the other hand, if the KDM1A isn't notable apart from LSD1, doing nothing will result in the draft being deleted shortly.‚ÄîAnne Delong (talk) 14:23, 11 March 2015 (UTC)

Attempt to use primary sources

Guideline on image references

Hi all. I have been a Wikipedia editor for a while now. Recently I focus my efforts on adding images to the articles to help readers in understanding the concepts easier. Trust me, images help tremendously for readers to learn new subjects/concepts. Usually the articles I have edited are not related to medicines. Until recently after I visited the National Museum of Health and Medicine, I started touching some medical-related articles. To my surprise, the  has a pretty high bar which I didn't realize. Thanks to seasoned editors (Doc James and Jytdog) to help me out to understand the guideline. So I consider myself to be a newbie here in the medical content arena. 

As I mentioned, I work with images for articles. My experience outside of the medical content is that, in general, the inclusion of images lacks inline citations. While the text content of an article has great reliable sources as inline citations, but most of the time, no citations for images. I think this is a big  loophole of Wikipedia. With no verifiability, readers/editors cannot be certain that the image in question is an actual depiction of the subject or concept. Similar question for image caption as well. We can see some examples even in the medical articles such as CT scan images of diagnoses without citations, etc. The  is strong on copyright concerns but weak on verifiability. 

I would like to also share my experience working with images. I think it is much easier to find reliable sources for concepts or textual descriptions. It is much harder to find references with visual descriptions. Most of the time I have to resort to use primary sources (which are allowed in article content per general RS) because non of secondary sources would include a picture or &quot;visually&quot; describe things in such a way that we can use as an inline citation for an image. My believe is that if there is no secondary source out there, primary sources that can convey visual description is better than not having any citation at all. To me, images without citations can easily become .

Now, let get back to the medical content. With such high bar on references (e.g. a review article on a science/medical journal indexed by PubMed), as we know, those articles  mostly contain text, some graphs and tabular information. It is harder to find images that can be used as a reference from such articles. Now we are back to a decision on what should be done. Either we stand by the same high-bar for image citations or we just allow images to be included without citation at all. The former is one extreme in which we could deprive readers ability to understand hard concepts (biomedical is hard to most people) because we cannot include images without high-quality references in the same standard as MEDRS. On the other extreme, we let the loophole exists and hope that the editors include images with correct depictions of the subjects/concepts without a way to verify them. If you ask me, I would think somewhere between the two extremes is the best approach. 

I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on this. Z22 (talk) 19:29, 7 March 2015 (UTC)
Yes thanks. We are aware of this. While one can paraphrase the ideas in a bit of text one cannot paraphrase a picture. Thus we are in the situation that one must often take the uploaders word. Pictures however do get reviewed by the many medical experts at WPMED for accuracy. Doc James (talk ¬∑  ¬∑ ) 19:37, 7 March 2015 (UTC)

I'm interested in what folks have to say about what is an appropriate way to source captions for a picture uploaded to WP.  It seems to me that ~most~ any effort to relate something about of source A to some feature B in the image (or the whole image), will be .  What is the acceptable way to source captions for self-generated images?  Thanks! 19:54, 7 March 2015 (UTC)
as Doc James indicated Pictures however do get reviewed by the many medical experts at WPMED for accuracy, in regards to WP:SYN -  &quot;A and B, therefore C&quot; is acceptable only if a reliable source has published the same argument in relation to the topic of the article. If a single source says &quot;A&quot; in one context, and &quot;B&quot; in another, without connecting them, and does not provide an argument of &quot;therefore C&quot;, then &quot;therefore C&quot; cannot be used in any article this seems to be the rule to follow--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 20:34, 7 March 2015 (UTC)
Images should be sourced, particularly graphs and charts, because it's important that they receive the same treatment as the rest of the text. I've seen more than a few examples where the graphs are out of date, incorrect, or from an unreliable source. In terms of other images (eg symptoms, pathophysiological mechanisms etc) I guess attribution is key, done in the actual image data is best. 
If you're referring to using images as references, well, that is a great idea and I think it's particularly relevant to anatomical articles, which I edit a fair bit. Often an image shows something obvious like A connecting to B, but it is too obvious for a book to state in the written text. I don't see a problem with using images as references, so long as we treat them the same as other references. --Tom (LT) (talk) 22:05, 7 March 2015 (UTC)
Yes of course the data within an image needs a ref. But many images do not have data within them Doc James (talk ¬∑  ¬∑ ) 22:54, 7 March 2015 (UTC)
I'm interested in what folks have to say about what is an appropriate way to source captions for a picture uploaded to WP - the information in the caption, which is meant to describe the image.  It seems to me that the only way to avoid a mess of SYN is for the source for the caption to be the same source from which the image came.

The OP used the same caption and sourcing in several articles, like [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Head-mounted_display&amp;diff=649944534&amp;oldid=648061179 this].

Doc James (talk ¬∑  ¬∑ ) 22:53, 7 March 2015 (UTC)

Do you (or does anybody) have any insight into PAG or other discussions, about how to appropriately caption and source the second one?  That is the question.  Thanks! Jytdog (talk) 01:46, 8 March 2015 (UTC)
 I think it's important to start by examining the point of a caption. The guidance is at . First of all, it is not to describe an image - that is the job of alt text. A caption should normally expand on the reason why the image is there in he first place, and that is to provide information visually instead of having to make a description in the text of the article. The best images will make their point self-evidently. Others may need some explanation to the reader: look at what happens when the image Doc James mentions above () is used in an article: Eye tracking#Optical tracking - the caption needs four lines just to explain what you can't see in it! In medical articles an image might be used so that the lay reader can get some idea of the appearance of signs of a condition, or perhaps to show the position on or in the body where a condition has effect. Surely the caption should be saying something like &quot;A rash caused by meningitis doesn't disappear under pressure.&quot; or &quot;A very prominent wedge-shape area of airspace consolidation in the right lung is characteristic of bacterial pneumonia.&quot; so that it expands or explains the point that the image has been chosen to illustrate. Once the image and caption are understood to be a substitute for &quot;a thousand words&quot;, it should remain only to see what the source would be for those thousand words. If you can't find one, then you might need to ask is the image contributing to the article, or is it just decoration? --RexxS (talk) 17:27, 8 March 2015 (UTC)
precisely, any image should augment information, not confuse (by being a decoration)--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 10:34, 9 March 2015 (UTC)
Hi Z22,
For the information you're after, you want to read the other page (guideline) about images.  The  section is the most important.  In medical terms, the key point is that the image should look like the thing that you're trying to describe.  A blob under a microscope need not be proven in an independent reliable publication to really, truly be whatever bacteria (etc.) you're trying to illustrate; it need only look like it.  Editors figure out whether it looks like it by taking their common sense and best judgment to their favorite web search engines and seeing what other images are so described.  
This cuts in both directions:  if it looks like the thing, then you can use it, even if it turns out that it's not actually the thing in question, but if it doesn't look like the thing, then you can't use it, even if you've got a stack of top-quality sources swearing that it really is that thing. 
We don't have images for the purpose of proving that bacteria exist.  We have them to show readers what the bacteria look like, in ways that can't be done through words.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 07:37, 8 March 2015 (UTC)

My 2¬¢: all diagrams need to be referenced on the image page and its caption needs to be referenced if it says anything that isn't stated and cited in the article text. The only non-diagram image in which I've encountered a  issue is ; I decided to just use that in amphetamine because I doubt anyone can tell a vial of clear water apart from a vial of pure free base amphetamine in a picture, so it probably doesn't matter anyway.  If an image is questionable as to whether it depicts its topic and you can't contact the uploader, then just don't use it. Seppi333 (Insert 2¬¢ | ) 22:11, 9 March 2015 (UTC)
EDIT: Assuming an image is of sufficient quality, one notable benefit to citing your images is that you sometimes receive emails from professors or other authors requesting permission for or providing notice of reuse of your image (e.g., I've learned that  is being used for a college-level psychology &amp; behavioral neuroscience textbook).

Penis transplantation

There have been a lot of headlines recently about what is supposed to be the world's first successful penis transplant, which was performed last December in South Africa. For whatever reason, it is only just being reported on now.

the #20 reference is not a review article within 5 years, otherwise looks good--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 10:27, 15 March 2015 (UTC)
I'll go through and copyedit it sometimes soon; I agree it needs some work. Based upon what I remember from the sources I've used, it's associated far more with oral intake of impure illicit methamphetamine (e.g., caustic impurities include lye and lithium battery acid, depending upon how it's synthesized) than the meth's adverse effects.  Dextromethamphetamine (recreational isomer) actually has weaker peripheral effects than both amphetamine isomers (although levomethamphetamine has stronger peripheral effects than both), though moderately stronger CNS effects.  I gather that would make bruxism (CNS-mediated effect) worse but involve less xerostomia (I'm assuming this is related to the peripherally-mediated drying effect of substituted amphetamines mucous membranes). It needs copyediting to reflect this, though I need to go back through the sources I used to write methamphetamine first. Seppi333 (Insert 2¬¢ | ) 13:17, 15 March 2015 (UTC)

Am trying to clarify the definitions of low, moderate, and high Wikipedia use. Doc James (talk ¬∑  ¬∑ ) 04:25, 14 March 2015 (UTC)
I believe they gave their conclusion early on Wikipedia is an open web-based encyclopaedia and is therefore more responsive to changes in knowledge than conventional encyclopaedias. Without a doubt, Wikipedia is one of the most dominant online reference sources, gaining in presence, quality, and content [3] - also for retrieving health information [10,12,13]. Not only the lay public but health professionals, researchers, and medical students depend on it as a resource for medical information if im not mistaken they did seem to indicate a much higher percentage of male use (except in &quot;low&quot; use)--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 10:31, 14 March 2015 (UTC)
The options for use in their survey were &quot;1-5x/week&quot;, &quot;Daily&quot;, and &quot;1-5x/month&quot;, and &quot;Never&quot; - I'd guess the first three are high, moderate, and low use respectively. Seppi333 (Insert 2¬¢ | ) 18:31, 14 March 2015 (UTC)

Potentially false. Any given student merely thought it was false, no other details or evidence that there were indeed errors, and in which articles, as you already point out. They provide the questionnaire which were used, and these data were not collected. Matthew Ferguson 57 (talk) 10:05, 15 March 2015 (UTC)

If I haven't overlooked it, the authors failed to indicate or to ask whether a specific language version of Wikipedia was considered. Since the students were asked at universities in Germany, Austria and Norway, they might (primarily) use the German, Norwegian or English Wikipedia. --Leyo 17:07, 15 March 2015 (UTC)

Hi All

I've just uploaded three hundred or so images from the UK Department for International Development to Commons [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Images_from_Department_for_International_Development here], many are related to medicine and there are a large amount of images specific to Ebola treatment.

New study about reliability of Wikipedia for medical students 

The study is [http://advan.physiology.org/content/39/1/5.long Is Wikipedia a reliable learning resource for medical students? Evaluating respiratory topics]. The good news is that it's open access, the bad news is its conclusion: &quot;...most articles had knowledge deficiencies, were not accurate, and were not suitable for medical students as learning resources.&quot; Everymorning talk 17:52, 6 March 2015 (UTC)
so while there saying its not suitable, their also saying Two methods were used in calculating readability. Table 2 shows the readability scores (mean ¬± SD) of each article calculated by Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level and Readability Coleman-Liau index. For the first method, the readability was in the range of 9.4 ¬± 1.8‚Äì22.6 ¬± 10.7, whereas the second method recorded a range of 10.0 ¬± 2.6‚Äì19.6 ¬± 8.3. A strong correlation was found between the scores calculated by the two methods (r2 = 0.744, P &lt; 0.001). The scores obtained from the two methods indicate that Wikipedia articles were geared to a college level rather than to the public,.. so therefore its college level reading, but not suitable for students(that seems to be in conflict as a statement)?--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 18:06, 6 March 2015 (UTC)

Interesting, and rather better informed as to how WP works than most research. But their 2 mentions of &quot;administrators&quot; (who they think rate articles) are wrong. The belief that WP comes &quot;at the top&quot; of search results, referred to casually &amp; cited to several papers, is surely outdated for google at least - it certainly is for cancer articles. Johnbod (talk) 18:20, 6 March 2015 (UTC)
Some thoughts:
#The study assumes that Wikipedia should be judged as a whole. They compare the quality of very developed highly trafficked articles with stub articles on minor topics and getting no traffic. The presumption is that readers cannot discriminate between developed and undeveloped Wikipedia articles, and that they read hypertext as they would text on paper. In my opinion, most people could check Alveolar lung disease ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alveolar_lung_disease&amp;oldid=600793954 archive]) and determine that they should click through to other articles for more information.
#They made no reasonable attempt to list drawbacks on their research methods.
#Part of their criticism of the articles is, just like for 10+ years, &quot;Although the number of editors/authors involved in the 40 articles looks impressive, there was no information available about these authors and their experience. Wikipedia allows anyone to edit and make changes to articles; thus, the authors are not necessarily doctors or respiratory physicians or academics specialized in an area related to the respiratory system&quot;, and that statement is part of the research insight from which they drew conclusions
#&quot;There were deficiencies in the use of educationally useful images/illustrations and tables to explain information given indepth&quot; Whatever else Wikipedia is doing I expected that there would be broad agreement that the media collection in Commons is impressive. If this is not the case then I think this part of the deficiency is being corrected as time passes more quickly than other problems.
#&quot; Details of treatment and evidence-based information available from major clinical trials, guidelines/position statements released from major societies/associations, such as the American Association for Respiratory Care, American Thoracic Society, European Respiratory Society, British Thoracic Society, and Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand, were not mentioned.&quot; They are seeking data from primary research and looking for brand name endorsement, which does not always happen on Wikipedia.
I appreciate the study and this like all other research contributes to driving improvement of Wikipedia.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 18:27, 6 March 2015 (UTC)
It is another poor piece of research which unfortunately shows that the researchers do not know how to operate a Wiki and that peer review is no guarantee of high quality:
#The primary issue with this paper is that there was no blinding and no comparator. What they did was take Wikipedia articles and ask medical students to rate how reliable they thought they were while applying some &quot;statistical veneer&quot; to the efforts in the hopes of getting it published / making it seem more true. eMedicine was deemed to be correct rather than considered as a comparator.
#Per &quot;no information available about these authors and their experience&quot; All they had to do was look at the talk page of these articles or the edit history and they would see mine and  name a lot which if they clicked on it would give our credentials
# Per &quot;deficiencies in the use of educationally useful image&quot; Yup please contribute some images under an open license. We are all volunteers and this is a work in progress.
# Per &quot;guidelines/position statements... were not mentioned&quot; Ah completely false. At least 6 of the articles extensively summarize guidelines and positions statements. Makes me doubt if they actually read the articles in question.

* What the authors of this study expected was a type of encyclopedia similar to Scholarpedia - Free, peer-reviewed, and authored by notable medical experts. If one were to compare Wikipedia's article on Cardiac arrhythmia and Scholarpedia's [http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Cardiac_arrhythmia corresponding article], one would find that:

1. Scholarpedia's (SP) lede section is more concise than that of Wikipedia (WP)
SP: &quot;Cardiac arrhythmia is the condition in which the heart's normal rhythm is disrupted&quot; (short and concise)
WP: &quot;Cardiac arrhythmia (also known as irregular heartbeat) is any of a group of conditions in which the electrical activity of the heart is irregular, faster, or slower than normal&quot; (Too long, didnt read)

2. SP's images are of much higher quality than WP's
SP: Most images are dynamic, containing animation and/or links to external 3D applet. All figures are appropriately linked to the main text 
WP: Two still images, not very useful and randomly placed in the article. None of the images are linked to the main text.

3. SP appears more reliable than WP
SP: The page is co-authored by 3 medical experts, with names and affiliations clearly displayed at the beginning. All subsequent edits are made by approved contributors and prominently displayed in the article.
WP: The sections on &quot;Diagnostic approach&quot; and &quot;Management&quot; are supproted by 0 refs. Article history shows a persistent and hidden pattern of edit-warring between established editors and anonymous IP addresses.
We could learn from our mistakes and improve the way we present our articles, or we could simply ignore the criticisms and dismiss them as inaccurate and/or methodologically flawed. Based on what I've experienced working on this project and judging from some of the comments above, I honestly don't think anything will change in the near future. -A1candidate  13:20, 7 March 2015 (UTC)

The Scholarpedia article is a fascinating contrast, and no doubt an excellent effort in terms of what it is trying to do, but it treats the subject as though it was astronomy (another of Scholarpedia's very few subject areas) and hardly has any information as to how the condition might be treated. You can complain about WP's &quot;sections on &quot;Diagnostic approach&quot; and &quot;Management&quot;&quot; but at least we actually try to cover these rather important topics [PS - slightly unfair; there is a little info on treatment in the last few sections].

Physicians know that recently vaccinated individuals can infect other individuals (both vaccinated and unvaccinated).

the media often will say one thing and then another, that is why any discussion is best based on something more substantial than the news--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 00:01, 16 March 2015 (UTC)

Are all the 23 references (below the article) not substantial?
‚ÄîWavelength (talk) 00:28, 16 March 2015 (UTC)

first of all, that is a press release from a fairly crackpot foundation Weston A. Price Foundation - not a news report from CNBC.  so, misrepresented.  It is not reliable for much of anything except what that foundation thinks.  secondly, the headline and section header is hilariously alarmist and gives succor to anti-vaccine nutjobs (nice job, spokeslady, saying the measles outbreak could have been started by a vaccinated kid.  sure ~maybe~ but if parents got their kids vaccinated, we wouldn't have outbreaks like we have had.  see herd effect.)   yes, per the many refs,  the medical community already knows that people who have been vaccinated with live vaccines can spread virus (that is why they are warned to be careful) and secondly, that vaccinized people can harbor virus. the key thing is that the vaccinated people (mostly, as nothing is perfect) don't get sick, and neither do other people who are vaccinated.  oh, and their point that healthy people fight off disease better - also not a big revelation. blech.

**Or maybe after a bat bite as it keeps you from dying a horrible death from rabies (I have had bats that have bitten people test positive). Or maybe during a hepatitis A outbreak. Or maybe if you work with people who have hepatitis B. Or to keep you from dying of tetanus.
**Agree they are slightly less needed now in the developed world because they have worked so incredibly well (smallpox was once the leading cause of death in the United States and a few shots often work for the rest of peoples lives like with polio).
**Now that we so rarely see people dying from vaccine preventable diseases in the developed world much of the population takes them and herd immunity for granted.

Bifid penis and diphallia
While creating a disambig page for double penis, I found that we currently have articles on both bifid penis and diphallia. Are these two names for the same condition, or two distinct conditions? If the former, they should be merged: if the latter, can someone please clarify the exact difference between the two conditions in both articles? Also, should the normal condition of bifid penis in some other species be split out from the article about the abnormal condition in humans, into its own article? -- The Anome (talk) 11:06, 19 March 2015 (UTC)
apparently diphallia is a much more complicated congenital disorder, which springs a number of co-existing problems in the individual in question ( renal, vertebral, hindgut, anorectal). While bifid is relegated to the area in question, and no further than that (congenitically speaking).... in regards to the last question its not clear, what the exact question is--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 11:43, 19 March 2015 (UTC)

&quot;Cause of death: Cardiac Arrest&quot;

I have noticed the cause of death in many articles about people is stated to be cardiac arrest; often featured prominently in the article's infobox. However, cardiac arrest is the mechanism of death and not its cause. Should this technical point be corrected, or should we just let sleeping dogs lie and leave the colloquialisms in place? And if we wish to correct this, then how? Some problems I see are 1) discrepancies between what coroners from different nations are allowed to use to describe &quot;cause of death&quot;, for instance some countries allow &quot;old age&quot; whereas others do not, 2) the unreliability of news sources to correctly use terms like &quot;mechanism&quot; vs. &quot;manner&quot; vs. &quot;cause&quot; of death, and 3) the lack of access to official coroner reports to find the actual cause of death to replace the current info in articles. Thoughts? TypingAway (talk) 05:22, 19 March 2015 (UTC)
the #1 and #3 points you raise are difficult to get around due to, as you say &quot;nation&quot; in question (which also involves the corresponding coroners office).In regards to the media, this wikiproject uses review article, so I would think they are a non-factor--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 10:29, 19 March 2015 (UTC)
We typically do rely on the media for the cause of somebody's death -- medical review articles are rarely available.  Anyway, I don't think we have any realistic choice here, in cases where no autopsy was performed.  I would definitely be opposed to changing &quot;cause of death&quot; to &quot;mechanism of death&quot; in those infoboxes, if anybody has any such idea. Looie496 (talk) 15:15, 19 March 2015 (UTC)
question #2 (from the poster) reads mechanism vs manner vs cause correct usage, when a primary or secondary source is made available we in fact do use journals (or WHO, CDC) as has been the case with the ebola outbreak in west Africa and evacuated cases[http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1501355?query=infectious-disease]. Now then, that in fact &quot;cardiac arrest&quot; as a cause of death may take longer (or in some cases maybe never) as opposed to a virus, bacteria, head injury, is a different story, we are suppose to follow --Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 15:41, 19 March 2015 (UTC)

Interesting anecdote

Hi all. Just passing on a thing. We just had our very first request through the CRUK information nurse helpline to edit a Wikipedia page. It was from a survivor of a very rare leukaemia, who felt that the current page on the topic was unnecessarily negative and 'filled him with doom and gloom' (he's survived for 14 years - somewhat of an outlier given the overall statistics for the disease in general!). He didn't feel he was qualified to edit the page himself, hence the request to us. If anyone felt like having a look at the page with this in mind, that would be great - I'm not aware of any current refs that would substantially change its content but perhaps the tone could be a little less brutal in places to bear the newly-diagnosed in mind.

Sigh. Yes. But these people are students who don't seem to have gotten much direction before starting their project, doing no harm beyond writing an article that's not that great, but above average by the standards of medical articles written by students. They should get their own accounts, read , write their articles in a sandbox, get linked up with the education program, etc. etc. Engagement with the educational angle would be much more effective than a block and an impersonal lecture about an unintuitive rule.

A good read indeed.  I hope someone in the lay media picks this up and rewrites it from the paradigm of patients, as a message to parents who refuse to vaccinate their children -- that their decision has effects far beyond their own families, and its consequences are more complicated than simply leaving their children unprotected from preventable diseases.  Not that it would have any measurable effect on a group whose beliefs are immune to facts; but possibly worth the effort.  I might do it myself. DoctorJoeE /talk to me! 16:02, 27 March 2015 (UTC)

Vaginal tightening and Vaginal laxity articles

The Vaginal tightening article is extremely poor. And, today, , who is clearly not a new Wikipedia editor, created the Vaginal laxity article and made a bunch of vagina-related redirects. The Vaginal laxity article does not use the ideal medical sources named at . I ask: What should be done with these two articles? We don't need both, and we have the Pelvic floor, Female genital prolapse and Vaginal weightlifting articles. Note that, looking at its sources, I also have concerns about the Vaginal weightlifting article; I addressed that article at this WikiProject last year (see ), but got no replies. 

I will alert  to this discussion to keep the discussion centralized (). Flyer22 (talk) 23:15, 25 March 2015 (UTC)
keep the former, nominate the latter for deletion, (on the first article im certain with help it can go from &quot;poor&quot; to good)...IMO--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 23:27, 25 March 2015 (UTC)
There's also significant overlap between the vaginal laxity article and vaginal tightening article; a partial or complete merge might be in order. A lot of physicians don't ask their patients about vaginal laxity not only because of time constraints, but also because they haven't known of good treatment options; that goes to show how much connection there is between the two topics of problem and cure. By the way, vaginal laxity is not only a medical topic but also one that has attracted the attention of feminists and other social and cultural commentators. AbuseResearcher (talk) 01:16, 26 March 2015 (UTC)

I don't see how your Vaginal laxity article is needed. As mentioned above, it uses poor sources for medical information, and is covered in one or more of the aforementioned articles with different names. It can be expanded on in the Vaginal tightening article if that article is kept. Right now, the Vaginal tightening article reads like a personal website. I'm not a fan of unnecessary . I will almost always choose consolidation  unless a  article is truly needed. Flyer22 (talk) 03:16, 26 March 2015 (UTC)
What is your specific proposal? Basically &quot;address these concerns in a reasonable timeframe or it'll be converted into a redirect and/or nominated for deletion&quot;? I would consider the overlap between the vaginal laxity and vaginal tightening article to look something like , while the relationship between an article A and B, in which B is a fork of A, would look more like [http://staff.www.ltu.se/~larserik/applmath/chap10en/venn2.gif this]. AbuseResearcher (talk) 03:29, 26 March 2015 (UTC)
I am 100% in favour of merge. I do not believe there can possibly be enough reliable material on either of these two subjects to justify independent articles. It is better if such content can be kept in a central place so interested readers don't have 5+ articles they have to pass by to engage with a topic. That is my 2c. --Tom (LT) (talk) 07:20, 26 March 2015 (UTC)

Encyclopedic parts of the Vaginal tightening article could be merged into the Kegel exercise article once the vaginal tightening content is appropriately sourced. Parts of the Vaginal laxity article would also fit there; other parts of it would fit better in the Pelvic floor and/or Female genital prolapse articles. Flyer22 (talk) 07:39, 26 March 2015 (UTC)

We also have the Human vaginal size article, but, at  in 2013, I suggested that the article be merged with the Vagina article. Given the support for the merge at that talk page, I would have merged the content by now if it weren't for the poor sources used at the Human vaginal size article.

Hi WikiMed,

Just announcing a new course working on medical topics: . It's an intro class. A small intro class, but as we know from past experiences, introductory psych classes can prove challenging.

de-archiving thread on financial impact of endocrine disruptors

;MEDRS- Splashy press around splashy PRIMARY sources on costs of endocrine disruptors.

This content was introduced today to the Endocrine disruptor article:
A study published in 2015 estimates the health costs of EDC in the European Union to be approximately ‚Ç¨157 billion per year.


I [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Endocrine_disruptor&amp;diff=651178036&amp;oldid=651172099 removed this] with edit note: &quot;this is essentially a press release on publication of a WP:PRIMARY source. fails MEDRS&quot;, and Gandydancer  [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Endocrine_disruptor&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=651178036 restored it] with edit note, &quot;This source seems OK to me&quot;.  I have not re-reverted. 

Issues:
* First the source is in German.
* second, it is an announcement in the EU parliament by a member of the Green party there.  This is just political posturing, noting that a scientific paper has been published that is good for that politician's POV.    With the German and the political nature of this, it is a bad source. 
* third there has been a shitload of popular media reports on these studies in English. like [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2015/03/150305-chemicals-endocrine-disruptors-diabetes-toxic-environment-ngfood/ this], so if we were going to generate content from this, there are far better sources. 
* if you do some work, you will see that there are 4  sources that were published at the same time by the same group, with one summarizing the other three:
** (summary) Trasande L et al. Estimating Burden and Disease Costs of Exposure to Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals in the European Union. J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2015 Mar 5:jc20144324. [Epub ahead of print] 
** Legler J et al. Obesity, Diabetes, and Associated Costs of Exposure to Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals in the European Union. J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2015 Mar 5:jc20144326.  [Epub ahead of print]  
** Hauser R, et al.  Male Reproductive Disorders, Diseases, and Costs of Exposure to Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals in the European Union. J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2015 Mar 5:jc20144324. [Epub ahead of print] 
**Bellanger M et al.  Neurobehavioral Deficits, Diseases and Associated Costs of Exposure to Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals in the European Union. J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2015 Mar 5:jc20144323. [Epub ahead of print]  
* These 4 papers are  sources, and per other science-based content in WP, we wait to see how these papers are treated by  sources.  We don't do science by press release in WP.  We don't do it when Big Pharma hypes clinical trial results published in a primary source, and we don't it here either. 

In my view this content is health related, since the authors had to make judgements about what diseases/conditions ED chemicals cause, and then just did the math from there.  
* The questions
** does MEDRS apply here?
** What if anything should we say now, before secondary sources come out?

the article , of course, indicates it is within the scope of this wikiproject, therefore subject to all you have enumerated above (you have acted with logic and objectivity), having said that one should always try to find a &quot;common ground&quot; as I am certain can be done here, while satisfying all guidelines--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 13:09, 13 March 2015 (UTC)
oz, while all content should be sourced to 2ndary sources per , , and RS, only some content in health-related articles is specfically subject to MEDRS's call for secondary sources.  Content about the cost of a drug, for example, doesn't need reviews or statements by major bodies under MEDRS (it should anyway per OR/VERIFY/RS, but not per MEDRS per se).   The reason I think this content is subject to MEDRS's secondary sources guidance, is that the authors had to make judgements about what diseases/conditions are caused by EDs in order to calculate costs -  to me that is very much about health and is highly controversial. Jytdog (talk) 13:15, 13 March 2015 (UTC)
I agree with your judgement--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 13:20, 13 March 2015 (UTC)
Agree MEDRS applies, and even if there wasn't a biomedical aspect here, I'd want to see better sourcing ... Alexbrn talk||COI 13:13, 13 March 2015 (UTC)

The source is ok. ‚Ç¨157 billion is an economic cost. I don't think you can invoke MEDRS for removing a monetary figure in dollars (or euros). -A1candidate  15:36, 13 March 2015 (UTC)
you ignored what i wrote above.  the estimate is based on making a determine of what conditions/decisions are allegedly caused by alleged ED compounds (2 health claims about health).  Once a decisions are made about those, it is just math.  The papers discuss both alleging steps and make decisions about them. This is completely unlike doing something like reporting sales of an actual drug, or determining the cost to treat someone who has, say, Alzheimers. There are two controversial and very biomedical steps before that, which are the heart of these papers. Jytdog (talk) 16:16, 13 March 2015 (UTC)
(ec) The monetary figure doesn't exist in isolation, though.  It represents the authors' projections of the increased incidence of certain medical conditions as the result of exposure to EDCs, multiplied by the economic cost associated with those conditions.  I agree that the average or expected economic cost associated with a particular medical condition is plausibly not a medical claim and not subject to the strict requirements of MEDRS (though it's a slippery-enough quantity to define and estimate and interpret that very robust sourcing standards should still apply).
But‚Äîforecasting a specific change in incidence of a range of medical conditions as a consequence of environmental exposures to certain chemical compounds?  That's getting into medical-claim territory and within the scope of MEDRS.  And since the dollar- (or euro-)cost estimate is clearly derived from and dependent on that medical assertion, we can't pretend that it's purely an economic statement not subject to MEDRS.  I am strongly inclined to agree with Jytdog's interpretation. TenOfAllTrades(talk) 16:33, 13 March 2015 (UTC)
Per , the danger posed by EDCs is a scientific fact. EDC advocates will no doubt disagree, but Wikipedia is not the place for this. -A1candidate  16:39, 13 March 2015 (UTC)
over stating what the source says and how it applies to this situation, per usual. Jytdog (talk) 16:45, 13 March 2015 (UTC)
While PubMed has not as yet classified  as a review, it would effectively appear to be a review:
 
In other words, an expert panel reviewed the available reviews and used a weight-of-evidence approach to assign a probability of causation. So why isn't this considered a secondary source? Boghog (talk) 16:50, 13 March 2015 (UTC)

Just to clarify, it would appear that the underlying medical claims (EDCs cause illnesses) in this source are tertiary (review of reviews, MEDRS compliant) while the economic claims (these illnesses cost ... ) are primary (outside the scope of MEDRS). Boghog (talk) 18:30, 13 March 2015 (UTC)
+1. That's not just some study by some random people (‚Äúthe Steering Committee convened expert panels for each of the domains composed of four to eight scientific expert‚Äù). MEDRS does not apply here. However, I would not oppose removing the first reference and to rephrase the text. For instance, the whole range of the Monte Carlo analysis (‚Ç¨3.3‚Äì244 billion annually) may be given. --Leyo 20:31, 13 March 2015 (UTC)
Economics is not a medical claim and therefore does not need a medical source. Cost effectiveness is a different matter as it is a medical claim. Doc James (talk ¬∑  ¬∑ ) 23:46, 13 March 2015 (UTC)

*NOTE - dearchived this, as this arose in a discussion about content at the Endocrine disruptor article, and  rightfully asked for action.  I should have been following this more closely, and apologize for not doing so.   I do not see a clear consensus above.  Can we get more voices, please?  I realize that this is a complex issue, but the topline impact statement is very strong (that is a lot of money!) and I want to be sure we are comfortable with the sourcing and content.  Thanks. Jytdog (talk) 19:58, 30 March 2015 (UTC)

 I know you asked for more voices, but I think the issue is not at all complex and consensus above (which Leyo supported) is very clear.  The underlying medical claims in this source are secondary/tertiary.  The economic claims are primary and outside of the scope of MEDRS.  Agreed? Boghog (talk) 20:11, 30 March 2015 (UTC)

Thanks for taking the time Boghog!  So I thought your analysis of the Trasande source was interesting.  Doc James seems to support that, as does Leyo.  Ozz and TenofAllTrades agreed with me, I believe.  So consensus is not clear to me. 

The MEDRS issue where I am struggling here, is with the toxicology part of this, which in my view is very much a MEDRS thing.  And in my view, the conclusions they are coming to about prevalence of diseases/conditions attributable to EDs is very much primary.  It is indeed number crunching to go from those prevalences, to the economic costs. 

Here is the event that suite of papers arose from (from Transande)
&quot;During a 2-day workshop in April 2014, five expert panels identified conditions where the evidence is strongest for causation and developed ranges for fractions of disease burden that can be attributed to EDCs. Although accompanying manuscripts describe in greater detail the bases for their estimates of disease attribution and probability of causation, we present here an overview of the methods they applied as well as approaches applied to estimate disease burden and costs attributable to EDCs in the EU based upon those data inputs.&quot;

You see what I mean?  They are dealing with probabilities, and these groups developed ranges for disease burden.  This source is indeed  for that research, which never existed.  This is not just reviewing the literature or even doing meta-analysis.  It is drawing new conclusions about ED influence on prevelance of diseases and conditions. The ED hypothesis in general remains controversial, especially in its application to human toxicology. Here is some more, describing where they went: 

Expert panels achieved consensus for probable (20%) EDC causation for IQ loss and associated intellectual disability, autism,  attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, childhood obesity, adult obesity, adult diabetes, cryptorchidism, male infertility, and mortality associated with reduced T. Accounting for probability of causation and using the midpoint of each range for probability of causation, Monte Carlo simulations produced a median cost of ‚Ç¨157 billion (1.23% of EU gross domestic product) annually across 1000 simulations.  Notably, using the lowest end of the probability range for each relationship in the Monte Carlo simulations produced a median range of ‚Ç¨119 billion that differed modestly from base case probability inputs.

So do folks see what I am struggling with here? I am interested to hear. Maybe i am out to lunch. Thanks. Jytdog (talk) 20:44, 30 March 2015 (UTC)

Content about the cost of a drug, for example, doesn't need reviews or statements by major bodies under MEDRS (it should anyway per OR/VERIFY/RS, but not per MEDRS per se). The reason I think this content is subject to MEDRS's secondary sources guidance, is that the authors had to make judgements about what diseases/conditions are caused by EDs in order to calculate costs - to me that is very much about health and is highly controversial. Jytdog (talk) 13:15, 13 March 2015 (UTC) ...but I still believe your judgement is correct, you rightfully say you feel in this matter the authors made judgements and that is why you are looking for clarity, your right...I agree with you (again)...and I think others should give opinions as well--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 21:05, 30 March 2015 (UTC)
It's all about phrasing the right way, i.e. not as a fact but as a study outcome/estimate. Then, I don't see a problem. The range of the Monte Carlo analysis (‚Ç¨3.3‚Äì244 billion annually) is quite large, i.e. it is very likely that the true (but unknown) value is within this range. --Leyo 08:58, 31 March 2015 (UTC)
Thanks for talking Leyo.  My issue here is that the underlying estimate of prevalence due to EDs (uopn which the monte carlo simulations depend) is  research published here as a PRIMARY source, and we have no idea if other experts in the field find that estimate reasonable, or wacky.  We have no idea.  This is why we steer clear of PRIMARY sources in project medicine.... does that make sense? Jytdog (talk) 11:41, 31 March 2015 (UTC)
The statement discussed here is not purely medical but also/rather economical. --Leyo 11:54, 31 March 2015 (UTC)
I totally hear you on that. i do!  what i am trying to say is that the economics are based on a medical/health judgement.  that had to happen before the economics could be estimated.  do you hear me on that? thanks. Jytdog (talk) 12:12, 31 March 2015 (UTC)

I agree with JytDog ....There is a catalogue of criteria for endocrine disruptors (EDC) within the European Union yet. On Monday, health Commissioner Vytenis Andriukaitis had to justify this delay before the European Parliament.
The Commission would have to suggest already on 13 December 2013 the catalogue of criteria for the hormonally active chemicals. So far it works but on the impact assessment of EDC. Deputies criticise the postponement and emphasize the health and economic need for fast regulation.
Andriukaitis emphasized the importance of assessment at the plenary session, to take into account all scientific information. The first phase of the research was completed, a consultation is finished. In the next step, an informational site published and initiated a second round of research.
A new study by international researchers has once again put the health costs of EDC: close 157 billion euros per year. 155.8 billion more than a study of Scandinavian EU Member States commissioned end of 2014 revealed (EU news by the 25.11.2014) are. Investigated injuries were such restrictions of IQ and mental retardation with prenatal exposure to specific neurotoxic. These cause the highest costs.
Meanwhile, Sweden has launched an initiative to accuse the European Commission before the European Court of Justice because it is not complied with their legal obligations to the regulation of EDC. The Council has joined in the initiative last month (EU-news from the 27.02.2015[http://www.microsofttranslator.com/BV.aspx?ref=IE8Activity&amp;a=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eu-koordination.de%2Fumweltnews%2Fnews%2Fchemie%2F3071-edc-eu-kommissar-verteidigt-folgenabschaetzung]...is no good and therefore we need to work towards a MEDRS source per the reasons outlined above.--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 12:44, 31 March 2015 (UTC)

So to be sure I understand correctly, the group  that did the study used their own decisions regarding what information they found to be acceptable to base their figures on rather than the Wikipedia quidelines on what's acceptable, so we now refuse to mention their study in Wikipedia because it does not meet our guidelines on sourcing?  Gandydancer (talk) 17:31, 31 March 2015 (UTC)
No, that is not is being said here. Jytdog (talk) 17:45, 31 March 2015 (UTC)

I saw a long thread and had a few minutes to kill, so I decided to read this. What Boghog said. I don't get the issue here. I think trying to shove this analysis into the somewhat wikipedia-idiosyncratic &quot;source hierarchy&quot; is a distraction and the best way to handle it in the article is to simply describe it as the result of one study, with a brief summary of their methods as appropriate for the desired level of detail. Opabinia regalis (talk) 19:32, 31 March 2015 (UTC)
the problem is that, the authors had to make judgements about what diseases/conditions are caused by EDs  and therefore, what do we cite as a reliable source?--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 19:40, 31 March 2015 (UTC)
You .
If there are no competing/confirming/disagreeing studies, I'd give it a single, brief mention with &quot;One study said&quot; language, under
Society and culture
(not in the lead).  I would use the range (‚Ç¨3.3‚Äì244 billion per year) rather than the median, and I'd explain to non-economists what the main costs are (e.g., probably lost productivity and years of healthy life lost rather than direct medical expenses).  WhatamIdoing (talk) 22:35, 31 March 2015 (UTC)
Whatamidoing the cite is this [http://www.microsofttranslator.com/BV.aspx?ref=IE8Activity&amp;a=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eu-koordination.de%2Fumweltnews%2Fnews%2Fchemie%2F3071-edc-eu-kommissar-verteidigt-folgenabschaetzung] , now the point is Jytdog says it needs a secondary source due to the judgements the authors have made in regards to the economic costs, and I agree (BTW its all above explained more than once)--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 22:49, 31 March 2015 (UTC)
I agree with Opabinia regalis and WhatamIdoing. Ozzie10aaaa, I don't think that we need to cite this website, but rather . --Leyo 23:31, 31 March 2015 (UTC) BTW: See also .
Me too. There was also a [http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/06/health-costs-hormone-disrupting-chemicals-150bn-a-year-europe-says-study Guardian article on March 6th]. The largest element of the estimated costs is the economic cost of people less intelligent because they were exposed as children (!), so this is indeed the end result of a long string of assumptions. &quot;‚ÄúThe shocking thing is that the major component of that cost is related to the loss of brain function in the next generation,‚Äù one of the report‚Äôs authors, Professor Philippe Grandjean of Harvard University, told the Guardian.&quot; Johnbod (talk) 02:17, 1 April 2015 (UTC)   
  how lovely to see you here. If you haven't, (you too WAID), I would urge you [http://press.endocrine.org/doi/pdf/10.1210/jc.2014-4324 to read the Trasande] paper - the layers of assumptions here are something.  And they say: &quot;The approach we have taken will potentially transform decision-making in environmental health by providing a new model for evaluating environmental health risks and permitting a complete assessment of the potential costs of failing to prevent chronic disease through the use of safer alternatives to EDCs.&quot; (emphasis added)  (p8, near top of right column). This is not your run of the mill paper.  Jytdog (talk) 23:39, 31 March 2015 (UTC)
I understand that.  However, economic effects for commercial products are important and encyclopedic.  Iff this source is the only information that we have about an important aspect of the subject, then we should include it.  The summary should be brief, use  attribution to identify it as coming from a single publication, be suitably hedged, and not be trumpted in the lead, but it shouldn't be omitted entirely.  That is, we should follow what MEDRS says:  &quot;If the conclusions of the research are worth mentioning (for instance, publication of a large, randomized clinical trial with surprising results), they should be described as being from a single study&quot; and replaced when something better comes along. 
I'm open to several approaches to &quot;suitably hedging&quot;.  For example, if you worry about including a number that won't mean anything to most people, then it might make more sense to say that this one paper estimated that the cost of EDC exposure might be approximately double the costs associated with lead and mercury exposure. 
I'm also open to someone finding a better source, or even a second similar source, so that we can compare and contrast the conclusions.  The only option that doesn't work for me is &quot;completely omit economic information because we're questioning the methods used in a peer-reviewed paper&quot;.  Doing a detailed peer-review of the source isn't our job.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 04:01, 1 April 2015 (UTC)

Yes, I read (skimmed) the paper. I think it is a lot of sensationalistic publicity-bait BS an interesting and unconventional approach to a challenging problem. But I agree with WhatamIdoing. Just briefly summarize the results with appropriate hedges to emphasize it's just one study. If there's a source out there constructively criticizing the methods, nothing wrong with including that too. Opabinia regalis (talk) 05:04, 1 April 2015 (UTC)

*Thanks everybody who commented here.  i appreciate the time and attention, and am hearing you.  i'd be open to something along the lines of what WAID and Opabina suggest, perhaps contextualized by [http://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-series-of-studies-reporting-estimated-cost-to-the-eu-of-endocrine-disrupting-chemicals-edcs/ this].   are you OK with that?  If so, I will not oppose. Jytdog (talk) 12:06, 1 April 2015 (UTC)
*:I agree on mentioning other opinions such as Richard Sharpe's together with the study results. In this context, please note that Richard Sharpe is involved in the  as a signee of Dietrich et al. --Leyo 12:39, 1 April 2015 (UTC)
interesting... so not the most disinterested &quot;expert&quot;, hm?  in any case, i'll look to you to add it back. thanks for being patient and working through this with me. Jytdog (talk) 12:51, 1 April 2015 (UTC)
I am not sure if I understand your last but one sentence correctly. Will you draft the text? --Leyo 19:02, 1 April 2015 (UTC)
i was asking you if you want to add it back; it appears you would like me to!  will do that this evening.  either way, we'll work it over til we (and everybody else) is satisfied enough. thanks again. Jytdog (talk) 19:11, 1 April 2015 (UTC)
Okay, guys, I'm invoking .  There's the wrong answer:  Endocrine disruptor#Economic effects.  Go fix it.  I need to go read up on the bug that kept my doi from turning into a magic citation via .  I thought the patch was supposed to arrive here three hours ago.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 21:56, 1 April 2015 (UTC)</segment>
