Hi, everyone!

I have recently created the page [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma_phenotyping_and_endotyping Asthma phenotyping and endotyping] which lists the now-recognised phenotypes and endotypes of asthma. Creating redirects could be helpful, as I don't think many of them deserve their own page at this time. 

However, many redirects to these types already exist, and simply redirect to the Asthma page whole, e.g. Eosinophilic asthma, or only link to the Asthma#Classification page, which doesn't feature them as a classification, e.g. Atopic asthma.

Do you think something could/should be done about it?

Thanks for your time! AufbauPrinciple (talk) 10:08, 25 December 2023 (UTC)

Hyperproteinemia categorization 

I was expanding Hyperproteinemia (high blood protein levels) and I'm having a hard time figuring out which category it should be listed under.

It's currently listed under the catagoried  and . However the ICD lists Hyperproteinemia as a  metabolic disorder.[https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en#/http://id.who.int/icd/entity/393047701/mms/other]. Hypoproteinemia (low blood protein levels) is categorized under .

If anyone could advise me on how to categorize this article that would be very helpful. CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 01:04, 28 December 2023 (UTC)
 seems best. It is a general term for abnormally high protein levels in the blood, not a &quot;blood disorder&quot; in the sense of leukemia, sickle cell anemia etc. Spicy (talk) 01:30, 28 December 2023 (UTC)

Black box warnings 2nd project

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine/Archive_168#Black_box_warnings_project Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Medicine#Black box warnings project] is largely done.

As a further goal, I think we should include the text of black box warnings in the drug articles.  
I propose that a section of each article use a template to pull the text of the warning from wikidata, and that a bot put that section in all of the articles on drugs with boxed warnings. 
Does that sound like a good idea?  a good plan for how to do it?  Other ideas?  Formatting ideas?. 

(Perhaps a bot isn't needed?  If I add a reference here , something automatically causes the reference section to appear below, even w/o  in a References section.  What?  Useful?  I doubt it,  but maybe.  Would be cool.)

(The warning text in Wikidata comes from the FDALabel database.)

A week ago, [https://www.wikidata.org/w/index.php?title=Wikidata_talk:Mismatch_Finder/Collaboration/Purdue_Summer_of_Data_2024&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=2021715311&amp;diffmode=source here], I proposed/made a request for help with part of this.   I wrote in part,  ... No response. 

I was disturbed to find that most drugs with FDA-mandated black box warnings had articles that were missing any mention of the boxes or the risks. It is disturbing to me that many pages mentioned minor side effects but left this critical info out.  Part 1 changed this, but there's more to do - adding the text of the warnings.  

-- RudolfoMD (talk) 02:20, 11 December 2023 (UTC)

First, I think putting black box information on every drug that has one is important and useful. I'm not sure if there are equivalents of black-box warnings for other regulatory agencies (i.e., other than the US FDA), but if so, I think that should be put on the radar to be addressed once a satisfactory implementation has been found for the FDA-specific black box warnings.
I do not know much of anything about wikidata, but if there is any way to import that csv from the FDA website into wikidata such that it can be easily referenced, that seems ideal. My complaint before was that the infobox shows that a black box warning exists but there was no readily-available way for the reader to click through to read the text of the warning. There was previous discussion about the fact that medline does have the body of the warnings, and is perhaps easier to link to than the FDA's own data; the point was made that the FDA issues the warnings and so it should be the primary source used for this information. Is there perhaps a way to combine these: have the FDA link in the , and perhaps also somehow link to the medline entry in the UI in the infobox? This way we link to the primary-source/issuer of the warning, but also provide the utility to the reader of being able to click through and read the warning text easily. Kimen8 (talk) 14:10, 11 December 2023 (UTC)
 in a References section.  What?  Useful?  I doubt it,  but maybe.  Would be cool.) Whilst  is invoked even without the template, a bot can check and add the section – though I like to think an article on a drug with a regulatory warning would have references, and therefore already have a reference section. I don't know if the citation style is something a bot is capable of checking. Mentioning as citations  be consistent within a page (but isn't always), but might vary across a project's articles. 
(Have added  below to keep the fake citation within the frame of reference)
Little pob (talk) 15:22, 11 December 2023 (UTC)
Perhaps you missed/misunderstood my proposal, Little pob?  I'm wanting all of the articles on drugs with boxed warnings have a section something like: 

Important Warnings

There's a black box warning about this drug, which reads  Xoid will kill any patient with foo, and any patient taking Xoid with bar. 
Will a bot be needed to add these -- that is one of my questions - I guess so but perhaps not. RudolfoMD (talk) 03:31, 14 December 2023 (UTC)
I think it will be complicated.  For example:  Clonidine has a black box warning, but only for four injectable formulations, not for the more common tablets, and not even for all injectable formulations.  There are four with black box warnings, but they don't give the same black-box warnings.  One of them (XGen's) has a warning that &quot;The 500 mcg/mL strength product should be diluted prior to use in an appropriate solution.&quot;  Maybe the others don't have a 500 mcg/mL product?  Both XGen's and PharmaForce's have a warning against using it for childbirth or surgery, but Hikma's injectable formulation doesn't, for no reason that I can discern. 
In principle, I am in favor of including this information, but in practice, I'm not sure that it's feasible. WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:42, 11 December 2023 (UTC)
If it's correct, that is annoying - does complicate this.  Though I'm guessing and hoping it's rare.
I'd say  Clonidine  should say something like: 
There's a black box warning about injectable formulations of this drug, which reads  on the XGen label.  In terms of an algorithm:  Including the longest warning is most likely to include all the most important warnings. 
Are we sure about this, or are we assuming MedLine is correct?  Did you find all the Clonidine labels on fda.gov? RudolfoMD (talk) 03:41, 14 December 2023 (UTC)
https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/ has copies of the Medication package insert submitted to the FDA for all regulated drugs (human and veterinary; does not include unregulated substances, such as herbal supplements).  They have [https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/search.cfm?labeltype=all&amp;query=clonidine&amp;pagesize=200&amp;page=1 175 entries for clonidine].  Seven of the 175 are injectable.  These:  [https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=6e562c90-2e37-47ac-9c3f-12460f96dc33][https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=f01f281d-c7e5-4258-ab14-3685f1ff296f][https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=ada02f1f-ae78-4435-879e-492ae862d504][https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=8c126bb8-732a-4949-8754-2f50b5543638] have one or two boxed warnings (if two, they may be displayed in the same or separate boxes).  These do not:  [https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=d2b11e61-b2ef-4d20-8973-a4afc6b951ae][https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=2a5b46ec-4c16-48a5-9e58-8d28a3f21274][https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=7daa1996-ea9f-2576-e053-2991aa0a6be5], although the first in this box-less batch seems to have an incomplete or incorrectly entered label in the database, and the last two seem to have the same warning about surgical procedures as appears in the boxed warnings.  The main difference is that the words aren't displayed in boxes. WhatamIdoing (talk) 04:31, 14 December 2023 (UTC)
So does including the longest warning make sense; is anyone volunteering to manually review the warnings so we can see and handle complications like the one with Clonidine as we prepare to display them in wikipedia? RudolfoMD (talk) 05:09, 14 December 2023 (UTC)
Passing by comment: can we add a picture to the Boxed warning? I've never heard of this before (I lived in the States for a decade but was never in need of any serious medication...). Skimming that article makes me wonder what that warning actually looks like? Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here 03:17, 12 December 2023 (UTC)
Passing comment 2: see . We probably need a new article on this concept outside United States, under a more clear name like warnings in drug labels and package or safety information on drug labels (to use some phrasing from cited sources). The current article is appallingly US-centric, and the name is unclear to anyone who is not American. Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here 03:25, 12 December 2023 (UTC)
All countries have warnings.  Only the US seems to have this &quot;extra important warning&quot; thing.  The article should be US-centric – as US-centric as the Food and Drug Administration article. WhatamIdoing (talk) 20:21, 12 December 2023 (UTC)

Aortocaval compression syndrome Vs. Supine hypotensive syndrome

I was wondering if anyone could help clear up some confusion regarding Aortocaval compression syndrome and Supine hypotensive syndrome. 

The wiki article states that &quot;Aortocaval compression is thought to be the cause of supine hypotensive syndrome&quot;. Supine hypotensive syndrome also redirects to Aortocaval compression syndrome. However a lot of sources seem to classify them as the same disorder.[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430759/][https://journals.lww.com/anesthesia-analgesia/fulltext/2017/12000/aortocaval_compression_syndrome__time_to_revisit.27.aspx][https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/analgesia-anaesthesia-and-pregnancy/aortocaval-compression/E524C087792483BCD3684885E2771E04]

I'm wondering if Aortocaval compression syndrome and Supine hypotensive syndrome should be regarded as separate entities or referred to as synonyms. CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 03:08, 29 December 2023 (UTC)

I think it's safe to say the terms are interchangeable since even the StatPearls article intended to educate healthcare providers explicitly states that. 🙂 AufbauPrinciple (talk) 07:34, 29 December 2023 (UTC)
Thank you, I was leaning towards that but wanted to double check before writing the article! CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 20:20, 29 December 2023 (UTC)

Arteriosclerotic heart disease Vs. Atherosclerosis

Can anyone find a difference between Arteriosclerotic heart disease and Atherosclerosis? They seem to be referring to the same disorder but I'm not sure. CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 22:00, 29 December 2023 (UTC)

It's extremely difficult to find sources in this. It seems that the term arteriosclerotic heart disease has all but gone extinct. 🤔
It seems that arteriosclerotic heart disease (ASHD) is the arteriosclerosis of the coronary arteries. Arteriosclerosis is the hardening of arteries such as can be caused by atherosclerosis; plaque buildup. It seems that ASHD is a synonym for coronary heart disease.

https://www.jstor.org/stable/3469073 AufbauPrinciple (talk) 11:41, 30 December 2023 (UTC)
Thank you so much. Do you think it's appropriate to redirect it to coronary heart disease? CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 16:01, 30 December 2023 (UTC)
I think that redirecting ASHD to coronary heart disease would be entirely appropriate. 🙂 AufbauPrinciple (talk) 17:53, 30 December 2023 (UTC)

Disseminated disease Vs. Disseminated infection.

I was wondering if anyone could help me understand the concept of Disseminated disease. I can't find any resources that refer to it outside of the context of infections. I understand the basis of it however since articles only define Disseminated infections I'm having a hard time figuring out how to properly site a definition.

Another thing I noticed was that there is lots of usage of the term Disseminated infection but very little usage of the term Disseminated disease. When the term Disseminated disease is used it seems to be used as a synonym not a separate entity. Would a name change and rewrite of the article to focus on Disseminated infections be appropriate here?

Any advice or guidance is appreciated! CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 03:24, 3 January 2024 (UTC)

UPDATE: I improved the article a bit but decided to leave it as is because I feel this topic is too far out of my understanding to properly write the article. Thank you to anyone who helped! If anyone is interested in expanding the article the two references I used are very extensive. CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 00:41, 4 January 2024 (UTC)

Obviously anecdotal, and there's added potential for a geographic bias, but I (a UK based coder) have seen it infrequently used within the clinical record to refer to mets (usually extensive). Little pob (talk) 13:19, 3 January 2024 (UTC)
Just to note: there's a possibility it may have actually been &quot;disseminated [organ/system] cancer&quot; that I'm remembering, rather than &quot;disseminated disease&quot;... Little pob (talk) 13:29, 3 January 2024 (UTC)
I've found a couple articles in reference to cancer but typically under the name &quot;Disseminated Cancer&quot;. I'm not sure wether to include this as it seems to be an overlap with &quot;metastatic cancer&quot;. CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 18:41, 3 January 2024 (UTC)
I think that the equivalent in non-infectious diseases is usually called Systemic disease.  I looked at dozens of the books using this term, and nearly all of them were about infectious disease, especially HSV in newborns and MAC/MAI in people with HIV/AIDS.  
That said, I did find a book on lymphoma that mentioned minimal disseminated disease (perhaps the pre-treatment equivalent of minimal residual disease?)[https://www.google.com/books/edition/Non_Hodgkin_s_Lymphoma_in_Childhood_and/nJiRDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=%22disseminated+disease+(MDD)+at+diagnosis+or+minimal+residual+disease%22%22&amp;pg=PA114&amp;printsec=frontcover] and a couple of others that mentioned it in the context of oncology, usually for hematological malignancies,[https://www.google.com/books/edition/Microspheres_and_Regional_Cancer_Therapy/KJEBEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=%22disseminated+disease%22&amp;printsec=frontcover][https://www.google.com/books/edition/SPEC_Lanzkowsky_s_Manual_of_Pediatric_He/6nxREAAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=%22disseminated+disease%22&amp;pg=PA370&amp;printsec=frontcover], but not always.[https://www.google.com/books/edition/Brain_Tumors_in_Children/PuJwDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=%22disseminated+disease%22&amp;pg=PA321&amp;printsec=frontcover]

No. And &quot;one can view metastatic cancer as a disseminated infection&quot; is wrong or at least unencylopedic.  Cancer isn't an infection. RudolfoMD (talk) 21:20, 3 January 2024 (UTC)

I have definitely come across the term in reference to malignancies in clinical settings, and a quick Internet search seems to bear this use out. TompaDompa (talk) 18:28, 3 January 2024 (UTC)
Do you mind expanded on this? I did come across quite a few case reports of Disseminated infection in the context of malignancies due to the weakened immune system. I also found some usage of the term in the context of cancer cells spreading.[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33626407/][https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6008966/] CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 18:37, 3 January 2024 (UTC)
Sure. I'm talking about cases where a malignancy that has metastasized to a large number of locations in the body is described as &quot;disseminated disease&quot;. That is to say, the &quot;disease&quot; in &quot;disseminated disease&quot; refers to the malignancy itself in that context (and &quot;disseminated&quot; is roughly equivalent to &quot;extensively metastasized&quot; here). TompaDompa (talk) 21:45, 3 January 2024 (UTC)
Tompa, do you see that language used for solid tumors?  I'm not sure that anyone would describe (e.g.,) lymphoma as &quot;metastasized&quot;, but it can be &quot;disseminated&quot;.  
Cursed, you can have a disseminated infection in the setting of disseminated malignancy.  Both the infection (e.g., bacterial) and the cancer can be separately spread around the body. WhatamIdoing (talk) 03:15, 4 January 2024 (UTC)
Yes, e.g. prostate cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer. TompaDompa (talk) 07:57, 4 January 2024 (UTC)

Infobox WARNING for US

The WARNING in the infobox is not helpful or useful and it may be scary to readers. It seems premature to add it to the infobox without having more detail in each of the articles.

The infobox adds a WARNING to the beginning of the US legal status along with a &quot;citation&quot; that requires the reader to download some list and/or make a database query. The link fails for me with a 504 HTTP status.



The WARNING doesn't belong in the legal status section of the infobox since is part of the FDA label and is not a legal status. Articles that contain the WARNING in the infobox do not contain a discussion about the WARNING. The provided &quot;citation&quot; states it was retrieved in October 2023. Does that mean it is now stale and could be providing a false alarm? The placement of the WARNING in the infobox is annoying and distracting. --Whywhenwhohow (talk) 23:52, 6 January 2024 (UTC)

Articles about drugs with boxed warnings should contain information about black box warnings.  It wouldn't make sense to remove the little hint of information we have, just because the rest of the article isn't up to normal standards.  An amount of information that is small but less than ideal is better than no information at all. 
A 504 error to a US federal government website is likely temporary.  I can tell you that the link was working a couple of weeks ago.  Also, as a practical matter, these warnings rarely change.  Like anything else involving regulatory requirements for a drug, it will require a little routine maintenance to check that nothing has changed, but this is probably one editor for a couple of hours, once a year (and less, if anyone comes up with a clever way to diff last year's spreadsheet against this year's spreadsheet). WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:03, 7 January 2024 (UTC)

 Why should they contain that information? Wikipedia is not a guide () and does not give medical advice (). The warning is US FDA specific and looks alarming. The so-called hint using a large unexplained WARNING doesn't seem appropriate. The &quot;citation&quot; for the WARNING is not useful. When it works, it presents a database query form that requires readers to understand the form in order to use it properly. --Whywhenwhohow (talk) 07:53, 8 January 2024 (UTC)
Alternative markings were proposed during the discussion – the least obtrusive of which were ◼︎ (a square) for the US FDA and ▼ (an inverted triangle) for the EU equivalent. These did not receive any support over the implemented WARNING. Both disclaimers were also raised and discussed by editors more competent than I, but will see if I can find the archived discussion(s). Little pob (talk) 15:47, 8 January 2024 (UTC)
Original discussion as far as I'm aware: . (I'm only seeing reference to  on a quick review, though.) Little pob (talk) 15:56, 8 January 2024 (UTC)
Also  (36 comments from 7 editors). WhatamIdoing (talk) 17:31, 8 January 2024 (UTC)
Whywhenwhohow, I'm sure you don't mean to be asking why articles about drugs should contain information about important contraindications and serious adverse effects.  Every article about a drug that has earned a high-priority warning from the FDA or EU should have that fact mentioned in it because major safety issues are basically always DUE.  One would not wish to leave out information, e.g., about suicide risk in SSRIs, or Depo-Provera causing osteoporosis, or celecoxib causing cardiac deaths because you can't really have a complete understanding of the subject if you aren't aware of the serious safety issues.  In addition to the medical side, these warnings also have significant business effects. WhatamIdoing (talk) 17:42, 8 January 2024 (UTC)

Hyperthyroid misinformation in Eliot Coleman article

The Eliot Coleman article (author of winter gardening methods) has a large paragraph on hyperthyroidism which likely contains  violations since it is based on a book written by Coleman's daughter about her recollection of his hyperthyroidism from her childhood, and potentially supported by a Spanish paper (which I cannot access or read). It looks like it is suggesting dietary advice to remedy Graves' disease. I am not familiar enough to evaluate this, but I see zero discussion of diet in the rather long and comprehensive-looking Graves' disease article. Perhaps someone from this wikiproject can assess the matter.    ▶ I am Grorp ◀  21:46, 7 January 2024 (UTC)

Thanks for the note, @Grorp.  While iodine problems can be caused by dietary factors, and thus reversed by fixing those dietary factors, that's not what the cited source actually says.  His thyroid problems were solved by conventional medical treatment, not dietary changes. WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:18, 8 January 2024 (UTC)

Need help on a page: Enteritis

Enteritis is an extremely high-traffic page, with over 400,000 monthly page views. It is currently in a very poor state compared to most pages with that kind of attention, and has a remarkably slow edit frequency. I've made some improvements but realistically I lack the time or expertise to bring it up to par by myself.

I need some help improving the page. It may need large-scale restructuring, maybe not. I've also had trouble finding relevant images (there was no image on the page before I added one recently) if anyone is better at finding those too.

Glucocorticoid resistance

I'm currently working on expanding the page Glucocorticoid resistance but I'm a bit confused as to what the topic of the article should be. There seems to be two definitions of Glucocorticoid resistance, one being a well documented genetic disorder,[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2386273/] and the other being more of a vague concept.[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0039128X16301258] I'm not sure if I should write this article from both perspectives or just focus on the genetic disorder. I've started a sandbox here for the article if anyone wants to check what I've already written on the subject.

It seems like the term has been used in many different contexts and any advice on how I should move forward is appriciated. CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 00:41, 7 January 2024 (UTC)

Congratulations on your work. It seems that the primary genetic disorder is a syndrome - i.e., a complex of various manifestations in multiple organ systems - referred to as (primary) generalized glucocorticoid resistance,[https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/22/19/10839], and is caused by defects in the human glucocorticoid receptor. The general concept of resistance to glucocorticoids[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21164266/] is indeed more vague and highly technical. Therefore, it is worth considering renaming the article Generalized GC resistance, and only cover this specific disease. NikosGouliaros (talk) 15:12, 7 January 2024 (UTC)
Thank you for your response! I think renaming it is the best course of action and I'll finish up my article in the sandbox, then switch the name! CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 20:53, 7 January 2024 (UTC)
Another idea is, since the various non-congenital types of glucocorticoid resistance too are mediated by the Glucocorticoid receptor, to expand on them in the article on the aforementioned protein.NikosGouliaros (talk) NikosGouliaros (talk) 20:33, 8 January 2024 (UTC)

Dipygus

The page for Dipygus is currently lacking citations and classified as a stub. I was going to expand it but I'm questioning whether it needs its own article or whether is should be merged to Caudal duplication.

This article[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4155636/] sates that &quot;Dipygus is a complete caudal duplication deformity in its severest form.&quot; Based off this article and other reports it seems to be a variation of caudal duplication and not its own separate entity.

Orphanet,[https://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/Disease_Search.php?lng=EN&amp;data_id=1772&amp;Disease_Disease_Search_diseaseGroup=Dipygus&amp;Disease_Disease_Search_diseaseType=Pat&amp;Disease(s)/group%20of%20diseases=Caudal-duplication&amp;title=Caudal%20duplication&amp;search=Disease_Search_Simple] GARD, [https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/1164/index] and MONDO[https://monarchinitiative.org/MONDO:0011928] all list it under synonyms for Caudal duplication.

I'm interested in others thoughts on the matter are. CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 01:27, 10 January 2024 (UTC)

Need some advice about this journal PharmaNutrition, they have published many reviews of clinical trials but is this a reliable journal to be citing on Wikipedia [https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/pharmanutrition].

Systemic vasculitides VS. Systemic vasculitis

I'm having a hard time differentiating Systemic vasculitides from Systemic vasculitis. I was wondering if Systemic vasculitides even needs to exist considering the amount of overlap between the two descriptions.

This article [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7355154/] states &quot;Systemic vasculitides are uncommon conditions characterized by inflammation of blood vessels that can lead to a variety of complex disorders involving one or more organs and systems. Systemic vasculitides are categorized as small, medium, large, or variable based on the diameter of the vessel they primarily affect.&quot; (Rephrased slightly for copyright reasons).

This seems like the exact same definition of Systemic vasculitis.

If anyone has any opinions advice or information on the topic please share. CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 03:03, 13 January 2024 (UTC)

I don't know anything about this subject myself, but https://www.hopkinsvasculitis.org/types-vasculitis/ suggests that the -ides name is just the plural form of -itis. WhatamIdoing (talk) 05:47, 13 January 2024 (UTC)
Would it just make sense to redirect Systemic vasculitides to Systemic vasculitis then? CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 18:32, 13 January 2024 (UTC)
We seem to have a bit of a mess.  Systemic Vasculatides (note capitalization) redirects to Vasculitis.  Systemic vasculitis says it's about &quot;Necrotizing systemic vasculitis&quot;, which makes me think that it was about narrower subject and then the name was changed.
I suspect that what we want is to end up with:
* All types (e.g., systemic, local) summarized briefly at Vasculitis
* All the systemic types summarized at Systemic vasculitis
* All the -ides names redirected to Systemic vasculitis (because we put articles at the singular – Cancer, not &quot;Cancers&quot;)
* Separate articles on all the main systemic types (e.g., Necrotizing vasculitis gets its own article, unless it turns out that all systemics are also necrotizing)
People familiar with the subject matter are hereby requested to tell me what I've got wrong. WhatamIdoing (talk) 20:09, 13 January 2024 (UTC)
Thank you for your help. I know quite a bit about vasculitis itself (as an interest not in a professional way) so I would be happy to expand these articles. It would probably take me a week to sort things out but I do love expanding and creating pages! If anyone with more knowledge would like to weigh in please do.
Just to summarize (correct me if I'm wrong here)
* Expand Vasculitis to briefly touch on the different types (I'm also noticing that the article itself needs to be reformatted and fixed up a bit)
* Expand and reformat (noticed the formatting is a bit off in the current article) Systemic vasculitis.
* Fix redirects
* Create page for Necrotizing vasculitis

Bigeminal pulse VS. Bigeminy

I was wondering if anyone could help me figure out the difference (if there is one) between Bigeminal pulse and Bigeminy. I suspect the two articles may be referring to the same disorder but I always get hesitant when pages have already been created. CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 00:52, 6 January 2024 (UTC)
Bigeminal pulse is the arterial pulse that can be felt when there is a bigeminal cardiac rhythm. Our article describes bigeminal pulse as a condition, but it is more properly classified as a sign. Bigeminy is the underlying cardiac rhythm. TompaDompa (talk) 08:30, 6 January 2024 (UTC)

bigeminal pulse is feeling of alternate abnormal beats due to irregular heart beats. that mean one normal volume pulse and another weaker. similarly bigeminy is an ECG diagnosis of one normal followed by another abnormal beats,  EEverest 8848 (talk) 11:11, 15 January 2024 (UTC)

Cryoglobulinemic purpura and Cryofibrinogenemic purpura

I was going through the dermatology stubs and stumbled upon Cryoglobulinemic purpura and Cryofibrinogenemic purpura. I'm wondering if either of these pages really need to exist. It would be silly to give every illness that causes pupura their own article (Eg. vasculitic purpura, anemic purpura etc.) so I'm confused as to why Cryoglobulinemic purpura and Cryofibrinogenemic purpura are listed as their own entities instead of just being redirect to Cryoglobulinemia and Cryofibrinogenemia.

Cryoglobulinemic purpura does have its own listing on SNOMED [https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/?perspective=full&amp;conceptId1=404684003&amp;edition=MAIN/2024-01-01&amp;release=&amp;languages=en] but no listing on Mondo or Mesh ID. Also if you type Cryoglobulinemic purpura into the ICD-11 it is listed under Cryoglobulinaemia [https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en#/http://id.who.int/icd/entity/455331227]. I was only able to find one source with the term Cryoglobulinemic purpura in the title. [https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(16)30827-0/fulltext]

Cryofibrinogenemic purpura also has its own listing on SNOMED [https://browser.ihtsdotools.org/?perspective=full&amp;conceptId1=402853002&amp;edition=MAIN/2024-01-01&amp;release=&amp;languages=en] but nothing on MONDO, Mesh ID or the ICD-11. I was only able to find one paper on the subject.[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3310920/]

Should these terms be redirects? Or are they worth their own pages? Any input or opinions are appreciated! CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 20:31, 19 January 2024 (UTC)

My inclination is to agree that there's not much hope of us flushing out useful encyclopedia articles on either of those topics. A quick skim of web sources doesn't turn up anything beyond what you'd expect. I'd probably redirect. Ajpolino (talk) 20:49, 19 January 2024 (UTC)

It looks like Golan1911 sorted out how to do this, by just starting an article on that page.

CD30+ cutaneous T-cell lymphoma

It seems like CD30+ cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is referring to Primary cutaneous CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders (CD30+ Lymphoproliferative Disorders of the Skin) which encompasses Lymphomatoid papulosis and Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma. [https://dermnetnz.org/topics/primary-cutaneous-cd30-positive-lymphoproliferative-disorders][https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6355473/][https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5776746/]. I couldn't find any reference to the term CD30+ cutaneous T-cell lymphoma outside of this context. The current wiki page lists Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma as a synonym however I couldn't find any reference to this in literature. I made a page for Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (it's a work in progress so it's a bit rough right now).

I'm wondering if I should redirect CD30+ cutaneous T-cell lymphoma to Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma or rename CD30+ cutaneous T-cell lymphoma to Primary cutaneous CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorders or CD30+ Lymphoproliferative Disorders of the Skin (not sure which one is more appropriate).

Any input is appreciated! CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 21:18, 19 January 2024 (UTC)

Generally speaking, we prefer whatever name is given in an international standard (by which we mostly mean the name used in the International Classification of Diseases, unless it's terrible).  I don't know if it's relevant in this case, but the difference between leukemias and lymphomas can be a bit arbitrary. WhatamIdoing (talk) 22:28, 19 January 2024 (UTC)
The ICD lists Primary cutaneous CD30 positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma and Lymphomatoid papulosis under Primary cutaneous CD-30 positive T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders so should I change CD30+ cutaneous T-cell lymphoma to Primary cutaneous CD-30 positive T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders and Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma to Primary cutaneous CD30 positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma? CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 23:26, 19 January 2024 (UTC)

While I may understand that there maybe editors who really want to protect Wikipedia from misinformation, what is NOT okay is that, people are nominating articles (likely on subjects they aren’t familiar with) for deletion without doing thorough research or tagging for improvement, and when later more sources and evidence surfaced, people aren’t correcting (or trying to correct) their own mistakes. Not trying to find sources base on new information that others provide, but chose to delete content and sources (and have newbies driven away), and describing other editor’s claim of “sources exist” as imagination (not ), and even citing  instead. --Dustfreeworld (talk) 21:01, 21 January 2024 (UTC); 21:24, 21 January 2024 (UTC)

Thanks for the link, though I (and also the IP user or other Korean speaking new users?) really don’t know how to “rise the article again”. I don’t know if I understand you correctly.

The ICD-11 coding challenge





Hey you! Are you up for a challenge? Do you have time to kill? Or do you just want to help make Wikipedia a little bit more complete? Can you fill in the missing ICD-11 codes?

I considered writing a bot to do this task, but that would not work. The WHO actually does offer spreadsheets that can be used to convert ICD-10 codes and code *ranges* to ICD-11 codes. However, these spreadsheets aren't very suitable for us. Most of the time, they just map ICD-10 codes/ranges to 'unspecified' ICD-11 codes, ending in &quot;Z&quot;. These are miscellaneous/residual categories, usually not fit for .

Furthermore, the ICD-11 has categories which the ICD-10 has not. For example, our article on Panic attack gives  as the ICD-10 code. This code includes Panic disorder, Panic state, and Panic attack. According to the spreadsheet released by the WHO, F41.0 would be  in the ICD-11. However, this is in fact Panic disorder, not an individual Panic attack. That would be  in the ICD-11.

So, using a bot to blindly convert all ICD-10 codes to ICD-11 codes would be a bad idea, because it would result in many errors. It should be done by hand. Creating a good bot would take more time than for us to do it manually. This is a one-time task, so let's get to it!

Thank you for your contribution! Honestly, I don't fully understand what I'd need to do (am I alone in this?). If I'm correct, in most of the articles one only needs to include the ICD11 code in the Medical Resources template at the end, right? NikosGouliaros (talk) 15:07, 15 January 2024 (UTC)
 Yes, that's right! In a nutshell:
# Copy the ICD-10 code from the article.
# Search for that code in 10To11MapToMultipleCategories.xlsx (this file can be downloaded from [https://icd.who.int/browse11/l-m/en the ICD-11 browser] -&gt; Info -&gt; ICD-10 / ICD-11 mapping Tables).
# Copy the ICD-11 code from the spreadsheet. Usually, this is a miscellaneous category.
# Check the ICD-11 browser to look up the main category.
# Copy-paste it in the Wikipedia article.
# Done.
For example, the article  is Erectile dysfunction. The article says F52.2 and N48.4. If you look those up at 10To11MapToMultipleCategories.xlsx, it'll give you HA01.1Z and HA01.13.

Calcific Tendinitis Wiki page

Having some calcium along with tendinopathy should arguably not alter management.  It is probably best considered an incidental finding.  Acute, inflammatory, calcific tendinitis on the other hand is a completely different thing with a different pathophysiology, prognosis, and treatment.  It should be separated and distinguished.   Scientific writing on this are misleading when they don't clearly make this distinction. Ischyros7 (talk) 21:15, 19 January 2024 (UTC)

There's an article at Calcific tendinitis.  Is that content what you think should be under that name? WhatamIdoing (talk) 22:24, 19 January 2024 (UTC)
[Yes, I am referencing that Wiki page. Please let me know what you think of the below.]
Calcium is very common in degenerated tendons.  There is no clear reason to distinguish tendinopathy with and without calcium.  
This chapter collates the evidence that calcification in tendons is a common variation in asymptomatic people: DOI 10.1016/s0950-3579(89)80009-3
As an orthopedic surgeon, I recommend this page be changed to &quot;Acute calcific tendinitis&quot; to address the much less common circumstance in which the calcium breaks free of the tendon and causes a brief, intense, inflammation that mimics the symptoms and signs of infection.

Articles about health care professions

I notice that many health care professions have two articles: one for the profession and one for the people who practice the profession. An example is Dentistry and Dentist.

--BeauregardTA (talk) 04:50, 29 January 2024 (UTC)

Ballet#Ballet as a career is IMO one of the best occupation-related sections I've written.  Career-related articles generally have something about the education/training, the likelihood of getting a job, the pay, and the job conditions (e.g., whether you work overnight).  It's good to include similar careers (both laterally and vertically).  I particularly recommend the US Occupational Outlook Handbook as a source of impartial (though US-specific) statistics.  Professional organizations can be useful, but they tend to be a bit promotional. WhatamIdoing (talk) 15:38, 29 January 2024 (UTC)

referring to placebo effect

One sentence in the lead to the acupuncture article says: &quot;The conclusions of trials and systematic reviews of acupuncture generally provide no good evidence of benefit, which suggests that it is not an effective method of healthcare.&quot; There are two sources for this claim, a systematic review of systematic reviews and an analysis of this review at SBM; both state that in general, effects of acupuncture are likely due to the placebo effect. There is broad medical consensus that the placebo effect exists when treating subjective phenomena like pain, and given that acupuncture is primarily used to treat pain, I thought it would be more accurate to say &quot;The conclusions of trials and systematic reviews of acupuncture generally provide no good evidence of benefit relative to a placebo, which suggests that it is not an effective method of healthcare.&quot;

In the talk page this was suggested to be bad style, as well as moving towards promoting placebos, but acknowledging that something exists is not the same as promoting it, particularly when the most accurate descriptive account of the sources requires acknowledging that such a thing exists.

Anyway, I don't think we always have to acknowledge placebos, just in areas where broad medical consensus would suggest the placebo effect might be at work. Any thoughts? AtavisticPillow (talk) 17:06, 23 January 2024 (UTC)

I think this is covered by . We should be summarizing the main finding(s) of sources and not surfacing details of method (whether work has been placebo-controlled, double-blinded or whatever). If we look at an  like Amphetamine it discusses efficacy without every mentioning the placebo controls used: I don't think we should be retro-fitting such articles to add 'compared to placebo' alongside discussions of efficacy. There's an additional consideration in altmed where there is a rearguard action to justify poorly-performing interventions with the justification that they 'harness the power of placebo'; thus, mentioning it in this context without an even longer explanation risks causing more confusion. Bon courage (talk) 17:15, 23 January 2024 (UTC)
Thanks for that link. That seems fair. I thought a minor addition of a few words for accuracy would help the article, but concision is a virtue too. AtavisticPillow (talk) 17:29, 23 January 2024 (UTC)
Comparing pain treatments against non-pain treatments feels like an apples-and-oranges error.  When we look at chronic pain (e.g., chronic lower back pain), very little works better than placebo, but placebo works fairly well.  If we say &quot;doesn't work&quot; without qualification, and the reader's personal experience/belief is dramatically different from that, then they may be inappropriately skeptical abut the rest of our content.  (Also, some drugs, especially Experimental cancer treatments, aren't tested against placebo anyway, so specifying may be appropriate.)
Speaking more generally, what makes readers trust (or not) what they find on the internet has nothing to do with the sources cited.  People trust information that confirms their pre-existing beliefs more than information that disagrees.  This is not unique to lay people; this history of science is littered with examples of gradual corrections to an early expert's work, because saying &quot;Wow, Dr. Expert's 2 is wrong; I clearly got 10&quot;, researchers behave like first-year students and say &quot;Well, I got 10, but let me 'adjust' those with a series of excuses about my technique until I can claim that my 10 really means 3 or 4.  That's pretty similar to 2, even if it's a little higher&quot;.   WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:48, 24 January 2024 (UTC)
I recently read Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!, where one of these examples is presented. See Oil drop experiment#Millikan's experiment as an example of psychological effects in scientific methodology for the details. TompaDompa (talk) 19:25, 24 January 2024 (UTC)
The guideline referred to above does state not to get into the details of methods when citing medical studies and to simply summarize the conclusion(s). I think this situation is a borderline, because arguably failing to mention that the conclusions are against a placebo here changes the meaning of the results being summarized. I don't think that would be the case were we discussing cancer drugs not tested against the placebo, because placebo's have no effect on the progression of the cancer (though they might change the patient's psychological wellbeing and relation to their cancer); we could just say &quot;this drug doesn't work&quot; based on a good secondary source. 
Broadly, it seems the approach to fringe and alternative medicine on Wikipedia takes its lead from people like Steven Novella and his website, Science Based Medicine, and it is thought that only this approach is actually . This is clearly better than letting pseudoscientific theories and practices run amuck, but I share the concern that for lay-readers this may make Wikipedia as read as partial or polemical, and may lead to the premature dismissal by readers of the data to be presented. It is clear to me that Novella and such skepticism by experts performs a valuable function and should be displayed prominently on Wikipedia; I am less sure that the present way that this is carried out is the ideal one. AtavisticPillow (talk) 19:44, 24 January 2024 (UTC)
This is not an altmed-specific thing, but applies to all biomedicine. It has nothing to do with Novella. To repeat, look at a high-quality article like Amphetamine to see how efficacy is discussed without going into the weeds about placebo controls. Bon courage (talk) 20:20, 24 January 2024 (UTC)
WhatamIdoing raised the issue of how Wikipedia is read by the general public, so I was responding to that in the second paragraph. I don't think specifically the presentation of clinical trial details has anything to do with Novella. I do think there is a little room for disagreement as to what constitutes the &quot;weeds&quot; and what is directly relevant for summary, and background assumptions or approach may play a role there, but the  guideline you adduced is convincing imo. AtavisticPillow (talk) 20:57, 24 January 2024 (UTC)
My input is to change it to something like, &quot;The conclusions of trials and systematic reviews of acupuncture generally provide no evidence of benefit relative to placebo&quot;. (Or &quot;compared to placebo&quot;, or other similar wording) (I would also take out the word &quot;good&quot; as being unnecessary and sounding too informal) That would be both accurate and concise and I can't imagine how it would possibly make anything any worse. 

As AtavisticPillow said: &quot; If we say &quot;doesn't work&quot; without qualification, and the reader's personal experience/belief is dramatically different from that, then they may be inappropriately skeptical abut the rest of our content.&quot; Vontheri (talk) 21:14, 29 January 2024 (UTC)

For plague/pandemic experts: Volcanism as driver of Yersinia pestis/Black Death evolution and spread

Fell, H. G., Baldini, J. U., Dodds, B., &amp; Sharples, G. J. (2020). [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305748820300967 Volcanism and global plague pandemics: Towards an interdisciplinary synthesis]. Journal of Historical Geography, 70, 36-46. hypothesizes that the climate disturbance caused by the 1257 Samalas eruption triggered/helped cause several disease outbreaks across Eurasia, including the initial Yersinia pestis outbreak that became the Black Death. I have refrained from adding this information so far b/c it seems like a big claim and I don't know anything about the wider Black Death literature to tell whether it has any acceptance. Jo-Jo Eumerus (talk) 10:07, 1 February 2024 (UTC)

@Jo-Jo Eumerus, I don't know whether it has acceptance (I leave that question to others) and I haven't read the paper, but I think an idea like this could be presented fairly, e.g., &quot;Volcanoes can trigger chains of events; for example, some researchers have speculated that this eruption might have caused climate disturbances that triggered, among other things, zoonotic disease outbreaks.&quot;
In the specific case of Y. pestis, this isn't exactly an extraordinary claim.  It's transmitted by fleas and lice that usually bother rats but sometimes find themselves around humans.  Outbreaks are correlated with an increased reports of dead rats (whose plague-bearing fleas then jump ship for the nearest target), which are correlated with sudden changes in plant growth (e.g., no food here, so the rat decides to investigate that grain silo), which is correlated with changes to sudden changes to weather patterns, which can be triggered by a volcano belching a bunch of dust into the sky.  Also, crop failures cause human migration, which is another opportunity to spread everyone's favorite biting insects and arthropods.  
The only real question here is likely to be how strong of a claim is .

Nodular vasculitis

I'm having a hard time defining Nodular vasculitis and I would appreciate others input on the topic. There seems to be two main definitions of it. One being a synonym for Erythema induratum and the other being a distinct condition.

Here is what I've been able to find.

1. Nodular vasculitis as a synonym for Erythema induratum:

&quot;Nodular vasculitis (NV) is a rare kind of panniculitis marked by erythematous plaques or nodules that appear mostly on the calves and have the potential to ulcerate and drain.&quot;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6256222/]

&quot;Erythema induratum, also known as nodular vasculitis or Bazin disease, is classified as a tuberculid skin eruption, a collection of skin disorders linked to a silent or underlying tuberculosis (TB) focus.&quot; [https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1083213-clinical]

&quot;Nodular vasculitis is a type of panniculitis&quot;[https://dermnetnz.org/topics/nodular-vasculitis]

2. Nodular vasculitis as a distinct disease:

&quot;Nodular lymphocytic vasculitis was discussed in three generations of a family by Reed et al. (1972). There were two different types of lesions: (1) several small to medium-sized nodules on the arms, legs, and buttocks; and (2) several larger, firm nodules over bony prominences that resembled rheumatoid nodules.&quot; [https://omim.org/entry/192310?search=Nodular%20vasculitis&amp;highlight=nodular%20vasculiti]

Complex Regional Pain Syndrome and Amplified Musculoskeletal Pain Syndrome

We were contributing to the page on Complex Regional Pain Syndrome and discovered this page on Amplified Musculoskeletal Pain Syndrome.  While it's definitely true that humans can experience pain disproportionate to any pathophysiology/nociception, we should discuss the potential benefits and potential harms of creating numerous illness constructions (social constructions about illness), such as CRPS and AMPS on the one hand, versus just having a page about disproportionate discomfort and incapability on the other.  We favor the later. Unecomeditor1 (talk) 23:39, 24 January 2024 (UTC)

Yes, I work with @Dr311 Unecomeditor1 (talk) 11:11, 26 January 2024 (UTC)
For example, the AMPS page discusses EDS and other rheumatological diseases along with AMPS. But this is confusing and misleading because those conditions each have a pathophysiology that can be measured and verified. We suggest using words of association rather than causation on these pages until there is adequate experimental support for a pathophysiology in these conditions. At this time, the evidence is still speculative and based on observational studies, rather than experimental. Unecomeditor1 (talk) 16:31, 1 February 2024 (UTC)
I think your changes yesterday were helpful.  I particularly appreciate the very concise explanation of what &quot;amplified pain&quot; means. WhatamIdoing (talk) 20:05, 1 February 2024 (UTC)
Thank you! We appreciate the positive feedback. Unecomeditor1 (talk) 13:54, 7 February 2024 (UTC)
To further expand, It’s more accurate to say there is no measurable pathophysiology and the diagnosis is conceptual. A section of the AMPS page mentions that the condition is “often not diagnosed when it first presents.” Since the diagnosis is conceptual rather than experimental, it cannot be framed as a delay in diagnosis. The main issue is whether this concept of AMPS and its use with individual patients is good for their health. Unecomeditor1 (talk) 12:47, 9 February 2024 (UTC)

CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 22:10, 9 February 2024 (UTC)

This sounds like a definite maybe.   has the process if that's what you think is best, but the question you'll have to settle first is whether that's a case of &quot;one old thing → one new thing&quot; or &quot;one old thing → two different diseases&quot;.  For example, Da Costa's syndrome (&quot;soldier's heart&quot;) turned out to be at least two things (some of the soldiers had PTSD; some of them had Mitral valve prolapse), so we can't really merge and redirect it to one or the other.  If AD included both Dercum's disease and also lipedema, then it's probably better to have a short article saying that it's an outdated category that lumped together two conditions that we now split apart, instead of just redirecting it.

MPH efficacy &amp; trial quality

There was some text in the methylphenidate article which was mostly based on fairly old (and, in my opinion, problematic) narrative reviews. More recent Cochrane reviews have seriously criticized the quality of the evidence base for methylphenidate and have said that conclusions regarding efficacy and safety must therefore be drawn very tentatively or even should not really be drawn at all. I posted about it on the MPH talk page, got no responses, and after some time removed the problematic text in the article. There's since been a bit of discussion but more input would certainly be appreciated from anyone who wants to take a look. Feline negativity (talk) 21:35, 14 February 2024 (UTC)

Urticarial dermatoses

Can anyone help me understand what Urticarial dermatoses is supposed to be reffering to? From my understanding dermatoses just refers to a general skin condition so it seems like this term is very broad. The closest thing I could find was Urticarial dermatitis.[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5383738/] CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 03:55, 15 February 2024 (UTC)

I'm wondering if it might be appropriate to redirect it to hives? There is also Urticarial syndromes which is equally undescriptive and vague. CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 16:33, 16 February 2024 (UTC)
Have you tried to track down that textbook?  That might help.  The title's in the plural, so it's a group of skin diseases.  A quick search says there is a rare disease called &quot;Neutrophilic urticarial dermatosis&quot;, which is presumably an example of a urticarial dermatosis.  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9524803/table/j_rir-2021-0030_tab_001/ lists several others.
My impression is that it's trying to draw a distinction between something that itches (e.g., a random little itch, maybe a mosquito bite) and a longer-term skin condition that has itchiness as a significant feature. WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:27, 16 February 2024 (UTC)
I found the textbook. Urticarial dermatoses is talked about in the chapter Urticaria and Angioedema. It is talked about in the context of a differential diagnosis. 
&quot;It is important to distinguish urticaria from urticarial dermatoses, such as urticarial drug eruptions, eosinophilic cellulitis and bullous pemphigoid. The individual wheals of urticaria are ‘here today and gone tomorrow’ (i.e. they last less than 24 hours), whereas with urticarial dermatoses, the individual lesions last for days or longer. Although urticarial vasculitis is usually included in classifications of urticaria because the wheals resemble urticaria, it is actually an urticarial dermatosis. Clinically, the lesions last longer than 24 hours (as determined by circling and observing individual wheals), and histologically there is evidence of leukocytoclastic vasculitis.&quot;
This definition also seems to differ from the article you were able to find which is odd. CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 20:23, 16 February 2024 (UTC)

If you've never done this before, then I suggest reading the  and then picking a criteria that appeals to you, and reviewing the article (or even just a section of it) for that one thing.  For example, maybe you want to read the article and see whether it's &quot;comprehensive&quot;.  Did it leave you with unanswered questions?  Are there important sections (see the list at  for some ideas) that have been omitted?  And then, whether you see something that needs improved or if you think it's perfect just like it is, please go to  (despite the name, it's not really an archive!) and start a little subsection that says something like &quot;I read the

Calcinosis cutis

I noticed that there are several stubs listed as subtypes of Calcinosis cutis. The article lists 9 subtypes of Calcinosis cutis (Dystrophic calcinosis cutis, Metastatic calcinosis cutis, Iatrogenic calcinosis cutis, Traumatic calcinosis cutis, Idiopathic calcinosis cutis, Idiopathic scrotal calcinosis, Subepidermal calcified nodule, Tumoral calcinosis, and Osteoma cutis. These subtypes seem unnecessarily specific. 

Idiopathic scrotal calcinosis, Tumoral calcinosis, and Osteoma cutis have more literature and seem like more distinct disorders but the other subtypes have very little information available.

I'm wondering if it would be appropriate to redirect Dystrophic calcinosis cutis, Metastatic calcinosis cutis, Iatrogenic calcinosis cutis, Traumatic calcinosis cutis, Idiopathic calcinosis cutis, Subepidermal calcified nodule to Calcinosis cutis and write a brief overview on them within the article for Calcinosis cutis.

Abderhalden–Kaufmann–Lignac syndrome VS Cystinosis

I'm confused as to the distinction between Abderhalden–Kaufmann–Lignac syndrome and Cystinosis. The wikipedia page for Abderhalden–Kaufmann–Lignac syndrome makes it seem as though it is a type of Cystinosis however different sources seem to say different things. 

This article[https://ojrd.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13023-016-0426-y] states &quot;Cystinosis was first described in literature in 1903 by the Swiss biochemist Emil Abderhalden (1877–1950) as the familial cystine accumulation disease [1]. Abderhalden referred to a child initially encountered by Eduard Kaufmann, Basel, Switzerland (1860–1931). This patient died at the age of 21 months with massive cystine accumulation in multiple organs that were discovered at the postmortem examination. The Dutch pathologist George Lignac (1891–1954) was the first to provide a clear systematic description of the disease in 1924, and the first to associate cystinosis with its major clinical manifestations such as rickets, renal disease and growth retardation [2]. This is why cystinosis was initially termed as the Abderhalden-Kaufmann-Lignac syndrome.&quot; This implies that Abderhalden–Kaufmann–Lignac syndrome is a historical name for Cystinosis.

MONDO lists Abderhalden–Kaufmann–Lignac syndrome under the name nephropathic cystinosis as a type of cystinosis.[https://monarchinitiative.org/MONDO:0100151]

Any insights would be appreciated.CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 01:00, 25 February 2024 (UTC)

The page for Alpha-synuclein already mentions mutations. 
&quot;Nevertheless, alpha-synuclein aggregates to form insoluble fibrils in pathological conditions characterized by Lewy bodies, such as Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy. These disorders are known as synucleinopathies. In vitro models of synucleinopathies revealed that aggregation of alpha-synuclein may lead to various cellular disorders including microtubule impairment, synaptic and mitochondrial dysfunctions, oxidative stress as well as dysregulation of Calcium signaling, proteasomal and lysosomal pathway. Alpha-synuclein is the primary structural component of Lewy body fibrils. Occasionally, Lewy bodies contain tau protein; however, alpha-synuclein and tau constitute two distinctive subsets of filaments in the same inclusion bodies. Alpha-synuclein pathology is also found in both sporadic and familial cases with Alzheimer's disease.&quot;

While I've been reading Wikipedia since I was a young child, I recently joined the site after years of noticing easily fixable errors and/or outdated content. 

Shoutout to @WhatamIdoing for inviting me to join this page.

Outside of some small 2-minute edits here and there, I've been working on revamping the pages of some of the non-profit organizations associated with harm reduction &amp; psychedelics such as Bluelight, MAPS, &amp; Erowid.

The discussion has been blanked, but it looked unproductive, so I'm not sure anything was lost.  (Also, pinging Arjayay because of this side discussion.)
Looking at the article, I suggest two possible areas for improvement:
* More clearly separate venom effects from allergic responses (e.g., by putting all allergy information in a separate paragraph).  Everyone is at risk for the &quot;poisonous&quot; effects; only a small fraction of people are additionally at risk for &quot;allergic&quot; effects.  I emphasize additionally because having the allergy doesn't make you immune to the poisonous aspect.
* More clearly differentiate between being allergic and realistically being at risk of anaphylaxis.  Most people who are allergic to anything will not actually develop anaphylaxis upon a subsequent exposure.  Our inability to pre-identify who those people are is not quite the same as us believing that it really could be all of them.  
I think what I'm looking for is something like &quot;Anyone could die from the poison, a few people are also allergic, and of those few allergic people who are exposed, a (small?  tiny?) minority of the allergic reactions are life-threatening anaphylaxis&quot;.

Pseudoacanthosis nigricans

Would it be appropriate to redirect Pseudoacanthosis nigricans to Acanthosis nigricans? There isn't much information regarding Pseudoacanthosis nigricans and I don't think it's possible to expand it much. CursedWithTheAbilityToDoTheMath (talk) 23:26, 1 March 2024 (UTC)

*Merge to avoid confusion I think they can be merged, with a mention in Acanthosis nigricans that Pseudoacanthosis nigricans presents similarly (the skin manifestation) except without endocrinopathy (insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia) but with the same clinical features as AN, viz. brown-to-black, poorly defined, velvety hyperpigmentation of the skin distributed over the neck, the axillae, antecubital and popliteal fossae, and groin folds. (Predilection for areas of perspiration and/or friction due to IGF1 signalling pathways and high-affinity binding to insulin).
My opinion is to avoid confusion Pseudoacanthosis nigricans should not be used at all. But rather specify 'acquired or inherited' and subtype the AN 'Obesity, Endocrine and metabolic disorders, particularly disorders associated with insulin resistance, Genetic syndromes with acanthosis nigricans, Familial acanthosis nigricans, Malignancy, Drug reactions'.
However, it’s odd the Wikipedia article Pseudoacanthosis nigricans [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pseudoacanthosis_nigricans&amp;oldid=1183552263 in its current form] only mentions its association with heroine abuse. My assumption, based on first principles, would be that repeated subdermal needle injections in heroin users results in repeated damage and subsequent inflammation to surrounding dermal tissue and resultant hyperpigmentation which may mimic AN, albeit distribution would be different and AN is histologically &quot;papillomatosis and hyperkeratosis of the skin&quot;
Quick searches do reveal that 'Pseudoacanthosis nigricans' may now also be synonymous with Obesity-associated AN which has the same pathogenesis as AN except it can be at any age since insulin resistance occurs at &gt;200% of ideal body weight, but the AN will regress with weight loss. Local S/E of insulin injection repeatedly superficially in the same spot of skin, by same pathogenesis but mimicking hyperinsulinaemia I suppose. Autoantibody related, such as autoAb to insulin receptors on cells in these areas.

I'm just more familiar with the AfD format. I'll give the other way a go if and when I make such a proposal in future. TarnishedPathtalk 03:22, 10 March 2024 (UTC)

Medical claims in articles like Animal-assisted therapy and Equine-assisted therapy

Someone smarter than me should take a look at these articles. I cleaned them up a bit but there is more work to be done. Polygnotus (talk) 21:24, 9 March 2024 (UTC)

I don't think I've looked at these articles for years, but my recollection of them is that both the proponents and detractors were making outlandish claims – the one side almost claiming that horse riding is the one true panacea for all chronic conditions, and the other side barely restraining themselves from claiming that no disabled kids anywhere has ever gotten any benefits whatsoever from it, not even the ordinary benefits of the physical activity inherent in it or the social and emotional benefits of bragging at school about getting to ride a horse.  It was not edifying, and I gave up.
Given the state of civic discourse in the US, I don't have any real hope that the sources will be any better now than they were then, but if someone's willing to take it on, I think that we could do some good by writing an article that summarizes (i.e., is no longer than necessary) the middle ground (i.e., some people do this, and some people get benefits from it).

Thank you! I love animals and I am 1000% sure they can improve most people's lives. And of course improving happiness has a measurable effect on health in many cases. Some animals (e.g. dogs, cats) are also emphatic and smart enough to partially understand the emotions of humans. But we need to follow  for all medical claims and we need to be honest about what AAT and EAT can and can't do. Having a sick person interact with an animal is often a great idea; but animal contact is not a panacea. I am probably not smart enough to write a proper article about this topic so I am hoping someone else will step up and collaborate with WhatamIdoing. Polygnotus (talk) 07:53, 10 March 2024 (UTC)

Medicalnewstoday website

I wanted to read a source that was added with [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Surgery&amp;curid=45599&amp;diff=1213088949&amp;oldid=1212709573 this] edit but when I link to the source and manage cookies, I get a message from Healthline saying we detect that you are in one of the member countries of the UK/EU/EEA, which is now subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Unfortunately, a tracking-free version of our full website is currently unavailable in these countries. It's the first time I've come across a website that doesn't allow me to manage cookies, but also if Medicalnewstoday IS a Healthline publication then is it not a deprecated source?

Publishers can publish both reliable and unreliable sources, just like the big pharma companies all sell regulated prescription drugs and dubious nutritional supplements.  In practice, Medical News Today is likely to be more useful for business-related information than for . WhatamIdoing (talk) 17:53, 11 March 2024 (UTC)

Draft to Mainspace when Blocked user moved it to draft, help please!

History: I cleaned up and provided major edits to this page  The page had notices on it and was moved from Mainspace to draft. How can I get this back to MainSpace? It appears the person &quot;Fhektii&quot; who moved this to draft was banned March 6. O left a note on Ponyo's page (see below) although she seems swamped with investigating and blocking and likely has no time for this.

Hi Ponyo,

It seems user Fhektii moved page Benjamin Djulbegovic to  does not appear to be responding to Talk. I want to remain polite and kind. My question is, how might I move this draft back to mainstream? I have made significant edits. Fhektii included an accusation that someone paid to put this content up. No one has paid me. I do not know the original editor(s), , I found this while looking for an obscure reference. The page in question is written about a well respected professor and oncologist. I have done my best to address any areas of concern. I emailed the Professor for a photo and he responded the same day and then, after reading the Wikipedia form, he realized that he may not own the copyright and so immediately sent a selfie instead which I then used. Thank you for any help or direction you can give to help get this page to mainspace

Warmest regards, ~~~AmyEBHC AmyEBHC (talk) 05:30, 11 March 2024 (UTC)[reply]

Hello, AmyEBHC,
Benjamin Djulbegovic has been moved back to main space. It looks like there have been editors who edited the article who might have had conflicted motives. Liz  Talk! 02:11, 12 March 2024 (UTC)</segment>
