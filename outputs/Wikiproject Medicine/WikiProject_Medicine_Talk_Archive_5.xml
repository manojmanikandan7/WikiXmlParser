Request cardiology specialist to provide details regarding Shone's Syndrome / Complex in details  11:42, 29 October 2007 (UTC)

I would like to suggest that on amputation-related articles that are stubs, the stub should read &quot;This amputation-related article is a stub&quot;, et cetera, et cetera. Not only will this be more accurate, it will also be quite humorous :)  11:39, 16 July 2007 (UTC)

 Are there really enough articles to justify this? From the amputation article, I see perhaps a dozen articles that could use this stub template. As for the so-called humour — sigh. Let's say I don't share the same enthusiasm. :-)  09:41, 19 July 2007 (UTC)

Neurocardiology

I just finished doing a cleanup on neurocardiology.  I am not an expert, but I suspect this topic is more alternative medicine than medicine in general.

Sacrococcygeal teratoma and coccygectomy

Hi can anyone tell me from what date coccygectomy became standard practise in the management of SCT?  I know the Altmann typing of SCT began in 71/72 but when did total resection of the coccyx become regular protocol? 23:23, 27 July 2007 (UTC)

I have not read much of the early literature, but the current standard of surgical treatment (including coccygectomy) is described in its entirety in a 1964 review article.  So it must predate that article. -- 19:46, 28 August 2007 (UTC)

ATLS Page

The ATLS stub contains information I consider to be inacurate, although I might be wrong.

It states that ATLS is for paramedics and other advanced practitioners, where I thought it was for MD/DOs only, although other paramedic-level practitioners can AUDIT the course (ie attend but not get certified).

It states that BTLS is for EMT-Bs (going along with the first point above), where it is in fact for all EMTs (basics, intermediates/specialists, and paramedics).

I'm new to Wikipedia (and love it, BTW!), so sorry if I'm not completely protocol-compliant.  I am, however, a paramedic and RN and think I have the above correct.

Unsure about article

Hi Folks, I hope this is the right place to ask. Balano-preputial lamina is a (rather perplexing) stub that cites no sources. As far as I can tell, the phrase is used by a handful of lobbyist websites, but only two  even use the term (both, oddly, are journal letters written by a lawyer on behalf of the same lobbyist group), and neither define it. Nor have I had any luck in textbooks. I'm trying to work out if the term actually exists in a meaningful sense - has anyone come across a reference anywhere?  22:44, 11 August 2007 (UTC)

Creation of a Pregnancy Task Force

I've begun working on articles related to pregnancy and childbirth, and have found that this is a topic sorely in need of additional editors' help. I would like to propose creating a  for pregnancy-related articles within WP:MED. I envision the scope as encompassing clinical and preclinical subjects (assuming I understand those terms correctly), as well as what I call &quot;experiential&quot; subjects (for example, see this article) -- that is, subjects that are not strictly medical but which are nevertheless related to pregnancy and/or childbirth.

I have never been involved in the creation of a WikiProject or task force, so would appreciate any bureaucratic or technical help that might be offered, as well. -- 14:35, 14 August 2007 (UTC)

History of the relationship of osteopathic and allopathic medicine in the United States

I initially suspected this article to be a POV fork. I have since worked with its author to resolve some of those issues, but the article still strikes me as a pro-osteopathic medicine fluff piece more suitable to a trade journal than to an encyclopedia. Even now, the original author is adding in details about osteopaths' practice rights in foreign countries (i.e., explicitly out of the scope of the title of the article in the United States). Beyond the first couple of sections with pro-osteopathic pronouncements by the AMA &amp; AMSA and the discussion of the 1960s turf wars between osteo and traditional medicine, the remainder of the material doesn't even seem to fit with the subject of the article. I would appreciate it if others would take a look at this article and suggest ways to proceed. Thanks, [[User:Antelan|Ante]][[User:Antelan|lan]] [[User_talk:Antelan|talk]] 17:52, 15 August 2007 (UTC)

Perhaps the table with the International practice rights would be better placed in the Comparison of allopathic and osteopathic medicine article, which is not US specific.  There's already an international section there. However, it is notable that traditionally allopathic organizations like the American Medical Student Association support the International Practice Rights of US-trained osteopathic physicians, something that was not true until very recently.  AMSA recently adopted a policy requesting that governments recognize US allopathic and osteopathic physicians as equals.[http://www.amsa.org/about/ppp/osteo.cfm] 
I do not want this article to be fluff. I have tried to make good citations and source every statement appropriately.  I've appreciated User Antelan's close editing assistance, and I hope the article continues to improve.  Touro Osteopathic[[User:OsteopathicFreak|Freak]] [[User talk:OsteopathicFreak|T ]] 04:42, 16 August 2007 (UTC)

My concern has largely been with the approach that has been taken with these articles. In the &quot;Comparison of...&quot; article, you say, &quot;The two largest traditionally allopathic organizations, the American Medical Association and the American Medical Student Association, both support further integration and non-discrimination in residency programs.&quot; [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_allopathic_and_osteopathic_medicine#Residency] You then cite a source that says that the AMA opposes differential FEES for osteo and allopathic medical students, which is totally distinct from the claim you made in the article. You also used this same source to make yet a different point in the &quot;History of&quot; article, which demonstrates that this was no accidental misuse of a source. It's frustrating for me to have to go through and fact check your edits. I don't mind helping you with incidental POV issues, but using the same source to back two different statements, neither of which were supported by the source, doesn't make me feel comfortable. Hence, I am asking for others interested in this topic to help me with the fact checking. [[User:Antelan|Ante]][[User:Antelan|lan]] [[User_talk:Antelan|talk]] 22:06, 16 August 2007 (UTC)

OK.  You raise a valid point.  However, I hope you will  here.  In fact, my claim is correct though poorly sourced.  The source I cited is one piece of a much broader conversation within the AMA about osteopathic/allopathic discrimination.  The &quot;fees for medical students&quot;  was one outcome of an investigation.  It's not always easy to cite a source that is readily available on the web for AMA in-house policy documents / discussion.  I'm trying.  They are published and publicly available, but not always on the web.

*[http://forums.studentdoctor.net/attachment.php?attachmentid=5914&amp;d=1142029431 AMA HOD report]
The conversation expanded to discuss discrimination in general, and DO membership within the AMA.  As indicated by &quot;G-635.053 AMA Membership Strategy: Osteopathic Medicine&quot;, the AMA is now actively seeking DO membership. In &quot;H-405.989 Physicians and Surgeons,&quot; the AMA demonstrates it advocates for equality between MDs&amp;DOs in regards to the use of professional titles &quot;physician&quot; and &quot;surgeon&quot;. Touro Osteopathic[[User:OsteopathicFreak|Freak]] [[User talk:OsteopathicFreak|T ]] 23:05, 16 August 2007 (UTC)

Looking through those, I see where the medical student representatives at the AMA conference introduced resolutions saying what you're suggesting, but I don't see where those became enshrined, except for the equal fees part of the resolution. [[User:Antelan|Ante]][[User:Antelan|lan]] [[User_talk:Antelan|talk]] 23:12, 16 August 2007 (UTC)

In the meantime, perhaps we can reliably source that these resolutions were proposed by members the AMA, indicating that this discussion is an ongoing topic of debate. Touro Osteopathic[[User:OsteopathicFreak|Freak]] [[User talk:OsteopathicFreak|T ]] 00:34, 17 August 2007 (UTC)

Are you confident that an internal discussion within the AMA is notable enough to be discussed on an encyclopedia's pages? Are you certain that you are not focusing on minute details of an internal proposal written by a student subsection of a larger organization because it speaks to a particular agenda? I recognize that these questions sound accusatory, and I don't mean for them to come off like that, but I just think I need to call your attention to what I see as a trend. [[User:Antelan|Ante]][[User:Antelan|lan]] [[User_talk:Antelan|talk]] 03:21, 17 August 2007 (UTC)
I hear you.  That is an important question.  My answer is, yes.  I do think it is noteworthy.  There are dozen of published articles that discuss this topic, and whole books based largely on similar discussions.   I continue to appreciate your point of view, but I disagree that we should simply exclude relevant data because it is contentious or representative of a political process.  What is this article about if not two agendas and their relationship?     The AMA and the AOA are organizations that represent two collective agendas.  I have made continuous efforts to be fair and balanced in my presentation.  I have made a point of including sources critical of osteopathic medicine in numerous places. I look forward to continuing to work with you on a fair POV. Touro Osteopathic[[User:OsteopathicFreak|Freak]] [[User talk:OsteopathicFreak|T ]] 03:59, 17 August 2007 (UTC)

You say, &quot;What is this article about if not two agendas and their relationship?&quot; That has been my concern from the beginning. I know that you haven't simply censored critical views of osteopathy. In fact, you've manufactured controversy where none exist. Your edits would lead a reader to believe that fairly insignificant issues are of great importance (e.g., equal fees for osteo &amp; allo med students, Harvard's CME on OMM). POV is not simply AMA vs AOA. It's what's important and what isn't. A neutral POV doesn't ignore controversy and conflict where it exists, but it also doesn't overemphasize minute events. [[User:Antelan|Ante]][[User:Antelan|lan]] [[User_talk:Antelan|talk]] 04:05, 17 August 2007 (UTC)
  
The history of this conflict is real. People have written articles on these topics, including the specific details that you mention - Harvard's CME course as well as Harvard's non-CME OMM course for medical students (New Physician, Jan 2007), the changing attitude of the AMA towards osteopathic physicians and graduates, the new rules about fees is just one small example that illustrates the point.  In both these cases, I have articles to cite, but they are not on the web.  So, in the interest of verifiability I haven't cited them and have tried to steer towards web based sources whenever possible, but that has proved a bit limiting.  This conversation seems hypercritical.Touro Osteopathic[[User:OsteopathicFreak|Freak]] [[User talk:OsteopathicFreak|T ]] 04:29, 17 August 2007 (UTC)

I'll say again what I've said above: &quot;A neutral POV doesn't ignore controversy and conflict where it exists, but it also doesn't overemphasize minute events.&quot; The conflict between osteo &amp; allo is undisputedly real. The AMA president's statements on the matter? Relevant, important. The fact that Harvard has a CME on OMM? Tangentially relevant, trumped only by its thorough unimportance. Looking through the Jan 2007 New Physican, the DO article has Jay Bhatt on record saying that OMM can be used for asthma &quot;without need for medications&quot;, which, in the context of the relevant Cochrane review (&quot;Currently, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of manual therapy for patients with asthma.&quot;) strikes me as non-evidence-based fluff. Also, please let me know which page number in the Jan 2007 New Physician you're referencing that has the article on Harvard's CME course and non-CME OMM course; I couldn't find it. I don't understand how it's preferable to put the Harvard CME information in the article without citing reference because it's not web-based. [[User:Antelan|Ante]][[User:Antelan|lan]] [[User_talk:Antelan|talk]] 05:22, 17 August 2007
I was inappropriately quoted by the author. OMM can be used in asthma (without medicines should not have been said). We will try to facilitate a printed correction (jbhattbhangra)
With all due respect, I disagree.Touro Osteopathic[[User:OsteopathicFreak|Freak]] [[User talk:OsteopathicFreak|T ]] 10:47, 17 August 2007 (UTC)
Here's one article, which I hope you'll read to verify that I'm not simply making these controversies and trends up.[http://www.amsa.org/tnp/articles/article.cfx?id=342] The article on the Harvard program is in the same issue, but it's not in the online version.
Because something is subjective, doesn't mean it is not noteworthy.  Any article on religion or philosophy of any kind will be filled with reports of subjective statements.  Who are you to decide what is important?  Jay Bhatt was the President of the largest medical student organization in the world.  For that reason alone, his opinion on the topic is noteworthy, even though it may be utterly biased in your opinion.  Evidence-based medicine is one approach, but it is not the only approach.  (In fact there are large physician groups that have historically opposed E-B, another noteworthy topic.) There is no Wikipedia value that suggests only evidence-based medicine is noteworthy.Touro Osteopathic[[User:OsteopathicFreak|Freak]] [[User talk:OsteopathicFreak|T ]] 12:59, 17 August 2007 (UTC)

I have the hardcopy of the Jan 2007 New Physician, and I am still eagerly awaiting the page number of the Harvard article that you are referring to. With regards to &quot;evidence&quot; - Wikipedia is an evidence-based encyclopedia; if a claim is unverifiable, it doesn't get published here. We could verify that Dr. Bhatt made such-and-such claim, but if the contents of that claim itself are not verifiable, you'll have a very hard time getting them inserted as fact into articles.

I have no problem labeling any item you are concerned about as a &quot;claims&quot; rather than &quot;facts&quot; - if you feel this strongly that these are controversial claims.

 Antelan, &quot;malignant&quot; in this context means &quot;cancerous&quot;, not &quot;progressively worsening&quot;.  18:38, 15 August 2007 (UTC)

The parenthetical gives a fair description of the meaning of malignant in line with that of both the WP article on &quot;malignant&quot; and definitions from medical dictionaries [http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?malignant]. Cancer is already intrinsic to &quot;lung cancer&quot; so that doesn't need to be restated. I agree that by definition, malignancies are cancerous, but redirecting &quot;malignant&quot; to the broad article on cancer doesn't make that much sense. It is more likely that the reader wonders what the word &quot;malignant&quot; means. Other opinions? [[User:Antelan|Ante]][[User:Antelan|lan]] [[User_talk:Antelan|talk]] 18:47, 15 August 2007 (UTC)

The term malignant deserves its own disambiguation page - when used in reference to 'cancer' or neoplastic tissue, yes, malignant does of course refer to a malignant neoplasm. A disambiguation page would solve this issue. Also, the word 'tumour' needs to be explained further. A 'tumour' is simply a mass of tissue, not necessarily a cancerous/neoplastic one.  02:17, 28 October 2007 (UTC)

Scope banner

Is there any template for using when placing an article under the scope of this WikiProject? I couldn't find one  20:47, 18 August 2007 (UTC)

Yes! Exactly, are there without the stub categorization or with other comments? Where? Thanks  21:06, 18 August 2007 (UTC)

Hmm, you could do , but that still leaves you with ??? for quality and importance assessment, which may be just fine anyway as someone can come by later and fill them out.

Ok, that will do. If anyway later you find one which allows to insert some view as &quot;revise your sources&quot; or &quot;expand your sources&quot; or something like that, could be great, otherwise I can also combine with the existing in common use.

Psychic Surgery, again

Since my last post got no response awhile back, I'll give it ago again: psychic surgery - is it something we're concerned about? &quot;... it is performed by psychic doctors or psychic surgeons&quot; This strikes me as phrasing that makes the procedure sound medical. I tried to note that these are not medical professionals, but I was [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Psychic_surgery&amp;diff=148809435&amp;oldid=148755547 rebuffed] with this edit summary: Insert this back if you have a source that say no &quot;psychic&quot; surgeons have medical degrees If Wikiproject:Medicine is OK with this article as it stands, I'll go ahead and unwatch it, but I'd like to see what you all think. [[User:Antelan|Ante]][[User:Antelan|lan]] [[User_talk:Antelan|talk]] 07:32, 19 August 2007 (UTC)

 It is self-referential: people who claim to perform &quot;psychic surgery&quot; call themselves &quot;psychic surgeons&quot;. By using this title, these people attempt to legitimize their activities.  09:20, 19 August 2007 (UTC)

 The definition of &quot;psychic&quot; (related with non physical nature) contradicts the definitions of &quot;surgeon&quot; and &quot;doctor&quot; (both of which relate with physical practice or &quot;physicians&quot;), articles may not have contradictions of course, there is a flag for that somewhere calling the attention that the article contains contradictory definitions [[User:jennylen|Jenny]][[User_talk:Jennylen|Len]] 10:29, 19 August 2007 (UTC)

Who knows Ivan O. Godfroid ?

It's a Belgian psychiatrist. We are arguing currently in the French wiki if we should maintain him in the wiki. 

The problem is that someone said that he was well known, and said that he was truly known in the english-speaking world like in Atlanta, Houston or Miami.

And I think that, this person is one of his friend or relative. So I wonder if people, here (in the english wiki) know him and can bring argument that his work as a psychiatrist is notorious and secondary sources have been produced from his work. 

There is a strong suspection of fake. But we have no doubt that he is a psychiatrist and has made some publications. 
Most of the primary sources are not reliable because he has his own publishing house 'Socrates Promarex' and we can't find secondary 
sources about his work. And primary source seems to be Wikipedia.

 10:56, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

A search on PubMed[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez] on &quot;Godfroid I&quot; gives 18 hits. None of the titles strikes me as in themselves opening new insights to radically change psychiatry (several just debating points), and publication years of just between 1995 &amp; 2000 suggests nolonger active in research &amp; publishing (or at least in PubMed abstracted biomedical journals). Of course may or may not be notable as a psychiatrist in other ways (eg as a leading member of psychiatric organisation, as a well known TV-doc or presenter etc), but not something that I as a GP would be aware of.   17:44, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

Help with medical terms

Hi! I was hoping someone at this WikiProject could help me with this question: What is the formal medical term for getting the wind knocked out of you? The article doesn't say. — () 21:50, 26 August 2007 (UTC)

Searching the web, it appears to me that &quot;temporary paralysis of the diaphragm&quot; (already in the article) is the formal medical term. -- 20:00, 28 August 2007 (UTC)

Would you recommend moving the article to Temporary paralysis of the diaphragm, then? Or do you think there's a better term out there? — () 21:04, 29 August 2007 (UTC)

No, I would leave the article as it is.  But I would add a redirect.  I will do it.  By the way, it looks like some existing redirects need to be cleaned up.  &quot;Winded&quot; has nothing to do with temporary paralysis of the diaphragm.  Could you do that, ? -- 02:38, 30 August 2007 (UTC)

The major difficulty here is that getting the wind knocked out of you does not relate to any specific medical condition at all, and therefore there is NO specific medical term for it. Yes, I do hold a qualification. --[[User:Anthony.bradbury|Anthony.bradbury]][[User talk:Anthony.bradbury|&quot;talk&quot;]] 16:45, 4 September 2007 (UTC)

Red blood cell indices

I was just looking over MCV, MCH, and MCHC and was thinking about merging these three into one article called Red blood cell indices as they are all related stubs.  I don't think there is much potential for expansion for these articles, and I doubt anyone would object to the merge.  Whether or not these should be merged, there definitely should be an article specifically for the red blood cell indices.  As I see it, there are 3 options: a disambiguation page for the 3 articles, an overview page with  links to the 3 articles, or a merged page.  I prefer a merge, but wanted others' opinions on the matter before I took action.  I haven't put merge tags on the pages, as I'm sure not many people are watching those pages, and those who are probably are watching this page too.  -- 06:03, 29 August 2007 (UTC)

Featured article categories

If an article such as homeopathy or chiropractic (samples only) were to become , what category would it go in at ?  Right now, we have Biology and medicine; would they go there, or would another category be needed?  If so, what would it be called?  And would these kinds of articles be subject to  ? How do we define &quot;Medicine&quot; articles? [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] () 18:32, 14 September 2007 (UTC)
I think they would go under medicine (certainly better choice than Biology which would seem to me to be a more umbrella term for all animal/plant topics). Whilst these might be viewed as perhaps more strictly as &quot;Health&quot; topics, as these alternative medicine topics perhaps could be seen as distinct from being accepted as conventional medicine, that seems a little harsh and needlessly exclusive and snobish. Given this project is named &quot;medicine&quot; rather than the mouthful of &quot;human health and wellbeing&quot;, and that medicine is defined as &quot; is the science and 'art' of maintaining and/or restoring human health through the study, diagnosis, and treatment of patients&quot;, then yes these alternative and complimentary approaches (which often have blurred boundaries with conventional medicine) should be classified as Medical under FA listings.
I also feel they should follow WP:MEDMOS, which is after all a sensible article structure for describing the nature and classification of conditions (even if an alternative system of classification as occurs in many alternatives of holistic medicine or Traditional Chinese Medicine). MEDMOS issues of reliable sources is based on , ,  etc; so reporting from reliable sources of peer reviewed journals seems appropriate to expect.
[An aside note] for these approaches 2 levels of citation support is needed: 1)  uncontroversially whether the approach and its application for a particular condition is used and therefore in itself notable 2) whether or not it actual works (which requires to follow  to ) which must adhering to  of course.
I see no conflict with alternative/complimentary health topics following a good clear article structure, but clearly a herbal product article will not follow precisely the same structure as a conventional drug ( for a start would seem inappropriate in its parameters). Should some guidelines be set up to cover these variations in types-of-medicine articles ?      21:10, 14 September 2007 (UTC)
Note: this has arisen out of a dispute over the placement of Parapsychology in the  page. IMO, both of Sandy's examples would go under Medicine. There's a healer-patient relationship, regardless of whether one believes in the theory behind it. I do think it is time to take the knife to the &quot;Biology, medicine and psychology&quot; category. I know there's overlap, but there is no clean way of splitting everything. Someone just needs to make a few arbitrary decisions. Blue whales and Tourette syndrome. You wouldn't find them together in the library. ° 22:14, 14 September 2007 (UTC)

Oh, there's no rush. It's been suggested at least twice already. The last time was only 10 days ago. Splitting is inevitable as FA numbers grow. Is there not some formal classification system we can borrow, to save internal arguments? ° 22:51, 14 September 2007 (UTC)

Veganism

The veganism article is a low-importance medicine article, currently listed as a GA. The  made this suggestion:
I think the regular editors ought to approach Wikipedia:WikiProject Medicine to discuss how Veganism fits within the scope of this technical project. The aim of discussions would be to identify articles on the topic of nutrition which can support this article. Some of the more technical information that, I feel, is misplaced in this article could migrate to those articles, leaving summaries in place here. Once the relationship of Veganism with more technical articles on nutrition has been established, part of the scope check for new material would entail surveying these supporting articles.
Within the 'Health/Risk Calculation' there is something of a thematic inbalance, in that the 'Precautions' have more editorial space than &quot;Benefits&quot;. Is it true that the precautions of a vegan diet outweigh benefits, or it that editors concerned with health threats are writing at a greater level of detail. In the spirit of the previous recommendation, would it make sense to have editors of the WikiProject Medicine review the section to establish if this information is better presented elsewhere. 
Any efforts to review and consolidate material, place it in more appropriate articles, find new sources, etc, would be greatly appreciated.  11:13, 17 September 2007 (UTC)

Smoking POV

There's a dispute going on over at  where the user  is fiercly disputing the neutrality of the article by claiming that it misrepresents the health hazards of smoking in favor of the opinions of anti-smoking lobbyists. The sources cited are being challenged through fact-tagging, insertion of much vaguer wording and references to [http://www.forces.org/ FORCES International Liberty News Network].

Though I haven't studied this issue in excuciating detail, my impression is that there is a widely held consensus about the general health hazards of inhaling the smoke of incompletely combusted substances in the medical community. Could someone who knows the issue better try to help resolve this conflict? Right now, the article is protected due to edit warring.

In fact, a recent article in a local newspaper [http://www.lahontanvalleynews.com/article/20071006/Opinion/110060046 here] writes &quot;Arsenic in the water, tungsten in the air, polonium in wells, underground atomic testing to the east - all have been reported by the media. The entry for &quot;Fallon, Nevada&quot; on Wikipedia, a popular online encyclopedia, mentions the leukemia cluster. It's no wonder some outsiders unfortunately perceive our community as unhealthy.&quot;

If you have access to any further information regarding this subject which might be relevant to this article regarding this subject, such as perhaps contrary opinions and/or further research, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.  15:01, 6 October 2007 (UTC)

This has received substantial press coverage in larger newspapers (Reno Gazette Journal) over the years. I will see if I can find something useful. [[User:Antelan|Ante]][[User:Antelan|lan]] [[User_talk:Antelan|talk]] 05:09, 7 November 2007 (UTC)

Plagarism in Article: Tremor

A great deal of information in the article &quot;Tremor&quot; was apparently taken from http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/tremor/tremor.htm -- The National Institute on Neurological Disorders and Stroke.

This source is never cited.

Assessment

I've added project template to 2000+ articles by creating list from category pages and need help in assessing them. Instructions are detailed in . Unassessed articles can be found [[:Category:Unassessed-Class medicine articles|here(quality)]] and [[:Category:Unassessed-importance medicine articles|here(priority)]]. Bot generated  are available but there is a backlog of 3-4 days. Project template now has script for auto-stubbing (for bot and semibot operation). My guess is there are 10,000+ medicine related articles yet to be assessed and  I am trying to find and tag them. -- 20:49, 17 October 2007 (UTC)

It's wonderful! Thank you! Let me know if you have any kind of question.    18:44, 21 October 2007 (UTC)

 Hmm, that's an awful lot of unassessed articles. I wonder if there's an easier way for me to assign importance without editing every individual talk page....  16:29, 22 October 2007 (UTC)

I've seen a few pages tagged by the bot which looks at the stub categories and changes the unassessed-quality parameter to stub-quality.  It also adds a parameter that indicates non-human assessment.  It's not perfect, but then neither am I.  I doubt that it would be possible to do the same thing for importance.   18:28, 22 October 2007 (UTC)
Bot generated stub class rating is possible because if there is a stub tag in the articles it will automatically put them into stub category which bot can detect. Unfortunately I could not come out with any clever idea for importance scale. However  is a time saver and is highly recommended for assessment (I have left some instruction for setup ). It allows user to make assessment without going to talk page or typing anything-- 18:58, 23 October 2007 (UTC)

I've used Outriggr's script to assess about 330 articles in the last 24 hours.  It's okay, and if you're interested in chipping away at the unassessed article lists, it's a little quicker than the other approaches I've tried.  
The primary downside is mental:  if you define a default importance, and you run across something that's borderline, then you're more likely to settle on your default than to change it.  I'm working from [[:Category:Unassessed-Class medicine articles|this list]] at the moment, and am currently selecting articles which are very likely to match my default importance.  I figure that I can change the default importance rating later and go back to the others at that time.   () 21:23, 19 November 2007 (UTC)

Relationship to Veterinary Medicine

In trying to clear some of these unassessed pages, I've run across a few that I'm not sure should be WPMED at all.  Molera is the most recent one.  It's a bit of anatomy on a dog.

Induced abortion and infertility

At Infertility (in this section) and Abortion (see footnote), a user claims that there is an established causal effect between induced abortions and subsequent infertility, risk of miscarriage, and sterility.  I have found three references which state that there is not a causal link between abortion and infertility.  I would appreciate it if interested parties with appropriate backgrounds would weigh in on this issue.  Please visit  to join in the discussion.  Thank you.   18:05, 7 November 2007 (UTC)

Photouploaded's presentation of the facts is biased. I added the following to Infertility: &quot;Abortion&quot;. Photouploaded then deleted my edits. The statement is not my &quot;claim.&quot; It is supported by solid refs that I found, [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez] and [http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/243/24/2495], as well as a ref that Photouploaded found in an attempt to refute the information. Becuase of his ref, I changed &quot;Abortion&quot; to &quot;Abortion performed via Dilation and evacuation.” Photouploaded also put a “Disputed” tag on the section. 

I did not add the link at Abortion. It has been there for a long time.

Please do see the Talk. Thanks! 23:20, 7 November 2007 (UTC)

This Scientific Peer Review project can hardly be called successful. While there have been a steady but small flow of articles submitted for review, the actual reviews have been either non-existent or in no real way different from those done through the standard  process. Some editors will recall that the project was started with an enthusiastic discussion about identifying expert reviewers through an elected board. Unfortunately as time went by, it became clear there was no consensus on whether we had a board, or on how it was to be set up or on what it was supposed to do. There was also a lack of consensus on what &quot;sciences&quot; we were covering, and on many other aspects. In the end we sort of lapsed into a minimal review process which has staggered on for about 18 months. I think it is time we decided what to do about the project. Unless people can come up with a new way forward and enthusiastically implement it, I think we have to declare that this project be no longer active in any sense and that editors should ask for review at WP:PR. I am posting this on the talk pages of the major Science WikiProjects. Please feel free to publicize it elsewhere. Please add you comments at . -- 01:51, 13 November 2007 (UTC)

ATLS Page

The ATLS stub contains information I consider to be inacurate, although I might be wrong.

It states that BTLS is for EMT-Bs (going along with the first point above), where it is in fact for all EMTs (basics, intermediates/specialists, and paramedics).

Unsure about article

Hi Folks, I hope this is the right place to ask. Balano-preputial lamina is a (rather perplexing) stub that cites no sources. As far as I can tell, the phrase is used by a handful of lobbyist websites, but only two  even use the term (both, oddly, are journal letters written by a lawyer on behalf of the same lobbyist group), and neither define it.

Creation of a Pregnancy Task Force

History of the relationship of osteopathic and allopathic medicine in the United States

I initially suspected this article to be a POV fork. I have since worked with its author to resolve some of those issues, but the article still strikes me as a pro-osteopathic medicine fluff piece more suitable to a trade journal than to an encyclopedia. Even now, the original author is adding in details about osteopaths' practice rights in foreign countries (i.e., explicitly out of the scope of the title of the article in the United States). Beyond the first couple of sections with pro-osteopathic pronouncements by the AMA &amp; AMSA and the discussion of the 1960s turf wars between osteo and traditional medicine, the remainder of the material doesn't even seem to fit with the subject of the article. I would appreciate it if others would take a look at this article and suggest ways to proceed. Thanks, [[User:Antelan|Ante]][[User:Antelan|lan]] [[User_talk:Antelan|talk]] 17:52, 15 August 2007 (UTC)

Perhaps the table with the International practice rights would be better placed in the Comparison of allopathic and osteopathic medicine article, which is not US specific.  There's already an international section there. However, it is notable that traditionally allopathic organizations like the American Medical Student Association support the International Practice Rights of US-trained osteopathic physicians, something that was not true until very recently.  AMSA recently adopted a policy requesting that governments recognize US allopathic and osteopathic physicians as equals.[http://www.amsa.org/about/ppp/osteo.cfm] 
I do not want this article to be fluff. I have tried to make good citations and source every statement appropriately.  I've appreciated User Antelan's close editing assistance, and I hope the article continues to improve.  Touro Osteopathic[[User:OsteopathicFreak|Freak]] [[User talk:OsteopathicFreak|T ]] 04:42, 16 August 2007 (UTC)

My concern has largely been with the approach that has been taken with these articles. In the &quot;Comparison of...&quot; article, you say, &quot;The two largest traditionally allopathic organizations, the American Medical Association and the American Medical Student Association, both support further integration and non-discrimination in residency programs.&quot; [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_allopathic_and_osteopathic_medicine#Residency] You then cite a source that says that the AMA opposes differential FEES for osteo and allopathic medical students, which is totally distinct from the claim you made in the article. You also used this same source to make yet a different point in the &quot;History of&quot; article, which demonstrates that this was no accidental misuse of a source. It's frustrating for me to have to go through and fact check your edits. I don't mind helping you with incidental POV issues, but using the same source to back two different statements, neither of which were supported by the source, doesn't make me feel comfortable. Hence, I am asking for others interested in this topic to help me with the fact checking. [[User:Antelan|Ante]][[User:Antelan|lan]] [[User_talk:Antelan|talk]] 22:06, 16 August 2007 (UTC)

OK.  You raise a valid point.  However, I hope you will  here.  In fact, my claim is correct though poorly sourced.  The source I cited is one piece of a much broader conversation within the AMA about osteopathic/allopathic discrimination.  The &quot;fees for medical students&quot;  was one outcome of an investigation.  It's not always easy to cite a source that is readily available on the web for AMA in-house policy documents / discussion.  I'm trying.  They are published and publicly available, but not always on the web.

The conversation expanded to discuss discrimination in general, and DO membership within the AMA.  As indicated by &quot;G-635.053 AMA Membership Strategy: Osteopathic Medicine&quot;, the AMA is now actively seeking DO membership. In &quot;H-405.989 Physicians and Surgeons,&quot; the AMA demonstrates it advocates for equality between MDs&amp;DOs in regards to the use of professional titles &quot;physician&quot; and &quot;surgeon&quot;. Touro Osteopathic[[User:OsteopathicFreak|Freak]] [[User talk:OsteopathicFreak|T ]] 23:05, 16 August 2007 (UTC)

Looking through those, I see where the medical student representatives at the AMA conference introduced resolutions saying what you're suggesting, but I don't see where those became enshrined, except for the equal fees part of the resolution. [[User:Antelan|Ante]][[User:Antelan|lan]] [[User_talk:Antelan|talk]] 23:12, 16 August 2007 (UTC)
Yes.  I working on finding more documents detailing which resolutions were approved, etc.  The medical students were from AMSA, which was the main group are advocating for these new resolutions.Touro Osteopathic[[User:OsteopathicFreak|Freak]] [[User talk:OsteopathicFreak|T ]] 23:55, 16 August 2007 (UTC)

Are you confident that an internal discussion within the AMA is notable enough to be discussed on an encyclopedia's pages? Are you certain that you are not focusing on minute details of an internal proposal written by a student subsection of a larger organization because it speaks to a particular agenda? I recognize that these questions sound accusatory, and I don't mean for them to come off like that, but I just think I need to call your attention to what I see as a trend. [[User:Antelan|Ante]][[User:Antelan|lan]] [[User_talk:Antelan|talk]] 03:21, 17 August 2007 (UTC)
I hear you.  That is an important question.  My answer is, yes.  I do think it is noteworthy.  There are dozen of published articles that discuss this topic, and whole books based largely on similar discussions.   I continue to appreciate your point of view, but I disagree that we should simply exclude relevant data because it is contentious or representative of a political process.  What is this article about if not two agendas and their relationship?     The AMA and the AOA are organizations that represent two collective agendas.  I have made continuous efforts to be fair and balanced in my presentation.  I have made a point of including sources critical of osteopathic medicine in numerous places. I look forward to continuing to work with you on a fair POV. Touro Osteopathic[[User:OsteopathicFreak|Freak]] [[User talk:OsteopathicFreak|T ]] 03:59, 17 August 2007 (UTC)

You say, &quot;What is this article about if not two agendas and their relationship?&quot; That has been my concern from the beginning. I know that you haven't simply censored critical views of osteopathy. In fact, you've manufactured controversy where none exist. Your edits would lead a reader to believe that fairly insignificant issues are of great importance (e.g., equal fees for osteo &amp; allo med students, Harvard's CME on OMM). POV is not simply AMA vs AOA. It's what's important and what isn't. A neutral POV doesn't ignore controversy and conflict where it exists, but it also doesn't overemphasize minute events. [[User:Antelan|Ante]][[User:Antelan|lan]] [[User_talk:Antelan|talk]] 04:05, 17 August 2007 (UTC)
  
The history of this conflict is real. People have written articles on these topics, including the specific details that you mention - Harvard's CME course as well as Harvard's non-CME OMM course for medical students (New Physician, Jan 2007), the changing attitude of the AMA towards osteopathic physicians and graduates, the new rules about fees is just one small example that illustrates the point.  In both these cases, I have articles to cite, but they are not on the web.  So, in the interest of verifiability I haven't cited them and have tried to steer towards web based sources whenever possible, but that has proved a bit limiting.  This conversation seems hypercritical.Touro Osteopathic[[User:OsteopathicFreak|Freak]] [[User talk:OsteopathicFreak|T ]] 04:29, 17 August 2007 (UTC)

I'll say again what I've said above: &quot;A neutral POV doesn't ignore controversy and conflict where it exists, but it also doesn't overemphasize minute events.&quot; The conflict between osteo &amp; allo is undisputedly real. The AMA president's statements on the matter? Relevant, important. The fact that Harvard has a CME on OMM? Tangentially relevant, trumped only by its thorough unimportance. Looking through the Jan 2007 New Physican, the DO article has Jay Bhatt on record saying that OMM can be used for asthma &quot;without need for medications&quot;, which, in the context of the relevant Cochrane review (&quot;Currently, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of manual therapy for patients with asthma.&quot;) strikes me as non-evidence-based fluff. Also, please let me know which page number in the Jan 2007 New Physician you're referencing that has the article on Harvard's CME course and non-CME OMM course; I couldn't find it. I don't understand how it's preferable to put the Harvard CME information in the article without citing reference because it's not web-based. [[User:Antelan|Ante]][[User:Antelan|lan]] [[User_talk:Antelan|talk]] 05:22, 17 August 2007 (UTC)
With all due respect, I disagree.Touro Osteopathic[[User:OsteopathicFreak|Freak]] [[User talk:OsteopathicFreak|T ]] 10:47, 17 August 2007 (UTC)
Here's one article, which I hope you'll read to verify that I'm not simply making these controversies and trends up.[http://www.amsa.org/tnp/articles/article.cfx?id=342] The article on the Harvard program is in the same issue, but it's not in the online version.
Because something is subjective, doesn't mean it is not noteworthy.  Any article on religion or philosophy of any kind will be filled with reports of subjective statements.  Who are you to decide what is important?  Jay Bhatt was the President of the largest medical student organization in the world.  For that reason alone, his opinion on the topic is noteworthy, even though it may be utterly biased in your opinion.  Evidence-based medicine is one approach, but it is not the only approach.  (In fact there are large physician groups that have historically opposed E-B, another noteworthy topic.) There is no Wikipedia value that suggests only evidence-based medicine is noteworthy.Touro Osteopathic[[User:OsteopathicFreak|Freak]] [[User talk:OsteopathicFreak|T ]] 12:59, 17 August 2007 (UTC)

I have the hardcopy of the Jan 2007 New Physician, and I am still eagerly awaiting the page number of the Harvard article that you are referring to. With regards to &quot;evidence&quot; - Wikipedia is an evidence-based encyclopedia; if a claim is unverifiable, it doesn't get published here. We could verify that Dr. Bhatt made such-and-such claim, but if the contents of that claim itself are not verifiable, you'll have a very hard time getting them inserted as fact into articles.

I have no problem labeling any item you are concerned about as a &quot;claims&quot; rather than &quot;facts&quot; - if you feel this strongly that these are controversial claims. I do have an issue with simply deleting information because you feel it's a claim and not a fact.

 Antelan, &quot;malignant&quot; in this context means &quot;cancerous&quot;, not &quot;progressively worsening&quot;.  18:38, 15 August 2007 (UTC)

The parenthetical gives a fair description of the meaning of malignant in line with that of both the WP article on &quot;malignant&quot; and definitions from medical dictionaries [http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?malignant]. Cancer is already intrinsic to &quot;lung cancer&quot; so that doesn't need to be restated. I agree that by definition, malignancies are cancerous, but redirecting &quot;malignant&quot; to the broad article on cancer doesn't make that much sense. It is more likely that the reader wonders what the word &quot;malignant&quot; means. Other opinions? [[User:Antelan|Ante]][[User:Antelan|lan]] [[User_talk:Antelan|talk]] 18:47, 15 August 2007 (UTC)

The term malignant deserves its own disambiguation page - when used in reference to 'cancer' or neoplastic tissue, yes, malignant does of course refer to a malignant neoplasm. A disambiguation page would solve this issue. Also, the word 'tumour' needs to be explained further. A 'tumour' is simply a mass of tissue, not necessarily a cancerous/neoplastic one.  02:17, 28 October 2007 (UTC)

Psychic Surgery, again

Since my last post got no response awhile back, I'll give it ago again: psychic surgery - is it something we're concerned about? &quot;... it is performed by psychic doctors or psychic surgeons&quot; This strikes me as phrasing that makes the procedure sound medical. I tried to note that these are not medical professionals, but I was [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Psychic_surgery&amp;diff=148809435&amp;oldid=148755547 rebuffed] with this edit summary: Insert this back if you have a source that say no &quot;psychic&quot; surgeons have medical degrees If Wikiproject:Medicine is OK with this article as it stands, I'll go ahead and unwatch it, but I'd like to see what you all think. [[User:Antelan|Ante]][[User:Antelan|lan]] [[User_talk:Antelan|talk]] 07:32, 19 August 2007 (UTC)

 It is self-referential: people who claim to perform &quot;psychic surgery&quot; call themselves &quot;psychic surgeons&quot;. By using this title, these people attempt to legitimize their activities.  09:20, 19 August 2007 (UTC)

 The definition of &quot;psychic&quot; (related with non physical nature) contradicts the definitions of &quot;surgeon&quot; and &quot;doctor&quot; (both of which relate with physical practice or &quot;physicians&quot;), articles may not have contradictions of course, there is a flag for that somewhere calling the attention that the article contains contradictory definitions [[User:jennylen|Jenny]][[User_talk:Jennylen|Len]] 10:29, 19 August 2007 (UTC)

Who knows Ivan O. Godfroid ?

It's a Belgian psychiatrist. We are arguing currently in the French wiki if we should maintain him in the wiki. 

The problem is that someone said that he was well known, and said that he was truly known in the english-speaking world like in Atlanta, Houston or Miami.

And I think that, this person is one of his friend or relative. So I wonder if people, here (in the english wiki) know him and can bring argument that his work as a psychiatrist is notorious and secondary sources have been produced from his work. 

There is a strong suspection of fake. But we have no doubt that he is a psychiatrist and has made some publications. 
Most of the primary sources are not reliable because he has his own publishing house 'Socrates Promarex' and we can't find secondary 
sources about his work. And primary source seems to be Wikipedia.

 10:56, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

A search on PubMed[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez] on &quot;Godfroid I&quot; gives 18 hits. None of the titles strikes me as in themselves opening new insights to radically change psychiatry (several just debating points), and publication years of just between 1995 &amp; 2000 suggests nolonger active in research &amp; publishing (or at least in PubMed abstracted biomedical journals). Of course may or may not be notable as a psychiatrist in other ways (eg as a leading member of psychiatric organisation, as a well known TV-doc or presenter etc), but not something that I as a GP would be aware of.   17:44, 21 August 2007 (UTC)

sole (foot)

The article sole (foot) has been tagged as part of this wikiproject, as well as part of anatomy - shouldn't it be only under anatomy? There's nothing medical in the article, as it is, it's simply about the body part.  |  01:43, 14 September 2007 (UTC)

Featured article categories

If an article such as homeopathy or chiropractic (samples only) were to become , what category would it go in at ?  Right now, we have Biology and medicine; would they go there, or would another category be needed?  If so, what would it be called?  And would these kinds of articles be subject to  ? How do we define &quot;Medicine&quot; articles? [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] () 18:32, 14 September 2007 (UTC)
I think they would go under medicine (certainly better choice than Biology which would seem to me to be a more umbrella term for all animal/plant topics). Whilst these might be viewed as perhaps more strictly as &quot;Health&quot; topics, as these alternative medicine topics perhaps could be seen as distinct from being accepted as conventional medicine, that seems a little harsh and needlessly exclusive and snobish. Given this project is named &quot;medicine&quot; rather than the mouthful of &quot;human health and wellbeing&quot;, and that medicine is defined as &quot; is the science and 'art' of maintaining and/or restoring human health through the study, diagnosis, and treatment of patients&quot;, then yes these alternative and complimentary approaches (which often have blurred boundaries with conventional medicine) should be classified as Medical under FA listings.
I also feel they should follow WP:MEDMOS, which is after all a sensible article structure for describing the nature and classification of conditions (even if an alternative system of classification as occurs in many alternatives of holistic medicine or Traditional Chinese Medicine). MEDMOS issues of reliable sources is based on , ,  etc; so reporting from reliable sources of peer reviewed journals seems appropriate to expect.
[An aside note] for these approaches 2 levels of citation support is needed: 1)  uncontroversially whether the approach and its application for a particular condition is used and therefore in itself notable 2) whether or not it actual works (which requires to follow  to ) which must adhering to  of course.
I see no conflict with alternative/complimentary health topics following a good clear article structure, but clearly a herbal product article will not follow precisely the same structure as a conventional drug ( for a start would seem inappropriate in its parameters). Should some guidelines be set up to cover these variations in types-of-medicine articles ?      21:10, 14 September 2007 (UTC)
Note: this has arisen out of a dispute over the placement of Parapsychology in the  page. IMO, both of Sandy's examples would go under Medicine. There's a healer-patient relationship, regardless of whether one believes in the theory behind it. I do think it is time to take the knife to the &quot;Biology, medicine and psychology&quot; category. I know there's overlap, but there is no clean way of splitting everything. Someone just needs to make a few arbitrary decisions. Blue whales and Tourette syndrome. You wouldn't find them together in the library. ° 22:14, 14 September 2007 (UTC)
I don't know if we should wait for parapsychology to shake out before attacking that, or if it's better to shake it all up at once.  At least following the discussion on the talk page of  would be good.  [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] () 22:20, 14 September 2007 (UTC)
Oh, there's no rush. It's been suggested at least twice already. The last time was only 10 days ago. Splitting is inevitable as FA numbers grow. Is there not some formal classification system we can borrow, to save internal arguments? ° 22:51, 14 September 2007 (UTC)

Needs discussing.    00:49, 17 September 2007 (UTC)

Veganism

The veganism article is a low-importance medicine article, currently listed as a GA. The  made this suggestion:
I think the regular editors ought to approach Wikipedia:WikiProject Medicine to discuss how Veganism fits within the scope of this technical project. The aim of discussions would be to identify articles on the topic of nutrition which can support this article. Some of the more technical information that, I feel, is misplaced in this article could migrate to those articles, leaving summaries in place here. Once the relationship of Veganism with more technical articles on nutrition has been established, part of the scope check for new material would entail surveying these supporting articles.
Within the 'Health/Risk Calculation' there is something of a thematic inbalance, in that the 'Precautions' have more editorial space than &quot;Benefits&quot;. Is it true that the precautions of a vegan diet outweigh benefits, or it that editors concerned with health threats are writing at a greater level of detail. In the spirit of the previous recommendation, would it make sense to have editors of the WikiProject Medicine review the section to establish if this information is better presented elsewhere. 
Any efforts to review and consolidate material, place it in more appropriate articles, find new sources, etc, would be greatly appreciated.  11:13, 17 September 2007 (UTC)

Medical research related to low-carbohydrate diets

Came across this article recently, which seems to have been largely created by  as an annotated list of some papers related to Low-carbohydrate diets.  As an outsider to what I'm sure is a heated debate, IMO it feels like this stuff should be spread among the History and References sections of the Lcd article.  But I figured I'd take the coward's way out - tag it to this Project and point it out to you guys to debate :-) No doubt that  might be considered a factor, but I'm instinctively wary of article names that are that long.....  18:48, 23 September 2007 (UTC)

Smoking POV

There's a dispute going on over at  where the user  is fiercly disputing the neutrality of the article by claiming that it misrepresents the health hazards of smoking in favor of the opinions of anti-smoking lobbyists. The sources cited are being challenged through fact-tagging, insertion of much vaguer wording and references to [http://www.forces.org/ FORCES International Liberty News Network].

Though I haven't studied this issue in excuciating detail, my impression is that there is a widely held consensus about the general health hazards of inhaling the smoke of incompletely combusted substances in the medical community. Could someone who knows the issue better try to help resolve this conflict? Right now, the article is protected due to edit warring.

Fallon, Nevada

It has been mentioned that the content of the Cancer Cluster section of this article seems to rely entirely on one source. In fact, a recent article in a local newspaper [http://www.lahontanvalleynews.com/article/20071006/Opinion/110060046 here] writes &quot;Arsenic in the water, tungsten in the air, polonium in wells, underground atomic testing to the east - all have been reported by the media. The entry for &quot;Fallon, Nevada&quot; on Wikipedia, a popular online encyclopedia, mentions the leukemia cluster.

Bot generated  are available but there is a backlog of 3-4 days. Project template now has script for auto-stubbing (for bot and semibot operation). My guess is there are 10,000+ medicine related articles yet to be assessed and  I am trying to find and tag them. -- 20:49, 17 October 2007 (UTC)

It's wonderful! Thank you! Let me know if you have any kind of question.    18:44, 21 October 2007 (UTC)

 Hmm, that's an awful lot of unassessed articles. I wonder if there's an easier way for me to assign importance without editing every individual talk page....  16:29, 22 October 2007 (UTC)

I've seen a few pages tagged by the bot which looks at the stub categories and changes the unassessed-quality parameter to stub-quality.  It also adds a parameter that indicates non-human assessment.  It's not perfect, but then neither am I.  I doubt that it would be possible to do the same thing for importance.   18:28, 22 October 2007 (UTC)
Bot generated stub class rating is possible because if there is a stub tag in the articles it will automatically put them into stub category which bot can detect. Unfortunately I could not come out with any clever idea for importance scale. However  is a time saver and is highly recommended for assessment (I have left some instruction for setup ). It allows user to make assessment without going to talk page or typing anything-- 18:58, 23 October 2007 (UTC)

I've used Outriggr's script to assess about 330 articles in the last 24 hours.  It's okay, and if you're interested in chipping away at the unassessed article lists, it's a little quicker than the other approaches I've tried.  
The primary downside is mental:  if you define a default importance, and you run across something that's borderline, then you're more likely to settle on your default than to change it.  I'm working from [[:Category:Unassessed-Class medicine articles|this list]] at the moment, and am currently selecting articles which are very likely to match my default importance.  I figure that I can change the default importance rating later and go back to the others at that time.   () 21:23, 19 November 2007 (UTC)

Photouploaded's presentation of the facts is biased. I added the following to Infertility: &quot;Abortion&quot;. Photouploaded then deleted my edits.

Becuase of his ref, I changed &quot;Abortion&quot; to &quot;Abortion performed via Dilation and evacuation.” Photouploaded also put a “Disputed” tag on the section.

This Scientific Peer Review project can hardly be called successful. While there have been a steady but small flow of articles submitted for review, the actual reviews have been either non-existent or in no real way different from those done through the standard  process. Some editors will recall that the project was started with an enthusiastic discussion about identifying expert reviewers through an elected board. Unfortunately as time went by, it became clear there was no consensus on whether we had a board, or on how it was to be set up or on what it was supposed to do. There was also a lack of consensus on what &quot;sciences&quot; we were covering, and on many other aspects. In the end we sort of lapsed into a minimal review process which has staggered on for about 18 months. I think it is time we decided what to do about the project. Unless people can come up with a new way forward and enthusiastically implement it, I think we have to declare that this project be no longer active in any sense and that editors should ask for review at WP:PR.

merging Blood sugar and Blood glucose monitoring

I found these two articles while trying to unravel a disambig on schizophrenia - surely this is a no-brainer for a merge but I thought listing it here was prudent.cheers,   ( · ) 02:17, 26 November 2007 (UTC)

Whilst I agree a risk of overlap, one is a physiological parameter and the other is specifically a disease monitoring proceedure (could be called &quot;diabetes control by the close monitoring of blood sugar levels&quot; except that is not what it is known by), similarly blood pressure discusses what that is and its normal physiological control, whilst hypertension discusses monitoring of abnormal blood pressure.    02:37, 26 November 2007 (UTC)

Yeah, I suppose invoking 'WP ain't paper' applies here in this case. Anyway, I'll go with consensus.cheers,   ( · ) 05:09, 26 November 2007 (UTC)

Merge. One is a function of the other. Can't have monitoring without blood sugar. I think article length would be the only reason to maintain two articles. &quot;Blood glucose monitoring&quot; should be about the technical aspects (fingerprick, electronic device). All content related to the management of diabetes belongs in diabetes management, because it stems directly from the concept of glycaemic control.  |  06:53, 26 November 2007 (UTC)

Ummm...sort of - but only really in glycaemic index and hyper- and hypo-; agree with merging these two. cheers,   ( · ) 13:00, 27 November 2007 (UTC)
*Yes merge these two. Glycaemia as would be spelt in BrE is real (hence hyperglycaemia, hypoglycaemia, glycaemic control)   10:33, 27 November 2007 (UTC)
 &quot;Glycemic&quot; I accept; it's an adjective. However &quot;glycemia&quot; would appear to mean &quot;the presence of glucose in the blood&quot;. This is a pointless term.  () 13:25, 27 November 2007 (UTC)

Glycemia seems to be medical shorthand for abnormal blood glucose, similar to the shorthand use of hydramnios for abnormal amniotic fluid which unfortunately leaves the reader guessing &quot;does this refer to polyhydramnios or to oligohydramnios?!&quot;  Back to blood sugar and related pages.  I suspect a general search may be needed to find additional pages that may need to be merged or edited to remove significant overlap.  In my experience, when there is one bad pair like blood sugar and glycemia, there are other pages too.-- () 01:56, 28 November 2007 (UTC)

Image labeling

Hello, I would like to request that someone please add a description to [[:Image:Cn3nucleus.png]], explaining what kind of section this is (coronal?), and roughly where in the head those structures are. The picture is used in several articles on brain anatomy. Thanks,  () 01:22, 27 November 2007 (UTC)
Take a look at mesencephalon, and imagine a section taken through the &quot;7&quot; in the second photograph. It's a near duplicate of Image:Midbrainsuperiorcolliculus.png. -- () 03:03, 27 November 2007 (UTC)

MCOTW and open tasks

After rather intensive discussion on , I can only conclude that MCOTW in its present form needs an overhaul. Rather than having articles run for 1 or 2 weeks, there are calls for a more informal but equally collaborative process. Some feel that articles should be collaborated on for 4 weeks. Others feel that articles can be &quot;worked on&quot; simultaneously as long as one or two enthusiastic editors take the lead (as is commonly the case anyway).  |  23:47, 22 November 2007 (UTC)

I would like to propose the following:
* MCOTW becomes the &quot;article collaboration&quot; page.
*: Yes.-- () 17:43, 23 November 2007 (UTC)
*:Great!    12:59, 24 November 2007 (UTC)
* Any user can nominate an article, outline the problems, and propose changes.
*:Change &quot;user&quot; to &quot;editor&quot; (clarify). -- () 17:43, 23 November 2007 (UTC)
*::What do you mean by &quot;editor&quot;? Someone who is already involved with the WikiProject, or with the article in question?  |  21:27, 24 November 2007 (UTC)
*:::By &quot;editor&quot; I mean anyone who cares to edit Wikipedia. KISS -- () 23:13, 24 November 2007 (UTC) 
*::Fine; that was the arrangement on MCOTW as well. I thought &quot;user&quot; already implied that.  |  06:39, 25 November 2007 (UTC)
*:It becomes easier to track the changes like that.    12:59, 24 November 2007 (UTC)
*: Change &quot;nominate&quot; to &quot;request&quot;.  Just ask for help.  KISS. -- () 23:13, 24 November 2007 (UTC)
*::On MCOTW we worked with nominations. I see no reason to change this. In effect it means the same anyway.  |  06:43, 25 November 2007 (UTC)
* Either the nominating editor or any other editor can register as either &quot;responsible editor&quot; or &quot;collaborating editor&quot;. This is an indication that this editor feels (s)he is able to either take charge of the improvements or offer help of some sort.
*:No. This will derail energy into discussing/arguing about who is qualified. -- () 17:43, 23 November 2007 (UTC)
*::This proposal merely follows from observations made on . Do you have an alternative?  |  21:27, 24 November 2007 (UTC)
*:::Yes.  In my experience, adding bureaucracy never increases participation. Let's have a place where editors can request help.  Let's not designate &quot;responsible&quot; editors or anything of the kind. -- () 23:13, 24 November 2007 (UTC) 
*::Requesting help on simple matters can be done on this talkpage effectively. For collaboration some members of CLINMED have long felt that unless one editor takes the lead, collaborations do often not achieve the desired result. I wish you could address those views; I think the very slight increase in &quot;bureaucracy&quot; is easily matched by an increase in actual collaborative work.  |  06:39, 25 November 2007 (UTC)
*:No! We would need a &quot;section chief editor&quot; who would be responsible for the whole collaboration.    12:59, 24 November 2007 (UTC)
*::Isn't that the same thing? What I think we need is one or two editors per article who commit themselves to monitoring the progress on a collaboration.  |  21:27, 24 November 2007 (UTC)
*:::Why monitor anything? -- () 23:13, 24 November 2007 (UTC)
* Nominated articles are reviewed after 2 weeks by the nominating editor. If the needed changes have been made, the article can be removed. Alternatively, the objectives can be updated. If there is no action on an article at all, it will be removed after 3 weeks.
*:Suggestion. Simply archive the older requests as the list gets long, without making any judgements. -- () 17:43, 23 November 2007 (UTC)
*:Bad idea. We removed similar guidelines from the MCOTW to avoid these additional tasks. We won't have as many nominations as you think. It will work without these reviews.    12:59, 24 November 2007 (UTC)
*::Some collaborations need more time than others. What I suggest is that the &quot;overseeing editors&quot; review the need for intensive collaboration after a set period of time. If no such review takes place, we need to be able to mark a collaboration as inactive.  |  21:27, 24 November 2007 (UTC)
*:::People will collaborate or not, as they like.  I see no need for &quot;overseeing editors&quot;. -- () 23:13, 24 November 2007 (UTC)
* Main aims of collaboration are: (1) Important topics possibly ready for GA or FA status, or (2) topics that are broken and need sourcing/NPOV.
* Myself and probably  (or other volunteers...) will monitor the collaboration page, but apart from removal after inactivity our role is supervisory rather than executive.
*:Suggestion.  Rather than supervisory, consider your role to be clerical. -- () 17:43, 23 November 2007 (UTC)
*::Removal of old collaborations is the main clerical task. I think the supervisory role is definitely needed, and may consist of asking editors to get involved in certain articles if needed.  |  21:27, 24 November 2007 (UTC)

Comments
Please let me know your considerations here. After the somewhat disappointing experiences on meningitis and allergy I'm convinced that the system I've outlined above will make for better medicine articles.  |  23:47, 22 November 2007 (UTC)

Probably better to have more than one article to focus on, as only a percentages of editors would be interested or specialised in any one given topic. Much of the above seems to replace or duplicate what normally is discussed on an articles talk page. I was just thinking how disappointing the MCOTW was too.  () 00:36, 23 November 2007 (UTC)

Collaborations will definitely be simultaneous. The presence of an article on the &quot;collaboration list&quot; simply means that an article has been flagged for collaborative work. The sky is the limit, although in practice we should try to limit the number of active collaborations to 5-6, if at all possible.  |  01:26, 23 November 2007 (UTC)

I don't know whether it will help. It seems to me that working on multiple articles increases the odds that any given person will know something about one of them, but will probably decrease the attention that any given article will get.  I'm certainly willing to go along with whatever you want to try, though.  () 07:42, 23 November 2007 (UTC)

That is a compromise we need to make. It is obvious that concentrated effort on one particular article is not presently working.  |  21:27, 24 November 2007 (UTC)

One model to consider following is Wiktionary's [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Requests_for_verification requests for verification] page. I really like the bottom-up, unsupervised, collective approach. In fact, we could use a similar approach here, to flag medical articles that, for example, need references to medical literature (as opposed to websites). -- () 17:55, 23 November 2007 (UTC)

You are completely right. What I am proposing is closer to a noticeboard of articles where input is needed. This might be FA/GA status, but could equally be NPOV, sourcing, cleanup, restructuring or removal of tedious jargon.  |  21:27, 24 November 2007 (UTC)

Okay, let's make a list of the kinds of contributions (tasks) we might want to request:
*:) 23:24, 24 November 2007 (UTC) 

#wikify:  inline links in text, See also, External links, categories, templates, interwiki links
#verify facts
#find sources
#find images
#resolve disputes, address all issues on talk page
#fix writing (hard):  NPOV, tone, style; structure of sentences, paragraphs, sections, articles
#fix writing (easy):  spelling, grammar, punctuation, formatting
#revert vandalism
*:(unsigned because this should be a collective list)

We might request a lot more. In the past, MCOTW produced featured articles.  |  06:39, 25 November 2007 (UTC)

*I'm a little confused. Are you suggesting that a cyclic (weekly/monthly) article improvement drive should be scrapped in favour of a noticeboard that is regularly updated, with &quot;spent&quot; collaborations removed by the nominator?
*The idea of someone &quot;responsible&quot; seems to be disliked by two people above. It is not meant to increase bureaucracy or cause disputes over who is in charge (could be two people). It comes from analysis of what actually happens when an article is collaboratively improved and who author's FA/GA articles. This person shouldn't be regarded as superior to any other editor. As the word &quot;responsible&quot; suggests, they should help identify what needs done and guide, if requested, volunteer editors towards areas they can help with. Also, and very importantly I think, they should individually thank the collaborators for their input. ° 10:27, 25 November 2007 (UTC)
*::Thank you for your input, .  (See the problem?) -- () 16:53, 25 November 2007 (UTC)

I was indeed suggesting that the cyclic improvement drive was not going to work, because topics are rather specialised. Rather, we will have a number of articles simultaneously marked for improvement. As Una Smith and myself have indicated, articles can be nominated for various reasons, from GA/FA status to sources/NPOV.

My original suggestion was that nominators should monitor progress on articles they have nominated, and Berci &amp; myself would only remove articles if the nominator does not do that. The nominator is not necessarily the same person as the &quot;responsible editor&quot; I was thinking about.

EXAMPLE: I am not good at psychopharmacology, but I can tell a rubbish psychopharmacology from a good one. I would therefore be able to nominate the article for improvement. Suddenly and miraculously, professor Tricyclic from Brno University (with no drug company links) would agree to take charge of the improvement. Several other editors, e.g. someone with an interest in anticonvulsants and a paediatrician, also register their interest. Some good edits take place; after a while, I review the progress and agree with Prof Tricyclic that some more work is needed. One week later, the article has been improved, and a consensus decision is made between nominator and editor to remove the psychopharmacology article.

I know that in this model some things sound less ideal than others, but on the whole I think it is a format that is most likely to achieve results. Needless to say, it is down to the numbers in some aspects.  |  12:41, 25 November 2007 (UTC)

In the past, MCOTW produced featured articles.  Please recall goal, objective, strategy, tactic, task.  GA or FA article quality is a goal, or perhaps an objective toward some other, larger goal.  MCOTW (a tactic) was intended to recruit editors (a strategy) to do work (tasks), but we all agree the MCOTW tactic does not work well.  (I tried it myself, I did not like the result, and I want nothing more to do with it.)  There are many possible tactics.  I suggest we adopt a new tactic that focuses attention on identifying what tasks are really needed at a given time.  It is helpful to focus on tasks because some (many) editors specialize in certain tasks.  Information about an article's importance and current quality would be useful statements to make when requesting help with specific tasks. -- () 16:53, 25 November 2007 (UTC)

The problem with a &quot;list of open tasks&quot; is that it doesn't encourage anyone to actually take a lead. What I've been trying to put forward is a system where more complex tasks are coordinated by a named editor. I'm still not sure why you think this is bad (apart from instruction creep), but given the paucity of responses from other editors my proposal is likely to fail.
A simpler solution is to broaden the scope of MCOTW (more in line with your suggestions) as a noticeboard for pending tasks on medical articles. But we need a way to monitor progress on articles, otherwise the noticeboard is likely to get overloaded with requests that don't get handled by anyone. I'll wait (again) for other editors to offer their comments.  |  07:22, 26 November 2007 (UTC)

Um, were you all aware that WPMED already has a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Medicine#List_of_open_tasks List of open tasks]?  I'm willing to hear arguments about deleting MCOTW entirely and only using the list of open tasks, but I see absolutely no value in have two separate lists of open tasks.   () 20:02, 26 November 2007 (UTC)

I thought  was intended for editors (those named in the table) to claim certain articles, to discourage others from editing them.  That's why the editor's name comes first.  Know what I mean?  If the intent of the page is to request help, then the page name should be &quot;Requests for editorial help&quot; or something like that. -- () 19:53, 28 November 2007 (UTC)

My final point above concerns the merge of MCOTW and open tasks, and the fact that present open tasks should be grandfathered into the new system. As I was trying to explain, lists of open tasks alone do not achieve enough because there is no guarantee that anyone will actually focus on that task.  |  23:20, 26 November 2007 (UTC)

WPMED tagging:  categories?

I have been working my way through the several thousand WPMED-tagged articles that Countincr found a while ago.  Today I noticed that  has recently tagged a bunch of categories as being part of the WPMED project.  See [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Unassessed-Class_medicine_articles&amp;from=People this list] for a handful of examples.  

Do you all want categories to be tagged with the WPMED template?  My current thought is that the WPMED template belongs only on articles, but I'm open to comments.  () 05:20, 27 November 2007 (UTC)

I too have been tagging template and category pages for WPMED.  Those pages are part of our infrastructure. -- () 05:55, 27 November 2007 (UTC)

Yeah, it's pretty common to have a cat or template class for a WikiProject, common enough that when I simply marked them as class= (which would have pointed each out as belonging to WikiProject Medicine's long list of unclassed articles, etc.), someone else chastised me for not calling each of them class=cat in the first place. Jeepers. Anyway, AutoWikiBrowser tells me that there are, as of this writing, 2,663 articles identified as Unassessed-Class medicine articles, and that's obviously not all of them. For one thing, you have a lot of unassessed categories that haven't even been identified as unassessed.  () 06:21, 27 November 2007 (UTC)

We can tag importance=NA;  is NA defined also for class? -- () 15:09, 27 November 2007 (UTC)

We should decide now how to classify pages, and which need importances.  For classifications, I think that we should use specifics (&quot;list,&quot; &quot;cat,&quot; &quot;template,&quot; etc), rather than the generic &quot;NA.&quot;  For importances, categories and templates could automatically be classified as &quot;NA,&quot; and ignore the importance parameter given.  Lists probably should be given an importance.  Also, NA importance could mean either &quot;non-article&quot; or &quot;not-applicable.&quot;  It does not mean no importance.  There are a few articles that have an importance of NA, which is inappropriate.  -- 21:33, 27 November 2007 (UTC)

Putting this template on categories looks a little weird to me because the template actually says, &quot;This article is within the scope of WikiProject Medicine.&quot;  

On the broader question, what do you think the major point behind the tag is?  Is it primarily a stamp of ownership (in which case, including categories may be sensible)?  Is it a way of making all the medicine-related articles easy for a reader to find and browse?  Is it a way to prioritize articles for improving (in which case, including categories may be irrelevant)?   () 17:41, 27 November 2007 (UTC)

I think tagging pages is done for all of the reasons you just stated.  Tagging categories would let a potential editor know that WikiProject Medicine is involved in the maintenance of the category, and not to make big changes without consulting us here.  Tagging articles lets us categorize them so we know what needs to be worked on.  The wording on the template can be changed from &quot;article&quot; to &quot;page&quot; if you think it is appropriate, or it could conditionally display &quot;page&quot; if the page either has a non-article classification or is not in the main namespace.  -- 21:33, 27 November 2007 (UTC)

&quot;Tagging categories would let a potential editor know that WikiProject Medicine is involved in the maintenance of the category, and not to make big changes without consulting us here.&quot;  Please don't even think that thought!  I tag pages to make it just a little easier for me and others to find them again.  I certainly do not expect (nor want!) to be consulted before another editor does work.  Please do nothing to discourage or inhibit editors who want to make big changes.-- () 02:04, 28 November 2007 (UTC)

Yes, NA is available for class.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Medicine/Assessment#Quality_assessment]:
* &quot;NA (for pages, such as portals or project pages, where assessment is unnecessary; adds pages to Category:NA-Class medicine articles). This means &quot;non-article&quot;, NOT non-applicable.&quot;
List, dab, and template are already activated.   () 07:18, 28 November 2007 (UTC)
What about activating cat? Technically NA can apply, but cat is better for organizational purposes and consistent with many other WikiProjects.  () 10:19, 28 November 2007 (UTC)
I'll add the cat class to  and the assessment page.  But first, do you think the importance of categories should be automatically set to NA by the template (and ignore any importance specified on the category talk pages)?  This would be my suggestion.  -- 17:24, 28 November 2007 (UTC)

Yes. -- () 19:41, 28 November 2007 (UTC)

Category-Class has been added to  and is now included at .  I also went through  and sorted them appropriately.  -- 04:50, 29 November 2007 (UTC)

Rotavirus

Portal should contain clear links to specialities/ subspecialties

Stop me if this has bee discussed before, but I feel that there should be clear links on the portal to all the medical specialities, I think that would be a nice way to organize the information. So then after clicking on Urology for example, one may have several urology topics to choose from. I suppose eventually  each specialty could have it's won portal/ front page. Is this a good way to think about it?

 () 09:53, 30 November 2007 (UTC)

My sense is that most encyclopedia readers don't access information by specialty. Also, access by specialty is provided via the category pages.  , what do you have in mind to improve on this?  -- 17:00, 30 November 2007 (UTC)

Project page redesign

With the merge of the medicine, preclinical medicine and clinical medicine wikiprojects, this might be a good moment to redesign the project page to be more useful.

Drug abuse mess

There is a mess in articles concerning drug abuse. For instance, there is an article on Addiction, one on Drug addiction, one on Substance abuse and one on Drug abuse, all saying much the same thing. We need to integrate them in order not to confuse readers where they differ from each other.

First, we need to define from what definitions of drug abuse to make the layout of the articles. For instance, some definitions include Physical dependence in Drug addiction and some do not, and it's important to define what standpoint Wikipedia has in order to organize the articles. The other standpoints can still be presented within the articles.

The following definitions of drug abuse are given:
*Drug addiction#Medical definitions
*Substance abuse#Definitions
*Addiction#Terminology and usage
*Drug_abuse#Medical_definitions

There might be more of them, so please fill them in if you find any.

An outline
Personally, I prefer the layout presented e.g. in Drug addiction (the 2001 definitions), differing the following terms (and articles):
*addiction
*physical dependence
*tolerance
*pseudoaddiction

The article Addiction presents some other aspects than Drug addiction, and should just contain a large summary of Drug addiction and a link to Drug addiction. On the other hand, Substance abuse and Drug abuse really don't contribute with anything more than terminology, and should also be merged. All these terminology and definitions can then be merged into one section in Drug addiction (probably needing a separate article forked from it). Pseudoaddiction, although by definition distinct, might also be a section in Drug addiction, since there isn't much about that subject yet.

Thus, the layout is following:
*Addiction
**drug addiction/Drug abuse/Substance abuse
***alcoholism etc.
*physical dependence/Drug dependence
*drug tolerance
*pseudoaddiction

I further suggest a Template is created with the definitions and differences, and then placed in each article.  () 08:44, 29 November 2007 (UTC)

Support reclassification of articles according to a widely agreed standard.
The drug abuse articles also do a good job of whitewashing abuse as &quot;recreational use&quot;. Obviously, if something is banned by law it becomes abuse. If something legal has possible health risks, it may be recreational use, but if something has definite health risks I think the term &quot;abuse&quot; should be used just the same.  |  10:38, 29 November 2007 (UTC)
The original outline that I proposed was based on the Handbook of the Medical Consequences of Alcohol and Drug Abuse  (new 2008 edition is on its way.)  You can view it .  Drug abuse was not supposed to focus on addiction or substance abuse in particular, but rather pharmacology, toxicology, and neuropsychological effects.  Substance abuse was supposed to discuss management and treatment.  Unfortunately, a persistent troll (and a few new ones on substance abuse) caused quite a fuss, and I left the article(s) with little accomplished.  Both the articles on drug abuse and substance abuse focus on issues other than addiction and should not be merged. — |  12:51, 29 November 2007 (UTC)

These pages do need some reorganization to reduce duplicated content and ensure full coverage of the topics(s).  However, Wikipedia is not the place in which to take a stand; that would be POV.  A navigation template is a good idea.  I see illegal use and abusive use as two different topics, and IMO the fact that they can co-occur is not a valid reason to conflate the two topics.  — () 15:21, 29 November 2007 (UTC)

I never suggested that illegal and &quot;abusive use&quot; were identical. But both are best described as &quot;abuse&quot; rather than the nonsensical term &quot;recreational use&quot;. If you have a better word for either of them, please advise.  |  18:00, 29 November 2007 (UTC)

The layout of that handbook is a good one, but the articles might not contain what the corresponding chapters described. Yet, it's a guide. With that Substance abuse article, it might just need to be renamed &quot;Management of drug abuse&quot;, if that's what it's supposed to contain.  () 16:54, 29 November 2007 (UTC)
The Handbook of Psychotrophic Drugs (13th Revised Edition) had some reallly good information, but I don't have the book on hand.  I'm going to try and take another look when I have a chance.  Also, I recommend taking a look at how the print edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica treats the subject.  I'm not understanding why there is a problem with the terms &quot;drug abuse&quot; and  &quot;substance abuse&quot;, which continue to appear in current use on PubMed.  The problem as I see it, is that &quot;drug abuse&quot; and &quot;substance abuse&quot; continue to be used interchangeably, with politically correct authors trying to use &quot;substance misuse&quot;, etc.  Frankly, the entire literature on the subject is one big laughing joke and I'm pretty close to giving up on this and letting people do what they like. — |  01:30, 30 November 2007 (UTC)

Outline, version 2
All in all Drug abuse seems to be the highest article, not in importance in any way, but as the article to fork other articles from. Then future contributors know where to attach further information regarding drug abuse, not really fitting into more specialized subjects.

Regarding Recreational drug use vs. Drug abuse, all standpoints are probably sufficiently explained in all those definitions. Yet, it's a good idea to have a separate section e.g. &quot;Recreational use vs abuse&quot; in the article, with link to Recreational drug use.

It's much the same thing with illegal drug use vs. drug abuse. I think the article politics of drug abuse serves that purpose. To make the distinction even more clear, a section e.g. consitent with the recreational one, e.g. &quot; Illegal use vs. drug abuse &quot; may be created.

So, with this in mind, a proper outline would be:
*Addiction
**Drug addiction
** (problem gamling etc.)

*Drug abuse
**Drug abuse-related definitions (facilitating linking from the other articles as well)
***Recreational use vs. drug abuse
***Illegal use vs. drug abuse
**Drug addiction
***pseudoaddiction
**physical dependence
**drug tolerance
**Substance abuse renamed to Management and treatment of Drug abuse
**alcoholism etc. 

 () 07:13, 30 November 2007 (UTC)
I don't see a need to rename &quot;substance abuse&quot; as that is the name the DSM IV uses.  See similar articles like alcohol dependence. — |  04:45, 1 December 2007 (UTC)

Sure it is a term often used, and well worth describing in Definitions. Yet, I think it is too similar to Drug abuse to be an own artice. The only reasonable alternative I see is thus to have Drug abuse renamed and filled with Management and treatment of Drug abuse, and Substance abuse taking its place.  05:27, 1 December 2007 (UTC)
The substance abuse definition is the one used by the American Psychiatric Association in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition [http://books.google.com/books?id=9_pQHmDFMxgC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;lpg=PA94&amp;dq=305.90+substance+abuse&amp;source=web&amp;ots=bcyMd9Z13z&amp;sig=2Hb4o28LRHtGTU-BwVwEgvu2WKo#PPA94,M1] as the article makes clear.  The individual substance abuse definitions (Alcohol abuse, etc.) are a subset.  The drug abuse definitions are altogether different, as are the effects of drug abuse on the body, which do not concern the psychological topic.   The section on &quot;Approaches to managing drug abuse&quot; is supposed to be a summary of substance abuse and related articles. — |  07:09, 1 December 2007 (UTC)

My dream of haveing the drug abuse-related articles organized well enough to avail readers an overview of them fades away with every definition I hear. Nevertheless, I made a navigation template to Drug abuse, Substance abuse and Drug addiction, which might suffice for now. The section on &quot;Approaches to managing drug abuse&quot; might well be, if supplied with corresponding info from the other articles, big enough to in addition be forked of as an own article, leaving a summary. Then, all other articles may also contain a link and a summary to that article, just as I think would be best with all those definitions-sections as well. I think it would be the best, because even if drug addiction specifically is treated differently as drug abuse in general, an approach including them all is the best management.  16:10, 1 December 2007 (UTC)
Another solution is to turn drug abuse into a dab page. — |  03:02, 2 December 2007 (UTC)

Aase-Smith

To anyone who knows anything about Aase-Smith:  Would you please look at this stub?  It's the bit about &quot;red blood cells (anemia), which help fight infection&quot; that has me doubting the accuracy of the text.  03:52, 2 December 2007 (UTC)

I know nothing, but I can look things up.  Aase-Smith is a redirect to Aase-Smith syndrome, which needs to be merged with (or disentangled from) Aase syndrome and perhaps also Diamond Blackfan anemia.  On PubMed, searching for &quot;Aase syndrome&quot; gets several hundred hits to Diamond Blackfan anemia, while searching for &quot;Aase-Smith syndrome&quot; gets several hundred other hits, many with &quot;Aase-Smith syndrome&quot; in the title. -- 05:23, 2 December 2007 (UTC)

Conflict of interest and Wiki sister projects

I hope everyone will please read through [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest/Noticeboard#Anti-stuttering_devices.2C_Stuttering this entire discussion] as it relates to the use of Wiki sister projects to further a conflict of interest.  I suggest we need to be much more vigilant about links to Wiki sister projects; perhaps it was only me, but it has never occurred to me before that they needed to be checked according to the same criterion we'd use for any other external link. It's also worth noting that Slp1 was all alone on this issue until I happened to bring this article to FAR, at which point the issues came to the light of day before a broader audience.

Merge of Medical speciality, Medical specialist, Physician specialty codes and Surgical specialties

The following discussion is from :

Why not merge the Physician specialties and Medical specialties? They include the same list - just that Physician specialties links to their codes.  () 13:08, 8 December 2007 (UTC)

If you are going to be merging these articles, I recommend merging all of the articles listed on the left side of the template.  There is a lot of duplicated content between Physician specialties, Medical specialty, Surgical specialties, and Medical specialist.  I recommend creating one big table of the specialties, with each row containing the specialty, surgical or medical, specialty code, annual salary, parent specialty (if sub-specialty), and a brief description of the field.  You might want to place  and  tags on the pages and move this discussion to one of these 4 articles' talk pages.  -- 15:46, 8 December 2007 (UTC)

Thus, Medical speciality, Medical specialist, Physician specialty codes and Surgical specialties probably need to be merged. However, I think Surgical specialties may remain as a subarticle to that entity. Physician specialty codes may also be, because it has it in alphabetical order - something which probably will be lost, because I think several tables are needed, to avail headers to distinguish major groups, as in Table of muscles.  () 17:42, 8 December 2007 (UTC)

Multiple tables can be avoided by using sortable tables (see List of medical schools in the United States for an example).  The default sorting would be on the specialty name, and the specialty codes could be alphabetized by clicking in the column heading.  The reason I would want a column solely for &quot;medical&quot; or &quot;surgical&quot; would be so that the specialties could be displayed in order, first sorted by medical or surgical, and secondarily by specialty name (similar to the degree column in List of medical schools in the United States).  If your only reason to separate medical and surgical is for ease of browsing, a sortable table should take care of your concern.  -- 18:21, 8 December 2007 (UTC)

Is the content of Physician specialty codes even encyclopedic? I have my doubts...  |  22:11, 8 December 2007 (UTC)

Yes, a sortable table would do it well. Then we don't need that Physician specialty codes as a separate article, but just use the codes in this new table. I'll try this method. Anybody may fine-tune it later.  () 05:52, 9 December 2007 (UTC)

Done. Again, feel free to fine-tune it.  () 13:31, 9 December 2007 (UTC)

Health effects of tobacco smoking article

This article is an absolute disgrace. It includes as &quot;health effects&quot; really only &quot;health benefits&quot; of tobacco smoking. As a doctor I am particularly apalled that this is the case. This article either needs urgent review or to be merged into another article which is less biased.
I've started adding in some brief information about health RISKS, though I'm having problems with working out how to cite articles to put citations in there at the moment.
I think I do need some help fixing that article up... help!  () 14:26, 9 December 2007 (UTC)

Well done Snipergirl. Don't hesitate to tag the page  if you can't fix it on your own. I have renamed the page tobacco and health, which is a more inclusive title that would allow the page to cover more controversial issues such as the health risks of Snus. Be aware that passive smoking contains much relevant material, and that you may want to summarise its conclusions in a separate paragraph with the  at the top to avoid duplication.

We will obviously help out as much as possible, but I believe  has recently spent a lot of time trying to knock passive smoking into shape.  |  15:25, 9 December 2007 (UTC)

The Ischaemic Heart Disease Article

I think the articles should be merged. The vast majority of IHD is due to CHD/CAD, and we already have a great duplicity of articles on the subject. Acute coronary syndrome and myocardial infarction stand on their own (but the former needs more sources).  |  20:05, 9 December 2007 (UTC)

Drug article debate


It seems there is a current debate (in the archived version of this talk page) about which articles should be joined. Some of the articles in question are not solely related to drug abuse and many of them do not fall within the topic of drug abuse at all. 

In particular, drug dependence, drug tolerance etc are biological processes that have litle to do with drug abuse. Patients routinely become physiologically dependent on and tolerant to drug effects without abusing them. This is especially relevant in cases where the drug in question has no psychological addiction potential whatsoever, and there are many cases where this is true. One would never refer to a patient who has become tolerant to antibiotics as a drug abuser, or an addict, nor is that patient dependent on the drug, IE if one discontinues the antibiotic course there is not likely to be a set of withdrawal symptoms. One would also not refer to a patient who is dependent on anti-depressants as an addict even if discontinuation of the drug would cause withdrawal symptoms.

In addition, one can become tolerant to drugs like morphine or valium without abusing them, cancer patients routinely become tolerant and physiologically dependent on opiates despite the fact that they are using them for legitimate purposes, but one would never refer to a cancer patient as a drug addict simply because of tolerance or physical dependence on the medication. These specific conditions are entirely separate and lumping them together is incorrect. 

To clarify my position, it would be highly improper to pull all these topics under the drug abuse subject simply because they are related in some way, and they have more to differentiate them than they have in common.  () 22:51, 9 December 2007 (UTC)

Are you talking about a category or a template or something else? Sorry, not quite following. I wasn't around for the beginning of the convo, so please fill me in if it's not too much hassle. Thanks, [[User:Antelan|Ante]][[User:Antelan|lan]] [[User_talk:Antelan|talk]] 22:53, 9 December 2007 (UTC)

 I would agree with Mrsteveman1. The concepts of tolerance, dependence, withdrawal and abuse are distinct (though related)and IMHO wikipedia should reflect this.  () 15:28, 10 December 2007 (UTC)

 My thinking is (i hoped the examples would clarify this), that all these things, dependence, tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, may be related to drug abuse in that abusing drugs can lead to those problems, but they are and always will be medical problems completely distinct from the intent of the user. People abuse drugs all the time without ever seeing any of these problems, and people see these problems without having ever abused drugs. Therefor they are for the most part, separate issues with much greater relevance to other situations.  —Preceding  comment added by  ( • ) 21:57, 10 December 2007 (UTC)

 requests now open

Dear Wikimedians,

This is a (belated) announcement that requests are now being taken for illustrations to be created for the Philip Greenspun illustration project (PGIP).

The aim of the project is to create and improve illustrations on Wikimedia projects. You can help by identifying which important articles or concepts are missing illustrations (diagrams) that could make them a lot easier to understand. Requests should be made on this page: 

If there's a topic area you know a lot about or are involved with as a Wikiproject, why not conduct a review to see which illustrations are missing and needed for that topic? Existing content can be checked by using  to search Wikimedia Commons, or use the  to quickly check for images of a given topic in other-language projects.

The community suggestions will be used to shape the final list, which will be finalised to 50 specific requests for Round 1, due to start in January. People will be able to make suggestions for the duration of the project, not just in the lead-up to Round 1.

* General information about the project: 
* Potential illustrators and others interested in the project should join the mailing list: 

thanks,  () 13:12, 13 December 2007 (UTC) (Project coordinator)

[[:Category:Eponymous diseases]]

Category:Eponymous diseases was deleted based on this discussion: , anyone else thinks that's not consensus? -- () 19:01, 15 December 2007 (UTC)

Four editors expressed keep opinions and four expressed delete opinions (five if you include Radiant). It appears Radiant was unimpressed with the keep arguments (which have to be based on policy, not just opinion). He also took into account the three completely unanimous deletion discussions below that one (which also involved multiple categories each). There appears to be consensus that Wikipedia should not have eponym categories, and the medical contributors failed to convince that their categories are a special case. BTW: there remain List of eponymous diseases and List of eponymous medical signs. Personally, I don't have strong opinions either way. ° 20:04, 15 December 2007 (UTC)

Colin, could you direct us to the consensus on the deletion of all eponym categories? I think that having categories for this would have been mighty useful - all the sciences are replete with eponyms (Coriolis effect, Planck constant, Hayflick limit, Flesch-Kincaid Readability Test) and a category would have been rather suitable to link these together sensibly. In medicine, eponyms are of such significance that they may indicate a death sentence (Lou Gehrig's disease, Klatskin tumor) or lifelong disability (Parkinson's disease) or unpredictable tummy trouble (Crohn's disease).  |  21:43, 15 December 2007 (UTC)

I don't see much consensus there, but I admit I didn't weigh in on the discussion because I'm ambivalent about how the category is named.  I have a problem with Tourette syndrome being categorized as an eponymous disease, rather than an eponymous condition, so I wasn't sure what to do when that XfD came up. If we reinstate it with a broader or more precise name, I'm on board.  [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] () 22:07, 15 December 2007 (UTC)

To answer JFW, the other categories for deletion were  (Buildings and structures named after people; Airports named after people; Skyscrapers named after people; Trump buildings),  (Eponymous cities; Cities named for Lenin; Cities named for Stalin) and  (Eponymous foods; Eponymous minerals; Eponymous theories). Many of the comments made in those discussions could apply equally well for medical eponyms (and indeed, many of the medical eponym comments said nothing medical). The overriding impression was that being an eponym wasn't a distinguishing characteristic worth of a category.

I'm trying to remain neutral as to whether it was the correct decision; I'm just describing my interpretation of the events. ° 00:03, 16 December 2007 (UTC)

Thanks for that, Colin. I note that only the medical eponyms attracted &quot;keep&quot; votes, as opposed to the other eponyms. I'm with Steven that there may be grounds for stating that there was not the degree of consensus there that one would have expected. I'm of the opinion that medical eponyms do not constitute &quot;overcategorisation&quot;, and I would support overturn in a deletion review.  |  08:41, 16 December 2007 (UTC)

Neoplasia and Tumor

 shortened Neoplasia and Tumor on the grounds that the Cancer article is much more exciting, so people should really just go to that article instead.  I've reverted the edits to Neoplasia, primarily because I was (and am) irritated by the consensus-free style on display, but also because it seems really undesirable to &quot;soft-redirect&quot; a woman with benign uterine fibroids (to name one common non-cancerous neoplasm) to the cancer article.  I don't normally keep track of Tumor and don't want to intrude if its usual shepherds agree with the changes.  Would someone else (or several someone elses) please take a look at both of these articles and make rational decisions about them?  () 02:53, 15 December 2007 (UTC)

Thanks for the heads-up.  Tumor is a mess and  did clean up some problems, but also created some new problems.  Rather than just fix the new problems, a patch, I suppose the page may as well get worked over.  But first, this may be a good time to discuss the accumulating content overlaps between Cancer and many related pages, not just Neoplasia and Tumor. -- () 03:55, 15 December 2007 (UTC)

Late effect equals sequela equals complication?

Some medical billing manuals define &quot;late effect&quot; as a residual effect or sequela of an acute condition.  But in the medical research literature &quot;late effect&quot; refers to a condition that occurs (or presents) after (sometimes long after) the causative condition has resolved.  In clinical medicine, is &quot;late effect&quot; just a synonym for sequela?  And how do these terms relate to complication (medicine)?  All these pages need improvement.  (Also, improvement now would be helpful in resolving some difficulties with Herpes zoster.)  Please take a look at them. -- () 05:01, 19 December 2007 (UTC)

I think &quot;sequelae&quot; is a container term for every medical problem that arises as a result of another problem. The difference between &quot;late effect&quot; and &quot;complication&quot; is the timeframe. I'm not at all sure where the cutoff lies between the one and the other. Intuitively, I would say that a &quot;complication&quot; arises during the illness or its treatment, while a &quot;late effect&quot; by its very wording is after the illness or its treatment. But I have heard &quot;complication&quot; used in this context just the same.  |  14:32, 19 December 2007 (UTC)

Hm.  JFW, thanks for your edits to late effect;  I changed lactate from a redirect to a disambiguation page.  Re your comment here, are you are thinking a complication occurs during a condition, a sequela begins during a condition and continues afterward, and a late effect begins afterward (perhaps long afterward)?  Do you know any sources (textbooks, etc) that address this? -- () 23:52, 19 December 2007 (UTC)

I've never seen a good definition of these terms, and I suspect there is no formal definition. My above reaction was purely an intuitive one. Complications may develop after a condition has resolved.  |  00:02, 20 December 2007 (UTC)

Lens (anatomy)

Da Costa's syndrome

I did some formatting and sourcing work when I ran across it today, and I'd like to have someone else look at the 'History' section, and then at the personal webpage listed at the very end (particularly the bit that starts &quot;Why I wrote this theory&quot;).  I'm highly suspicious of a WP:OR violation, but parts of the history are probably accurate -- although I'm not sure that they're worth saving.  What do you think?  () 22:05, 18 December 2007 (UTC)

The condition is largely historical (see  which is an excellent review) and could be described as &quot;irritable heart syndrome&quot; or somesuch. Unfortunately  has a history of publishing  () and has a habit of citing his own work  (see [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?Db=pubmed&amp;Cmd=DetailsSearch&amp;Term=%22Banfield+MA%22%5BAuthor%5D Banfield MA]) and [http://users.chariot.net.au/~posture/ his website]. The new additions need to be examined in the light of this.  |  22:19, 18 December 2007 (UTC)
I just ran into this via changing the synonymous Soldier's heart stub to a disambiguation page. At a glance, it does seem the section on results from the South Australian Institute For Fitness Research and Training study seems disproportionately long. I also notice some fairly inaccurate edit summaries from  - for instance [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Da_Costa%27s_syndrome&amp;curid=5158024&amp;diff=179081363&amp;oldid=179071673 adding 738 words] is not &quot;m (minor edits and layout)&quot;. Could this be a situation to invoke ?
And whatever the source, I don't think detailed case study data - the three stages of NCD were 1161, 940 &amp; 591 respectively, and for healthy women was 834, and the stages of NCD were 854, 621 &amp; 420 kgm/min etc etc - is encyclopedic. It's meant to be an article for general readership, not an academic literature survey.
I've posted a note to  about the COI issuse of expounding his own theory within the Da Costa's syndrome article.  () 00:53, 21 December 2007 (UTC)
