 ascularisation  

Hello, 

I am a student pursuing the Edinburgh Award at the University of Edinburgh. I recently wrote an article on ascularisation and would appreciate some feedback on how to enhance it. The page currently indicates that it resembles more of a personal reflection or essay. 

Any feedback would be deeply appreciated!

Thank you!   ser:Biochemgenie|Biochemgenie (ser talk:Biochemgenie|talk) 12:32, 14 March 2025 (UTC)
ing|Biochemgenie I'm not qualified to comment on the article but for general advice (such as what the essay tag means), please try P:Teahouse. Originally, the page was a redirect to ngiogenesis. Please consider whether the two topics are significantly different and therefore two articles are required. A tag at the top of the page draws attention to asculogenesis and the same consideration is required regarding that article. ser:Johnuniq|Johnuniq (ser talk:Johnuniq|talk) 07:58, 16 March 2025 (UTC)
That page is the subject of a 3-page merge proposal being discussed at alk:Vasculogenesis#Merge proposal. They key concern at the new page ascularisation is that it is a personal reflection on the topic. This is primarily because the cited articles don't support the synthesis being made. Throughout, the page is primarily using primary sources for examples, but there are insufficient sources for the synthesis; suitable sources would be influential reviews or textbooks. Remember that Wikipedia is a review of reviews, not a place for primary publication. See P:WPNOTRS. ser:Klbrain|Klbrain (ser talk:Klbrain|talk) 16:05, 16 March 2025 (UTC)
Hi. Thanks for your efforts here. Great to have more more editors contributing! ser:Biochemgenie|Biochemgenie. One suggestion that I have is to try to tackle the lead. I suggest that you review a few other similar articles to get a feel for how we communicate evidence and background information about medical topics. There is also a guide ikipedia:Manual of Style/Lead section#:~:text=It gives the basics in,overview of the article's topic.|here for how to write a lead.

 Input needed 

The FA etabolism has a couple CN tags that should be fixed up and in doing so I ran into a bit of a tricky situation which I've explained at alk:Metabolism#Opinions needed, does source support articles claims?.

 Adding sources to Wikidata 

I've just created ikipedia:How to add sources to Wikidata.  The instruction page is 90% screenshots.  Basically, you click a couple of times and paste in a MID or OI (code)|DOI number (or ISBN, or URL, or even the name of a notable book, but I figure that most of us will be citing journal articles, so PMIDs and DOIs are more relevant).  It really is very easy.  

If you find yourself over at Wikidata, please feel free to add sources.   ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 00:16, 2 April 2025 (UTC)

 Are scoping reviews reliable sources for medical content?  

I never saw these until recently but seeing them more and more now. Are they generally suitable sources in terms of MEDRS? ser:Moribundum|Moribundum (ser talk:Moribundum|talk) 15:13, 27 March 2025 (UTC)

Nice to see you again |Moribundum. Scoping reviews, in my experience tend to be similiar to systematic reviews, in the sense that they review a ton of publications. I‚Äôm not sure if there is a distinct difference between the two. I think it depends on the pub itself more so than the terminology they use. I‚Äôm going to ping |colin and |WhatamIdoing here because they both heavily contributed to MEDRS and have a wealth of knowledge in the area. Kind of separate to you question, but I to have seen an increase in this term and I do think it would be beneficial to add the term to the MEDRS page, however that‚Äôs not something I‚Äôm comfortable with but Colin and WAID may be. ser:IntentionallyDense|Intentionallyser talk:IntentionallyDense|Dense (pecial:Contributions/IntentionallyDense|Contribs) 19:32, 27 March 2025 (UTC)
Hi! Great question. In my opinion, a scoping review published in a peer reviewed medical journal would be acceptable under MEDRS, but its use depends on what is being shared in the Wikipedia article. In my own editing, I would think that they are generally suitable for summarizing background information on a topic or providing a paraphrased overview of a treatment, similar to a review article or a text book source. However, evidence from a scoping review may not be strong enough to support claims about the efficacy of a treatment (as an example) unless there are no stronger sources available. If possible, it is best to look for higher-quality MEDRS sources, such as systematic reviews with meta analysis or clinical guidelines. I would love to hear what others think! ser:JenOttawa|JenOttawa (ser talk:JenOttawa|talk) 21:50, 27 March 2025 (UTC)
This is also how I've treated them. They tend to be great for simple definitions and history sections but otherwise I just find that a textbook, systematic review, or clinical guidelines are much better for other sections of the article. ser:IntentionallyDense|Intentionallyser talk:IntentionallyDense|Dense (pecial:Contributions/IntentionallyDense|Contribs) 04:26, 28 March 2025 (UTC)
Thanks ppl for advice. Re MEDRS there is actually already a scoping review used as a reference on that guideline, but the guideline does not mention scoping reviews itself. ser:Moribundum|Moribundum (ser talk:Moribundum|talk) 16:51, 28 March 2025 (UTC)
Ah, yes. This discussion was up on the MEDRS talk page a short while ago. I had half-committed to updating the guideline, but have not gotten to it. I think one could see a scoping review somewhere half between a narrative review and a systematic review - but often in a field where there is a scarcity of literature, and with a broader question than that of a scoping review. So in that sense they are MEDRS-compliant tertiary sources, but less strict than systematic reviews. One more source type that the guideline doesn‚Äôt discuss is the umbrella review - which is a systematic review of systematic reviews. I intend at some point to get to writing something on this for the guideline. ser:CFCF|CFCF (ser talk:CFCF|talk) 16:00, 30 March 2025 (UTC)

 Assessment of the amount of nutrients in products 
I am confused by the description of the nutrient content of products, which is in many articles

FDA source says following &quot;5% DV or less of a nutrient per serving is considered low. 20% DV or more of a nutrient per serving is considered high.&quot;

https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-facts-label/daily-value-nutrition-and-supplement-facts-labels#:~:text=Use%20%25DV%20to%20determine%20if,per%20serving%20is%20considered%20high.

But what is serving?   As I understand it, this is not 100 g, the data for which is given in our articles. Because, for example, milk, apple, banana, etc. are often consumed in portions greater than 100 g, and dried fruits or nuts in portions less. However, in our articles, an assessment is often given &quot;low&quot;, &quot;moderate&quot; or &quot;rich&quot; based on 100 g. Is this correct? Perhaps we should just list percentages, leaving readers to determine how good a given source is based on their usual serving sizes? 

For example pple is described as  &quot;there is low content of micronutrients, with the Daily Values of all falling below 10%  BTW, FDA lists low content as 5% or below. And 100 g of apple has 5% of vitamin C and 4% of potassium. If my usual serving per day is 200 g weight apple (which is medium size) - it will be 10% of vitamin C, and 8% of potassium. So is it better to leave current wording, or change somehow?

ser:Zemleroika11|Zemleroika11 (ser talk:Zemleroika11|talk) 16:39, 6 April 2025 (UTC)

So... I think you want serving size as in &quot;medium apple&quot;, because arsley can be &quot;high&quot; in certain nutrients if you eat 100¬†g, but that isn't material since people usually eat 5¬†g of it.
To solve this problem, you might look for European sources instead of US ones, as I understand that the per-100-grams approach is more common in Europe. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 19:17, 6 April 2025 (UTC)
Well, I want to clarify what wording is correct in wikipeia. Here is per 100 gram approach in food items nutrients tables. I propose to use only percents of dv, describing nutrient content in text, not 'rich' or 'low', as these terms are applied to servings by FDA source , where terms 'rich' and 'low' are defined in percents, and there is no clear understanding of what serving is in every case. ser:Zemleroika11|Zemleroika11 (ser talk:Zemleroika11|talk) 22:17, 6 April 2025 (UTC)
Could it be resolved with more specificity?  For example:  &quot;A medium apple is a moderately good source of Vitamin C because it contains 10% of the US RDA&quot;. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 01:44, 7 April 2025 (UTC)

 On adding a edical template 

Greetings, fellow editors! I was recently scrolling on medical-related Chinese Wikipedia pages, and I saw a useful template with source code edical on top of every page.The related template page is this: https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/template:medical. It basically provides a warning that Wikipedia medical pages should only be used for reference and that one has to consult professionals for medical advice, while linking to the page ikipedia:Medical disclaimer. I think this would be beneficial in case somebody vandalizes an important medical page and another person happens to be reading it, or simply when a well-intended editor make mistakes. Regarding the high number of medical cases involving people trusting unreliable sources (see P:NGR), I believe this can prevent many of such accidents. ser:Pygos|Pygos (ser talk:Pygos|talk) 13:10, 11 April 2025 (UTC)
This has been discussed many many times, and the consensus on the English Wikipedia is that the general content disclaimer that you found is sufficient. There are argument for and against, and you are in your right to prefer this. However, just given the history of the discussion, and the unyielding consensus against it - I don't think we should rehash it again. I have no strong feelings either way, but would very much like to save people's time.

d I'm going to go ahead and disagree here. I think this type of information is unlikely to confuse, and more likely to decrease the risk of inaccurately picking statistics and treating them as perfect. You might not need to specify that it is a confidence interval, but you can quite easily specify &quot;(likely between 0.16‚Äì0.32). ser:CFCF|CFCF (ser talk:CFCF|talk) 20:56, 31 March 2025 (UTC)

I agree with CFCF.  In particular, if the CI is very large, then it's better to say &quot;between 1 and 99&quot; than to say &quot;50&quot;.  If you want to emphasize the range for some sensible reason, then you can write something like &quot;estimated to be between 0.16% and .0.32%&quot; and leave out the &quot;0.19%&quot;.
Also:  Consider applying some rounding, e.g., &quot;about 0.2%&quot; or, even better, &quot;about one in 500 people&quot;.  Or re-write the whole sentence into plain English:  &quot;Worldwide, PA is estimated to affect about one in 1,000 people, with the rate in Europe being about double that.&quot; ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 04:46, 1 April 2025 (UTC)

I did for some but not all of the sources and didn't find much. ser:IntentionallyDense|Intentionallyser talk:IntentionallyDense|Dense (pecial:Contributions/IntentionallyDense|Contribs) 17:12, 15 April 2025 (UTC)

 Help keep the page etabolism a FA! 

I need help finding sources for the following on the page etabolism: File:Catabolism schematic.svg, File:Insulin glucose metabolism ZP.svg, and q|Modern biochemical research has been greatly aided by the development of new techniques such as chromatography, X-ray diffraction, NMR spectroscopy, radioisotopic labelling, electron microscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. These techniques have allowed the discovery and detailed analysis of the many molecules and metabolic pathways in cells. 

I have detailed this more at alk:Metabolism#Sources_needed. Any feedback or help is appreciated! ser:IntentionallyDense|Intentionallyser talk:IntentionallyDense|Dense (pecial:Contributions/IntentionallyDense|Contribs) 19:33, 6 April 2025 (UTC)
