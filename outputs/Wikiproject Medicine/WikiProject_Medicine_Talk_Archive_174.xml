Hello, 

I am a student pursuing the Edinburgh Award at the University of Edinburgh. I recently wrote an article on Vascularisation and would appreciate some feedback on how to enhance it. The page currently indicates that it resembles more of a personal reflection or essay. 

Any feedback would be deeply appreciated!

Thank you!   Biochemgenie (talk) 12:32, 14 March 2025 (UTC)
 I'm not qualified to comment on the article but for general advice (such as what the essay tag means), please try . Originally, the page was a redirect to Angiogenesis. Please consider whether the two topics are significantly different and therefore two articles are required. A tag at the top of the page draws attention to Vasculogenesis and the same consideration is required regarding that article. Johnuniq (talk) 07:58, 16 March 2025 (UTC)
That page is the subject of a 3-page merge proposal being discussed at . They key concern at the new page Vascularisation is that it is a personal reflection on the topic. This is primarily because the cited articles don't support the synthesis being made. Throughout, the page is primarily using primary sources for examples, but there are insufficient sources for the synthesis; suitable sources would be influential reviews or textbooks. Remember that Wikipedia is a review of reviews, not a place for primary publication. See . Klbrain (talk) 16:05, 16 March 2025 (UTC)
Hi. Thanks for your efforts here. Great to have more more editors contributing! Biochemgenie. One suggestion that I have is to try to tackle the lead. I suggest that you review a few other similar articles to get a feel for how we communicate evidence and background information about medical topics. There is also a guide  for how to write a lead. I am not sure I have time to work more this week, but keep us posted and good luck! JenOttawa (talk) 05:02, 1 April 2025 (UTC)

Adding sources to Wikidata

I've just created .  The instruction page is 90% screenshots.  Basically, you click a couple of times and paste in a PMID or DOI number (or ISBN, or URL, or even the name of a notable book, but I figure that most of us will be citing journal articles, so PMIDs and DOIs are more relevant).  It really is very easy.  

If you find yourself over at Wikidata, please feel free to add sources.   WhatamIdoing (talk) 00:16, 2 April 2025 (UTC)

Are scoping reviews reliable sources for medical content? 

I never saw these until recently but seeing them more and more now. Are they generally suitable sources in terms of MEDRS? Moribundum (talk) 15:13, 27 March 2025 (UTC)

Nice to see you again . Scoping reviews, in my experience tend to be similiar to systematic reviews, in the sense that they review a ton of publications. I‚Äôm not sure if there is a distinct difference between the two. I think it depends on the pub itself more so than the terminology they use. I‚Äôm going to ping  and  here because they both heavily contributed to MEDRS and have a wealth of knowledge in the area. Kind of separate to you question, but I to have seen an increase in this term and I do think it would be beneficial to add the term to the MEDRS page, however that‚Äôs not something I‚Äôm comfortable with but Colin and WAID may be. IntentionallyDense () 19:32, 27 March 2025 (UTC)
Hi! Great question. In my opinion, a scoping review published in a peer reviewed medical journal would be acceptable under MEDRS, but its use depends on what is being shared in the Wikipedia article. In my own editing, I would think that they are generally suitable for summarizing background information on a topic or providing a paraphrased overview of a treatment, similar to a review article or a text book source. However, evidence from a scoping review may not be strong enough to support claims about the efficacy of a treatment (as an example) unless there are no stronger sources available. If possible, it is best to look for higher-quality MEDRS sources, such as systematic reviews with meta analysis or clinical guidelines. I would love to hear what others think! JenOttawa (talk) 21:50, 27 March 2025 (UTC)
This is also how I've treated them. They tend to be great for simple definitions and history sections but otherwise I just find that a textbook, systematic review, or clinical guidelines are much better for other sections of the article. IntentionallyDense () 04:26, 28 March 2025 (UTC)
Thanks ppl for advice. Re MEDRS there is actually already a scoping review used as a reference on that guideline, but the guideline does not mention scoping reviews itself. Moribundum (talk) 16:51, 28 March 2025 (UTC)
Ah, yes. This discussion was up on the MEDRS talk page a short while ago. I had half-committed to updating the guideline, but have not gotten to it. I think one could see a scoping review somewhere half between a narrative review and a systematic review - but often in a field where there is a scarcity of literature, and with a broader question than that of a scoping review. So in that sense they are MEDRS-compliant tertiary sources, but less strict than systematic reviews. One more source type that the guideline doesn‚Äôt discuss is the umbrella review - which is a systematic review of systematic reviews. I intend at some point to get to writing something on this for the guideline. CFCF (talk) 16:00, 30 March 2025 (UTC)
(Since I was pinged above:   is for CFCF to write that.  ;-) ) WhatamIdoing (talk) 01:49, 2 April 2025 (UTC)
Mapping reviews are another type. I have not noticed one cited here recently, but becoming more [https://systematicreviewsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13643-023-02178-5#:~:text=Mapping%20reviews%20are%20also%20a,question%20of%20interest%20%5B18%5D. common] and are a useful tool.JenOttawa (talk) 04:48, 1 April 2025 (UTC)

Dysesthesia

Does anyone know how to add a pronunciation key to an article? I think it would be beneficial for Dysesthesia laurap414 (talk) 03:56, 2 April 2025 (UTC)

@Laurap414, you can use the international  and/or the mostly American  systems to add this.  It might look something like  or .  You can check dictionaries to find official pronunciations, and then  like a normal ref.
This information is often added with the |pronounce= parameter in the infobox. WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:17, 2 April 2025 (UTC)

The Core Contest

‚ÄîWikipedia's most exciting contest‚Äîreturns again this year from April 15 to May 31. Given how important high-quality medical articles are to people's life, especially now that the US government is scrubbing vital health information from their websites, I was hoping I could tempt people here to join.

The goal: to improve  or other core articles, with a focus on those in the worst state of disrepair. Editing can be done individually, but in the past groups have also successfully competed. Winners are those who provide &quot;best additive encyclopedic value&quot;, judged by the amount of improvement and 'coreness' of articles. . ‚ÄîFemke üê¶ (talk) 13:24, 6 April 2025 (UTC)

Death-related RFCs

It might be useful to have some WPMED folks join these two RFCs:

*  ‚Äì mostly about conflation of Euthanasia and Assisted suicide in the article
*  ‚Äì whether to add a hatnote to  at the top of the article

The latter was not included in , so it will be missed by anyone watching that page.  Both are listed in  (the only two open RFCs for WPMED articles at the moment).  WhatamIdoing (talk) 19:12, 6 April 2025 (UTC)

Assessment of the amount of nutrients in products
I am confused by the description of the nutrient content of products, which is in many articles

FDA source says following &quot;5% DV or less of a nutrient per serving is considered low. 20% DV or more of a nutrient per serving is considered high.&quot;

https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-facts-label/daily-value-nutrition-and-supplement-facts-labels#:~:text=Use%20%25DV%20to%20determine%20if,per%20serving%20is%20considered%20high.

But what is serving?   As I understand it, this is not 100 g, the data for which is given in our articles. Because, for example, milk, apple, banana, etc. are often consumed in portions greater than 100 g, and dried fruits or nuts in portions less. However, in our articles, an assessment is often given &quot;low&quot;, &quot;moderate&quot; or &quot;rich&quot; based on 100 g. Is this correct? Perhaps we should just list percentages, leaving readers to determine how good a given source is based on their usual serving sizes? 

For example Apple is described as  &quot;there is low content of micronutrients, with the Daily Values of all falling below 10%  BTW, FDA lists low content as 5% or below. And 100 g of apple has 5% of vitamin C and 4% of potassium. If my usual serving per day is 200 g weight apple (which is medium size) - it will be 10% of vitamin C, and 8% of potassium. So is it better to leave current wording, or change somehow?

Zemleroika11 (talk) 16:39, 6 April 2025 (UTC)

So... I think you want serving size as in &quot;medium apple&quot;, because parsley can be &quot;high&quot; in certain nutrients if you eat 100 g, but that isn't material since people usually eat 5 g of it.
To solve this problem, you might look for European sources instead of US ones, as I understand that the per-100-grams approach is more common in Europe. WhatamIdoing (talk) 19:17, 6 April 2025 (UTC)
Well, I want to clarify what wording is correct in wikipeia. Here is per 100 gram approach in food items nutrients tables. I propose to use only percents of dv, describing nutrient content in text, not 'rich' or 'low', as these terms are applied to servings by FDA source , where terms 'rich' and 'low' are defined in percents, and there is no clear understanding of what serving is in every case. Zemleroika11 (talk) 22:17, 6 April 2025 (UTC)
Could it be resolved with more specificity?  For example:  &quot;A medium apple is a moderately good source of Vitamin C because it contains 10% of the US RDA&quot;. WhatamIdoing (talk) 01:44, 7 April 2025 (UTC)

Request: Add sourced mention of Dr. Russell Surasky interview to COVID-19 section of Tucker Carlson article

Hi editors,

I‚Äôm requesting help from an extended-confirmed user to add a line under the ‚ÄúCOVID-19 pandemic and vaccines‚Äù section of the Tucker Carlson article. The proposed content is sourced, relevant, and directly tied to Carlson‚Äôs public commentary on pandemic policy.

In February 2022, Carlson interviewed neurologist and addiction medicine specialist Dr. Russell Surasky on Fox News. The interview addressed New York school mask mandates for children with medical exemptions, particularly one involving a nonverbal autistic child. Dr. Surasky criticized the policy as harmful and unethical.

On adding a  template

Greetings, fellow editors! I was recently scrolling on medical-related Chinese Wikipedia pages, and I saw a useful template with source code  on top of every page.The related template page is this: https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/template:medical. It basically provides a warning that Wikipedia medical pages should only be used for reference and that one has to consult professionals for medical advice, while linking to the page . I think this would be beneficial in case somebody vandalizes an important medical page and another person happens to be reading it, or simply when a well-intended editor make mistakes. Regarding the high number of medical cases involving people trusting unreliable sources (see ), I believe this can prevent many of such accidents. Pygos (talk) 13:10, 11 April 2025 (UTC)
This has been discussed many many times, and the consensus on the English Wikipedia is that the general content disclaimer that you found is sufficient. There are argument for and against, and you are in your right to prefer this. However, just given the history of the discussion, and the unyielding consensus against it - I don't think we should rehash it again. I have no strong feelings either way, but would very much like to save people's time. Perhaps someone else would be able to point to the relevant policies or discussions. CFCF (talk) 13:34, 11 April 2025 (UTC)

Confidence intervals

Saw this in an article. Should we remove confidence intervals? Moribundum (talk) 08:43, 29 March 2025 (UTC)

 Moribundum (talk) 08:43, 29 March 2025 (UTC)
Probably difficult to give an answer that is applicable in general. My intuition is that confidence intervals are more likely to be helpful/relevant when it comes to effect sizes than when it comes to prevalence figures, for instance. TompaDompa (talk) 15:31, 29 March 2025 (UTC)
Hello, but what percentage of readers will understand this term? Moribundum (talk) 08:04, 30 March 2025 (UTC)
Other than in an article quite focused on confidence intervals themselves, I think any use of the term would generally amount to a failure of encyclopedic writing for the general reader, Bon courage (talk) 15:40, 29 March 2025 (UTC)
 I'm going to go ahead and disagree here. I think this type of information is unlikely to confuse, and more likely to decrease the risk of inaccurately picking statistics and treating them as perfect. You might not need to specify that it is a confidence interval, but you can quite easily specify &quot;(likely between 0.16‚Äì0.32). CFCF (talk) 20:56, 31 March 2025 (UTC)

I agree with CFCF.  In particular, if the CI is very large, then it's better to say &quot;between 1 and 99&quot; than to say &quot;50&quot;.  If you want to emphasize the range for some sensible reason, then you can write something like &quot;estimated to be between 0.16% and .0.32%&quot; and leave out the &quot;0.19%&quot;.
Also:  Consider applying some rounding, e.g., &quot;about 0.2%&quot; or, even better, &quot;about one in 500 people&quot;.  Or re-write the whole sentence into plain English:  &quot;Worldwide, PA is estimated to affect about one in 1,000 people, with the rate in Europe being about double that.&quot; WhatamIdoing (talk) 04:46, 1 April 2025 (UTC)
I agree with this. I strongly believe we should include confidence intervals but explain them in plain language as the likely range. I've seen a lot of misinformation that reports the result without the confidence interval. Daphne Morrow (talk) 10:27, 15 April 2025 (UTC)
