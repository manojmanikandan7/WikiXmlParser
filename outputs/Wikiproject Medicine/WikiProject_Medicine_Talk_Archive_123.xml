 Case study of wiki in several cohorts of classes 
ile:Rod of asclepius.jpg|30 px|right
Just out today there is a paper presenting a case study of Wikipedia editing in a physical therapy program. I am an author.

*ite journal |last1=Weiner |first1=Shira Schecter |last2=Horbacewicz |first2=Jill |last3=Rasberry |first3=Lane |last4=Bensinger-Brody |first4=Yocheved |title=Improving the Quality of Consumer Health Information on Wikipedia: Case Series |journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research |date=18 March 2019 |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=e12450 |doi=10.2196/12450 |pmid=30882357 |doi-access=free 

The classes are at ikipedia:Touro. The outreach model is applying the ikipedia:Education program to a 3-hour workshop where all the attendees do research and draft their text proposals and citations in advance. Tracking is with eta:Programs and Events Dashboard.

The Wikimedia Foundation sponsored open access publishing of this paper through its grants program as documented at meta:Grants:Project/Rapid/Touro College/publishing wiki education research in healthcare.

I have some additional information about this project which I intend to share, but which was out of scope of this paper. The paper talks about &quot;persistence&quot;, which is a measure of the extent to which content which someone posts to Wikipedia actually stays in Wikipedia over a period of time. In general, editors wish to make persistent edits and to avoid edits which will not be persistent. Later on wiki I will share something about those measurements and tie it to this research.

For now, I hope that others can use this paper as supporting evidence of the usefulness of classes editing Wikipedia's medical content. For me it has been enlightening to learn how many patients have pain which they are treating with physical therapy, and how much more time that patients spend engaged in making thoughtful decisions about physical therapy as compared to many other types of healthcare, and also how often Wikipedia contains the perspective of pharmacology but lacks perspective of physical therapy in its articles.

Thanks everyone.

It's a method of approach for procedures on the ureter(s).

Retrograde ureteric procedures can also be performed on women, so the lede is inaccurate. mall|(Not a clinician, but have linical coding|coded urology.) ser:Little pob|Little pob (ser talk:Little pob|talk) 11:20, 3 April 2019 (UTC)

 Health - Health care - Healthcare

I have a question. Some articles have different name. Some are Health in COUNTRYNAME, others are Health care in COUNTRYNAME, while some others are Healthcare in COUNTRYNAME? I dont understand that? Shouldn't all have the same name? Please explain to me. is there a reason for that? Also, i cannot move some articles, and have information : The page could not be moved: a page of that name already exists, or the name you have chosen is not valid.

eply to|Dr.Bookman the guiding policy is ikipedia:Article titles. A country or territory m|might favour one variant over the others - which will be reflected in the P:RS|reliable sources - and must be reflected in the article title. Some regions may use health, healthcare, and health care interchangeably. Others might view health as an umbrella term, of which health care (and/or health care) would be a specific sub-term. For example; the UK m|used to use health to refer to health care and social care as a whole (recently there has been a shift to the term &quot;health and social care&quot;). The page move problem you're having is probably down to the presence of a P:REDIRECT|redirect page. However, these page moves are potentially controversial, and should therefore be discussed at the talk page of each page you wish moved. ser:Little pob|Little pob (ser talk:Little pob|talk) 13:37, 27 March 2019 (UTC)
 &quot;Health care in&quot; could be changed to &quot;Healthcare in&quot;, but articles starting with &quot;Health in&quot; aren't supposed to cover the same topics as articles starting with &quot;Healthcare in&quot;. &quot;Health in&quot; article should have information about health statistics, public health, outcomes, the healthcare industry, etc; whereas &quot;Healthcare in&quot; articles focus on the healthcare system. Not all countries have articles on both, because they haven't been written (yet). ser:Natureium|Natureium (ser talk:Natureium|talk) 14:16, 27 March 2019 (UTC)
 So that should all be fixed, then? Is there a way to link all articles that are Healh care in, so i can move them to Healthcare in?

 The rule of thumb I had heard is that &quot;healthcare&quot; refers to the industry, while &quot;health care&quot; refers to what medical professionals provide. If there are a lot of pages that need to be moved, we might want to make sure there is a determination about what is correct. ser:Natureium|Natureium (ser talk:Natureium|talk) 01:13, 29 March 2019 (UTC)

Some people do follow that distinction:  Healthcare organizations provide health care to improve health.  Perhaps this might help explain the distinction:
* Health in Ruritania is fair.  Lots of people die from preventable diseases, and some people have stunted growth due to malnourishment during childhood.
* Healthcare in Ruritania is limited.  There are not very many hospitals, and there is only one hospital that has an MRI machine.
* Health care in Ruritania is typical for developing countries.  Family members are intimately involved in caring for sick people, and they buy antimalarials without a prescription every time anyone has a fever.
These may not be the best examples, but the point is that some people use these three words to mean different things.  If that distinction is being followed, then moving the article makes it &quot;wrong&quot;.  
That said, in most cases, I suspect that no difference between &quot;Healthcare in&quot; and &quot;Health care in&quot; is actually meant, and that if both happen to exist, it might make sense to merge those articles anyway.  Perhaps for clarity, if you mean to write about &quot;healthcare&quot; as strictly defined (organizations, etc.), it would be worth considering a more specific name, e.g., Healthcare infrastructure in... or Healthcare industry in...  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 15:58, 29 March 2019 (UTC)

You could redirect to ietary supplement or ineral (nutrient) as there doesn't seem to be a phosphate supplement specific page at present.  A general hosphate supplement page could be useful and would have precedents e.g. alcium supplement, agnesium (medical use), otassium chloride (medical use).

 Pill identification 

180 was converted from a redirect to a disambiguation page today. When looking to see if there were other entries that belonged on the page, I found that the first few results on google were related to the marking on 4mg Tizanidine Hydrochloride pills. izanidine hydrochloride redirects to izanidine which makes no mention of pills at all. Do editors here think that this should be mentioned in the article, in a different article and/or on the dab page?

I have no opinion either way, and I'm not advocating for or against inclusion anywhere, but I haven't found any guidance about it so I don't know if it's been discussed previously or what the issues are. ser:Thryduulf|Thryduulf (ser talk:Thryduulf|talk) 18:23, 9 April 2019 (UTC)

What about the large RCTs?

Hi, ser:Sara3054|Sara3054, and welcome to Wikipedia!
The short answer is:  We avoid what are called &quot;rimary sources&quot;, such as original research papers.  This includes randomized controlled trials and anything that provides equal or &quot;worse&quot; evidence than that.
The long answer is:  It's a bit more complicated than that.  So what we want, when we're talking about scientific questions, is an article that adequately represents the current (more or less) state of scientific beliefs.  And for this, we need to use good sources (we call those &quot;reliable&quot;), and we need to represent them fairly, without trying to make one point of view sound better than what the experts think of it (we call that &quot;neutral&quot;, or more specifically, giving ikipedia:Due weight to the various viewpoints).  We think that hewing as closely as possible to the ideal academic sources is most likely to give us the end product that we want.  In particular, for ikipedia:Biomedical information like whether aspirin prevents heart attacks or what causes cancer, we tend to follow recent eview articles and textbooks instead of the news headlines (which are often overstated) or primary research papers (which can be cherry-picked).
Now, I'll bet you can imagine the problems if we just declared those to be &quot;the rules&quot; that have to be followed under all circumstances:  A million-person study is sometimes worth adding before anyone has had time to get a review article through the eer review process.  There might be too few patients to run a decent RCT at all, or that might be all we can find (rare diseases, but also a major problem for writing about comorbidities).  A condition might be common, but there might not be any &quot;ideal&quot; sources about it because nobody bothers publishing research on it (consider ack labor:  a third of women giving birth have it, and there is exactly one (just one!) review article that uses that term in all of PubMed).  A subject might be &quot;medical&quot;, but the focus of the sources might be on environmental impacts (and I hope the world never sees an RTC in humans about whether a drug is bad for wild fish).  So while we set forth an &quot;ideal&quot; standard, we are trying to leave some room for editors' judgment, especially when the literature is quite thin for that subject.  
As a practical note, I've found that often the information in a good RCT could also be supported by a secondary source.  By the way, tf you are more familiar with scientific standards, then you might find this page useful:  ikipedia:Ten simple rules for editing Wikipedia.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 05:17, 10 April 2019 (UTC)

The phrase is a registered trademark of Nobelbiocare (a major dental implant manufacturer), and the article is weighted heavily to product push imo with few references.  In 2014 I would have argued for deletion.

Merger Discussion Notification
NOTE: I am proposing this discussion for leishmanHillard on behalf of aiichi_Sankyo|Daiichi Sankyo. I am a paid editor and am aware of the COI guidelines.

Per the merger discussion guidelines, I wanted to notify WikiProject Medicine of a merger discussion I’ve initiated on the page for igmented_villonodular_synovitis|pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS). More detail is on that page’s Talk page, but in short, we have initiated this discussion at the recommendation of a conflict of interest editor who we’d previously contacted about adding enosynovial_giant_cell_tumor&amp;redirect=no|tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT) as a synonym for diffuse-type pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS). 

We are seeking the community’s guidance on how to go about ensuring that tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT) is accurately defined on Wikipedia. Currently, there is not a stand-alone TGCT page. It instead redirects to the iant-cell_tumor_of_the_tendon_sheath|giant-cell tumor of the tendon sheath (GCT-TS) page, which does not include TGCT terminology. This would suggest TGCT is solely a synonym for GCT-TS, which is incorrect. According to literature, TGCT is also closely related (and some say interchangeable) with pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) as well.

ser:Jon Gray|Jon, we usually follow the ICD system for organizing disease articles.  Do you have a list of the various ICD codes for these conditions?  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 20:10, 12 April 2019 (UTC)
I can help with the ICD-10 codes: (ICD-O-3 and national variants may offer more specificity.)
*PVNS = CD10|M12.2
*TGCT = CD10|D48.1
*GCT-TS = CD10|D48.1
The relevant index trail is q|Tumor, giant cell, soft parts see Neoplasm , connective tissue, uncertain behavior then q|Neoplasm, connective tissue, [site], uncertain behavior. If you go straight to Vol 3's neoplasm table, there are &quot;see connective tissue&quot; instructions at both tendon (sheath) and synovial membrane. A code from category CD10|D21, the code currently listed at GCT-TS, would be used if the tumour was known to be/specified as benign. ser:Little pob|Little pob (ser talk:Little pob|talk) 10:32, 14 April 2019 (UTC)

One of the sources here, used twice in the article, is the non-peer reviewed Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons published by the ssociation of American Physicians and Surgeons a fringe group that among other things denies that HIV causes AIDS. The association's article has a lot to say about the journal, starting with:

 Surgical pathology subspecialties 

I'm working through the list of unsourced medical articles, and we have a bunch of stubs of subspecialties of surgical pathology, most of them unsourced. Are these worth keeping, or should we redirect them to urgical pathology? I listed some of them here, but there are more:
* phthalmic pathology
* ulmonary pathology
* enal pathology
* astrointestinal pathology - this one is very long but still basically unsourced
* rthopedic pathology
* oft tissue pathology
Thanks, ser:Natureium|Natureium (ser talk:Natureium|talk) 18:59, 9 April 2019 (UTC)

We should probably have them, and they should probably be turned into something that is vaguely useful to, say, to the friend of a medical student.  Imagine that you're not a medical or medical-adjacent person, and your friend is going on and on (and on and on) about the current subject, and you just want to know enough to ask a decent question or make a comment like &quot;Oh, so you're trying to figure out whether he has ____ or ____, right?&quot;.  That's probably what should be in those articles.
The alternative isn't redirecting; it's merging them to urgical pathology#Subspecialties.  I know that this can feel really weird to WPMED folks, but the rule isn't &quot;source it or blank it&quot;.  The policy is actually that you must P:PRESERVE apparently good content.  It must be possible for a reader to verify that we didn't just make up that content.  What we tend to forget in our little corner of Wikipedia is that possible assumes that the reader is not only just reasonably educated but also has access to both a decent library and a web search engine, in addition to whatever sources might (or might not) be cited in an article.  I glanced at a couple of these, and I didn't see any contents whose verifiability concerned me.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 22:32, 9 April 2019 (UTC)
some of these names look a little weird to me, and I wonder if they're true sub-specialties.  Here is a list I found from the American Association of Pathologists of sub specialty certifications available.  E.g. &quot;soft tissue pathology&quot; is this dermatopathology, or someone who specializes in sarcomas, or neuro?  It's a weird distinction.  I wonder if there's anyone from path that might be able to look and provide direction.  
* Combined Anatomic Pathology and Clinical Pathology (AP/CP)
* Combined Anatomic Pathology and Neuropathology (AP/NP)
* Anatomic Pathology 
* Clinical Pathology 
* Blood Banking/Transfusion Medicine
* Chemical Pathology
* Clinical Informatics
* Cytopathology
* Dermatopathology
* Forensic Pathology
* Hematopathology
* Medical Microbiology
* Molecular Genetic Pathology
* Neuropathology
*Pediatric Pathology ser:Ian Furst|Ian Furst (ser talk:Ian Furst|talk) 12:30, 10 April 2019 (UTC)
 Yeah, some of those names are questionable. Are there any pathologists on Wikipedia that we can page? Barring any other ideas, I'll start merging any sourced information into urgical pathology. ser:Natureium|Natureium (ser talk:Natureium|talk) 22:38, 15 April 2019 (UTC)

 ahaja Yoga 

* ahaja_Yoga#Sahaja_meditation_and_associated_research

What do you guys think about this section? Does it pass MEDRS? I'm seeing a citation to the Journal of Complementary and Alternative medicine, which seems questionable. I'm not that familliar with MEDRS and Sahaja Yoga to comment on the rest. ser:Harizotoh9|Harizotoh9 (ser talk:Harizotoh9|talk) 01:56, 3 April 2019 (UTC)

Without looking, I think it's safe to say that there is no research on any kind of yoga that both claims a clear benefit for the specific &quot;brand name&quot; of yoga and meets MEDRS' &quot;ideal&quot; source quality.  This is because MEDRS's ideal was calibrated for heavily researched medical conditions, such as hypertension (about which more than 4,000 eview articles were published in the last five years) and not for individual types of yoga (this one, for example, can boast just 3 recent review articles, and zero in the core clinical journals). 
Whether or not the available sources are adequate depends on the exact claims being made.  P:RSCONTEXT matters in all articles and for all statements, regardless of whether or not MEDRS also applies.  For example, a source could be adequate for saying that &quot;Alice Expert wrote that this yoga is great&quot; while not being adequate for saying that &quot;this yoga is great&quot;. 
And, finally, P:DUE is a policy that applies to all parts of all articles, including sentences that could be supported by reliable sources.  Even if a source is &quot;reliable&quot; for saying that Alice Expert wrote something, the fact that she said that might be too unimportant to include.  This rule cuts both ways:  if most of the reliable sources discuss the fact that Alice Expert wrote about it, then the fact that Alice Expert wrote about it ought to be covered in the article, with some suitable compromise wording that acknowledges the fact while doing our best not to lead readers to overinterpret that fact.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 05:30, 3 April 2019 (UTC)

 emplate:Medical citation needed span 

I don't know if anyone here is familiar with lx|cn-span, but due to the fact that there was no template which had this functionality for specifying text that needed a medical reference in a manner similar to emplate:Citation needed span prior to today and since I wanted a template with this functionality, I created lx|Medical citation needed span.  Template shortcuts include owrap|lx|mcn-span, lx|mcn span, and lx|mcns. 

The usage/purpose of this template is fairly straightforward and works exactly like emplate:Citation needed span.  Compare lx|mcn in (1) with lx|mcns in (2) below:

#This text is sourced.[1] This text is a biomedical claim that needs a medical reference.ed cn|date=January 2019

* at least 1 of the 7 new editors who signed up kept editing for more than one week

Little factoid:  They contacted researchers/experts from a database.  Only one in 4,000 responded to say that they were already editing Wikipedia.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:52, 17 April 2019 (UTC)
 But how many responded to say that they weren't already editing Wikipedia? --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 20:11, 17 April 2019 (UTC)
They were asking for comments on high-traffic economics-related articles, rather than actual editing, and they found that a really surprisingly high percentage of experts were willing to provide comments.  Response rates appear to be subject-specific:  they had a baseline of 45%, but she mentioned that another study had found only 2% (psychology?).  I think the &quot;treatment&quot; groups were told how many page views the articles had and said that the expert's own papers &quot;may&quot; be used in the article (in a way that felt to me like &quot;You might already be quoted on Wikipedia, and this is your chance to find out whether your work was correctly represented&quot;, not &quot;Hey, you could spam your papers around Wikipedia!&quot;).  This increased responses but the baseline was already so high that it might not be really worthwhile.
Also, we talk about wanting experts, etc., but when we get their comments, we're not actually very quick to act on them, and when we do, we'd rather not have to make very many changes.  She eventually organized a student group to process the suggestions (100% of which have 'stuck', so they did a good job).  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 02:04, 18 April 2019 (UTC)
For what it's worth.  Roughly 10 times now, I've emailed world-leading gurus on particular subjects.  Each time, it's for a specific questions, or request for images about their subject.  So far, the response has always been helpful and they seem engaged.  I think most understand what Wikipedia represents, but have little interest in actually editing.  The article on 'Anaesthesia' is a good example where ser:Axl|Axl and I had a discussion about what hypnosis means in terms of anaesthesia.   I contacted the person, who wrote the definition for the major textbook on Anaesthesia (world wide).   He helped us sort out the definition.  At some point, it might be worthwhile to add a tag to point out who the world experts are, or where the best review papers exist.  Sometimes, it's hard to sort the good references from the great ones in the articles.  ser:Ian Furst|Ian Furst (ser talk:Ian Furst|talk) 14:39, 18 April 2019 (UTC)

 raft:Craig Simmons 

Hello medical experts.  Would someone from this project please look over the raft:Craig Simmons page, which is up for review at AFC? Some of the references are at PUBMED. I know it needs work on being more factual and less about inspiration and goals.  The editor responded somewhat to my comment about the need for independent references. I am willing to work on the tone if I was right about the notability.—ser:Anne Delong|Anne Delong (ser talk:Anne Delong|talk) 11:10, 25 April 2019 (UTC)

 I'm sorry, |Anne Delong|Anne, but I don't think Simmons quite meets our notability guidelines. He seems like one of very many respectable academics who has done solid research without ever being anything outstanding. He doesn't have &quot;significant coverage in multiple independent sources&quot; to meet P:GNG and he hasn't made a significant contribution that is part of the enduring historical record in his field such that independent historians have written about him (to meet P:ANYBIO #2). The best bet for notability is through P:NPROF #5 on the assumption that a Canadian university's granting of the title &quot;Distinguished Professor&quot; is equivalent to that in the USA. The only other possibility would be if the anada Research Chair (tier 2) in Mechanobiology award, which is &quot;for exceptional emerging researchers, acknowledged by their peers as having the potential to lead in their field&quot;, was accepted as meeting P:ANYBIO #1 (a well-known and significant award or honor), although I would have thought the Tier 1 award (outstanding researchers acknowledged by their peers as world leaders in their fields) to be more like what we should expect for ANYBIO#1.
 All of those are just judgement calls on my part and I'm sure others would disagree with me. If you want to see the article developed, I recommend concentrating on getting news coverage of Simmons' Canada Research Chair award and the &quot;Distinguished Professor&quot; title. If you, or AhmadKml, can flesh those out in the article text, particularly if they were reported beyond the immediate institutions involved, you will probably stand a decent chance of avoiding deletion in mainspace. Please feel free to copy any or all of this onto the Draft talk page if you wish, as this page gets archived quite quickly. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 15:19, 25 April 2019 (UTC)

GENERALLY1) Fundamentally, I do not consider any award for emerging  anything to indicate notability in any field. All the rest of the wording &quot;distinguished&quot;, &quot;exceptional&quot; is puffery--the key part is &quot;emmerging&quot;. People are notable once their accomplishments have emerged.  &quot;emerging&quot; = &quot;might be notable someday,&quot;   known around here as P:TOOSOON. This is not to say that someone with such an award as the hgihest award might not actualy be notable, just that the Canada Research Chair people have not accepted it yet. And , obviously, someone with that award in their earlier career might and often will actually become notable  later.  This in fact seems to be the case here--the award is from 2006. 
2)Most US named professorships are permaent awards at the highest level. But sometimes an award given as  a &quot;Distinguished&quot; professorship is a term award, given for a term of anywhere from 1 to 5 years. And the title &quot;University professor&quot; has a variable meaning,; some universities use it a term award ; others for retired professors--I know Berkeley does (or at least did), 
3) we always need to go by citations. Awards in the absence of high citations indicates a situation that needs further checking. (sometimes, of course, it just indicates a very narrow specialty, but it can indicate notability by press release) 
SPECIFICALLY:
1)Looking at google scholar, I see 10 articles with over 2000 references each. That's enough for very clear notability. There's no need for anything qualified or uncertain here. 
2)In any case the article is promotional and worded as a press release. For articles like this I find it easier to rewrite than to successfully explain how to rewrite.  I will do that, and accept. ser:DGG| DGG (ser talk:DGG| talk ) 06:41, 26 April 2019 (UTC) 
AND
The  expected danger of promotional writing is to make something look notable  when it really isn't; but I have seen an increasing number of instances here where promotional writing (sometimes innocent copy-cat, not promotional intent) leads to our being suspicious and obscures the actual notability.   ser:DGG| DGG (ser talk:DGG| talk ) 06:41, 26 April 2019 (UTC) 
ANYBIO is based upon press coverage, but the wording of press coverage is likely to be hyperbola and PR; this is especially true in subjects where it is thought the general public cannot judge for themselves. As an encyclopedia , we should report the accomplishments, not the taglines.

Thanks, ser:Doc James|Doc James, ser:Johnbod|Johnbod and ser:DGG| DGG. According to cademic ranks in Canada, &quot;Distinguished Professor&quot; is a rank above &quot;University Professor&quot;, and on a par with named chair. I realize that the draft needs better referencing; I brought it here in hopes that someone with access to medical and biology journals could see if his work was being discussed as well as cited.   I have been told that professors in medical fields tend to have more citations than in some other fields because the individual papers often have many authors.  Adjusting for this by sorting Google Scholar profiles by specialty, it seems that he has more citations than anyone else in the world in two of the three areas, and stands 11th out of several hundred in his main specialty.—ser:Anne Delong|Anne Delong (ser talk:Anne Delong|talk) 11:31, 26 April 2019 (UTC)

The editor of the Pancreatic cancer page asked me to post my addition here.  I would like to offer the following sentence for pre-review.  If there are any issues please suggest how I can make this conform to Wiki standards.  This research has significant implications.

ser:Fpbear, I'm not a contributing editor to ancreatic cancer but the 2019 Review offers this; &quot;A wide range of alterations to glycans have been detected in pancreatic cancer, and these show promise as both potential circulating biomarkers and as targets for glycan specific therapies.&quot;  My opinion would be that the work is pre-clinical (even as a biomarker), and therefore inappropriate for an encyclopedic reference edited for the general public.  E.g. it would not be appropriate under either the diagnosis or therapy section yet.  While the references are reviews, I think this is less an issue of an appropriate reference, and more an issue of consensus as to whether the fact stated is appropriate for the article. ser:Ian Furst|Ian Furst (ser talk:Ian Furst|talk) 23:13, 1 May 2019 (UTC)

ser:Ian FurstThanks for the sentence from the review paper, that would also be a good one to use.  There is a &quot;Research directions&quot; section in ancreatic cancer and it would seem appropriate to put this important research into the research section.  Otherwise what would be the purpose of the research section?  I agree this is not intended for the diagnosis or therapy section.
Also, I should note that there are Galectin inhibitors in Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials, including a trial for melanoma and head &amp; neck cancer.  These same inhibitor compounds can be applied to pancreatic cancer therapy if the results continue to be successful.  So it is not just distant pre-clinical work.  The pre-clinical research helps guide toward the target indications; pancreatic cancer in this case.
I'd go along with a referenced sentence in the research section, but see what others say. All of your references seem to be strong reviews.  However, it's not really my area of expertise.  I'm interested to know what people more involved in the topic think.   If it's a tangential area of research, or a burgeoning area.

 Reliable sources 

Hi, I was looking up something to do with ransferrin saturation, and noticed there was a &quot;no references&quot; tag.  I just wanted to check that https://labtestsonline.org/ would do as a reliable resource before I started a tidy up.  As in, I know it is reliable, but is it wiki-suitable?  Thanks, ser:Redfiona99|Red Fiona (ser talk:Redfiona99|talk) 11:59, 2 May 2019 (UTC)

Labtestsonline is maintained by the merican Association for Clinical Chemistry and it displays the HONcode logo. Sounds jolly good as a source. I will have a quick look for journal articles too. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 12:46, 2 May 2019 (UTC)

 Bug in PMC field of Visual Editor's citation template for PMID 

Last couple of times (citation #1 [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sporothrix_schenckii&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=895623637 fixed here] and citation #4 [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sporotrichosis&amp;diff=895626341&amp;oldid=895622696 fixed here]) I've added a citation using a PMID with the &quot;Cite&quot; tool in wikitext editor, the PMC field is corrupted by an extra &quot;PMC&quot; prefix (PMC IDs begin with &quot;PMC&quot;, whereas PMIDs are strictly numeric). I would guess that someone originally wrote the PMC formatter to prepend with &quot;PMC&quot;, then someone &quot;fixed&quot; the PMID citation template to include the PMC prefix.  Anyone know where to take this? I'd go to a Talk page but I don't know which one to use (things seem to be buried a few levels deep). — ser:soupvector|soupvector (ser_talk:soupvector|talk) 15:22, 5 May 2019 (UTC)

ser:Trappist the monk does all things citation templates.  If anyone can explain why Wikipedia's citation templates require that only the numeric part of the actual id code be used, he'll either be that person or know that person.  The answer might be inertia (i.e., we either have to add a switch to l|pmc to detect it, which is relatively expensive, or we'd have to do a massive bot run to change them all to the correct format).
At some point, we should probably look into whether Wikidata is including all the usual identifiers.  For example,  MID|21765645 = PMC3134971 = doi:10.1016/j.ijms.2010.08.003 = NIHMS236863.  We don't include all of the possible identifiers on Wikipedia, but Wikidata should have them all.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 20:38, 5 May 2019 (UTC)

All of these except the last appear to have been fixed in the article.

But, about PMC.  It used to be that cs1|2 wholly rejected PMCIDs with the PMC prefix which was in keeping with the original wikitext-based cs1|2 templates.  That was changed with iff|Module:Citation/CS1/Identifiers|prev|777799222|this edit 29 April 2017.  There is now no requirement that ara|PMC be digits only.  cs1|2 will accept either digits-only or digits with one PMC prefix.  The code strips that prefix because the rendering: &quot;PMC PMC3194828&quot; looks silly (when there are errors, as above, the module renders the PMC as-is in case it just might work – an indicator that something in the module has ang|sco|gang agley).   When a template has ara|pmc|PMC..., the module categorized that article into l|CS1 maint: PMC format.  Gnomes (and ser:Citation bot I think) use this category to strip the prefix from the PMCID which is why it is so near to empty most of the time.

If ve is going to allow itself to add extraneous PMC prefixes as it did above, we should tweak odule:Citation/CS1/Identifiers so that it strips all PMC prefixes instead of just the first one.  Gnomes or bots seem to be keeping the error count down, l|CS1 errors: PMC stays relatively empty, but those volunteers shouldn't have to be continually cleaning up garbage that ve shouldn't be producing in the first place.

lx|pmc is not a citation template so doesn't fall within the bailiwick of cs1|2.  Some thing like this might be used to replace 1} in that template:
invoke:String|replace|source=1} |pattern=^[Pp][Mm][Cc] |replace= |plain=false
testing that idea by replacing 1} with PMC3194828:
invoke:String|replace|source=PMC3194828 |pattern=^[Pp][Mm][Cc] |replace= |plain=false → invoke:String|replace|source=PMC3194828 |pattern=^[Pp][Mm][Cc] |replace= |plain=false

 Reading time 

I heard about :Research:Reading time/Draft Report in a meeting yesterday, and I think some of you may be interested.

Reading time is just what it says on the tin:  how much time people spend reading a given article.  The answer is:  not much.

Specifically, half of people opening a Wikipedia article are gone 25 seconds later.  Only a quarter stay on the same article for as long as 75 seconds.  And it's shorter if the person is from a developed country and/or if the reader is using a mobile device.

We know there is some demand for long articles (think about anyone with a loved one in the hospital, on a desperate quest to learn everything right now), but for the most part, we've got somewhere between 10 seconds and (if we're lucky) two minutes to tell typical readers what we think they need to know.  

So with that in mind, maybe it'd be a good idea for anyone with &quot;favorite&quot; articles to take a look at what you see at the very top of the page.  25 seconds is enough time for an average adult to read about 100 words.  Half the time, that's the most amount of time we've got.  (There are lots of free word-counting tools on the web, or you could estimate it as a third the length of this message.)   Look over the beginning of the articles you care about, and ask yourself:  Are we &quot;burying the lead&quot;, or are we getting straight to the main point?  Are we getting lost in classification systems, etymologies, or technical jargon, or can people glance at the page and discover right away that &quot;Scaryitis is a bacterial infection that causes redness and fatigue, and can be treated with antibiotics&quot;?

I'll admit that article leads haven't always been my favorite thing to work on.  They often feel like a haphazard collection of information that probably belongs elsewhere.  But it's looking like most of our readers never get any further than that.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 19:27, 30 April 2019 (UTC)

 Thanks for that info, |WhatamIdoing|WAID. I'd be willing to place a bet (not that's there's much chance of settling it, short of commissioning specific research) that for many visitors, most of that time is spent looking for a single piece of information in the infobox. If that turns out to be the case, then the decision to move all of the technical, jargon-y stuff out of the infobox was a very wise one. You've given good advice about the lead, and I suggest that it would also be worthwhile making sure that the infobox doesn't contain any &quot;fluff&quot; and encapsulates the key points of the article as concisely as we can manage. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 20:33, 30 April 2019 (UTC)
Thanks for sharing this |WhatamIdoing|WAID. ser:JenOttawa|JenOttawa (ser talk:JenOttawa|talk) 21:39, 30 April 2019 (UTC)
|WhatamIdoing|WAID thanks for sharing.  Two questions: (1) Any idea if this is a consistent statistic across Wikipedia, or unique to WP:MED articles (can we learn from others who do it better)?   (2) When I think back to why I come to Wikipedia, as a user, it's usually for a very specific reason; are we better to build out better ways to find information in the articles?  It's hard to reconcile low site visit time with the popularity of the site.  ser:Ian Furst|Ian Furst (ser talk:Ian Furst|talk) 22:47, 30 April 2019 (UTC)
RexxS, I'd love to have a fully featured tool that could survey people who are navigating away from a page, but I don't think it exists.  There is a very limited, somewhat brittle microsurvey tool that could maybe be used for people who stick around long enough to notice it and aren't in a hurry.  (Anyone who's in a hurry won't reply, so I think that might be particularly prone to a biased sample size.  It still might be better than nothing, though.)
Ian, I haven't looked, but these numbers are likely either &quot;all Wikipedias&quot; or &quot;all sites&quot; (hopefully except Wikidata and Commons, which aren't really for &quot;reading&quot;).  I don't think that any subject-specific questions have been explored.  I gather that they're less certain about the mobile web numbers.  (Hmm, let's see:  I could go read the report, or I could ping the author, who might want to know about this idea of splitting response times by subject area anyway.  Let's  ser:Groceryheist|go with the ping.)
On the second question, I'm wondering whether it might be possible to build a &quot;search on this page&quot; feature for mobile device users.  Surely I can't be the only person who is frustrated by the inability to find a specific part of a long article when there's no ⌘F option in the mobile web browsers.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 06:25, 1 May 2019 (UTC)

Hi everyone. Thanks so much for your interest in my project! We thought about looking at reading times by subject area, but chose to focus on differences across global audiences instead.  One of the challenges is how to identify or measure content areas in a precise and scientific way.  It seems like there are some reasonable approaches that can work if we just focus on 1 language editions (e.g. topic modeling or Wikiprojects).  There's a real possibility that I or someone else might follow up with a look at different types of content, so I'm curious if you have any ideas about measurement, or any other questions that might be interesting. 
 
I do think that short reading times suggest the importance of article ledes, and it's interesting to see your intuitions about why that is important and the relationship to search engines. One thing I would point out is that the fact that reading times are typically short might suggest that people don't have much time or attention to spend reading, but it might also suggest that Wikipedia articles already do a pretty good job making it easy for people to find the information that they are looking for.

I'm really glad you found my work interesting and I'm happy to keep chatting if you have any more comments or questions. ser:Groceryheist|Groceryheist (ser talk:Groceryheist|talk) 19:36, 2 May 2019 (UTC)
Dear ser:Groceryheist|Groceryheist, thank you for the work.  It would be interesting if you could determine any interactions on the page. My questions is, are people looking for something specific, and that is why reading time is low.  My presumption (right or wrong?) is that they would be more likely to land, or pick a link from the table of contents. ser:Ian Furst|Ian Furst (ser talk:Ian Furst|talk) 20:06, 2 May 2019 (UTC)
eply | Ian Furst I agree that is an important question and it can help tease apart the two possible explanations I mentioned above. Mediawiki does not support much of the kinds of browser instrumentation to collect data on readers that it would take to answer that question. However, on the mobile clicks on links to expand sections can be measured and there's a project working on eta:Research:Which_parts_of_an_article_do_readers_read | analyzing that data. Adding more browser instrumentation is a nuanced and multifaceted problem with implications for privacy and for the user experience. That said, I think that if the community supports it then the chances that the WMF finds an ethical and effective way to collect data to answer such questions can increase. ser:Groceryheist|Groceryheist (ser talk:Groceryheist|talk) 20:19, 2 May 2019 (UTC)

To add more detail about the other data (see also File:Which_parts_of_a_(Wikipedia)_article_are_actually_being_read_(Wikimania_2018).pdf|my presentation at least year's Wikimania): 
*A salient fact to keep in mind is that on 60% of mobile pageviews, readers never look beyond the lead section (i.e. don't open any of the subsequent, collapsed sections), as also noted  ikipedia:How_to_create_and_manage_a_good_lead_section#Importance_and_purpose_of_the_lead_section|on WP:LEADCREATE or in an earlier ikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine/Archive_76#Great_bit_of_research_by_User:Tbayer_(WMF)|discussion on this page. 
*To ser:Ian Furst|Ian Furst's question: The &quot;Why the World Reads Wikipedia&quot; surveys mentioned in our draft report offer another source of insight on how often people look for something specific (&quot;around 35 percent of Wikipedia users across these languages come to Wikipedia for looking up a specific fact&quot;). 
*Beyond the lead section, it's also worth being aware that the other sections likely receive vastly differing amounts of attention. We again have some information about this on mobile (see these charts I generated for neumonia and epsis a while ago; I'm no longer working at WMF at this point, but others might be able to access the data for information about other articles). 
*Aside from a section's topic, its heading (i.e. TOC entry) might play a big role in whether readers are going to make it there and find out that it contains the information they are after. At Wikimania last year the idea arose to systematically test this on mobile, ser:Doc James|Doc James and I developed this a bit in hab:T200810 regarding the technical infrastructure that would be necessary, but it would still need to be prioritized among the many competing demands WMF developers have to satisfy.

 Dermatology redirects 

I've just retargeted utographism and actitious urticaria to ermatographic urticaria (they previously pointed to ives) because neither is mentioned in the previous target and the more specific article seemed to more closely mirror definitions elsewhere. I don't really know anything about skin diseases, though, so if anyone would like to take a look and either confirm that this was a good decision or rectify the situation in some other way that would be appreciated. – ser:Arms &amp; Hearts|Arms &amp; Hearts (ser talk:Arms &amp; Hearts|talk) 18:47, 6 May 2019 (UTC)

Thanks for the note.  Those were created as part of a major project.  Did ser:Arms &amp; Hearts|you have a chance to look at and understand ikipedia talk:WikiProject Medicine/Dermatology task force/Missing articles/Archive 1#ICD Redirects (linked in the edit summary when those redirects were created)? 
As for &quot;not mentioned in the current version&quot;, I know that's currently a popular story for deleting old redirects among some editors who hang out at RFD, and it might even make sense for people's names, but a lot of medical content ends up having multiple names from different decades and different countries (see, e.g., ist of paracetamol brand names) – so long that we sometimes can't, and often shouldn't, include them all in the relevant article.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 19:17, 6 May 2019 (UTC)
Yes that an article does not contain the term being redirected is a very silly justification to delete the redirect.

The redirects now reflect ICD-10, by which I mean both trail to the new target (i.e. CD10|L50.3 Dermatographic urticaria). With the caveat that, because it's a edical classification, the ICD often ends up grouping m|similar conditions to the same code. Therefore, other MEDRS may offer &quot;better&quot; redirect options. ser:Little pob|Little pob (ser talk:Little pob|talk) 15:44, 7 May 2019 (UTC)
I'm not the best person to answer the factual question (which is why I only provided context on their creation and didn't opine on that).  
Doc James, any such change should probably happen at P:Redirect rules, where RFD regulars would take note of it, but my conversation at ikipedia talk:Redirect#RFD as cleanup did not suggest that there was much interest in discouraging what you've described as a &quot;very silly justification&quot;.  See, e.g., ikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2018 May 17#Furunculosis of external auditory canal, ikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2019 January 10#Acute HIV Infection and Early Diseases Research Program, and ikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2017 April 10#Cicatricial due to trauma/injury alopecia.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 19:43, 7 May 2019 (UTC)

 Anatomy schematics 

Hello, 

I have come into contact with people from the University of Geneva specialising in &quot;Sciences, Sexes and Indentities&quot; questions [https://unige.ch/ssi/ressources]. They have produced schematics that I find of interest, especially female reproductive organs seem from an oblique angle  [https://twitter.com/VsCyberH/status/1125320505098108928]; since they seem interested in disseminating them widely for educational purposes, I inquired whether they would release the material under a Free licence.

 Therapeutic abortion 

Hi everybody, I would like to report the following issue to users more familiar than me with this kind of matters. A newly registered user recently replaced the content of herapeutic abortion with a redirect to bortion#Induced, claiming that they made it in accord with a decision taken in 2010. The page has been then restored in 2015 and nobody complained for that until now. A quick look at the version that preceeded the redirect showed a pretty poorly sourced article, with a lot of POV issues. In any case, I'm not in condition to assess if the item was good enough to deserve a specific article or the information stated in at bortion#Induced is to be considered enough. Just wanted to signal this situation. Regards, ser:Horst Hof|Horst Hof (ser talk:Horst Hof|talk) 10:14, 10 May 2019 (UTC)

 e|EncycloABC We know that most readers only look at pages for less than 30 seconds, so we try to keep the information in the lead and infobox as concise as possible and limit it to items that the general public will be looking for. As a consequence the template l|Medical resources was created to hold the sort of information that a medical professional might be looking for and placed that at the bottom of the article (assuming medical professionals will be able to scan the entire article), so that the first section of the article remains as simple and uncluttered as possible. That is particularly important as we are trying to translate as many medical articles as possible into as many languages as we can.
 To answer your specific example, The MeSH code for arathyroidectomy would be best placed by using the l|Medical resources template. I've now updated that template to fetch the |P486 from Wikidata, and placed it as a demonstration in arathyroidectomy #External links. You can see how I updated l|Medical resources from its page history if you're interested in updating it further to get more information from Wikidata. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 12:30, 11 May 2019 (UTC)
e|RexxS is it worth moving the procedure classification data from l|Infobox medical intervention to l|medical resources to then free up that infobox for human readable information, or would a new RfC have to be run at the infobox page? ser:Little pob|Little pob (ser talk:Little pob|talk) 16:03, 13 May 2019 (UTC)
 If you want my opinion, I'd just do it. We shouldn't have to run a formal RfC on every edit! But perhaps it's worth waiting to see if anybody here can see any objections to doing that job, and if so, then discussing them on the template talk page (or start an RfC). Template l|medical resources ought to already have the codes needed, so it may be just a question of deprecating the parameters from the infobox and eventually doing a bot/AWB run to remove them and add l|medical resources. It looks like there are currently 1454 transclusions of l|Infobox medical intervention. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 16:58, 13 May 2019 (UTC)

I read a long article about electronic health records recently.  It's main point was that the EHR systems suffered from not understanding the audience.  Should you write down &quot;leg pain&quot;, because that's what the billing office wanted to know, or &quot;osteoarthritis in left knee&quot;, which is what the next provider needs to know?  Every ailment or only the ones that seem important right now?  And, perhaps more importantly in terms of making physicians regret their career choices, now that you can technologically enforce it, you can make that highly trained doctor click all the buttons, to the point that it takes half their work hours.  Back in the day, it was all on paper, and there were nurses and other staff who could manage the bureaucratic end of things.  If I can find it again, I'll post a link.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 21:54, 18 May 2019 (UTC)

My Stedman's Medical Dictionary (27th ed., 2000) lists anisochromasia but doesn't seem to mention anisochromia anywhere, even as a synonym. Note the two articles give subtly different definitions: nisochromasia is described as non-uniform colour within individual red blood cells (consistent with Stedman's), whereas nisochromia is implicitly described as non-uniform colour between different red blood cells.

alkquote|The emissions generated by IQOS contains some of the harmful constituents in tobacco cigarette smoke, though the levels are on average lower than those found in cigarette smoke.[10][11] According to government reports published in the Netherlands,[12] England,[13] and Germany[11], the IQOS product is likely less toxic or harmful than traditional cigarettes.

P:UNDUE aside, this summarizes two of PMI's standard talking points. These points were also used historically in the icotine marketing#&quot;Modified risk&quot; products| marketing of ventilated (&quot;light&quot;) cigarettes.

If you really are &quot;feeling very frustrated&quot; with that article then I think you could edit other topics. It is not healthy for anyone if they are very frustrated.
 I expanded the article and now the content is very neutral without the mass failed verification content. There is content about smoke in the lede and body but we don't need to repeat it many times throughout the article.

 ollege of American Pathologists and Lab Developed tests (LDTs) 

Can we take a closer look at what these folks are up to?  This as just published: http://web.archive.org/web/20190521191008/https://documents.cap.org/documents/general-ldt-faqs.pdf ! 
US-regulation-wise, LDTs are to medical lab testing  as utritional supplements are to pharmaceuticals.  The wild west, buyer-beware.  And it indicates these foxes are the henhouse guards and are trying to keep it that way by opposing any meaningful regulation.  It states that they're opposing any &quot;attempt to regulate the practice of medicine&quot;, they think the wild west situation is cool and should be retained with a &quot;grandfather provision&quot;, yet [https://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Tests/tests.html there's a shit ton of quack testing done]. When I look around at what's advertised, whether to consumers or clinicians, most of the testing advertised are quack LDTs!  This confirms that their interests align with pathologists who want to want to have to do as little work as possible. (Note the lack of caveats.)  So there's a massive conflict of interest wherein they run the [http://webapps.cap.org/apps/docs/laboratory_accreditation/build/pt-tip-sheet.pdf SAAS system] that evaluates lab quality and where it exists, auditing! (Note: It effectively doesn't for LDTs.)  We're talking irreplicable hair testing, heavy metal testing, etc.  --pecial:Contributions/24.130.170.132|24.130.170.132 (ser talk:24.130.170.132|talk) 19:46, 21 May 2019 (UTC)

We have an article at aboratory Developed Test.  It looks like it could be expanded.
I wonder whether there are obviously legitimate uses.  For example, if you use a test as part of a formal clinical trial, and that wouldn't normally be used in clinical practice, is that an LDT, or something else?  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 20:10, 21 May 2019 (UTC)
There are many, many legitimate LDT's in clinical use.  Almost all clinically available genetic testing, including single gene testing, panels and exomes are LDTs.  Anything targeted for the rare disease community is an LDT.  Many assays used in newborn screening are LDTs  Some of the tests on the list of dubious tests provided above are legitimate and the primary test to diagnose metabolic disorders.  The LDT article could certainly be expanded, but the original post on this topic is not neutral.  ser:Canada Hky|Canada Hky (ser talk:Canada Hky|talk) 01:46, 22 May 2019 (UTC)

A lot of totally evidence-free statements there, Canada.  I'm unconvinced.  Just because (someone claims that) much of (gene, newborn... or all of - rares) a kind of testing is LDTs doesn't mean that portion of the testing is legit.  The claims on quackwatch site aren't by some pseudonymous editor.  They're by MDs and are backed by logic and citations.

The lack of regulation given the billions spent is horrifying.  For the most part, there's simply no reasonable assurance that such tests are analytically, let alone clinically, valid.  
One example: ovarian cancer screening tests offered to asymptomatic patients were shown not to work only after patients unnecessarily underwent major surgeries with significant recovery and side effects. http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm519540.htm

 Ralph Northam article 

As you may remember, physician alph Northam drew a lot of criticism for his remarks on letting the parents and their physician decide how to proceed when a nonviable deformed fetus is born.  The talk page is working on a RfC draft after the first one failed to reach a consensus.  It would be good to have a few people with medical experience look it over. ser:Gandydancer|Gandydancer (ser talk:Gandydancer|talk) 15:28, 21 May 2019 (UTC)

Thanks.  It's a mess.  
The main points of contention seem to fall into nursing versus non-nursing issues.  For example, how can nurse practitioners be a so-called id-level practitioner when they have the biggest scope of practice within the entire nursing profession?  (Answer:  Because the highest level of practice within nursing isn't the same as the highest level of all types of healthcare practitioner.)  And why are we comparing physician training against NP training?  (Answer: Because they do some of the same things, and people need to understand the differences, including the differences in their education.)
I've left a note at T:GA to see whether someone could close the long-stalled Good Article nomination review.  That might have been the trigger for the sudden attention to the article.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 22:53, 22 May 2019 (UTC)

 rug distribution 

Some additional attention would seem to be needed, particularly to the subtopics of drug diversion, cold-chain distribution of vaccines and other biologics (for instance, there's some interesting news at https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-05-life-saving-vaccines.html), and the rapid distribution of radioactive pharmaceuticals.

 Probable cite spam 

Hello, I came across some probable cite spam, see [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=Bl%C3%A1zquez-Medela&amp;title=Special%3ASearch&amp;profile=default&amp;fulltext=1&amp;ns0=1 search results for author name]. Many/most of the sources seem to be primary research articles, but I am not sure which of these citations meet P:MEDRS standards (and add relevant information in due weight).
