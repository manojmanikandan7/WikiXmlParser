Morgellons

I'm not sure if any physicians have taken a look at this article.  I've noticed that it has been accumulating external links of varying quality, but I've been hesitant to remove any, given the nature of the article.  Read [http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/medicine/1662162.html?page=1&amp;c=y] for a more balanced review; unfortunately, I couldn't find anything at Pubmed.  --Uthbrian (talk) 00:56, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

I'd let it be.  Looks pretty silly.  The photomicrographs on the web page are clearly textile fibers.  I've got better things to get into edit wars about.  Kd4ttc 01:56, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

Thanks. I never heard of this, but will probably see one next week. It ought to be possible to put together a neutral article along the lines of the one you linked from Popular Mechanics. What is conspicuously missing from the article is a concise list of diagnostic criteria. alteripse 02:04, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

This is a new phenomenon, an entirely patient created &quot;disease&quot;. Probably impossible prior to the internet. Patients chat and diagnose themselves with this. Amazing.--JohnDO|Speak your mind  21:26, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

I've asked a suitably qualified editor to see if he can improve it.  Midgley 17:16, 18 March 2006 (UTC)

Medical resident work hours

Anyone who has an opinion on whether or not medical resident work hours should be merged with residency (medicine), state it here.  Ombudsman will make a big fuss after I merge it (just like he did after I merged Medical residency with residency(medicine)), so I want a consensus here to refer to.  The consensus on  was 4 merge v 2 don't merge, but I'd like some more opinions from those who didn't vote. --CDN99 16:43, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

MERGE.  There is merit to both, though.  The work hour article is long enough, but perhaps would be shortened if put in the context of residency.  I think you could do a nice article on residency and merge them.  I would merge if you are committed to doing a nice edit job as a dedicated project.  It could put the work hour story into perspective. There are patient care issues that are worse with the time limits such as continuity of care that do not get measured in the error rate data.  Kd4ttc

I think I've already voted, but this article was created by Ombudsman to further his doctor-bashing agenda. A good stab at NPOV may be necessary. JFW | T@lk 17:48, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

Disagree with Merge - Both are reasonably long articles although I agree (JFW) that both could do with editing-down and rewording of their current content.  However both need further expanding/boadening:
*The residency article in particular could do with expansion to cover the situation in other countries (currently terribly US-centric).
*The working hours can have a useful discussion on:
**rotas
**doctor fatigue. Is it better to get no sleep during a night shift covering for several teams, or being on-call more often covering fewer patients and so getting some sleep?
**Does doctor fatigue cause greater clinical errors.  Unfortunately, for the juniors medical staff, much of the the evidence in the UK suggested not: it did take longer to make decisions and more care (ie greater effort) made to ensure not making errors (ie more looking up of information or dosages calculated twice to make sure)
**Access to training
**EU vs UK in implementing changes, relationship between those in training and consultants (who after all tend to control the Medical regulatory authorities).
I think good articles of each will be/should be (if they are comprehensive and thoughtfully written) too long to be merged. David Ruben  Talk  19:47, 17 January 2006 (UTC)

Disguised Whale.to

I didn't really know where to put this notice.... John (Whaleto) is now adding a &quot;different&quot; link to all of his articles (ex. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wilhelm_Reich&amp;diff=35795663&amp;oldid=35096713]).  The link is http://  www.vaccination.org.uk, which is quite obviously a copy of the whale.to site, or a transfer of the contents to a different location.  I seem to be on his radar now, so I'll go remove all the links I can find.    --CDN99 18:11, 19 January 2006 (UTC)

A single pro Orthomed editor has been pushing that POV vociferously across several related articles, such as Orthomolecular medicine, redox therapy, Megavitamin therapy, and Linus Pauling.

Electroconvulsive therapy

Is there any truth to the recent edit over there, or is this more anti-medicine propaganda?  --Uthbrian (talk) 17:48, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

Yes was a rant with no links provided to claimed sources. Topic is subject of much controversy and not unlike supposed suicide risk and SSRIs - a study just concluded gives statistical evidence (as opposed to anecdotal rumblings) that &quot;Suicide rates were lower at all ages for men and women in the general population in the interval of high SSRI prescribing. We conclude that there is no evidence from this study of an increase in suicide rates following the introduction of SSRIs in the general population or in a high-risk inpatient sample.&quot; () .  The issue over side effects and ECT has rumbled on for ages and is well covered in the article's , so I have reverted back the edit and suggest any similar major edit be as a result of consensus within the talk page.David Ruben  Talk  18:41, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

Nice study you posted about the SSRIs.  The only thing lacking was the power to discriminate clear effects in the younger age groups-- it would've been nice to resolve the supposed link between SSRI use in children/adolescents and suicide.  It seems that psychiatric interventions are usually targets for criticism.  --Uthbrian (talk) 19:44, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

The anon in question reinserted his material, which I have reverted for poor citation. --JohnDO|Speak your mind  21:23, 20 January 2006 (UTC)

It looks like the anon user has finally posted some refs with his recent edits. --Uthbrian (talk) 02:47, 21 January 2006 (UTC)

These references include some interesting ones but look like they were copied wholesale from the reference sections of Anti-ECT websites. It seems unlikely to me that the editor has been reviewing 50+ year old out of print articles. They include some totally inappropriate ones such as court testimonies, an autobiography by a patient, and a videotaped deposition. These might be ok supporting historical detail but the editor is using them as documentation of ECT side-effects. N.B. The original article seems to be very poorly cited and we could use the assistance of editors with experience in the field to clean up the citations. --JohnDO|Speak your mind 22:36, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

The editor is back and included a long diatribe alleging bias and a double standard. Looking at the poor citations for the rest of the article, he does have a leg to stand on there. However, he also reverted the article again prior to discussion. We need more editors with background. I fear we are headed to an RFC.--JohnDO|Speak your mind 03:49, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

While this is not germane to ECT directly, I've noticed that the anon  contributing to the discussion has committed multiple acts of vandalism.  --Uthbrian (talk) 06:59, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

I've added a new category for medical hygiene.  Not sure if I've populated it to its full extent. Also, I wouldn't know where to begin for the article Medical hygiene. --Uthbrian (talk) 09:59, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

I'm not a doctor and neither are most people, so you might want to either change or paraphrase &quot;prophylaxis of iatrogenic infections&quot; to &quot;prevention of infection during medical treatment&quot; or some such. Mike Dillon 16:19, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

Done. --Uthbrian (talk) 21:01, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

Given the enormous range of topics that have been referred to vaguely as &quot;medical hygiene&quot; in the last 1.5 centuries (like condom use), I wasn't sure what you meant. It sounds like nosocomial infection control is your central topic. Technically, that is not entirely congruent with iatrogenic infection as not all nosocomial infections can be blamed on the doctors or even specifically on the care itself, while there are a few subsets of iatrogenic infection that are not strictly nosocomial. Maybe several redirects are in order. Good topic though. alteripse 21:35, 22 January 2006 (UTC)

Admittedly, I created the category after seeing Antimicrobial prophylaxis in surgery in .  What do you think should be done with the cat? Is it worth salvaging or should  I recommend it for deletion?  --Uthbrian (talk) 22:46, 22 January 2006 (UTC)
The list of topics is a good list. Leave it. Im a nitpicker about terminology sometimes. alteripse 03:56, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

Footnotes

Have you seen ? I think it's a great idea, and much easier to use and maintain than the other footnote systems I've seen. I've been testing it out on Metolazone and I think it's working pretty well. Well, hope it's able to help someone! — Knowledge Seeker দ 06:38, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

 I have seen it, but I don't like it. It makes the text very hard to read while editing. It is sad that there still isn't a better referenceing system. --WS 10:37, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

It's a compromise. Alternatively, articles would need a seperate section where all the footnotes go. Of course the new system implies numbering problems. In my mind, what we need is a seperate window where users can list their sources using standardised formats (web page, newspaper, scientific journal, radio broadcast). In the article text, all he'd have to do is click on the relevant source. This approach would require modification of the editing window and heavy scripting, something the developers may be a bit loathe to do for compatibility reasons. JFW | T@lk 22:11, 23 January 2006 (UTC)

I agree that it has its problems, but I still definitely prefer it over the old systems. The one system where you had to have the references in order and if someone rearranged the text all the references got mixed up was terrible. The other one where you can link text and footnotes isn't bad, but for someone like me who often uses the same source for multiple pieces of information, this new system is the best I've seen so far. And I'm sure it will be improved. Anyway, at least we have several options from which to choose. — Knowledge Seeker দ 05:05, 24 January 2006 (UTC)

Cite does seem to produce automatically sequencially numbered references and good duplicated-references, but I agree difficult to view page when editing.  Two questions
# Have you tried inserting multiple links to the same reference (e.g. when one provides a link to the whole article at a journel's website and a link to an abstract at PMID) ?
# Does this work with the full reference markup provided by WS's bookmarklet of the PubMed-PMID tool (see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Clinical_medicine#References here]) which I think gives a consistant citation style, that should be encouraged ? David Ruben  Talk  05:14, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

I'm not sure I understand your first question. A footnote may contain multiple links; is that what you're asking? Metolazone#References has a couple. I haven't used Wouterstomp's bookmarklet (I don't user Internet Explorer), but I can't think of any reason why it wouldn't work—you can put basically any wiki markup in the footnote, as far as I can tell. — Knowledge Seeker দ 06:29, 25 January 2006 (UTC)

I have partially solved the problem of dificulty editing an article that uses cite.  Take a look at this sample article.  The reason it's not a complete solution is that in the references section, it backlinks to an area that is no longer visible.  If there was a way to completely disable backlinking, I would consider this a complete solution. Ksheka 13:55, 21 February 2006 (UTC)

The solution is not to list all the references in an initial hidden section (using &lt; !...&gt;), which in the reference section will count as the 1st occasion of each citation, but rather include the  details in the main article as each reference first occurs. Subsequent duplication of a reference is made by using just the reference name (i.e. ). See reworked example. Instructions in  are really not clear for a new user (being more about how the software implements), so unless people wish to discuss this new system further, I will in a few days add some simple instructions under [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Clinical_medicine#References WikiProject Clinical medicine#References] David Ruben  Talk  13:10, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

Cerebral sinus thrombosis

I'm starting to wonder if we actually have a page on this. I've checked for various spellings. In any case, I'm interested in writing that from scratch, using Prof J. Stam's April 2005 review in the NEJM as an outline. What title should I use? JFW | T@lk 21:43, 26 January 2006 (UTC)

Good topic, use it as the title. I have taken care of one case resulting from extreme iron deficiency and another from extreme hypernatremic dehydration. alteripse 01:37, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

Looks like Hypernatremic dehydration is also missing. Perhaps it could be a redirect to Hypernatremia. Mike Dillon 02:45, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

Also, Hypernatremia has a red link to Dural sinus thrombosis, which I would assume should redirect to the Cerebral sinus thrombosis (unless the &quot;cerebral sinus&quot; and &quot;dural sinus&quot; aren't the same sinus). For that matter, the sinuses are not even discussed in the &quot;Composition&quot; section of Telencephalon or in the Cerebral cortex article. Mike Dillon 02:56, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

FWIW, Google gives &quot;dural sinus thrombosis&quot; 25,600 hits and just 952 for &quot;cerebral sinus thrombosis&quot;. --David Iberri (talk) 12:09, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

P.S. I just wrote dural venous sinuses --David Iberri (talk) 12:17, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

This is why WikiProject Clinical medicine rules! You all are so methodical and efficient. Mike Dillon 15:51, 27 January 2006 (UTC)

I like sinus thrombosis, cerebral sinus thrombosis, dural sinus thrombosis, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis.  In practice, I have tended to use more specific terms, such as superior sagittal sinus thrombosis, transverse sinus thrombosis, thrombosis of the torcula herophili, and so on.  I'd suggest that all of the above (ok, maybe not T. of the T.H.) be redirected to whichever you pick.  :)  -- Ikkyu2 04:18, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

Naming convention

I have looked and looked and looked but cannot find a guideline or any other statement in wikipedia that naming conventions of diseases should be written as their proper medical name, as opposed to the common term.  I am assuming there must be policy somewhere since heart attack redirects to myocardial infarction, but can anyone point me in the right direction?  If there such a statement, I would be able to write any future articles using that convention. Thanks. - Dozenist talk 16:14, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

Oh, ok.  I saw it written there, but I expected it to be mentioned elsewhere, such as .  Is there any way for this naming convention to be mentioned on WP:NAME or one similar to it so that the naming of articles on diseases be under some wikipedia policy or guideline? And thanks for the quick response. - Dozenist talk 21:05, 29 January 2006 (UTC)
Well, in the event that there is no other &quot;official&quot; page that this naming convention is written, I suggest that we bring the topic up in  and submit it as a proposal.  Otherwise, we will eventually see continuing objections to the naming of disease-related articles. - Dozenist talk 19:12, 1 February 2006 (UTC)

Hypergymnasia

I just happened to find Hypergymnasia, created a few days ago. Are there any references for this phenomenon? There are only 51 Google hits. Mike Dillon 23:03, 29 January 2006 (UTC)

I would have used the term compulsive exercise, but if I were going to dress it in greek because excessive exercise is too intelligible, I would have picked a term that meant something different from &quot;excessive nakedness&quot;. alteripse 00:44, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

Alteripase summarized this as &quot;How con you be excessively naked&quot;.  I'm afraid to tread on the category of people who are excessively naked.  Kd4ttc 00:52, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

Um, gymnotes means nakedness; gymnasia means &quot;exercise&quot; or &quot;training while naked&quot;, not just &quot;nakedness&quot;. (per Middle Liddell) Mike Dillon 01:09, 30 January 2006 (UTC)
Well I have the old unabridged Liddell (&quot;my Liddell's bigger than your Liddell...&quot;), but I have to confess it confirms that exercise is an alternative meaning, so I stand reluctantly corrected. alteripse 01:42, 30 January 2006 (UTC)

I'll do some merges and redirects. Thrombolysis != fibrinolysis. Thrombolysis is the pharmacological treatment of thrombotic disease with the help of agents that accellerate physiological fibrinolysis. JFW | T@lk 11:26, 3 February 2006 (UTC)

Bates Method
I hate to waste anyone's time on non-mainstream topics, but I would be much obliged to anyone with a bit of spare time interested in lending a hand to keep things neutral in Bates Method.

Wikipedia Quack Watch

Is anyone doing this?  I'm starting to see quackery everywhere on the WP; it recently invaded my pet article epilepsy, in the form of a representative of the IAHP.

I made some  edits to that article, but it got me wondering if anyone is keeping an eye out for this on a larger scale, in the name of promulgating our particular systemic bias.  (qq.v. ).  Ikkyu2 04:09, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

There is quackery all around. Most of it is confined to specific articles, which tend to be poor on evidence. The most trouble we have had is with orthomolecular characters, who aggressively promote their version of pseudoscience (see  for an interesting exchange).

I share your worries about systemic bias, but I've also encountered the following: almost all alternative treatments inserted into Wikipedia are a titre personnel. &quot;Dr Donald Quack, M.D. [note the prominent display of academic qualifications] has pioneered the use of lemongrass in gastric ulcers.&quot; Most of this almost immediately amounts to self-promotion, vanity, advertising and what-have-you. Personally I hotly agree that the common cold article should mention echinacea, as well as the poor results of this plant in controlled trials. We need to update benign prostatic hypertrophy to mention saw palmetto, and plantar fasciitis cannot be complete without the magnetic insoles.

Sadly, those editors interested in advancing the alternative viewpoint have typically been belligerent, subversive, aggressive, rude and POV. Wikipedia could do with more real information on alternative medicine. JFW | T@lk 20:06, 12 February 2006 (UTC)

I was just asking if anyone's put together a QuackWatch page - somewhere us physiciwikipedian types could go to see what the latest nonsense du jour is, and contribute our POV.  For instance, IAHP started off as a glowing endorsement of a quack organization; now that I'm done with it, anyone who reads the article will realize that there's serious controversy about their methods.

We should have a page to co-ordinate our efforts against these types of organizations. And I say this as someone who is an expert on a particular POV, namely that of traditional Western medicine; not to have our POV included in articles like this makes the Wikipedia worse.

I realize this goes against the spirit of Wiki, but perhaps for certain topics, there needs to be a minimum standard level of expertise required in order to get your edits published.  It does end up diminishing the quality of information when people essentially &quot;spam&quot; the wiki with angry, politicized and scientifically unsupported claims.  At some point, I would love to see a Wiki created by medical professionals geared toward medical professionals that would allow a searchable, hyperlinked nexus of medical literature, which could be added to, and edited in real time as new articles came out.  Text books are always about 2-3 years behind, and are not easily searchable.  Usually, when you need info, you need it &quot;at the bedside&quot; and you do not have time to do a medline search to answer quick questions about treatment options for unusual conditions.--Dleicken 06:38, 13 March 2006 (UTC)

*I like the sentiment, but part of the benefit of an open policy is that knowledgeable laypeople can also contribute:
**They may devote far more time researching and keeping abreast of the totality of published literature, compared to myself as a Generall Practictioner (eg IBSgroup is I belive not a doctor but is engaged in useful collaboration with a gastroenterologist over the IBS article).
**Also non-medics can improve the English of doctors, making articles much easier to read.
*If one has a doctor-only service, then the risk is that the articles are seen as authoritive and as such individual Doctor editors might be held more accountable for the information:
**e.g. if Dr A asserts X &amp; Y in 2005 and then Dr B the following year updates X but fails edit recent advancement in Y, then is Dr A or B liable for harm caused by someone following the out-of-date point Y ?
**A doctor only-site might also be seen as providing authorative &amp; comprehensive medical advice, the last thing any medical website wants to be seen as providing (e.g. If an article on abnormal LFTs mentions just &quot;remember Wilson's disease&quot;, then though this is a useful note to other doctors, it clearly should not be inferred that all patients should always be tested for this)
*If the site is closed, i.e. only doctors can access the site, then it will be less widely used:
**Other doctors are unlikely to encounter the site (wikipedia will not appreciate an advertising footnote on every medical-topic page stating &quot;for correct information see wikidoctor&quot;)
**Wikipedia is the largest encyclopadia, and it is increasingly likely that patients will refer to it - I would like to think they are provided with a reasonable background to a topic, rather than having to waste much of a consultation time arguing against misinformation from a long computer printout they wave in my face, before even being able to offer the correct state of medical science/application. 
*If one is to restrict a site to doctors, how is one to verify this? Faillure to do so risks subtle vandalism that may be very hard for a non-specialist to pick up. Anyone can look up my GMC number here in the UK, so proof of identify comes not from my knowing my registration number but having a current physical certificate. Who is going to want to send their original certificates to a website, and which website wants to try vetting authenticity of documents received and being responsible for safe return. Then there is the USA - is there one registration systems or one-per state ? And lets not forget rest of English speaking world (Australia, Canada, Carribean, New Zealand, Ireland etc), and I know I can not even read most of the world's non-english medical certificates (could be laundery bills or certificate of being a Quack). Tricky...
*Having stated all this, there already seems to be the start of such a wiki - http://ganfyd.org &quot;The free medical knowledge base that anyone can read and any registered medical practitioner may edit. Ganfyd is a collaborative medical reference by medical professionals and invited non-medical experts.&quot; I have not really used the site myself, so am unable to report on its strengths or weaknesses.

It is very strong  I wrote the licence for it, and have a considerable interest as well as being b'crat and having root access to the servers.  An interesting contrast between working there and here, apart from the exceding high standard we impose upon ourselves - none but the best anecdotes, and those in AnecdoteBoxes - is the complete absence of nuts, and a complete absence of friction and emotional-based argument.  Thus far.  I believe that with the number and range of doctors, and the degree of care we apply, Ganfyd is now a  and therefore of service to this community.  The two-way traffic will only improve both, but it may be particularly interesting to observe how an article written by one person and simultaneously added to both Ganfyd and WP diverges.

Compliance &amp; Concordance
I have had a go at writing Compliance (medicine) which is both about drug compliance and treatment more generally. In the UK, at least, this became very 'fashionable' to discuss some years ago and the Government (NHS) developed a term 'Concordance'. 'Concordance', aside from confusing most people, was meant to be an approach at engaging patients in their treatment care to jointly decide and agree upon options, and so (hopefully) reduce non-compliance.

I do think the two terms (Compliance and Concordance) so closely deal with the same issues that splitting them into 2 article will just end up duplicating most points.

This is (potentially) a large topic, so I would welcome any comments or contributions.David Ruben  Talk  16:44, 18 February 2006 (UTC)

A lot of shady epidemiological evidence is being thrown up on this topic by a single editor, an admitted anti-DU activist.

*Maybe I can take this opportunity to bring up a dilemma with the template:  I've been tying to improve the Tourette syndrome article (currently on a mini-break because of some family issues, but I'll go at it again in about a month).  I can't make the order suggested in the template work in that article.  Prognosis (which is a little understood aspect of Tourette's) affects how one writes about diagnosis and treatment, so putting it below those two doesn't seem to work ?  Since MOST people with TS get better with time, many adults are misdiagnosed, and treatment isn't always needed ... so prognosis information needs to come up front, as it does impact treatment decisions and even prevalence estimates.  I could use help on this, since I'm not a medical professional. Sandy 14:09, 28 February 2006 (UTC)
I have split out the page as described above. I'll try to make sure that for the next month or so that changes there are also discussed here during the transition, but I'd recommend adding that page to your watchlist. Per Sandy's query above: one option might be to include watchful waiting as a potential &quot;treatment&quot; for Tourette syndrome.

Thanks for the suggestions, Arcadian.  The &quot;sociological and cultural aspects&quot; was a term for lumping together a lot of stuff that may not belong in a medical article.  I'm still fishing around for a better title to that section, and am not convinced of the place for that information in the article anyway, but it's &quot;popular&quot; informaton that is difficult to delete.  It's interesting that you like the title of that section.  When I have time to work on the article again, maybe I can find a way to make that section more workable.

Coombs test needs some help

Hi, the Coombs test () needs some help/guidance/opinions on how the structure of the article should be and how the diagram in the article should look like. The discussion about the diagram also continues on my talk page.

Several points of the article are at discussion, like the general structure, the complexity of the article and how to make it suitable for the non-medical crowd, and how the diagram should look like in order to be comprehendable.

The general goal (IMO) would be to get other people's opinions on the article and make it correct and suitable for a wide audience (like every other Wikipedia article...).

Hope you can help! A. Rad 16:18, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

Articles for the Wikipedia 1.0 project
Hi, I'm a member of the , which is looking to identify quality articles in Wikipedia for future publication on CD or paper. We recently began assessing using , and we are looking for A-class, B-class, and , with no POV or copyright problems. Can you recommend any suitable articles? Please post your suggestions here. Cheers, Shanel 20:15, 9 March 2006 (UTC)

Finally some progress towards WP 1.0, but there will need be some careful thinking as to precise definitions the criteria use, and how apply the criteria both in general and to medical topics. I brain-storm a few thoughts below: 
*Even medical articles which have reached Featured status have since been heavily edited (e.g. Asthma) often with linkspams, so which version will get used ? Other articles that cover topics farely comprehensively e.g. Asthma get heavily edited with alternative points of view &amp; linkfarms.
*Medicine advances and few articles in wikipedia on medical topics are concerned mostly with historical narrative which might be seen as &quot;complete&quot;. Hence an article on Cancer X is likely to have its description of what it is (a cancer of X) &amp; date of 1st description remain constant over time. But if a new test or a new chemotherapy combination replaces the existing gold standards, then the article needs heavy editing. Who decides who may update a topic? There is a further risk that a specialist from a specialist research-centre adds description of some new test/treatment as if replacing the gold-standard (which it might in a few years and few extra millions spent), yet this remains unavailable outside of a research-specialist centre or anywhere in other countries (who continue using existing gold standards). An example of bias might be pneumonia and whilst it reads like a good medical textbook, most cases are treated in community by GPs who have no access (in UK) to performing blood cultures, can't treat on basis of Xrays (may be requested &amp; taken, but report takes few days to 2 weeks to come back from hospitals), and must empiricallty treat whilst awaiting outcome of sputum cultures.
*Medical topics are covered in a patchy manner. Hence however brilliant a featured article might be on the Aspartate transaminase liver blood test (with description of enzyme identidfication, structure, test development and interpretation), the article is not going to be included in WP 1.0 if the other LFTs enzymes articles, hepatitis or liver disease articles are poor (I doubt WP 1.0 will have an article on a Boeing 747's front wheel brake, if article on either the 747 or Boeing are not worthy of inclusion). David Ruben  Talk  14:12, 13 March 2006 (UTC)

Thanks for your response.  We are in fact looking at both importance and quality as issues - the posting is just our initial contact to get the discussion started.  There are many thousands of articles we want to include, and we will be very dependent on the individual WikiProjects to guide us through.  Before we publish each project will probably need to tell us (a) Which articles are the most important (b) Which articles make up &quot;complete sets&quot; (for example we want all of the Solar System planets or the chemical elements, not just some of them) and (c) Which of them are good quality articles?  I know that the Medicine WikiProject already has a  which is probably the ideal way to keep track of such things (would  cover a lot of material from this project too?  If not, then what we probably want initially is a list of the articles that you consider &quot;worth publishing&quot; - decent quality, and important enough.  Any suggestions?

Anti-psychiatry

Hello - I was wondering if anyone associated with this WikiProject cared to take a look at Anti-psychiatry, which currently strikes me as a big pile of unsourced POV. It's not my area, though, so I feel limited in the amount of good I can do there. --Dcfleck 14:17, 14 March 2006 (UTC)

Regarding the anti-psychiatry page, I agree that is needs some work.  Psychiatry is actually my field, but I wonder if that doesn't actually make me a bit unqualified, or over-qualified, or something, to edit an article about &quot;anti-psychiatry&quot;.  I'm actually quite glad to know more about the existence of this &quot;movement,&quot; or at least this collection of ideas -- and given that psychiatrists are the only speciality of medicine which routinely treats patients against their will, I'm also quite glad to have a set of vocal, opinionated critics around to keep checks and balances robust. Unfortunately, they're going to shoot themselves in the foot and come off sounding like an angry fringe if they don't keep things factual, well-referenced, and NPOV.  I'll have a look around it, and see what I think I can contribute, but I think that major changes or criticism of the page might be more well-received by thoughtful, more ostensibly psychiatry-neutral people (presumably such as you both, Dcfleck and Sandy).

Passive smoking and relative risk

Speciality templates

I started a  (which is pretty messy at the moment/confused) because was based on the gastroenterology template.  In creating the template I realized that the gastroenterology one isn't really about gastroentrology-- it is about diseases, signs and symptoms (ie. nausea and vomiting are NOT diseases) of the GI tract.  Many of the diseases on the gastroenterology template are family medicine things... others are surgical things (e.g. appendicitis).  Where are we going to draw the line?  

I think the gastroenterology template -- in its current form would be better named &quot;Signs, symptoms and disorders of the gastrointestinal tract&quot;.

The other question is-- are we going to make templates based on systems?  The gastroenterology template is a systems template... it isn't based on the speciality.  Is there a guideline about these sorts of templates?  

I think we should have two sets of templates-- one on the organ systems... another set for the specialities.  For the speciality templates-- we have to decide how to structure them.  The GS template is a mess at the moment 'cause I couldn't really decide between diseases and surgeries.  For the GS template... it probably makes more sense to have the surgeries listed--what a surgeon does and have in brackets what the surgeries are done for (i.e. large bowel resection (trauma, colon cancer, bowel infarct due to septic emboli, volvulus), appendectomy (appendicitis). 
Any thoughts on this?  

It looks like the  will need some revision.  I mention it here-- 'cause the templates are stuck on the main page of the clinical medicine project-- and it doesn't neatly fit into the heading &quot;Template_for_medical_conditions&quot;.

Well, I'd argue with this: &quot;Use of ICD or other classification systems is preferable.&quot; It's quite clear to me that use of a clear explanation in English is preferable, and I'd also argue that ICD-9 or ICD-10 etc codes are of no use to anyone using this encyclopedia: such codes are used to facilitate billing rather than understanding. - Nunh-huh 19:47, 4 April 2006 (UTC) ( there's also a small spelling error in the preceding sentence, &quot;varities&quot; for &quot;varieties&quot;).

&quot;I'd also argue that ICD-9 or ICD-10 etc codes are of no use to anyone using this encyclopedia: such codes are used to facilitate billing rather than understanding.&quot;
That is incorrect. Although they may be used for billing, the ICD codes are used for what they say: International Classification of Disease. This is helpful if people in different parts of the world want to be sure that they are talking about the  same thing. It is also immensely useful for audit and epidemiology.Jellytussle 20:44, 4 April 2006 (UTC)
Your mileage may differ. They are codifications made for statistical work - and mostly used for billing - and &quot;using the same code&quot; for a thing is no substitute for actually talking about the same thing. - Nunh-huh 22:03, 4 April 2006 (UTC)
Well all I can say is that in my own practice, in a socialised medical system (the British NHS) where billing is generally not an issue, these codes are very useful. Your practice may well differ. Where do you work? There is also an argument that ICD codes act as a standard baseline on the wiki medical pages, which are often subject to a large degree of vague editing. I agree that the ICD code is not a substitute for a well written discourse. It is however complementary. Comments from a pathologist would be helpful. Jellytussle 22:32, 4 April 2006 (UTC)

(For the benefit of others monitoring the thread, more details are available at International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems. I believe Jellytussle's position is more well supported than Nunh-huh's, but IANAD.) --Arcadian 22:51, 4 April 2006 (UTC)
IYWAD, you'd have realized that ICD-9 codes have no particular impact on, and no discerible benefit for, clinical patient care. The codes are usually provided by coders who have never seen that patient and possess only a rudimentary understanding of clinical medicine. Their use even as statistical data is problematic, and tolerable only because it has so little effect on anything. - Nunh-huh 23:41, 7 April 2006 (UTC)

I've added some comments to  --Colin°Talk 15:55, 5 April 2006 (UTC)


In UK general practice codes (Read rather than directly ICD) are generally added by the clinicians treating the patient.  In specialist IT systems they are generally built into workflow, or should be, and thus added as part of what the clincians do.  In a hospital which uses electronic notes they are likely to be made using some codes, inevitably if the terminal is in the basement they will be entered by someone from paper notes...

In the 70s the Reigenstrief Institute was doing work on clincial hinting using codification of the out patient notes...that leads us into ontology and computing.

Although there is a need to define the meaing of the phrases used in codes - the rubric - they are less variable in interpretation between doctors than are plain English notes.  There is alot of work on this.  Midgley 16:36, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

Carpal tunnel syndrome, etc.

Hello, all. This is just Wikipedia Quackwatch Part Deux, really; but I'm instead plonking it here in a barefaced attempt to get it read by more of you. My knowledge of medicine is minimal but I think that (because I don't smoke?) my nose is fairly sensitive to the aroma of spam. And I sense this aroma a lot of the time in Carpal tunnel syndrome, Repetitive strain injury, Soft tissue therapy, etc. (No, I haven't dared look at anything related to weight reduction.) Commonly, a clinic or an MD is cited has having shown or achieved this or that; even if the claim is true, there are of course clinics and clinics, and MDs and MDs. Mainstream medical opinion may err at times but I trust it very much more than I trust some single glib self-described MD whose company website is set up to take credit card orders.

One cynical view is that the core of WP is really just a congeries of fancruft: it's a good place to find out about Star Wars minutiae, but no sane person would use it as any kind of medical reference. Cynical or otherwise, that seems not to be true: Carpal tunnel syndrome is linked from [http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/tech/weekly/2416635.html this Houston Chronicle page]. Even though this Chronicle page right now doubles as an advert for McDonald's junk food, some people might take it seriously.

What we need is some good sense from experts. Thank you! -- Hoary 10:16, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

Carpal tunnel syndrome is real, but its relationship to &quot;repetitive strain injury&quot; is what is controversial. --Gak 18:37, 12 April 2006 (UTC)

I think there's more about it that's controversial. Take a look at [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carpal_tunnel_syndrome&amp;diff=48032428&amp;oldid=48015820 this diff], which shows the multiple, consecutive (and hazily spelled) contributions by a single IP. After he'd put it all in, I reverted the lot. He'd put this stuff in previously; it was reverted previously. He'll put it in again, I suppose. Many articles are battlegrounds between people more or less overtly selling nostrums and spam-zappers such as myself. My knowledge of medicine is low even by layman standards, and I'm uncomfortable editing such pages. I'd delightedly forfeit my right to do so via some new arrangement whereby only people with qualifications from recognized medical institutions could edit, but that's not going to happen any time soon. -- Hoary 03:24, 13 April 2006 (UTC)
I tend to think the revert wars have some use--i.e. you actually learn things along the way.  If you take BS some guy is trying to ram down your throat and out-smart 'em by explaining it better-- (so they understand) everybody wins.  Beyond that... I think peer-review will eventually come --see . Nephron  T| 04:31, 13 April 2006 (UTC)
Yes, conceivably. I don't think there's much chance of persuading the rammer of BS that he's wrong, because I suspect that he is doing it as a way of spamming his website and thus of increasing his personal revenue. On the other hand I have no hard evidence for this and no inclination to go looking for any: even if I found it and presented it, the proven spammer would likely lie low for a short period and then pop up with a new username. By becoming involved in an edit war, then (aside from the various things that are wrong with edit wars), I may indeed manage to educate myself to some extent in the issues involved. But dribs and drabs of such &quot;education&quot; can't rival a halfway decent medical school. Underinformed edit warring seems an absolutely batty way to create articles in anything calling itself an encyclopedia (as opposed to, for example, an elaborate multi-player game, or parody). I do understand that the time and energies of those people who are medically qualified are probably much better devoted to the practice and teaching of medicine than to battles with quacks in this rickety edifice. Trouble is, people may take seriously what they read in Wikipedia.... Hoary 05:31, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

I am indeed a orthopaedic hand surgeon (MD) and took an interest in the carpal tunnel section.  I made the mistake of giving a @#$#% what was said in the entry.  Once I understood the wiki concept I thought it was so cool and was personally affronted by the selfishness displayed by the spammers that have frequently made the entry their home.  As I entered in the CTS discussion area, CTS is a hot $$$$ item and people are out to make money out of it.  Wiki is free advertising so people are quick to grab, their entries like so much graffiti on a billboard.  I have no authority, but was happy to see honest users take an interest in maintaining the purity, honesty and selflessness of the information.  Contact me for questions or if there is anything I can do to help.

Roger, what you can do to help is . . . well, what you're already doing to help. (Many thanks!) But right now there's just one of you, without commercial motivation, versus several users who do seem to have commercial motivation. I hope that you can get more support here (while realizing that other medically qualified contributors to WP may already have their hands full keeping snake-oil-sellers out of articles on diet, sex, and all those other mass obsessions that fill the incoming &quot;Trash&quot; folder of my email account). -- Hoary 07:06, 13 April 2006 (UTC)

Radiocontrast and Contrast medium

I think Contrast medium should be merged into Radiocontrast.  It probably doesn't need much discussion, considering the amount of text in the two articles, but since I don't know enough to do the merge myself anyway...discuss :-) 

I agree. JFW | T@lk 08:30, 17 April 2006 (UTC)

I (respectfully) disagree.  As I understand it, contrast media for MRI studies would not count as radiocontrast. Maybe this article (Contrast medium) should rather be expanded past radioopaque substances, to encompass contrast media for other studies.  For example, bubbles used in echocardiography to assess for septal defects? Terrace4 00:45, 25 April 2006 (UTC)

Embryology - What is to be done about it?
{I originally posted this elsewhere in the Project}
I noticed when adding in information for some articles (serous membrane) a reference to the embryological origin of these stuctures would be useful. Adding these in I noticed many of my Wikilinks went nowhere, terms like trilaminar embryo didn't exist on Wikipedia! I poddled along and created a stub for this particular entry (which I believe should be merged with a larger article) but I see a greater need for a general overview of human embryogenesis.

 I'm in favor of leaving out both the Dr. and the M.D.  Otherwise the article looks like something about a dubious product or practice that's trying to pad on the credentials.  Andrew73 21:53, 8 May 2006 (UTC)

Interesting question.  Let's see... is pretty clear that &quot;Dr.&quot; should not be used.  It's not as clear about the degree, but from the examples given I'd say it's leaning on the side of against.  (But then, there's also some fairly recent and inconclusive discussion on the corresponding talk page...)  — JVinocur (talk • ) 22:09, 8 May 2006 (UTC)
I'm all for leaving anything but the name out. If it's important that he/she is/was a doctor, then it should be mentioned in the text InvictaHOG 23:46, 8 May 2006 (UTC)
Agreed. MD as a primary medical degree is a N. American thing. In other parts of the world, MD is a purely postgraduate qualification. In addition, in the UK, for eaxmple, surgeons are referred to as Mr, Mrs, Miss, or Ms, ie anything but Dr. Avoid confusion and leave out all but the name.Jellytussle 00:02, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

The combination of Dr and M.D. is hyper-American and is also, as Andrew rightly says, indicative of advertising dubious stuff. I wouldn't object to &quot;Dr John Smith is a physician from [...]; he obtained his M.D. in 1946 at Johns Hopkins [...]&quot;. In the public debate many people are known by their titles (but I would avoid boldfacing the title). JFW | T@lk 11:49, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

Question
Is there any consensus on what to do if there is an article regarding an instrument and an article detailing the use of that instrument? For example, Tonometer and Tonometry. Should both articles exist or should one redirect to the other? -AED 18:33, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

Same with Proctoscopy and Proctoscope. --Steven Fruitsmaak 20:26, 21 May 2006 (UTC)

I vote for combining the two articles and using a redirect from the other name. As to whether to make the instrument or the procedure the primary article, I don't think we have a policy and I suggest you take your pick and make it how you want. alteripse 02:40, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

My vote would also be to combine them. Does anyone have any preference for which direction the redirect takes place? For example, Endoscope redirects to Endoscopy, but Ophthalmoscopy redirects to Ophthalmoscope. I don't know if consistency in this really matters to anyone, but I thought I would check. -AED 03:58, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

The tool is part of the science, but the science isn't part of the tool - so I'd vote for science as the main and tools as redirects. Leevanjackson 10:13, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

Might the tool article contain detail of the history - the early petrol-driven ophthalmoscopes for instance - whereas the science of using it would probably focus on the current use of the current devices? Midgley 11:27, 22 May 2006 (UTC)
Petrol-driven ophthalmoscopes? Really? Now I am imagining the even more primitive wood-burning ones! alteripse 11:45, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

 I agree, one article with a redirect from the tool to the science. --Steven Fruitsmaak 12:57, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

 Can I throw the cat amongst the canaries and note that Tonometry (both applanation and indentation) is used to assess capsular fibrosis and capsular contracture of reconstructed breasts by both aesthetic surgeons and oncological surgeons/radiation oncologists? There is no mention of this in the article as it stands.Jellytussle 16:31, 22 May 2006 (UTC)

Breast implant article
I would like to encourage other physcian wikipedians to review the swamp that the article on breast implants has become. It's devolved into the personal crusade by one editor  to make the entry into a partisan treatise on why breast implants are evil &amp; how the medical establishment can't be trusted to study the issue. For those unfamiliar with the systemic reviews of this see this summary for a starting point[http://www.mhra.gov.uk/home/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&amp;dID=18485&amp;noSaveAs=1&amp;Rendition=WEB], [http://www.tga.gov.au/docs/pdf/breasti4.pdf]. As web-based sources like wikipedia become more common as a tool for reference, we have a duty to take some editorial control over medical areas to strive for evidenced based medical information being presented. I don't like the tension that is developing with this other editor (who is both bright &amp; energetic, but hostile to the mainstream views) &amp; ideally more people familiar with interpreting the medical literature would contribute to diffuse this log-jam.Droliver 23:49, 2 June 2006 (UTC)

I cannot stop wondering if jglaw is a compensation lawyer attempting to maximise negative exposure of breast implants. To speak with my old friend Ombudsman: behind every POV debate is a conflict of interest. JFW | T@lk 23:35, 3 June 2006 (UTC)
Declared to be a lawyer - doctor of jurisprudence user box and other comments.  However the interest seems to be personal, in that she made the mistake of seeking and getting breast implants and now resents this happening.  I'll not link, but it was all on WP.  I do observe Ombudsman with some fascination, the two are not similar, Ombudsman applying his considerable energies to a wide variety of causes and articles.  I'm unsure if other areas than medicine observe that editors whose range only includes one single topic are not the most encyclopaedic contributors?  I feel there is scope for an essay somewhere in the WP space on the difference between being knowledgeable and writing of a topic, and bending WP to the serives of an all-consuming passion.   I suggest meanwhile that jglaw is due for an RFC, based on past and present behaviour, but I seem to be involved in enough RFcs and other aspects that I'm not the best person to initiate it, if indeed it is needed.  Midgley 16:09, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

How do you define &quot;one single topic&quot;, Midgley? Ombudsman has in fact contributed quite a lot of fairly encyclopedic material - but it lacks in balance (the backbone of gold salts matched the contributions of medically qualified editors). I wonder what the RFAr will bring. In contrast, jglaw is a single-issue editor who will either submit to policy or go violently in a blaze of fire and blocks. I've witnessed this process enough to predict the outcome. Some editors will simply not agree that their forcefully held opinion is just... opinion and cannot replace fact. Editing Wikipedia is as much about content as it is about collaborative writing. The more controversial a subject gets, the more unqualified and poorly informed loudmouths it attracts. There will be no edit war over POEMS syndrome, but there will be an edit war over chronic fatigue syndrome (in a few weeks, I predict). This is probably one of the greatest curses of writing in the public discourse. JFW | T@lk 20:38, 4 June 2006 (UTC)

You are pretty quick to judge something you know absolutely nothing about.  I haven't gone out with a blaze of fire and blocks, and I won't.  Good luck to you, though, if this is the way you collaborate - by talking about people behind their backs.  What a group of harpies here.,MollyBloom 05:26, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

This discussion took place almost a month ago. Contrary to yourself, I have worked extensively with single-issue editors who have felt the need to defend a viewpoint not particularily well accepted by many other editors. I'm pleased that you seem not to fit in that category. If you don't like people talking behind your back you might as well stop contributing to Wikipedia. JFW | T@lk 14:44, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

Yes, it is unfortunate that there are those who devote an entire page to bashing other editors.  I am still farily new to Wikipedia, and I also work, so I edit when I can.  And no, I am not a single-issue editor, although I have dealt with one.  It is frustrating.jgwlaw 18:12, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

 I think Midgley is agreeing that Ombudsman contributes to a wide variety of of causes and articles and we'd all agree that he/she writes well and adds a lot of great content. I do worry about jglaw - her attachment to the AfD on Maxwell is pretty fierce. Just the act of my voting prompted multiple replies both on the AfD and on my talk page!

Invicta, you would be better served if you would worry less about me, and more about your own interests.MollyBloom 05:23, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

Ombudsman is indeed exceptional.  The effort he applies could be far more effective, and I suspect that the effort he soaks up could also be.  The ArbCom ruling may make a difference, but there is as yet no sign at all of him noticing it.  (Except as more persecution).  jglaw is branching out a little, which can be nothing but good - there is some expertise there that will be an asset to Asbestos/is.    Midgley 16:32, 25 June 2006 (UTC)
Midgely, it was never an accurate statement to say I am a 'single-issue' editor.  I am still fairly new to Wikipedia.  THe BI article was what I began editing.  Of course I would have more edits on this.  I have only been editing Wikipedia for a couple of months.  I have since branched out to asbestos, asbestos and the law, politics, other legal issues, etc.  IT does take time to get one's feet wet.  The BI article was most interesting to me, because it initially read like an advertisement for BI.  I have read other articles by the same author that are equally poorly written and refernced.  If a doctor wants to be treated as a professional and expert, he needs to act and write like one.  The BI article is of interest, because there still is genuine scientific controversy about their safety, particularly with rupture.  The edits I added were referenced and properly written,  An epidemiologist and expert on breast implants also contributed, and was demonized by the same pro-implant doctor.  I am not going to belabor this, but suffice to say that MDs also have agendas that are not necessarily 'scientific'.

Also, if you read my bio, in addition to law, I have degrees in math and science.  I am hardly ignorant,  and I understand more than some would like to admit, it seems.MollyBloom 05:39, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

Speaking of Experts on BI Articles
As I said, I was not the only one editing this article.  For a little perspective, here is a comment by an expert that Oliver has summarily dismissed.MollyBloom 06:29, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

Is this JFW's or Oliver's idea of a loudmouth ignorant editor?  Or does that refer only to my edits?  Because many of the edits I restored were not written by me, but by Dr. Zuckerman.  I doubt that Rob Oliver's MD from the University of South Alabama makes him more of an expert than Dr. Zuckerman's PhD and post doctoral epidemiology training at Yale University.

Last week, I testified on breast implants for the Health Committee of the Canadian Parliament. I was invited because I am an epidemiologist (post doctoral training at Yale Medical School) and internationally recognized expert on this topic. There are still many unanswered questions about the risks and benefits of breast implants, and much controversy. That's why the FDA and Health Canada are both unsure whether to approve silicone gel breast implants.
Last week I also spoke at a Women's Health conference in Virginia, on a panel with a plastic surgeon. We talked about the risks and benefits and agreed on almost everything regarding breast implants.
I have repeatedly added research data to this article, and Dr Oliver keeps removing it. I want this article to be accurate, but I have a fulltime job as the director of a research center and I don't think it is fair for me to have to keep putting back information that he removes for no scientific reason. He is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts.
I have taught at Yale and Vassar, and was the director of a major research project at Harvard. What research credentials does Dr Oliver have that entitles him to keep deleting my scientific additions to this article? (Dr. Zuckerman wrote this as can be seen from the history.)

and 
As the president of a nationally-respected independent think tank that has been quoted in every national newspaper, magazine, and TV network (and has over 40,000 entries in google), I am tired of Dr. Oliver's bullying comments and repeated deletions of scientific facts and analyses that I have contributed to this article.  And, I am offended by Dr Oliver's repeated slurs against the National Research Center for Women &amp; Families, an organization that he apparently knows nothing about.  Dr. Oliver, you are entitled to your opinion but you should not be making up facts in Wikipedia. I don't want to be rude, but the truth is I have never seen you interviewed as an expert on this topic by the major media, nor have I seen even one article by you on breast implants in the peer-reviewed medical literature. I understand that you have strongly-held views on the topic but you don't seem to have an objective grasp of the research.  I have published dozens of articles on health topics, including breast implants, in peer-reviewed medical journals, and I am happy to defend anything I have written.  Feel free to debate me in this discussion area, but please stop deleting my additions to this article.  Drzuckerman 04:23, 29 June 2006 (UTC)Dr Zuckerman

On Wikipedia, personal credentials have some weight, but not in the way you'd like them to. Most discussions are supposed to revolve around the facts, not about their sources. You should not be questioning Dr Oliver's credentials. I have personally edited a number of articles about conditions I have not managed, let alone published about. Does that make me an inferior Wikipedia editor? JFW | T@lk 19:19, 29 June 2006 (UTC)
Of course not.  But Oliver has attacked this epidemiologist and me. In fact, he seems to think he (or other MDs) have &quot; a duty to take some editorial control over medical areas to strive for evidenced based medical information being presented.&quot;  This implies that he believes only medical doctors should edit such articles.  In fact, epidemiologists are better qualified in some areas to discuss studies and the like, than a surgeon who has not specialized in this area.  But of course, with WIkopedia, all kinds of experts and lay people are invited to participate responsibly.  
Of course, facts need to be discussed.  But as you know, facts can be 'selectively' chosen.  That is what I, Dr. Zuckerman, and others have complained about.  All statements made and referenced on this article that I have made, or that Dr. Zuckerman has made are facts.  Other medical doctors have agreed the controversy needs to be discussed, but Oliver has claimed there is no controversy.  This is flatly untrue.  Now I am not going to get into a further argument here about this. jgwlaw 20:47, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

It looks like you need some  on that article, Molly. JFW | T@lk 21:56, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

There is no mediation possible with Molly on this. I've tried repeatedly to bring her into a mainstream treatment of this to no avail. My selective inclusion of studies is limited to the large number of systemic reviews which have addressed this to this point.
As an aside. Dr. Zuckerman, the editor referred to, is the single most prominent anti-implant crusader in the world. While she's clearly an expert in the political manuevering in that area, the positions and conclusions embraced by her are not endorsed by the FDA, Institute of Medicine, the AMA, the American Society of Plastic Surgery, the American collge of Rheumatology, or the health ministries of any other country in the world.Droliver 18:04, 1 July 2006 (UTC)
I believe Oliver is correct.  There is no mediation that is possible because he deletes all references that he does not like, and ignores the references in the articles that he cites, that suggest a need for further study.  None of the institutes that Oliver reference say anything about Dr. Zuckerman.  He is again slanting all of this.  Dr. Zuckerman is a Yale trained epidemiologist, who has directed research projects at Harvard, and taught at Vassar and Yale.  She has referenced everything she has written, and added citations, as have I.  Rob Oliver has a POV that has compelled him to push his 'pro-implant' stance all over Wikipedia.  Even other plastic surgeons came on and stated there was still controversy, and Rob ignored him.  This is the problem we face here.172.148.137.229 02:47, 2 July 2006 (UTC)
Oh, and speaking of a one-issue editor, Rob Oliver fits the bill.  He is obsessed about breast implants, which is what he does, and even denies there is any controversy over them.  The only things he has done on WIkipedia at all relate to breast implants, or putting up puff pieces on his favorite professors.172.148.137.229 02:52, 2 July 2006 (UTC)

This is a confusing sentence.  Perhaps, JFW, you could rewrite to be a bit more comprehensible?
&quot; Anaphylaxis occurs at a rate of 1:200 in first-time use, but serology (antibodies against aprotinin) is not advocated to prevent anaphylaxis on reexposure due to metholodological problems[2].&quot;
From this sentence, it appears that the writer means that serology is an antibody, and that it is not advocated to prevent anaphylaxis (although I don't think that is what you mean)... Wikipedia should be written for the general population, not medical professionals.   Even if the audience were medical professionals, the sentence is still awkward.jgwlaw 02:00, 6 July 2006 (UTC)

Since it was discussed here, it seems logical that it be added here.  In fact, that seems to be the norm on topics discussed here.  Not sure why this is different.  Also, since you evidently wrote this, it makes sense to place it where you will see it. But, since you asked, I did add it on the talk page.  Hopefully someone will rewrite it.

 That trick is described on http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic379.htm along with other methods to remove ingested foreign bodies.

Metoclopramide &amp; Milk fetishism
New  added Milk fetishism to a number of articles on drugs or herbal products used to induce lactation for this fetishism. I initially revert the addition of this link on Metoclopramide as being nonsense, and this has be re-inserted. To be fair () metoclopramide may well be so used, but it is clearly off-label use - which normally is a term used for drugs being prescribed by a doctor for other uses than that licensed, rather than illegally obtaining prescription drugs without a prescription for alternative uses. I am sure many drugs are off-label used by patients obtaining through on-line pharmacies without prescription/medical advice, but does this mean all such (mis-)uses need be included as significant 'See also' links in articles on wikipedia ?  Remember whilst significant minority viewpoints must be included under , trivial minority views do not. 

Please also see the discussion added to Milk fetishism advising what doses of Metoclopramide to take ([http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Milk_fetishism&amp;diff=58216257&amp;oldid=57809835 here]) which I edited down to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Milk_fetishism&amp;diff=58227627&amp;oldid=58225265 this].

William Coley, Coley's Toxins, C-Vax

Could someone who is feeling energetic take a critical look at The following: William Coley, Coley's Toxins, C-Vax ?
The first two pertain to a historical 19th century cancer treatment. I am concerned however that this is alt.med getting in by the back door. This can be appreciated when one looks at the tone of the first two pieces. As history they are very badly written, as science even more so. They link to some very dubious sites. Coley is legitimately mentioned in the history section of Cancer and probably deserves his own biography page, but what is currently in place is inappropriate, POV, and of a low standard.

Most of them are in urgent need of maintenance. Colorectal cancer is not bad but we need more material on screening, better references for the treatment of non-localised disease and some resources on surgical management of metastatic disease (isolated liver metastasis is treated surgically these days).
Alzheimer's disease is an accumulation of poorly contexted individual studies and lots of rubbish on ineffective dietary interventions.
Breast cancer lacks any form of verifiability.
Clinical depression same.

Disorders of Lipid Metabolism is probably the best, if dyslipidaemia, hyperlipidaemia, FHC, Tangier disease et al can automatically go there. Jellytussle 22:02, 28 June 2006 (UTC)
Agree. Here is a proposed hierarchy
*Disorders of lipid metabolism (better title than dyslipidemia, which can be mentioned in first line as medical term) brief overview, including Hyperlipidemia as a subset
**Hyperlipidemia, also an overview, but this can have most of the cardiovascular risk information, which overlaps so much for the individual disorders
***Each individual form of hyperlipidemia can have its own brief article with description of distinctive aspects

I've split back out dyslipidaemia, per the above, but of course further review/edits are welcome. But should we really equate &quot;dyslipidaemia&quot; and &quot;disorders of lipid metabolism&quot;?

But should we really equate &quot;dyslipidaemia&quot; and &quot;disorders of lipid metabolism&quot;? In the short term, wouldn't diet affect the former but not the latter?

They are part of the same spectrum, and should be classified under the same heading. Diet will effect some disorders of lipid metabolism and not others. dyslipidaemia is not a precise term in itself. Jellytussle 16:41, 29 June 2006 (UTC)

I think dyslipidaemia covers it all - it's the same as any other dys: dystonia, dysphagia, dyspepsia. The term is roughly synonymous with &quot;disorders of lipid metabolism&quot; as the &quot;dys&quot; of the lipids is generally due to metabolic abnormalities.

A speciality (neurology) and its diseases

I've noticed that [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Neurology Category:Neurology] -- is very sparse... and most of the neurological diseases are in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Neurological_disorders Category:Neurological disorders].

Any thoughts on this?  

I think the neurological disorders category should be merged into the neurology category and that the rule should be established that the diseases should bear the category of the speciality (e.g. Crohn's disease is in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Gastroenterology Category:Gastroenterology] --NOT in a category called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:GI_disorders Category:GI disorders] or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Gastrointestinal_disorders Category:Gastrointestinal disorders]).

Medical Dictionary Wiki proposal
I came across the suggestion on metawiki for a [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Medical_dictionary_wiki Medical dictionary wiki]. I suspect wikidictionary is adequate for any deifinition of terms and conditions best left as wikipedia articles. A &quot;how-to-guide&quot; of actually treating people seems inappropriate to me - its a fork of infomation, who has time to edit twice the number of articles, how are they to verify the credentials of editors, even some acredited doctors have non-mainstream views (who will act as judge). Hmmm highly problematic, let alone legal implications. David Ruben  Talk  17:39, 6 July 2006 (UTC)
I am wondering why medical doctors feel that medical articles can only be edited by their own profession?  Wikipedia is, by definition, open source.  Should we have only lawyers editing articles about law?  Or only mathematicians editing about math?  Or ...etc.  If that is going to be the case, then Wikiipedia will no longer be open source.  Maybe that is where Wikipedia will evolve. jgwlaw 03:11, 7 July 2006 (UTC)

Jggwlaw - you misunderstand twice over - firstly I made/intended no suggestion that non-medics could not edit medical articles in wikipedia (indeed anyone may join in with this project, or sign themselves as a participant) - secondly the proposal in question is to create an entirely new body of work quite distinct &amp; separate from wikitionary and wikipedia. It was the need for an additional block of information that I am unconvinced by (or at the very least a lower-level school/undergraduate work might be included in wikibooks). Also you will note (if you look at the discussion page for it) that it was the proposal itself that suggests that only medics could contribute to it. Suggestions/votes against the proposal should be posted to its project page ([http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Medical_dictionary_wiki Medical dictionary wiki]) not here in &quot;friendly co-operative&quot; wikipedia - I only added the item to this page to flag the possible new duplicating item of the Wikimedia  foundation :-) David Ruben  Talk  18:28, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

Yeah, I thought it was pretty cool, too, which is why I wanted to write an article on it. There probably isn't really any more to be said, though. Guess I won't be nominating it for MCOTW then! (though I may submit it to DYK). — Knowledge Seeker দ 08:20, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

Don't submit it, I've already done it. :)  and ... NCurse work 08:55, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

I've always wondered how they name this MoAbs. Well done, KS! JFW | T@lk 07:50, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

Porphyria

 seems to think half the world must have porphyria. I've had to revert almost all these editor's contributions, as they were far-fetched and unsourced. Does everyone agree? There may some useful information that I've scrubbed accidentally. JFW | T@lk 21:32, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

Rare condition with large range of symptoms - so yes I suspect many articles might contain information about porphyria, but that does not make this the primary condition to be considered (atrial myxoma is not the commonest cause of atrial fibrillation). Articles need balance, as well as good citations for information most doctors would struggle to be able to immediately verify. David Ruben  Talk  22:50, 10 July 2006 (UTC)

You did well. And Davidruben +1... NCurse work 08:10, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

But please peruse that user's contributions, because there may still be useful material in there. I've also asked for a cleanup of porphyria, which has become very messy after editing spates by [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Porphyria&amp;diff=62493241&amp;oldid=61909718] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Porphyria&amp;diff=63111731&amp;oldid=63082784].
