As discussed at ikipedia talk:Medicine Collaboration of the Week#Systematic coverage of topics, it would be nice to have a place we can identify articles that need work, even though they may not be selected for the Collaboration. I'm going to try to begin to organize it, though I'm not entirely certain how. I don't know if this will stay here or what its final home will be, but since intend to include both clinical and pre-clinical topics, it didn't make sense to place it at either one, nor does it really fit at P:MCOTW either. The design comes from ikipedia:WikiProject Anti-war#List of pages covered by the project. — ser:Knowledge Seeker|Knowledge Seeker ser talk:Knowledge Seeker|দ 07:10, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

All right, there are just too many articles to deal with in this fashion. I am now thinking that something like the lists at ikipedia:WikiProject_Chemicals/Organization would be more feasible, although it require the assistance and discussion of others to generate the lists. We could have the 50 most imporant diseases, anatomical parts, medicines, topics about medicine (like residency), medical specialties, preclinical fields, biochemical molecules, pathogenic organisms, and so on. I have to ponder this overnight. — ser:Knowledge Seeker|Knowledge Seeker ser talk:Knowledge Seeker|দ 08:03, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

I started creating the lists I thought were most important, and threw a couple entries on each one. The topics are biased towards internal medicine, since that's my specialty and it seems that the participants on P:MCOTW tend to tackle articles in that field too. Physicians and others with expertise in other areas are free to add topics relating to their fields (for instance, a table on surgical procedures such as aparoscopic cholecystectomy, neumonectomy, and so on). Please feel free to add items to the lists, or modify/remove my suggestions—I put them up mainly to give a feel for the direction I intended for each list, but of course that is open to debate as well. Once we get a better idea what items will be on the lists, we can start rating articles. I especially would like to ensure that topics commonly linked to from medical or other articles (such as ever) are well-written. ikipedia:WikiProject Clinical medicine/top priority and ikipedia:WikiProject Clinical medicine/categorizations will be useful in providing inspiration. — ser:Knowledge Seeker|Knowledge Seeker ser talk:Knowledge Seeker|দ 04:24, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

I wonder if it wouldn't be helpful to divide diseases into general and specific diseases. I think that a single editor has a much easier time really improving something specific like heumatoid arthritis whereas a general disease category such as rthritis works best with a lot of input. Might help us decide on future collaborations, as well. ser:InvictaHOG|InvictaHOG 13:07, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

I started something similair just a few days ago at ser:Wouterstomp/List of diseases|my user page. I added all diseases to the list here. Most come from ist of common diseases. It is a lot more than 50 now, but I think it would be impossible to choose the 50 most important ones. Two more ideas: it would be nice to keep a table with statistics for tracking the progress, like on the chemicals list's talk page. Also a list of diseases that don't have an article yet would be nice (all the red links on ist of diseases). --ser:Wouterstomp|WS 17:24, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

Thank you both for embracing this project and for your suggestions. InvictaHOG, I think that is a great idea; one shorter list could have topics like rthritis, ardiovascular disease, nfection, and so on, and another would have the more specific diseases. Wouterstomp, thanks for all that work you put in adding those diseases—that'll really help! I do think that we should limit it to 50, though; part of the purpose of this project, like the purpose of the Collaboration, is to help us prioritize/find direction—a sea of links can be overwhelming. How about this: we'll keep one list of just 50, and then have a secondary list with all the rest. I don't mind trying to prune it down to 50—it's a lot easier than trying to think of which ones to add, so you've really helped out. I only fear that it'd reflect my biases, so feel free to switch around any of my selections; I'm not the dictator here. — ser:Knowledge Seeker|Knowledge Seeker ser talk:Knowledge Seeker|দ 05:13, 22 November 2005 (UTC)

Reorganization?
#Would it make any sense to change the navigation template, emplate:WPCM navigation, to put ikipedia:WikiProject Clinical medicine and ikipedia:WikiProject Preclinical Medicine under the parent Project of ikipedia:WikiProject Medicine? ser:Edwardian|Edwardian 23:59, 21 November 2005 (UTC)
#Since ikipedia:Medicine Collaboration of the Week is primarily a collaboration of editors involved in those three Projects, would it make sense to move the page to ikipedia:WikiProject Medicine/Collaboration of the Week? ser:Edwardian|Edwardian 23:59, 21 November 2005 (UTC)
#And rather have participants listed at all three projects, would it make sense to move ikipedia:WikiProject Clinical medicine/Collaboration and the various participant lists to ikipedia:WikiProject Medicine/Participants? It would serve as a nice summary page so that participants could list their areas of interest, articles they've been working on, the primary sub-Project they are interested in, etc. there. ser:Edwardian|Edwardian 23:59, 21 November 2005 (UTC)
#Does anyone think it would be wise idea to move the articles listed in ikipedia:WikiProject Clinical medicine/top priority to ikipedia:WikiProject Medicine, then delete the former page? There appear to be many &quot;Things to do&quot; pages related to medicine/clinical medicine and a merge/delete of ikipedia:WikiProject Clinical medicine/top priority would help streamline the project a bit. ser:Edwardian|Edwardian 23:59, 21 November 2005 (UTC)

Excellent comments, Edwardian. The template change might not be a bad idea. I hesitate to make any change like that because I don't want to step on anyone's toes by creating a WikiProject that &quot;governs&quot; another—I don't intend this project to control or limit the clinical and pre-clinical projects in any way, but it has a different scope. I think the change is fine if others agree, as long as it's clear that this project shouldn't really affect the way the &quot;child&quot; projects conduct their business. The participants list sounds great; I'll work on setting that up maybe tomorrow. I'll move MCOTW here as well. Finally, moving the articles sounds fine to me; even if all don't have a category list, we can keep some miscellaneous articles at the end. — ser:Knowledge Seeker|Knowledge Seeker ser talk:Knowledge Seeker|দ 05:37, 22 November 2005 (UTC)

Ugh...there are way too many pages linking to the old MCOTW page. I tried updating all the important ones, but if anyone so desires, he can go through and update the other links =) otherwise I'll get to it later. — ser:Knowledge Seeker|Knowledge Seeker ser talk:Knowledge Seeker|দ 05:48, 22 November 2005 (UTC)

I moved a lot of article from ikipedia:WikiProject Clinical medicine/top priority to here. Perhaps someone else can finish off the twenty or so there that remain. ser:Edwardian|Edwardian 07:22, 22 November 2005 (UTC)
I've merged all the articles in ikipedia:WikiProject Clinical medicine/top priority to ikipedia:WikiProject Medicine. There's nothing of importance left there, so I'm going to redirect the former to the latter. Hope this won't be a problem for anyone. ser:Edwardian|Edwardian 04:02, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

 Jargon 

This page will be very helpful. Great idea!  By the way, it seems to me that many medical articles use far too many technical terms without explaining them.  We who work in medical fields need to strive to make medical articles understandable to a non-medical audience, while keeping those same articles accurate.  Let's avoid unnecessary medical jargon!  ser:Rewster|Rewster 06:35, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

Jargon should not be eliminated, it should be explained. Articles become hellish to read when the technical terms are all replaced with imprecise layisms. Try replacing ischemia with &quot;decreased supply of oxygen-rich blood&quot; in yocardial infarction. Also, wikilinks enable readers to understand technical terms by opening the relevant page.

I'm all for accessibility, but not at the expense of style, flow of text, and accuracy. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 08:22, 23 November 2005 (UTC)

 Article Priority List 
ile:Medical discharges 2002 (2).png ile:Medical discharges 2002.png


Glad you brought up the topic of priority articles. These are my priority articles. I'm going to update them on my user page instead of here. Feel free to check them out if you want a different perspective. 

To be meaningful, the list needs to embrace three concepts: 

1) Traditional western medicine 2) Actual world-wide health care usage 3) Future world-wide trends. 

Challenging, yes. But if you twist your mind the right way, it’s doable. Below is the way that works for me.--ser:FloNight|FloNight 08:52, 24 November 2005 (UTC)

 Inclusion criteria 

Hi, just thought I'd ask here. From ikipedia:Neglected articles I saw ossa navicularis, and while I checked that the article is correct, I have a hard time believing that can ever be more than a dicdef. I have two anatomy textbooks in front of me and neither had anything more to add than was in the article. I'm fairly sure it was added solely for the sophmoric humor value, but should it be merged somewhere, expanded, or just sent to afd? Thanks - ser:Taxman|Taxman ser talk:Taxman|Talk 23:44, 15 December 2005 (UTC)

Many anatomy terms are like this. I envision that each will have a nice image and a description of pathology associated with it. This article can be expanded in that way and should probably stay a stub until someone adds information about strictures, etc. Just my opinion, of course! ser:InvictaHOG|InvictaHOG 18:53, 16 December 2005 (UTC)

A number of those can easily be merged with parent structures; the fossa navicularis article can be merged with rethra with no loss of information, as strictures can happen anywhere in the urethra. Similarly, all those processes on the femur should not have independent articles but be discussed in emur. ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 11:12, 18 December 2005 (UTC)

'Article Alert Status' classificiation
Having had a bit of a ikipedia:Wikiholiday|wikibreak, great to see above discussions re formation and merging of 'to do list' of articles.  I've had a go at the red-'stub' flagged enorrhagia, and whilst I have greatly expanded the topic, I'm unclear whether it now counts as blue-'good'.  The yellow-'needs exp/org/NPOV' suggests only just better than a stub, and I take mild offense :-) at the thought that it needs further significant expansion.  The white-'needs opinion' is apparently if the 'article has not yet been classified' - however, I would appreciate the comments &amp; input of others...  Some guidence please anyone, and I'll happily try updating the list without messing it up :-)  ser:Davidruben|David Rubenser talk:Davidruben|talk 17:37, 20 December 2005 (UTC)

Hey now, you forgot about the orange which is little better than a stub; the yellow is beyond that. Nevertheless, I think enorrhagia is &quot;good&quot; and have so upgraded it. — ser:Knowledge Seeker|Knowledge Seeker ser talk:Knowledge Seeker|দ 05:06, 28 December 2005 (UTC)

 etal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder|Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder 

etal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder|Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder needs to be checked. I doubt that the article presents a neutral point of view:

 ardiac arrest 

A little mediation from some other healthcare professionals is required here, we seem to be somewhat at loggerheads. Basically, ser:Nescio has redirected cardiac arrest to ardiogenic shock, which (in my opinion and I'm pretty sure most other emergency/critical care specialists') is incorrect. I reverted once, but Nescio reverted back again, and we've been having a bit of a debate on the talk page ever since. --ser:John24601|John24601 22:25, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

Discussion located alk:Cardiac_arrest#Cardiogenic Shock|here.Correct, the two conditions IMHO overlap and are so similar that merging is better than having two seperate articles. And other than that, cardiac arrest was poorly written and mentions hypovolumic, distributive, endocrine and obstructive shock without making clear that it is discussing shock. Beyond that, one has to wonder if mentioning these types of shock is warranted, why is incorporating it in cardiogenic shock such a bad idea. 

However, I do admit I might have been somewhat too BOLD.mage:Flag_of_the_Netherlands.svg|25px|Holland ser:Nescio|Nomen Nescio 23:21, 30 March 2006 (UTC)

 Disclaimer in template 

I've had a good look around but haven't found where to put this or if it's already there...
All these medical entries are pretty good, but people can be easily influenced so you/we must add to the template for any medicine/diseaso/disorder a disclaimer stating something like 'A qualified physician should be consulted if you believe you have this condition/ before using this medicine'
I have in mind HD for example, where someone at risk may read the article, and believe they have all the facts, but really need to seek professional advice ( well until the info is perfect that is ;) )

 Spelling of orthopaedic / orthopedic 

Hi. There has been a discussion on the appropriate spelling of orthopaedic vs orthopedic to use.  I requested a move from rthopedic surgery to rthopaedic surgery, which was closed in favor of moving, but a view has been expressed that it was closed wrongly.   There are other places where the spelling ought to be consistent with the article, e.g. Category:Orthopedics.  I think it would be good to have more people's views so as to form a consensus on the prefered spelling.  If you are interested, please could you visit alk:orthopaedic surgery and have your say.
