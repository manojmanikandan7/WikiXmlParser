The POV pushers from THINCS and the Weston A. Price Foundation have been busy on Wikipedia.  The articles in question are written with the intent of pushing their minority viewpoint while discounting the current scientific consensus regarding the role of saturated fat in heart disease.  The articles need complete rewrites, presenting the majority view while recognizing the minority view.

Help needed with Emergence phenomenon

Hello. I just categorized the stub Emergence phenomenon but it's in dire need of cleanup and expert attention. It's not even clear to me that there's much in there worth keeping but hopefully someone from the project can make a better judgment on that issue. Thanks,  03:26, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

Lesch-Nyhan syndrome

Very nice article! I don't know about featured articles, but a thought on content: you may consider adding some stuff about the clinical spectrum of Lesch-Nyhan. There is a broad range of variability, from isolated hyperuricemia to full-blown Lesch-Nyhan Disorder.

Requesting input on stub proposal: Pathology-stub

Hi all. I've proposed a new stub, , to mark the many proto-articles on topics related to Pathology - including various tools and techniques of pathologists, subspecialties of pathology, and microscopic entities which are part of disease processes and are used by pathologists in diagnosis. In assembling the items that would be appropriate for the stub, I found that some of them had been labeled as medical signs and marked with , under the broad definition that anything which is detectable and relates to a disease is a &quot;medical sign&quot;. In my experience, named eponymous signs, and other medical entities specifically referred to as &quot;signs&quot; are concepts which refer primarily to a appearance or observation rather than to a physical entity which is part of the disease process itself. Thus, observations made on physical examination (e.g. strawberry tongue) or radiographic study (e.g. Kerley B lines) are &quot;medical signs&quot; but entities such as fibrosis, astrogliosis, and auer rods are not, and would be appropriate for my new stub &amp; category. Whether you support or oppose my idea, I'd apprciate your joining the conversation at . Thanks. -/ 02:17, 19 April 2007 (UTC)


Arthrogryposis
Merged Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita into Arthrogryposis and while doing so I happend to stumble on this list of sub names under  for Arthrogryposis: 

*Arthrogryposis due to muscular dystrophy 
*Arthrogryposis ectodermal dysplasia other anomalies 
*Arthrogryposis epileptic seizures migrational brain disorder 
*Arthrogryposis IUGR thoracic dystrophy 
*Arthrogryposis like disorder 
*Arthrogryposis like hand anomaly sensorineural 
*Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita CNS calcification 
*Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita distal 
*Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita neurogenic type 
*Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita pulmonary hypoplasia 
*Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita whistling face 
*Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, distal type 1 
*Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, distal type 2 
*Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, distal, x-linked 
*Arthrogryposis ophthalmoplegia retinopathy 
*Arthrogryposis renal dysfunction cholestasis syndrome 
*Arthrogryposis spinal muscular atrophy 
Do all of the above really qualify for their own article? Are there any diff's bout them?  Anyone here with a bit of med background give me some pointers or suggestions as to what to do with them? Would really love to just redirect them onto Arthogryposis but the article itself isint in the best shape in the world. Thanks in advance. Calaka 07:36, 20 April 2007 (UTC)

Many of these missing articles should be redirected to the Arthrogryposis article, but it is in a bad shape. If you could improve it, then we could also create the redirects. Until then, I don't think so.    14:01, 22 April 2007 (UTC)

 Sweet, i shall put Arthrogryposis on my 'to do list' and will see how far I can improve it. Then we can redirect most of those above terms and the &quot;List of Diseases not in wikipedia begining with A&quot; can go that one step closer to going complete... hehe. Calaka 06:27, 23 April 2007 (UTC)

Ok I did a whole revamp on the  Arthrogryposis article and hopefully now its better (hopefully not a complete utter mess), would really appreciate it if someone with more general wikipedia skills can take a look and see if they can tweak it so it's better, and remove/modify any info that might be repeated or possibly copyvio(All the reff's is there, im just having clashes with the unreferenced info that was there initially...and trying to incorporate it with all the stuff i found is a bit tricky)... particulatly check the causes section... i found that a bit hard to &quot;fix&quot;... After you made the appropriate changws( gave it the O.K!) please by all means redirect all the subtypes of arthrogryposis into that article. (The ones that are suited of course). Wanted to put them down as a list, but that's just not wiki like and will get messy.... So yeah thanks for ur time.PS. Just remembered though (While im posting i guess i can ask here: Are we allowed to use the &quot;infobox&quot; links from the article as references to the entire article... i wanted to but i thought ur not meant to for some reason and decided to make life difficult for myself and look for other jorunals,random webs that talk about this disease...So use infobox as reff for entire article? Or the fact that the infobox is there, assumes that we used those ref's for the entire article?PPS. One more Q, whats up with the external links? Do we actually allow support group type sites or what? Like what's allowed, whats not allowed in external links section? Thanks in advance. Calaka 04:33, 24 April 2007 (UTC)

I think we should continue this discussion on your talk page.    15:36, 24 April 2007 (UTC)

In case anyone is intrested, i finished doing all the redirecting of all the disease sub types into the article. Please don't hesistate to make correct modifications incase i made a mistake somewhere, and ur more than welcome to find a free GNU pic to add for the disease. And while ur add it ur also more than welcome to fix up the references so they read nicer. Im not to sure how to do that otherwise i would have done it myself. Thanks. Calaka 08:11, 25 April 2007 (UTC)

Hi. I am new to this; please let me know if I am not communicating properly. I don't yet know how to edit articles, so maybe I can just put a few comments here.  The article overall looks pretty good, I think. Basically, arthrogryposis is a clinical description that refers to multiple congenital contractures. The statement, &quot;The cause as such, is unknown,&quot; may suggest that there is a single cause that has yet to be discovered. Rather, arthrogryposis can be caused by a number of different things (many of which you list). Uterine crowding (e.g., in twin pregnancies) can be a cause, but most often it is due to decreased fetal movement secondary to a number of different reasons (CNS dysfunction, peripheral nerve dysfunction, muscle dysfunction). When evaluating a baby with arthrogryposis, you just have to go through all of those different possible causes. The list under &quot;Classification&quot; seems to be a number of entities from OMIM--single gene or single locus disorders that have arthrogryposis as part of the symptom complex. These are not a classification scheme for arthrogryposis per se, but just some genetic disorders that each can cause arthrogryposis. Anyway, hope that helps some. 23:28, 24 May 2007 (UTC)

Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease
Found another article with 21 different subtypes: , see 383-404. Since the article Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is in not bad shape (compared to what Arthrogryposis looked like a few days ago) , I decided to just make a redirect for most if not all of them into that article. (I shall research the actual disease and make checks for each subtype though to make sure it's not allready a article b4 redirecting). Feel free to have a look urself, add ur input etc. Thanks for ur attention.Calaka 08:00, 26 April 2007 (UTC)

Where did this list come from? It has some similarities with [http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/asp/diseases/diseases.asp?this=C#toplist NIH Office of Rare Diseases: Rare Diseases Terms: C]. But that list has 40 variants to the core Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Do we have guidelines on when/whether to create redirects for disease variants? How should such variants be formed? For example, some documents have Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, Type 1A rather than Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A. ° 11:15, 26 April 2007 (UTC)

Dunno where the list came from, i just looked at the list at the wikiproject's missing disease page 2 and saw that long list. I then googled each term to make sure it was generally real (If it had a OMIM number), the ones that are more researched even have genes affected and loci so they more than qualified for a redirect to the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease article. In terms of redirects I assumed that redirects dont cost bandwith or wikipedia resources so having both Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, Type 1A and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Type 1A wont hurt? That is my random newbie opinion tho and if it aint the case, im gonna have to go through a lot of &quot;delete redirects&quot; (see my contributions*cry*). As to make a bit of a update this is what i was left with: 
*Charcot Marie tooth disease deafness mental retardation 
*Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2B1 
*(Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2B2 
*Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4B 
*Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, intermediate form 
*Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, neuronal, type B 
*Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, neuronal, type D 
*Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, neuronal, type A
I am not to sure what they refer to, and the info i found on them was confusing, so hopefully someone else can add em on to the article and then redirect them (unless they were allready in the article but spelt out in a diferent format/way).Thanks once again for ur attention.

#Don't trust OMIM to prove a disease exists. Both [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=191091 tuberous sclerosis 3] and [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=191090 tuberous sclerosis 4] have OMIM entries but don't exist.
#Read . You haven't done anything wrong, or that needs deleted. There are lots of reasons for creating redirects. The main ones, I think, are helping with internal links and ensuring the &quot;Go&quot; button will find an article. With the former, someone might want to refer specifically to Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A and hope that if eventually a specific article is written for it, then the link will just work. With the latter, it is useful to know a little about how Go works (see ). For example, having a form where all (but the first) letters are lowercase, can help with such searches where mixed case is used.

Darn, thats a bit strange, is there any site on the net we can trust?! But anyway thanks for the reply. Cleared a few things up. I wont make all variants of a name:). But if they are on a wiki list (like the one where i initially found them) i try to assume, that they were placed there cuz someone requested them or such (and not just taken from a random list and dumped here for someone to make tedious redirects for em :). Cya later. Calaka 13:43, 26 April 2007 (UTC)
Oh, definitely just dumped. I guess it was thought to be useful to highlight genuinely missing diseases. An alternative to creating an article or redirect might be to just place a comment next to an entry in the list to say &quot;Article not required&quot; or whatever, when you think that the name or variation is just too obscure to be worthwhile.  ° 14:44, 26 April 2007 (UTC)

The &quot;Positive predictive value&quot; page says &quot;The positive predictive value is also known as the statistical power in statistics&quot;, but I think that this is incorrect. If I am not mistaken, positive predictive value = TP / (TP + FP), but power = TP / (TP + FN).

Navboxes and ICD-10 coding of disease articles
Is there a central forum on this Wikiproject for discussion of the proper use of ICD-10 coded infoboxes such as , diagnosis navboxes such as , and uses of ICD-10 coding in subheads (as on the page alcoholic liver disease) or other places throughout articles? For example, I think the latter example demonstrates overuse of coding, and the navboxes seem to be steadily proliferating, raising hackles among some editors of individual pages.

On one hand, I applaud those who are working hard to bring organization and useful information to disease articles on Wikipedia. On the other hand, I don't think ICD-10 should be the basic organizing principle for all articles and disease navboxes without some unified discussion, consensus, and set of guidelines. This Wikiproject seems to be the best place to do that. Perhaps we could create a dedicated subpage on this wikiproject for discussion of standardization issues, such as what to do if a consensus page breakdown does not correspond to ICD-10, or how to manage format conflicts arising from large numbers of navboxes on a single page. It would help to write consensus guidelines into , but I also think there should be a forum for discussing these issues as they come up. If such a page already exists, my apologies! -/ 22:38, 24 May 2007 (UTC)

To address the subhead issue - I agree that the codes should not be in the subheads, and should be removed where they exist. I believe there are very few cases where they are used in that way -- in the example in question, they were inserted by me back [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alcoholic_liver_disease&amp;diff=30636962&amp;oldid=20398163 in 2005], when there was much less precedent. -- 22:47, 24 May 2007 (UTC)

 Agree ICD codes shouldn't be in sub-heads or headings, like the use in the disease infobox (which I believe is appropriate), and copying my comments on Arcadian's talk page to here (dislike large navigational templates added to articles, in general).  I'm not happy having it cluttering up the bottom of Tourette syndrome (I dislike excessive navigational templates and don't feel it adds anything to the article except size), but I guess there's nothing I can do about it :/  I also don't like the undue weight it gives to the ICD-10 coding scheme over other schemes, and the fact that TS is a neurological condition.  I'd be really happy if I could remove it.  [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] () 22:51, 24 May 2007 (UTC)

To make it easier to see the difference between the old way and the new way:  [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Gastroenterology&amp;oldid=95970797 this] is the format of  before I updated it to , and organized it around ICD10. (Rustavo is [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3ANavigational_templates&amp;diff=132755224&amp;oldid=132696820 opposed] to Navbox generic.) On my monitor, it takes up less space vertically in the new format, even after adding several additional conditions. -- 23:14, 24 May 2007 (UTC)

I'm not really opposed to , and I apologize for overreacting to your changes to  - not all of my concerns were regarding the new template format as you'll remember. I realize that you have been doing good work on medicine articles for much longer than I have even been on wikipedia. My concern is just that when you are going to edit a large number of articles (e.g. every disease article on Wikipedia) it is nice to have a discussion to point to which explains what you are doing and shows that there is some consensus for it. It is helpful for us (relative) newbies. This really isn't just about you, . Thanks. -/ 05:16, 25 May 2007 (UTC)

I agree that this isn't just about me.  and  both date back to 2004 (predating my involvement with Wikipedia), and were created by .  dates back to 2006, and was created by . The biggest change I made to them was converting them to navbox generic, which has . Since then, I've created additional templates for medical conditions (starting with , in January 2006), and the feedback I have received has been . -- 13:54, 25 May 2007 (UTC)

My concern is not over one format for the template or another; I don't see the usefulness in cluttering the bottom of Tourette syndrome with one definition of a coding scheme, nor the need to have a chunky template at the bottom of the article with conditions ranging from Schizophrenia to mental retardation to personality disorders.  None of this adds anything to the topic of Tourette syndrome.  Should we also add a template there listing every single breakdown in the DSM ?  Then should I also add a template listing every single neurological condition?  Then every movement disorder?  Where do these large templates end?  TS could theoretically have four templates equally as large as this one, adding nothing to the article.  [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] () 11:18, 25 May 2007 (UTC)

 Navigation boxes aren't controversial. A majority of the  have them. When formatted using &quot;Navbox generic&quot;, they automatically collapse when more than one is on the page at the saem time, so if four were on the same page, they would take up less space than one does. Clearly, as you are the author of , you see the benefit to navigation boxes. I understand that you are upset that Tourette's is classified in chapter F of ICD-10 (in the same way that you were upset by OMIM's characterization of Tourette's) and you don't agree with the hierarchy, but that's why our standard is to  whenever possible, and there is no more accepted international standard than ICD-10. (DSM has wider support in the US, but DSM-IV Codes use the same numbers as , and the hierarchy in ICD-9 and ICD-10 are almost identical. That said, if you would prefer a DSM/ICD9 approach, I would not oppose that.) -- 13:54, 25 May 2007 (UTC)
Well, topics related to TS are ... related to TS.  I hate the proliferation and stacks of marginally-related navboxes on all FAs, but I know I can't Object at FAC because there's no criterion in WIAFA that disallows them.  A DSM approach would add an equally large chunk of &quot;stuff&quot; to the bottom of the article.  I don't understand this collapsible issue; you say they will automatically collapse if there are more than two on a page.  There are two templates at TS, but the ICD box doesn't automatically collapse — how can I enact that feature?  The box will bother me less if there's not a massive chunk of unrelated topics showing at the bottom of the TS article, so collapsing would be good. [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] () 15:54, 25 May 2007 (UTC)

The selective collapse feature only works with the standard templates. I've taken the liberty of converting your  template to Navbox generic, so you can see how it looks now. (Feel free to revert the change if you prefer it the other way.) -- 17:31, 25 May 2007 (UTC)

 Very nice result — thanks so much !  Now I can make all that clunk go away at the bottom of the article.  I do hope you can appreciate how irritating it is to have an ICD10 template on the Tourette syndrome article, when they don't even have the good sense to call it Tourette syndrome, or anything remotely close to what most of the world calls it :-)  It's bad enough that they label Tourette syndrome under &quot;emotional disorders&quot; (which it's not); it's just funny that this template is on an article where you have to label it in the template with a label not even in use by the ICD10.  So that's what I think of the ICD10 :-)  [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] () 19:09, 25 May 2007 (UTC)

I like where we are going with navboxes, but I do have one concern re the cancer pages.   used to have by-location and by-histology sections, which in made an important point about these being (often) separate.  I have spent months editing pages that conflate location and histology.  Eg, pages describing the same kind of germ cell tumor (by-histology) separately for each part of the body in which it is found.  Now we have  (oops, now its name is ) which rather obscures this point.  One of its fields is &quot;central nervous system&quot; or something like that, which approaches being a location.  And the title word &quot;morphology&quot; does the same.  Histology and morphology are not synonymous;  may I suggest call this template &quot;tumor histology&quot;?  Maybe someone could write a bot to make this change? -- 03:26, 8 July 2007 (UTC), corrected 03:28, 8 July 2007 (UTC)

The proposed name sounds good to me. I have renamed it to . If Una wanted to restore a subset back to Template:Tumors, I wouldn't object to that (though of course there are too many to put them all in there.) I've also changed Nervous system to Nervous tissue, to clarify that ICD-O is organized around tissue type. -- 03:43, 8 July 2007 (UTC)

Booze (fatal)

While I note [[:Category:Deaths from renal failure]], etc., I don't see anything for liver failure or cirrhosis of the liver (though there is an option for cancer of the liver). Indeed, there's no category for alcohol-related deaths. My medical knowledge is near zero and I'm not even all that keen on pigeonholing people (even dead ones) by cause of death; still, I wonder what medically minded people might think about this (non) issue. --  07:13, 26 May 2007 (UTC)

 In the UK, &quot;renal failure&quot; is not an acceptable (legal) cause of death — another specific disease must have caused the renal failure. &quot;Liver failure&quot; probably wouldn't be a useful classification, but perhaps &quot;liver cirrhosis&quot; is.  14:36, 27 May 2007 (UTC)

Need advice

I've been editing Herpes zoster for the past few weeks, trying to clean up what I felt was a mess.  Even though I'm an MD, I try to stay out of medical articles because they're no fun usually, and because my opinions can be fairly strong.  I don't want to  an article.  But I thought this article would be safe, because I'm not an infectious disease specialist.  It was more fun than dealing with Evolution vs. Creationism debates.  What I've noticed is a lot of people trying to put in what I consider  claims about shingles, especially with herbal treatments.  I think that homeopathy and naturopathy are pseudosciences mostly.  I know there is some research looking into certain herbal salves that might help the diseases, but I'm offended when I read garbage that taking this vitamin or that herb cures everything.  Given that Wikipedia is now at the top of every search engine, my guess is that someone who contracts shingles comes here for information.   Moreover, since with shingles getting antivirals within a couple of days is crucial, I don't want people to think that some claim that this or that works can be substituted.  I've read some other articles, and mostly the editors keep out the pseudo-medical crap.  But where's the line?  I want to move the article to GA and maybe FA status, so I need some advice from more experienced editors.  And if a couple of you could watch over the article, maybe I can get some pointers in watching how often you revert this ahem hooey.  Thanks.   18:41, 4 June 2007 (UTC)

Caduceus vs Rod of Asclepius

I really don't like the merchant symbol of caduceus being used by this project instead of the medical Rod of Asclepius. I propose we switch to the image [[:Image:Aeskulap.png|Aeskulap.png]] (see right) until we find a more suitable one. I've already inserted it in the med-stub template. --  09:51, 5 June 2007 (UTC)

Agree - It really should be the rod of ascepius.  Partly my fault as a transferred the caduceus to replace some 'star of life' designs as star of life is for emergency pre-hospital medicine only.  09:56, 5 June 2007 (UTC)

Exploring possibility of creating child WikiProject or Task Force

Hi, I'm in an information-gathering stage to determine whether it would make sense to create some kind of Wikiproject on a set of topics. As a complete WikiProject newbie, I'm looking for guidance.  

The article on &quot;dyslexia&quot; began as a single article, but is clearly going to branch out pretty quickly. I think that a Child Project, or even a Task Force, would be more appropriate than a full WikiProject.  

One question I have is, the topics in question could easily fall into 2, or even 3, larger topics. Some of the topics that branch out from this probably would be better placed in a different category entirely. Depending on how you look at it, dyslexia could be categorized under neurological or psychological conditions; education; special education (a child project of Education). The articles that will branch out from this topic will range from eduation law, special education, learning disabilities and educational methods and instructional interventions, to several branches of psychology, neuropsychology, psychiatric diagnoses, brain research, neuroimaging, etc.  How does one handle a topic that could easily be a child of multiple parent projects?  

If I had to choose from the list of current projects, I would probably go with neuroscience. But that project isn't very active, and I think we will need more guidance, at least initially.

Thanks in advance for any help,

Anorexia vs inappetence
In the textbook of clinical examination I have been learning from (in Slovenian; ), the author of the section on abdomen Saša Markovič discernes between inappetence as the loss of appetite and anorexia as the true aversion to food (which is not limited only to anorexia nervosa). Should we cite this? The author has been working for many years as the chief of the Division of gastroenterology and currently is the technical director of the Clinical Center Ljubljana. However, the majority of sources seem to equate anorexia and inappetence. Does anyone have any reliable source in English to confirm this distinction? Or any other comment?  --  21:54, 14 June 2007 (UTC)

 I have looked around. Both of these terms are defined as &quot;loss of appetite&quot; in most sources. Your Slovenian source is not using conventional definitions, although I can see that a distinction between those two might be useful.  17:14, 21 June 2007 (UTC)

Medical education
The medical education articles of this project have largely been neglected, and often experience disputes between differing views of medicine and terminology.  Examples include allopathic vs osteopathic and traditional (MD/DO) vs non-traditional (alternative/ND).  There needs to be a reorganization of the medical education articles.

First, we need to agree on what should be considered as medical education.  Should alternative medicine be included side-by-side with conventional medicine?  I think there should be a separate article for alternative medicine education, if there is content to fill the article.

Second, the &quot;allopathic&quot; and &quot;osteopathic&quot; groups articles should parallel each other.  Currently, articles on the osteopathic side are Osteopathic medicine and Osteopathy.  On the allopathic side are Doctor of Medicine and Allopathic medicine.  One idea I had is to rename &quot;Osteopathic medicine&quot; to &quot;Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine&quot; and rename &quot;Allopathic medicine&quot; to &quot;Allopathy&quot; (retaining all of the existing content, but slightly changing the focus of the articles).  I think it is fair to say that DOs might not want to be associated/confused with content from the osteopathy article, and MDs might not want to be associated/confused with the intent of the word allopathy.  The word allopathy could be used sparingly in the Doctor of Medicine article (if at all).  The allopathy article could link to the MD article.  Similarly, the osteopathy article could link to the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine article.  The DO article could have a see also at the top for osteopathy.

I'd like to hear other ideas, but I believe that making the article name changes as described above should help.  -- 00:24, 20 June 2007 (UTC)

A bit frustrating; we now have a Project-specific template that is only a copy of the general template and doesn't mention MEDMOS at all; I can't figure out how or where to add mention that GA, A and FA should conform to MEDMOS.  If we can't tailor it, why should we have a Project specific template rather than a general one ?  [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] () 06:25, 9 July 2007 (UTC)

OK, now I see; we have to build a page around the grading template, similar to the bio page.  Thanks, Scott.  [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] () 06:40, 9 July 2007 (UTC)

 Grading samples can be changed, but importance samples are still automatic.  [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] () 06:53, 9 July 2007 (UTC)

The importance examples are working now.  I'm also working on modifying the assessment templates, and just added the ability to use custom examples on .  The culprits were '-' instead of '_'.  -- 13:36, 9 July 2007 (UTC)

Interesting.  I never investigated how Tourette syndrome came to listed as the sample FA at , but it didn't displease me when I saw it there :-)  Just the other day, the main editor and FA nominator of  replaced TS with the article written by him/herself. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Grading_scheme&amp;diff=141386545&amp;oldid=140572431]  That's gutsy, considering it [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Agatha Christie: And Then There Were None|passed FAC with copyedit objections]].  Going to do my homework now.  [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] () 05:26, 9 July 2007 (UTC)
Found, TS was added back in April by an uninvolved editor, based on good logic (unanimous FAC).

Left message on the talk page there, don't like that &quot;significant issues&quot; wording, and MEDMOS needs to be mentioned early on.  GA, A, and FA should conform to MEDMOS.  [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] () 19:36, 9 July 2007 (UTC)

Big problem here.  I noticed a huge jump in the number of Medicine  listed in the chart at the top of this page, and noticed that several editors are assessing Medicine articles as GA class that have not been though .  Since it's now impossible to tell which articles are the ones that are incorrectly assessed, the list will need to be checked against , and articles re-assessed.

Fetus in fetu

Hi. I wondered if anyone would like to take a look at this article. I was called in to help over a dispute about sources, but lack the kind of specialised knowledge that would allow me to do more in the way of sourcing. Any help would be gratefully received. Thanks. -- 18:31, 9 July 2007 (UTC)

Hormesis in aging candidate for deletion?

Hi, I found this article and I think it should be shortended and integrated into hormesis or deleted. It is more like an essay and of no realistic biological impact, as far as I can tell. What do you think? -- 15:44, 10 July 2007 (UTC)
ugh, since a lot of it was added at once, did you google to check for a copyright violation?  [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] () 19:08, 10 July 2007 (UTC)
Never mind, here's the answer (at the bottom):  &quot;The above text is adapted, with consent, from a more extensive article by Suresh Rattan, to be published in a forthcoming issue of the journal “Ageing Research Reviews”, and where cross references to the original research studies can be found. The reference to the original article will be provided after it is published online.&quot;  I don't think we can do that; check with the copyright people, and perhaps it can be speedy deleted on that basis.  [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] () 19:10, 10 July 2007 (UTC)
Thanks for commenting- would you mind and do that for me? I spent a whole afternoon once to find out how an IP that contributed nothig but vandalism could be blocked, and I failed. The regularities on en.wp are far beyond manageable by now. -- 20:34, 10 July 2007 (UTC)
I don't know how either—maybe someone else will work on it.  [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] () 20:35, 10 July 2007 (UTC)
Wow :) I will try and see what I can do. At least I found this WikiProject, that seems to have some readers :). -- 20:42, 10 July 2007 (UTC)

Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/History of the relationship of osteopathic and allopathic medicine in the United States

Since this is probably of interest to WP:Medicine, I'm posting here that I'm nominating History of the relationship of osteopathic and allopathic medicine in the United States for . [[User:Antelan|Ante]][[User:Antelan|lan]] [[User_talk:Antelan|talk]] 20:19, 10 July 2007 (UTC)
I've been staying out of the allopathic vs. osteopathic issues for a while, but am going to propose a new idea.  I agree with Antelan that the History of the relationship of osteopathic and allopathic medicine in the United States article is probably not needed.  This is essentially the history and evolution of DOs and osteopathic medicine.  The contents of the article have not effected MDs/&quot;allopathic&quot; medicine at all.  (Don't bother arguing with this - it is irrelevant.  This is about the fight for osteopathic medicine's equality.  References could be made in Medicine, Medical education in the United States, and Medical school in the United States, but do not belong in allopathic-specific articles like Doctor of Medicine.)  Some of this content belongs in an article Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (which I think has always been more about about the physician than the type of medicine), and others in an article about the type of medicine practiced.  So my proposal is this.  Considering that &quot;Osteopathic medicine = Allopathic medicine + Osteopathic manipulative medicine&quot;, why rename OMM to Osteopathic medicine, since OMM is the type of medicine practiced by DOs.  The content in this article could be split between Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine and Osteopathic medicine, and the OMM/OM article would then be appropriate for some of the history.  -- 20:39, 10 July 2007 (UTC)
That sounds like a reasonable approach in general. With respect to the subject at hand, merging most of the relevant info from the History of the relationship... article into one of the medicine or osteopathic medicine articles seems appropriate.

Help needed with Quarantine

Greetings. This article, (Quarantine) is based on the 1911 Encyclopedia Britanica article and is hopelessly out of date. It needs some good fact checking, updating and inclusion of modern views and policy on the subject by someone who has some background and knowledge. It's especially relevant as an article given the recent Tuberculosis scare. -- 15:45, 12 July 2007 (UTC)

New tag proposal: Not medical advice
Is there any interest or support in developing a tag that may be placed on top of articles?  WP edits are not peer reviewed prior to publication.  There is some wrong information there.  The tag could say that articles are not meant to be medical advice and that there are limitations in the article due to the nature of the editorial review in wikipedia (trying to put it nicely).[[User:VK35|VK35]] 23:14, 14 July 2007 (UTC)
