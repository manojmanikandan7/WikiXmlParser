This is not my field, so asking here: is there any real difference between  (a new page) and ? – I can't see one. Thanks, Justlettersandnumbers (talk) 08:23, 18 June 2022 (UTC)
 Complicating things a bit you also have Social medicine, Public health and Health advocacy (and Medical sociology that looks at healthcare from the outside - Social medicine occassionally engaging in reflexivity from the inside). I suspect preventative might be a bit closer to the disease in question (e.g. &quot;mosquito nets prevent malaria&quot;), while social health will focus more on the sociological (e.g. &quot;Rates of vaccine uptake are lower amongst ethnic groups with a history of abuse by the medical profession, endorsement by members of the community can change this.&quot;). I suspect a merge might be in order Talpedia (talk) 12:30, 18 June 2022 (UTC)
Considering only the title, I'd guess that PSM is PM + SM, but sometimes it turns out that interdisciplinary fields develop their own methods or distinctive qualities.  In other cases, it's just a matter of someone saying &quot;Well, we want to have our own department, and this university doesn't have enough for a PM department or for an SM department, but if we club together, we can form a PSM department...&quot; – which isn't really &quot;a field&quot; at all, but two similar fields being combined for administrative purposes.  
All of these articles would benefit from links to each other and explanations about how they are similar and different.  Sometimes writing such a paragraph helps editors figure out which articles cover the same territory under other names. WhatamIdoing (talk) 17:42, 18 June 2022 (UTC)
 Yeah, I agree conrtrasting the different topics in the articles is a good starting point. I tried to do this a bit with Medical sociology#Related fields. Finding sources for this sort of stuff can be quite difficult though, since scholars mostly write within their field, rather than about their (or related) fields. Talpedia (talk) 12:20, 19 June 2022 (UTC)
Maybe look for undergraduate textbooks?  An introductory chapter might cover that kind of information. WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:49, 19 June 2022 (UTC)
 I did a little work on defining various of these terms on public Public health because that seemed like a good place - being the more recognised term. I found a book on the philosophy of population health (another term!), that mentioned Social medicine and discussed population health versus public health. Population health seems to want to get into more general sociological factors and Health equity (and so starts butting up against politics).  I looked for some discussion of preventive medicine without much joy. Though one textbook on preventive medicine while not actually defining the term talked about preventive medicine as &quot;the interface between public health and clinical practice&quot;, so that would sort of view it as &quot;what practicing doctors do about public health&quot;. I mean, I could probably have a look at a Preventive medicine textbook and work out what the correct definition is, but that would be my own OR! Talpedia (talk) 08:23, 23 June 2022 (UTC)
You've made great progress already.  Thanks for doing this. WhatamIdoing (talk) 15:33, 23 June 2022 (UTC)
The chapter &quot;Population Health:  Definitions, Tensions, and New Directions&quot; by Paula M. Lantz in ISBN 978-1259644511 offers this:  &quot;Preventive medicine is a specialty of medicine practiced by licensed physicians who are devoted to health promotion and disease prevention, and are primarily engaged in preventing rather than curing disease. What constitutes preventive medicine varies within and across countries.  In the U.S. context, preventive medicine is an area of medical practice recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialities with three main specialty areas: aerospace medicine, occupational medicine, and public health and general preventive medicine.&quot;
A later chapter offers this:  &quot;Preventive medicine, represented in light blue, uses the modalities of lifestyle medicine and conventional medicine to treat individual patients, but with a primary focus on prevention and health promotion. Preventive medicine is also the only discipline in this group with a major emphasis on population health.&quot;
Perhaps one of those would be useful. WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:13, 23 June 2022 (UTC)
 Thanks for that source. I found this paper https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2016.10.037, which is is a little argumentative but addresses the general question of what the various definitions are how they relate and  echoes some of the points from that source. I've updated the Public health a little to discuss preventive medicine, health equity and lifestyle medicine. Based on this. I'm not sure what the relationship between preventive medicine and Preventive healthcare is... 
 I still need to flesh out the relationship between social medicine and population health. I'm not quite sure to do about the various other articles that could be considered &quot;related&quot; to one another, e.g. Social medicine, Lifestyle medicine, Preventive and social medicine. I was thinking linking through to the related fields section of public health with something like &quot;is one of the fields used to further public health&quot;.
 Talpedia (talk) 11:18, 26 June 2022 (UTC)
It's always a good idea to  to related subjects.  
Perhaps preventive medicine is &quot;the field of studying whether to check everyone's blood pressure&quot; and preventive healthcare is &quot;actually checking everyone's blood pressure&quot;?  We probably need an article focusing on the second one more than an article on the first, because we probably have a lot of articles that say things like &quot;Primary care providers offer preventive healthcare&quot;.

Paraphrasing DSM and ICD criteria

Hey, I've been around for a couple of months at WikiProject Psychology, and it's come to my attention that the DSM-3, DSM-4, DSM-5, ICD-10 and ICD-11 copyrights don't allow verbatim copies of diagnostic criteria for Wikipedia purposes. So I've gone through and found some articles for which this is an issue at  this list and I'm planning to paraphrase them so we have less risk of getting another notice like . My goal is to paraphrase the criteria and not to remove content from them. 

There are some popular articles in the list I've made, and also some fairly obscure ones. I'm thinking of starting from the bottom of the list I've made, which is mostly the more obscure ones, just giving a heads up and open to any feedback about doing this. Also, I think it might be worth mentioning this explicitly in  because it is so common;  currently does a poor job of stating explicitly against verbatim copies from the ICD and DSM diagnostic criteria. 

You can read more about this on my talk page  here. Darcyisverycute (talk) 08:19, 27 June 2022 (UTC)

Hmm, it feels like fair use should apply here legally (and  should apply within wikipedia). Should we really be humoring the DSM's and ICD's abuse of copyright law. However, looking through Darcyisverycute's talk page there seem to be some prior discussion about this though, and perhaps it isn't my decision whether wikipedia wants to get sued... . Talpedia (talk) 11:59, 27 June 2022 (UTC)
The difficulty with fair use in this instance is that what looks like (and probably would be) fair use on a single page is not necessarily fair use when the volume of quotations is considered across the entire website.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 17:02, 27 June 2022 (UTC)

Acronyms (or abbreviations) for viruses

Recently, I noticed all of these acronyms or abbreviations (I'll just call them acronyms) added to articles about viruses. This is a pretty big deal in my opinion. I have no idea why there would be a need to add these acronyms. None of them are cited. And I have not sen any use of them outside of the wikipedia articles.

For instance:
*Monkeypox virus has THREE acronyms- MPV, MPXV, and hMPXV
*In the same article, it lists variola (VARV), cowpox (CPX), and vaccinia (VACV)
*Influenza A virus has the acronym IAV
*Human alphaherpesvirus 1 has the acronym HHV-1 which is not in bold like the others

In everyone of these articles, the acronym IS NEVER USED AGAIN! What is the point?
This is just getting ridiculous. There is no need to add these useless acronyms that the average reader would not use. I checked . There was nothing in there about writing these acronyms.

I just checked the articles Norovirus and Rabies virus. Neither of them have an acronym. 

What do y'all think about this? Sneasel talk 04:58, 1 July 2022 (UTC)
Abbreviations and acronyms are covered by  – there is probably little  could add that wouldn't attract claims of . 
For time reasons I've only looked at your first bullet point; a quick Google shows MPXV is used,[https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/all-topics-z/monkeypox/factsheet-health-professionals] hMPVX is  for use,[https://www.science.org/content/article/rename-monkeypox-remove-geographic-stigma-researchers-say]; but that MPV is actually an abbreviation of Metapneumovirus.[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4531267/]
Initially I thought it may have been a typo of MPX (also in use). Except it was added as an abbreviation of monkeypox to the MPV dab page  why it's been added to the monkeypox page (I've not checked if it was the same editor who contributed the MPV abbreviation to both pages).
Given it's already used for another virus;  are probably not going to be using MPV for monkeypox. As such, I  until such time that they do (if ever). Little pob (talk) 12:15, 1 July 2022 (UTC)
I think it's a good idea to have (real) abbreviations for viruses in the article about the virus.  That suggests that Monkeypox virus gets &quot;MPXV&quot;, but does not mention VARV, CPX, or VACV. WhatamIdoing (talk) 17:19, 1 July 2022 (UTC)

Spinal decompression could use a review

Spinal decompression seems to discuss this only as &quot;a procedure intended to relieve pressure on the spinal cord or on one or more compressed nerve roots passing through or exiting the spinal column&quot;.

We need respectable  sources for fringe topics. This is of no use. Alexbrn (talk) 11:22, 6 July 2022 (UTC)
On the more general subject, I'm doubtful about this sentence in the lead:  &quot;There is no good medical evidence that the Feldenkrais method confers any health benefits.&quot;  
Feldenkrais may be selling a fairy tale about re-training nerves, but gentle exercise of any kind confers the health benefits of gentle exercise.  This statement seems as scientifically untenable as the marijuana folks saying that smoke of all kinds causes lung cancer, except for smoking marijuana, which they claimed for years could never cause lung cancer.  (Reminds me of the story put out by tobacco companies, which used to say that cigarettes &quot;strengthened&quot; the lungs.)  We don't have to buy their story, but we also shouldn't be accepting sentences that suggest it doesn't make any difference whether you spend your day doing gentle exercises or plopped in front of a television.

Reuse/adaptation of a graphic in a journal article?

Hi all, me again. [https://www.nature.com/articles/nri.2016.90 This Nature article] contains an extremely useful infographic (Fig 1.) that details the specifics of the differences in immune response between men and women from in-utero (I didn't even know that was possible) to old age. My question is, how do I incorporate this into Sex differences in human physiology, do we need to file some sort of form with the Rightslink Copyright Clearance Center?

Thank you all again for your help. X-750 Rust In Peace... Polaris 20:52, 6 July 2022 (UTC)

The &quot;graphic&quot; parts of the infographic are mostly decorative, so that could be omitted.  You could ask for advice at , but since @Marchjuly is the only person who has answered questions there recently, we might as well ping him here.  You could also try  from the authors.

Alright, I'll wait for a response from Marchjuly. Roughly, how would the procedure with the VRT proceed? X-750 Rust In Peace... Polaris 10:39, 7 July 2022 (UTC)
I believe that the process is something like the authors need to send an e-mail message from a provable e-mail address (e.g., name@employer.edu) that says &quot;I own the copyright on , and I agree to license  for use in Wikipedia according to &quot; (or perhaps sometimes &quot;this bit is so small that I agree it's not really copyrightable&quot;).  Then a volunteer has to check that it seems reasonable, and post a statement about the permission on wiki. WhatamIdoing (talk) 15:03, 7 July 2022 (UTC)
I follow you. How do we initiate the contact with the authors though? Do I send an email to the authors with that template at ? X-750 Rust In Peace... Polaris 20:44, 7 July 2022 (UTC)
E-mail is probably best.  If you look towards the end of the paper, there is a section called &quot;Corresponding author&quot; with the e-mail address for one of them.  I'd start the message with like &quot;I'm one of the volunteers at the English Wikipedia, and I'd like your permission to copy a table from your recent paper in &quot;.  You could give them a link to your user page as well.  (Also, before you do that, do you have a dedicated e-mail address for Wikipedia?  If you don't want to out yourself, then you don't really want to send e-mail from an e-mail address with your real name.)  
There are lots of sample e-mail messages at , but I think they are kind of on the old side.  I don't think that we really need to tell people what Wikipedia is these days. WhatamIdoing (talk) 17:06, 8 July 2022 (UTC)

While I agree that &quot;Xenocatabolism&quot; is not separately notable, lemmata like &quot;Longevity escape velocity&quot; and &quot;Strategies for engineered negligible senescence&quot; certainly are. The still small, but ever-growing field of anti-aging movement is receiving increasing news coverage. De Grey is a huge face of the movement, therefore it should be no surprise that quite a few articles on this matter refer to him. As long as an article is notable, neutral (resp. balanced) and verifiable, I can't see any problem with that. Aquarius3500 (talk) 17:09, 9 July 2022 (UTC)

I also found several other sources for improving that article, including [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00204-020-02655-z this review article] and [https://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/369222 this article], and I'm hoping to work through them for adding citations to other parts of the article. It's slow work for me because I'm not familiar with the field, and I'm not experienced in finding or using medical sources. That's ok, I just would like other people to get involved as well, including to check my work. Dreamyshade (talk) 01:20, 17 July 2022 (UTC)

Use of controlled clinical terminology 

I am surprised that the info box template for disease doesn’t have a section for SNOMED-CT and ICD-10.  These would be helpful tremendously in using the resultant Wikidata as well as being helpful for those sort of people who use ICD-10 and SNOMED-CT.

Ditto for signs &amp; symptoms.

There is also a strong case for use of SNOMED-CT to identify procedures, anatomic locations, diagnostic studies, drugs, and so on.

There is a URL representation of SNOMED-CT (including both concept model attributes, as well as “unapproved” attributes which could be very helpful in representation of knowledge (vs. intensionally defining a concept).

For a host of reasons there is a need for a curated, peer reviewed basic knowledge representation for some really basic use cases.  e.g. “pathological process” CAUSES “disease”, “disease” HAS MANIFESTATION “clinical finding”, “drug” TREATS “disease”, etc.

I am delighted to work on this, and can probably even churn out some useful content (from SNOMED chiefly, but can also supply mappings to ICD-10, recognizing that ICD-10 is a gross simplification and at best a classification scheme but should ‘’’NEVER’’’ be used for clinical use as it is too ambiguous and imprecise.  Yes, I know, commercial EHR systems do it all the time, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t a profoundly bad idea.  And don’t even get me started on ICD-10-CM…).

@DrKC MD, that information is usually in , which is placed in
External links
at the end of the page.  It used to be in the infoboxes, but the list got kind of long and confusing, especially when we started adding lay-friendly summary contents (like the relevant specialty), so we moved the links off to a separate template. WhatamIdoing (talk) 21:48, 17 July 2022 (UTC)
As a side note, the ICD codes are something that has a specific, niche audience that we know about through comments on social media:  Medical coders sometimes use Wikipedia to find codes for unfamiliar conditions and procedures (presumably if they can't find something through a more definitive source).

Ectopic pregnancy



Just a heads up, last night I had to [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ectopic_pregnancy&amp;diff=1098695903&amp;oldid=1098545326&amp;diffmode=visual revert an edit to] the article about ectopic pregnancy to remove a -violating screed about how terminating an ectopic is totally not an abortion.

Whilst, depending on the definitions you use, termination of an ectopic pregnancy may not technically be an abortion, this is besides the point that the standard treatment for ectopic pregnancy is still termination; there is a worrying trend outside the encyclopedia, especially since the Dobbs draft leaked, to make excuses for the draconian abortion laws that are now coming into effect across America and causing a major chilling effect for obstetricians (leading, in turn, to more Savita Halappanavars). 

It's especially important right now that the encyclopedia not be used to disseminate medical misinformation, so it would be nice for some more knowledgeable eyes to keep an eye on articles relating to pregnancy. Sceptre (talk) 14:46, 17 July 2022 (UTC)
A meta-obervation. Years ago I took a decision not to edit any -related articles, because it was not likely to be a gainful activity. But AP2 is infecting everything, not least medical topics. It is profoundly depressing. The s are up to the job of defending against bad edits, but the amount of needless drama is increasing. Alexbrn (talk) 15:22, 17 July 2022 (UTC)
 Ugh, the pedant in me demands that this is not necessarily an attept to spread misinformation, but an attempt to split up the definition of termination so that there is a category X of &quot;necessarily termination&quot; and a category Y (to be called abortion). The aim is to render everything in Y immoral, by putting everything else in X such that Y can be considered &quot;essentially immoral&quot;. This is a common process in law where previous precedent is ignored through claiming your new case is sui generis. The misinformation (should it exists) would lie in claiming that this new unusual definition is commonly used, or wilfully encouraging people to fall into fallacious reasoning through Conflation of the new concept Y with the broader meaning of abotion. A reasonable argument would be that wikipedia should use the definition of the term used by medics.
 It's worth noting that the game of generality tweking isn't an exclusive preserve of pro-life groups. I am highly suspicious that the definition of abortion as &quot;termination of a pregnancy where a fetus has implanted&quot; used by medics may have evolved to exclude certain forms of birth control (though that would require a good deal of reading) and there is a clear incentive for pro-choice groups to interpret abortion as broadly as possible to extend the &quot;moral justification&quot; or necessary abortion to the practice as a whole.
 As to what this means for editing? I'm not so sure. Courts and newspapers will probably proceed to push term Y, and then editors will try to cite it.  Other editors will try to use WP:MEDRS to keep these sources out of the article. I am unsure if our editorial powers extend to talking about Y as &quot;an abortion that protects the health of the expectant mother, which the source calls an abortion&quot;. After sufficient time there will be academic sources that comment on Y, X and the term &quot;abortion&quot;. Talpedia (talk) 17:38, 17 July 2022 (UTC) 
Of course, the eventual end-goal of these people is that — as the now-famous op-ed goes – the only moral abortion will be their abortion (or, indeed, their mistresses'). There's a significant amount of winners' regret going around now, to the point where major pro-life 501(c)(3)s are [https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/3559579-swalwell-presses-anti-abortion-activist-on-whether-10-year-olds-should-carry-babies/ going to Congress and testifying that a child rape victim terminating her pregnancy isn't an abortion]. But Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, and we do not and must not censor medical fact to help right-wing culture warriors sleep better at night. Sceptre (talk) 18:00, 17 July 2022 (UTC)
 Hmm. I'm not quite sure it medical fact though. There is a &quot;social fact&quot; about what medics call abortion. I guess there are a series of facts that argue and conclude that the state of an embryo implanted in the uterus is similar to one implanted elsewhere such that the procedure to terminate an ectopic pregnancy is the same as abortion - but then a medic will also tell you that preventing implantation of a fertilized egg through use of a morning after pill is also not abortion. Such interpretations leave room for an argument than termination of an ectopic pregnancy is different because the fetus has not implanted in the uterus. We should, nevertheless, be clear about the terms we use and prefer the terms in use in most current scholarly works. Talpedia (talk) 18:23, 17 July 2022 (UTC)
Like I said in the OP, you can argue in good faith whether termination of an ectopic pregnancy is abortion, but these people aren't arguing in good faith; I don't know how you can reconcile the belief that preventing implantation (with something like Plan B) is abortion but terminating a fertilised ovum post-implantation isn't, after all. 
But one thing we can agree on is that if a ten-year-old child gets pregnant and crosses state lines to terminate her pregnancy, that is an abortion, no matter how much special pleading the forced birth brigade engage in. It's not 2012 any more; we don't have to pretend that in cases of legitimate rape, the female body has all sorts of ways to shut that whole thing down. Sceptre (talk) 19:42, 17 July 2022 (UTC)
 I mean to me lots of this is a game with words. My only position here is to recognise that a lot of this discussion is a game with words, and we should make sure we don't get sucked into such games.
  You cannot, you could however argue that ectopic pregnancy and plan b are equivalent and distinct from other forms of termination at a scientific (rather than moral) level. I personally think such a distinction aren't that relevant scientifically or morally. But this gets into WP:FORUM territory, the point here was mostly pedantry, but also to note that &quot;politically or procedurally useful&quot; distinctions is perhaps a feature of medicine itself as well as recent US politics.  Talpedia (talk) 19:59, 17 July 2022 (UTC)

Yes.  Also, it has changed, and we've not done a great job of keeping up with the changing language.  To whomever removed that old note at the top of Abortion that cited ob/gyn textbooks claiming that miscarriages are called abortions:  Thank you.  I think the solution used there (i.e., to point people to Definitions of abortion) is a good one, and might be helpful in all of the disputes about whether _____ is technically an abortion.
Articles like Ectopic pregnancy could certainly get a paragraph on people (not just in the US) being afraid that anti-abortion laws will result in medically unsound management of ectopic pregnancies.  It should not, however, say that any US location actually has such stupid laws unless and until we have an  source to support the claim that such a law actually exists.

Alzheimer's research controversy
Please read all of  and Sylvain Lesné and  on Lesne, and sources, lest we jump the gun. Particularly please read my urges for caution, to avoid a  issue of getting too far ahead on this breaking story.  Where do we put a description of Aβ*56 ?? Does that belong at a) amyloid at b) amyloid beta or at c) amyloid hypothesis?  My suspicion is b), but not a neuroscientist.  And I can't write that content even if I know where to put it; for now, I have temporarily set up the very awkward amyloid beta star 56 as a redirect to Lesne.  Some sources are comparing this to the Wakefield fraud, but my hunch is that is hyperbole, so we need to take it slow (and see what develops over the next few days in major US news outlets).

It's bad news for Ashe, bad news for Lesné, bad news for US taxpayers, bad news for University of Minnesota, but may be a flash in the pan for the big picture on the amyloid hypothesis and the overall Alzheimer's research.

Analysis and Response Toolkit for Trust


Hello!

I am writing to inform about a tool that is currently in development, and is possibly interesting for WikiProject Medicine members. 

[https://www.hackshackers.com/ Hacks/Hackers], along with its project partners, announces the [https://artt.cs.washington.edu/ Analysis and Response Toolkit for Trust] (ARTT). ARTT aims to provide motivated citizens with tools and resources to discuss vaccine efficacy online. ARTT provides these connectors with expert guidance in analyzing information online and in responding to others through trust-building ways.

In theory, ARTT users would engage with the tool when seeking guidance on how to respond to vaccine misinformation online. The tool would suggest resources that have been vetted for quality and reliability in hopes of encouraging productive dialogue. 

During the first research phase for this project, Wikipedians have been asked to provide feedback on potential uses for the tool within Wikipedia. For example, could a tool that vets sources be used to improve articles? Furthermore, could articles themselves be elevated to the point at which they could be recommended by the tool as reliability sources?

Starting with schizophrenia, and moving on to update MDD soon. Cas Liber (talk · ) 11:22, 21 August 2022 (UTC)
 I did a little editing and tried to add some ().
 There are often sort of &quot;two levels&quot; of summary. So for example, the history article might summarize something else (e.g. History of psychosurgery) which then wants to be mentioned in the Schizophrenia article, so I find myself wanting to then link to the e.g. History of psychosurgery from Schizophrenia even though we are already summarizing...
 I think if we link through to the appropriate &quot;anti-psychiatry&quot; articles through summary style we might reduce &quot;advocacy&quot;ish editing. I've sort of done this a bit with the history section. The advocacy editing isn't necessarily  or even . It's entirely relevant to the schizophrenia article that the vagueness of diagnosis has allowed to be used to torture people for political reasons the problem is more that people go and add something quite specific to the wrong promenent section of an article. Hopefully if it's easy for them to see that the general topic is linked to, and then see that the material they way to add is covered there, there will be less of a desire to add content.
 I'd just add that I view another sort of &quot;advocacy&quot; existing and indeed evident in the article. Which I would classify as a &quot;pro-psychiatric-powers / benevolent coercion&quot; advocacy. This consists of doing things like: pretending the SGAs have fixed the side effects of FGA so it's less bad to making people take antipsychotics, attributing non-adherence to lack of insight and using ill-defined notions of insight when there are numerous other factors and insight varies over time so that coercion is more benevolent and less coercive, discounting uncertainty in diagnosis so that coercive lifelong use of antipsychotics is more justifiable. I've addressed two of those issues in the article, one remains. This form of advocacy is rather more ingrained and well-funded. 
 We probably want a section on adherence to maintenance therapy in Antipsychotic to link to from this article to avoid too much content... though there are some issues because First-episode psychosis, Bipolar and other diagnoses will have some unique factors to adherence as well as shared ones and the literature won't necessarily be very helpful in telling us which factors are unique to a diagnosis rather than antipsychotics as a whole. Talpedia (talk) 15:35, 21 August 2022 (UTC)
I do appreciate what you're saying in regards to &quot;pro-psychiatric&quot; advocacy. Some of this is a problem of attribution, some of it is an issue of tone in the sources themselves. We cannot totally fix the problem of the field, we must only reflect what the field gives us, as in everything in Wikipedia. To do otherwise would be to . I think we can find more modern sourcing which fixes some, but not all, of the issues you have highlighted. — Shibbolethink (♔ ) 16:32, 21 August 2022 (UTC)
I haven't yet looked at your edits, but at least your ideas about using wikilinks to help demonstrate better summary style and manage the issues is a good one, because the article size keeps spiraling.  Some of the recent edits don't reflect the sources, and introducing laypress sources in to the medication section, for text that belongs in Society and culture, leads to POV/UNDUE concerns.  I also agree with Shibbolethink that there is some  advocacy going on; reflecting mainstream consensus of high quality sources in the medical sections, while exploring Society and culture issues in that section, would help.  Featured articles must  maintain a consistent citation style, and citations in the style used at schizophrenia, with vancouver author format, are generated by using [https://citation-template-filling.toolforge.org/cgi-bin/index.cgi this PMID filler].  I will go adjust your citations to conform to  when I have time to catch up. SandyGeorgia (Talk)  18:27, 21 August 2022 (UTC)
 My take on  here is that the consensus that people think exists, or even that people working in related fields think exists, is often not the same as the consensus you find when you have a look at the research literature. This can lead to a form of &quot;truthiness&quot; where people write according to a consensus that does not aware exist. Sometimes the &quot;false consensus&quot; is old, sometimes it's influenced by other things. Being aware of the biases at play can exist help you identify when something is likely to be contradicted by the sources, but should not feed into the actual material you write.
 Thanks for the heads up about the cites... I tend to use the visual editor with itss citation tool. So if there was a way I could make that do the write thing that'd be great Talpedia (talk) 19:39, 21 August 2022 (UTC)
Unfortunately, the visual editor has been the bane of medical content, and when editing a Featured medical article (and even a good deal of other medical content), you just need to be aware when the vauthor format and the Diberri/BogHog template is used to fill citations (it is SO much cleaner, and if we had raised awareness of it, rather than pushing other citation methods beginning years back, it would now be more likely that newer editors would provide PMIDs and DOIS), and just keep the template filling tool handy.  I will go through and fix all at Schizophrenia in the next few hours (got sidetracked at the COPYVIO issue above at tomato fever).  I'd add that if I didn't have to (mis)spend so much time cleaning up and maintaining our dwindling number of FAs alone, I'd have more time to focus on the more nuanced issues you raise, rather than becoming completely demoralized at seeing constantly deteriorating medical content defeatured.  We've lost most of our neurology and neuropsych featured content, as once they lose status and others start unwatching, they turn into just more black goo on the internet.

Hemi-Sync

*
*
This appears to be a company[https://hemi-sync.com/] selling an audio collection of &quot;binaural beats&quot; which, among other things, are claimed to have medical applications (e.g. replacing opioids for pain relief). The current article has no secondary sources for this (and I cold find none). I have attempted to  to Binaural beats but am getting pushback. Anybody know more about this? More eyes could help.
Note there is much overlap with the Robert Monroe article. Alexbrn (talk) 14:25, 22 August 2022 (UTC)

I was tempted to take this to  as the &quot;Hemi-Sync&quot; isn't mentioned at Binaural beats (making the redirect not worth it/that is a common deletion reason), but the fact that it has history makes AfD a better venue more equipped to deal with it. If you do not believe it notable , please take it to AfD. I am not opposed to that. TheSandDoctor Talk 14:53, 22 August 2022 (UTC)
It might be notable quackery, from what this Vice article[https://www.vice.com/en/article/9a35de/high-on-audio-i-tried-to-relax-with-binaural-beats] is reporting about the company's claims. Whatever, the current version with no reliable sourcing for its medical claims is poor. Could redirect to Robert Monroe and then trim the Hemi-Sync stuff there? Alexbrn (talk) 15:06, 22 August 2022 (UTC)
I think that sounds like a great idea. WhatamIdoing (talk) 15:45, 22 August 2022 (UTC)
That is a better target than Binaural beats -- I was only opposed to it being redirected there (Binaural beats) as it had no reference to it and the redirect didn't make sense. TheSandDoctor Talk 16:06, 22 August 2022 (UTC)
That's because &quot;binaural beats&quot; shouldn't be a section of Beat (acoustics). The former is a poorly understood perceptual phenomenon, the latter is well established math/physics (acoustic heterodyning). I would suggest a separate article for binaural beats and merging the hemi-sync stuff in there. - Palpable (talk) 16:13, 22 August 2022 (UTC)
But there's nothing to merge, surely? All the sources are unusable. Alexbrn (talk) 16:16, 22 August 2022 (UTC)
I'd defer to the MEDRS experts on that. My reading is that, in the absence of secondary sources, MEDRS seems to allow for primary sources as long as they have appropriate caveats, i.e. no endorsement of the results, but mentioning that the studies were done is ok. I'm not particularly interested in hemi-sync or binaural beats but if I were, I would appreciate having the primary sources linked so I could at least read them. The intent of MEDRS here isn't totally clear to me.
My main point is that the binaural beats stuff should be pulled out of the acoustic beats article where it really doesn't belong, presumably to a new article. - Palpable (talk) 16:34, 22 August 2022 (UTC)

The (multiple) Alzheimer drug scandals

There are big issues in these articles and most of what is in them is based on Cassava press releases (as is the source you link above), and the articles are a wreck, with millions of $$ at play in research money and the stock market issues.  And there is more on the talk page of this article than I can handle alone (along with the mess on most of WP:MEDs older FAs, that I have also been trying to maintain alone).

Are you just looking for a source that says they're married?  There seem to be a couple of less-than-stellar sources (e.g., [https://www.thedailybeast.com/a-new-alzheimers-drug-called-simufilam-could-transform-treatment-or-doom-its-maker-cassava-sciences]) and The New Yorker article that you mentioned (available through ; it says &quot;Many of Wang's papers were co-authored by Dr. Lindsay Burns, a senior vice-president at Cassava—and Barbier's wife&quot;), but you might like the one written by Burns herself:  https://www.harvardvarsityclub.org/article.html?aid=532  If you need additional sources, then it's possible that there might be a passing mention in one of these long video interviews with Barbier (which I haven't watched):  [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4473705-cassava-sciences-sava-ceo-remi-barbier-data-integrity-elon-musk-and-haters][https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8ipamyLuuQ]
It's not clear to me if this is important to the article about the company, and I doubt that it's relevant to the article about the drug.  Married couples who found companies are a dime a dozen.  The Twitterverse seems to think that the husband is blinded to the science because of family loyalty, but CEOs of publicly traded companies often seem to be blind to anything that might suggest their company will fail, even without a family connection, and you could make up a culturally appropriate story about the stereotypical reaction of the husband no matter what he does (e.g., &quot;Of course he's doing nothing; he's just another clueless, bumbling husband&quot; or &quot;Of course he's denouncing the fraud; he's angry at the other researcher for tricking his wife!&quot;).  It's usual for biographies to mention that the subject is married to another notable person, but in the article about the company or the drug, it might be challenging to present that information without violating NOR (i.e., by implying that the marriage is relevant to the scandal, as opposed to a minor but colorful historical detail, akin to Silicon Valley's penchant for starting computer companies in someone's garage).

Woo claims at Johrei#Efficacy

Not sure how to best deal with this one. It's a bunch of SCAM claims back by SCAM journals.

Alcohol abuse/use disorder

The discussion at  may interest some editors here. WhatamIdoing (talk) 05:32, 6 August 2022 (UTC)
*give opinion(gave mine)--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 13:35, 6 August 2022 (UTC)

No matter what happens at ANI, it appears that we have a couple of problems that we could usefully discuss.  Off hand, they include:
* To what extent should we prefer to use modern language vs. sticking to the cited (and out of date) sources?
** For example, if the source uses a previous name for Intellectual disability, should we use the current ICD-10 term?
** Sometimes it'll be obvious (we used to call aspirin a form of chemotherapy, but the concept of chemo has since been narrowed to cancer treatment).  Other times, it might not.  It's these latter cases that need to be discussed.
* To what extent should we prefer to use non-stigmatizing language vs. other options?
** For example:  Psychiatric disorder, psychological disorder, mental illness, mental disease, mental health condition...
** Also:  What if you think _____ is stigmatizing, but I think it isn't?
* How can we help editors deal with the way that diagnostic criteria and terms change or are disputed over time?
** For example, previous definitions said that every pregnant woman with high blood pressure and swollen ankles had pre-eclampsia.  Current definitions usually require high blood pressure plus protein in the urine.  So – did she really have pre-eclampsia?
** For example, sometimes the Lumpers and splitters get their way, and an old diagnosis is split into two (Plague is three separate diseases, the way some define &quot;a&quot; disease), or two old diagnoses are combined into one (e.g., DSM-IV separated Alcohol abuse from Alcohol dependence; these were combined into the DSM-V's single entry on Alcohol use disorder; Autism spectrum disorder was more or less created by merging Asperger syndrome with [old definition] Classic autism, PDD-NOS, and a few other things).
* How can we help editors deal with everyday language vs. technical terminology?
** For example, male/female; chronic fatigue syndrome vs being tired all the time; alcoholism vs alcohol use disorder)
** Some changes are easy (you should almost always use kidney instead of renal, because these are exact synonyms and most people only know the more common one).  But should we prefer everyday language or common names when that is less precise?
* What advice can we give to editors about words that have multiple definitions (one of which might be correct)?
** For example, consider cancer:  Many people who say they have Head and neck cancer don't technically have cancer (instead, they have non-cancerous &quot;benign&quot; tumors that could kill them).  Or perhaps I want to shock readers by pointing out the True Fact™ that blood cancer and sarcomas aren't cancers, because they're not carcinomas.  But they are cancers, in the sense that most non-medical people understand what that word means.
There might be more questions.  @Talpedia and @Colin, I'd particularly be interested in your thoughts about the questions that should be asked. WhatamIdoing (talk) 21:21, 8 August 2022 (UTC)
Also, in the short term, would it be more useful to everyone if we tried to write up something specific to alcohol-related disorders (the locus of this dispute), to psychology/DSM-type subjects more generally, or more broadly (perhaps even extending outside of core medical topics)?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 00:51, 9 August 2022 (UTC)


Some thoughts. These are interesting questions. I tend to prefer to think in a case-by-case way, where you sort of get generalish principles from the specifics of an individual case and after a while you distill this into a policy, so I guess I feel like we should start with the narrowest case of alcohol-related disorders. On the other hand, I have no experience doing policy work here or elsewhere and think that wikipedia might have more of a &quot;top down culture&quot; to doing things - I don't really see people take a precedent based approach that much. Both top down and case by case approaches have benefits, though in real life I get more irked by &quot;we are creating a policy for things we don't understand yet&quot; than &quot;how will we live without more rules&quot;. 

* I can certainly see the arguments for sticking to sources when you have disagreements, possibly with a little contextualization when people start disagreeing. 
* As was brought up in ANI, for  we need to be careful to avoid misrepresenting people. I think it might be better to say, &quot;James was diagnosed as manic depressive - cite 1 (a disorder now known as bipolar cite 2)&quot; rather than &quot;James was diagnosed with bipolar disorder&quot;.
* I'm not sure I like some of the search and replace that may have been going on in the ANI, and I think the meaning of alcohol abuse is sort of a case-by-case thing. This sort of issues seems like an easy way to pointlessly spread drama across lots of pages where no one really cares. It's different when you have a handful of pages that deal with a topic or closely related topics. I guess for things like &quot;person first&quot; or  it's more open and shut. 
* I'm inclined to open up &quot;non-stigmatizing&quot; a little and say that some of this language can be more generally &quot;political&quot;. You can get turf wars between different fields and different values. I think we want to stay out of these turf wars where possible. There may be cases where things are genuinely non-stigmatizing, but yes I feel that technicality is a better escape and defense from stigmatizing language than being &quot;played&quot; politically. 
* I can see a pretty good argument for consistent language across wikipedia. A rule of thumb might be if you are linking to an article or section of an article that is genuinly about just that thing you should use the name of the article. This sort of moves the conflict into merge discussions.

 

This feels like a bit of a nightmare for editors. I'd throw in that a similar problem is competing standards like ICD versus DSM. I think google n-gram viewer could at times be helpful since it can confirm if a term has completely fallen out of use. I like the idea of systematic reviews to resolve this sort of stuff, but then the systematic review that DarcyIsVeryCute took the easy root and outsourced to the DSM. 



The case that came up was in . I can see an argument for &quot;use common names if the sources you cite are not by expert authors&quot;&quot;. 

I dislike the use of common language on medical articles, but this is perhaps a personal preference that doesn't easily fit into wikipedia's values or principles. I am quite aware that language can be key to power in professional groups and bureaucratic processes and that people can use jargon to intimidate, confuse, bar access, hide information and suggest complexity where there is none. I don't think wikipedia should be propping up these barriers so I think it should use technical language to give people access to this language and prepare them for other reading. Wikipedia has the power of the wikilink to give the definitions of terms. But obviously . The counter argument is that you are excluding readers and sort of &quot;extending the reach&quot; of jargon by doing this; the former is plausible the latter less so. Professions will have their own reach and maintain their jargon, and ignoring the jargon doesn't really decrease this. 



In practice, if I were editing around this I would resolve it by trying to find newer sources.  I don't know the answer more generally. 

There are a bunch of other good questions here that I haven't addressed, but I think that's it for now! I think the principle I use myself outside of wikipedia &quot;when in doubt, choose technical and overly precise language&quot;... I guess because I want the discussion to be precise, and it's almost a request for others to provide details. I also am sort of of positive about &quot;follow the citation graph of your article to the most recent systematic review&quot; as an approach.

Talpedia (talk) 02:34, 9 August 2022 (UTC)

I think too many questions at once, and so hard to focus. One issue is with formal diagnostic terms, the names that committees and organisations agonise over and publish periodically, and that may then change over time. Sometimes a name changes without any change of scope, but sometimes the scope is widened, narrowed or redefined. Sometimes the name doesn't change but those familiar with the literature will know that in the past its scope was different. As noted here, there may be times when we have to use older terminology but perhaps indicate what the new terms is (and this may vary depending on how reliably they are equivalent). Someone in history who had a &quot;fit&quot; or &quot;seizure&quot;, for example, cannot be assumed to have had an epileptic seizure. Some medical literature, for example, uses deprecated terms for particular seizure types, and this may be because the doctor is familiar with them and hasn't adopted the new terms yet, or because the doctor is writing outside their speciality and last learned about seizure types in the 1980s at medical school. So there are likely reasons why even modern sources might not use the optimal technical term.

But there are other problems we get where the word is not a technical term invented by a committee. Whether to use the word &quot;woman&quot; or say &quot;committed suicide&quot; or write &quot;wheelchair bound&quot; or &quot;patients&quot; or use &quot;she&quot; for ships... most of recent MOS battles, are not words that we let experts create and define for us. I think for those, what language our sources use is of limited importance.

Then there's medical terminology for anatomy or types of drug or treatments. I agree with Talpedia that part of our mission should be to educate readers about these words, which they may encounter outside of Wikipedia. But at the same time, we have to bring readers with us, and we can't rely on links to lift all reader's vocabulary to the level of a neurologist, and writing like one would to a fellow neurologist, say, gives a strong message to the reader that they are too stupid to understand this subject. It is well established that we need to make an effort for the general reader, but I disagree with the style taken by many medical article leads. The point here is that we will be compelled at times to choose different words than our sources do, and it requires some care to ensure substitutions are appropriate.

In terms of approach, I wonder if merely fixing individual words is always likely to rub some people up the wrong way, and end up badly at AN/I. Most of the text on Wikipedia is overdue a rewrite and an update, so perhaps it is better if editors do that, with new sources, and then they can write in their own words how they see best.

Wrt whether you think something isn't stigmatising (or offensive, or biased, or whatever) I think we need to move away from editors having to convince a majority of RFC participants that this is the case. There will always be language conservatives and always be those who dislike someone saying one should write this way or that way, and such people are rarely honest and direct about this. Rather than saying &quot;I am conservative about this and see no need to change&quot; they invent rules like &quot;stick to sources&quot; when they think the sources might be more likely to align with their preference. They ask us to respect experts if they agree with them and ignore experts if they don't. If some reasonable people find a term problematic, we should at least consider alternatives. Sometimes alternative are remarkably trouble free, yet we still see huge resistance to change. -- Colin°Talk 07:58, 9 August 2022 (UTC)

Today, I feel like there are two general themes:  
# Tension between precision/accuracy and understandable/educational content.
# Specific problems of multiple meanings (e.g., is that &quot;DSM-IV Alcohol Abuse&quot; or is that just plain-English &quot;abuse of alcohol&quot;?)
Does that seem like a fair grouping?  Does anyone have interest in one/the other/another? WhatamIdoing (talk) 23:14, 11 August 2022 (UTC)

In the US any definition of AUD is going to inevitably derive from the DSM in some way, either by including or opposing the DSM's specific criteria. I think of it this way; if I am a prospective researcher wanting to propose a new diagnostic category, how could I not rely on the most widely accepted source on that? This can only happen when either the DSM does not include the disorder, such as prolonged grief disorder up until very recently, or if the DSM's position is highly contentious among academia. The bias towards the DSM and away from the ICD is the main flexibility I think researchers have in changing diagnoses, but the ICD itself often piggybacks from the DSM's conclusions and is more sparse for a variety of sections such as personality disorders. I don't think we have any options other than to use what's served up in the DSM because of this academic deadlock that new definitions need to rely on the DSM to gain academic support. 

When sources are out of date, there may not be newer sources, such as for a deceased BLP. There may never be a reliable source translating the mental disorder. I believe in this situation an editor-friendly solution would be to make a template either as a footnote or in brackets that says the following: 

 (which in  was known as   )

Which draws data from a template-protected table where consensus on MEDRS agrees for uncontroversial equivalent names ie. manic depressive vs bipolar disorder. For controversial disorders where it is not unanimously agreed the new and old definitions correspond one-to-one, I believe it is most appropriate instead to require a reliable source reporting on the difference for that specific situation. 

What I am proposing might be somewhat technically new, a template which contains a citation and maybe also a footnote, and makes sure the description is consistent and can change on a wide scale with consensus. I'm not sure if that is possible, but it is the most editor-friendly option I can think of for maintenance. I also think this is an &quot;easy answer&quot; in that it defers discussion to working out which equivalently named disorders are uncontroversial, which with the criteria I set out here I think is fairly straightforward. Since it is at this point clear that there is always going to be a loss or change of meaning if we modify information from sources to call alcohol abuse as AUD or vice versa, my proposal separates these case-by-case situations with open-and-shut situations.

Lastly, I don't think  is open and shut, as Talpedia says, in psychology. The main examples of this I have are &quot;narcissists&quot; and &quot;psychopaths&quot; which are not person-first terms, and also continue to be used academically especially in criminal psychology (a field which lacks person-first language among a general lack of empathy for individuals). The terms &quot;narcissists&quot; and &quot;psychopaths&quot; are also extensively used on Wikipedia. Thanks Darcyisverycute (talk) 02:36, 13 August 2022 (UTC)

@Darcyisverycute, would you recommend the &quot;X, now known as Y&quot; even for uncontroversial name changes?   AIUI the only difference between, e.g., &quot;manic depression&quot; and &quot;bipolar disorder&quot; is the name.  Why wouldn't you just use the modern name?  It feels like writing &quot;He was buried in Leningrad (which in 1991 was renamed Saint Petersburg) in 1952&quot;, when &quot;He was buried in St Petersburg in 1952&quot; or &quot;He was buried in what is now called St Petersburg in 1952&quot; would be adequate.
If it's easier to think about a medical example, do you expect to see articles talking about deaths from &quot;consumption (which was renamed tuberculosis in the 20th century)&quot; or &quot;quinsy (the historical name for Peritonsillar abscess)&quot;?  What about offensive historical names?  I don't think we should have articles say things like &quot;His first child had mongolism (the racist name used in the original description of what is now called Down syndrome)&quot;?
More generally, I think we might benefit from a discussion about when and whether to stick to the cited source alone (which may be outdated, biased, etc.), or to stick to the overall mass of sources. WhatamIdoing (talk) 17:45, 13 August 2022 (UTC)
@WhatamIdoing Thanks for the good examples to test the idea. The question here seems to be, if/when does adding the old name next to the new name add encyclopedic value that readers might want to know about without having to check the sources directly? I am still a little undecided, my initial thoughts are that writing both forms adds encyclopedic value in most or all cases. Prefacing my other ideas though and to answer your last question, I think using the historical term is only appropriate if a majority (or substantial minority) of sources primarily use the historical term - there should always be a preference for using current terminology, but if we are trying to &quot;medically translate&quot; old sources it's important that process is visible to readers. 
For your example of Leningrad and Saint Petersburg, the renaming is well known, but people learning about the topic without clicking on the wikilink might think Leningrad is a place that still exists, and the information in brackets or a footnote has value to that audience. Maybe it is easier to understand by saying the new name first, like &quot;He was buried in Saint Petersburg in 1952 (which was at the time known as Leningrad)&quot;. 
About the consumption/tuberculosis example, I think this emphasises that the specific phrasing &quot;which is now known as...&quot; or &quot;which in  was known as...&quot; is semantically different to &quot;which was renamed...&quot; because the renaming itself for these terms can happen both slowly through cultural acceptance, and through a formal process by authoritative bodies.
I think there is also encyclopedic value to someone learning about historical medicine to know that peritonsillar abscess used to be called quinsy. More specifically that the term [https://www.etymonline.com/word/quinsy#etymonline_v_3209 originated in the late 14th century] and that it is [https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22817-peritonsillar-abscess-quinsy still used (albeit infrequently) by medical sources as a synonym for Peritonsillar abscess]. I think  or disambiguation page is better to use if the term is still used for the specific article, and for articles mentioning the term any alternative name should be fine (possibly using  so it is easier to track).
Thinking about this overnight, I think the template would work better as a footnote so the information is accessible but does not bloat text body readability. For the same reason I think it would make sense if the proposed template is used only for the first occurrence of the word/term. The mongolism example seems to ask the relevance of  in medical articles. Based on that guideline, I think we can assume a majority of readers won't know mongolism is equivalent to Down syndrome, and it is a vulgar term, so some care is required to not censor the history of the term's specific usage while also not bloating the text. This also emphasies that there no reason to use the vulgar term in-article if it is not widely used among the cited sources. Darcyisverycute (talk) 03:10, 14 August 2022 (UTC)
The very last phrase has grabbed my attention.  Generally speaking, there can't be a question of whether something is &quot;widely used among the cited sources&quot;, because there is usually just one source cited for a given claim.  As a result, we can have a situation in which:
* The specific source cited at the end of this sentence uses Old Name.
* Most sources (and all modern medical sources) use New Name.
Should we be focused on &quot;the [currently] cited sources&quot;?  Or on what's &quot;widely used among [all reliable] sources&quot;?  (The latter is the way we determined  and .)
And – instead of answering this question right now, I want you to answer this question:  Do you think that would be an appropriate and productive question to ask the wider community? WhatamIdoing (talk) 20:23, 14 August 2022 (UTC)
Apologies for my late reply (real life stuff getting in the way at the moment). I agree the tough question here is what specific idea we can establish consensus on to resolve the majority of these individual choices of language (which on their own are minor or trivial, but at a large scale must maintain consistency of some sort to avoid difficult-to-detect bias). In many ways I think this kind of initiative seeks a stable consensus on-wiki where none exists in real life, which I think is a genuine source of difficulty in choosing a question that won't inevitably lead to a &quot;no consensus&quot;. 
The two policies you mention seem to be very relevant to this discussion and I think they can help with forming a specific question about alternative wordings. Without looking at the policy discussion, 's main difference to the discussion here seems to be that we are changing article text and not titles, and I think the restriction around titles is that both technically and logistically it's only possible to have one; so there are slightly different incentives to that decision. About , I find something curious in there: . If I am interpreting that correctly, for alias terms to be used in an article, there only needs to be verifiable evidence of its usage. I think a comparison can be drawn between list articles and lists of aliases as used in-article; balancing the use of verifiable terms/items in due weight is inherently a subjective process which in list articles often requires inclusion criteria to be decided case-by-case. If you could also point me in the right direction for any P&amp;Gs other than the one relevant paragraph at  about using alias/similar terms in article text, I haven't been able to find any other mentions of it.
About starting a wider discussion (I am assuming you mean an RfC), I think your draft question is good, I also think the question could use improvement in contextualising it with existing P&amp;Gs. Eg. &quot;When a term has multiple equivalent names and some are , is it acceptable to use the  terms if they are not the  nor widely used, but used among a substantial (possibly historical) minority of reliable sources?&quot; 
N.B. I feel like it could be valuable to have some sort of &quot;RfC question drafting&quot; process on-wiki since in many cases it seems the initial RfC wording can bias/derail discussion. Darcyisverycute (talk) 09:51, 20 August 2022 (UTC)
I agree about drafting a question in advance.  I have been considering the  approach, but I currently think we should go with the most popular format and encourage free-form discussion.
Do we need to address the question of to what degree a term is considered offensive?  There is a range, from widely condemned (e.g., racist names; anything named after a Nazi scientist), discouraged by official and semi-official bodies (e.g., professional organizations and medical textbooks say that spontaneous abortion is callous and offensive), just outdated (e.g., conditions that were renamed in ICD-10 or DSM-IV), to minority objections (e.g., men who think Male breast cancer should be called &quot;chest cancer&quot; because it sounds more manly).  Then there are the non-objectionable differences, such as names that vary per country (e.g., full blood count vs complete blood count) or that just have multiple accepted names. WhatamIdoing (talk) 15:14, 20 August 2022 (UTC)
I think both the &quot;most popular&quot; and &quot;pro and con&quot; approaches could work, I don't have a preference either way. 
About that second point, I think it would be most useful to specifically draw a line as to what is an objectionable vs non-objectionable difference. There is a continuum of offensive terms, correct me if I'm wrong, we have to draw a line somewhere for the purpose of alias terms (since intentionally alternating terms in-text would also be needlessly confusing.) Darcyisverycute (talk) 05:50, 26 August 2022 (UTC)
Alternating terms in an article isn't necessarily confusing at all.  Nobody is confused if you alternate home and house.  Nobody is confused if the Alzheimer's article sometimes says Alzheimer's and sometimes says dementia.
I assume that the line would be drawn on the basis of reliable sources, rather than editors' personal opinions:  &quot;normally avoid&quot; ____ if you have professional medical organizations and other high-quality sources advising against it; perhaps &quot;freely choose something else&quot; if you have a patient group or op-ed advising against it (and no similar sources in favor of it).  Or, to put it another way, you wouldn't really want to have a sentence in the article that says &quot;Many reputable medical organizations and patient groups object to the label _____&quot; and then use label throughout the article.
I agree that it's on a continuum.  Some situations are so clear that I can't imagine a real dispute (e.g., names that are primarily used as taunts by children), but others require some effort to understand.  For example, UK organizations are united in their opposition to the term spontaneous abortion, but some relevant US orgs don't express a preference either for or against that term.  In that case, I think we'd normally avoid the objected-to terminology.  For a different example, some LGBTQ+ organizations encourage gender-neutral terminology for what's traditionally been called women's health issues.  Medical bodies at the moment usually (a) advise using whatever terms the individual uses, when doing individual communication, (b) encourage researchers to report biological sex and psychosocial gender separately in journal articles, and (c) hope nobody will notice that they said nothing about how to handle mass communication, like what to write on general-audience websites or in newspaper articles.  I think in that case we might vary the terms within some range that seems reasonable for the specific article (e.g., lesbian women, LGBTQ+ people, avoiding needlessly gendered statements [&quot;her fetus&quot; vs &quot;the fetus&quot;]).
I'd like to call out another problem with trying to force specific rules about wording:  Some editors want to use the same term throughout the article (&quot;variation is potentially confusing&quot;).  Other editors want to use whichever term is used in the specific cited source (&quot;!&quot;).  The only way for both of these to happen is to exclude any source that doesn't use the terms we've chosen, and for some subjects, that will mean a violation of NPOV.  In practice, you won't be able to write about pregnant trans people if you need to find a MEDRS-quality source that calls them women. WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:05, 26 August 2022 (UTC)
Reconsidering what I wrote about &quot;intentionally alternating&quot;: You are right, it can be confusing but it is not always. And it's hard for editors to form agreement on what might be confusing or what might be necessary with prescriptive wording rules. Your examples show that it's inappropriate to either always follow or never follow the wording used specifically in the source. Your examples also show that it's impossible to have a universal and perfect balance in using in-article wording consistently versus representing sources accurately.
One particular example you mention:  -- I think this is the key of the issue. Deciding what is &quot;needlessly&quot; written seems to me, more or less, as equivalent to the idea of whether some particular wording is &quot;controversial&quot; (the similarity being that the process itself is rife with disagreement). 
Moving on, should we make a draft page for the questions? Or you're feeling ready to start a directed RfC with the question proposals we've discussed? What do you think? Darcyisverycute (talk) 02:10, 30 August 2022 (UTC)
I think the fact that we are still generating scenarios to consider demonstrates this is not ready for &quot;the wider community&quot;. There are different problems faced by different kinds of topic and the authors we are then citing. For an article on a medical subject, it may be straightforward to just avoid older sources using older terminology, though some terms are stubborn. And we need to distinguish between formally defined terminology and everyday language that the source just happens to be using. But if we are dealing with a biography, say, then the author of that is not a medical expert, may be immersed in antique sources and documents, and feel more comfortable repeating the language of that time.
Another example is apoplexy, which our article explains was used pretty much for any sudden spontaneous collapse into unconsciousness and death. A biographical article would likely have to use that term, possibly in quotes, and either explain it or rely on the wikilink. We couldn't substitute &quot;stroke&quot; or &quot;heart attack&quot;. But for terms that have an obvious modern translation, I don't see any reason to educate our readers in archaic terminology merely because it was contemporary with the event described. An exception of course might be if we needed to quote someone using that language or they are famous for having died of some archaic disease. But otherwise, I don't think history/bio writers would thank you for insisting on using Leningrad in any text covering that period, nor should we persist with archaic language for diseases in history just for the sake of being contemporary. I mean, we use modern grammar and spelling don't we, and while it might be fascinating to learn older forms of those, that's not really the point of most articles. Wrt censorship, the only place on Wikipedia where mongolism belongs is in Down syndrome. Darcyisverycute, please be very careful with the word &quot;censor&quot; because it does cause some people to disengage their brains and reach for  (without having read it nor the linked ). There is a difference between censorship and editorial choice, between being required and compelled to fall in line with some external restriction, and choosing willingly to so because we are grown ups. -- Colin°Talk 09:33, 15 August 2022 (UTC)
I think my difficulty is in deciding which of the many questions to ask first, rather than how to ask the selected question.
Thinking about Talpedia's preference for starting at the narrow end, we could consider an update to MEDLANG, which says:
* The term drug abuse is vague and carries negative connotations. In a medical context, it generally refers to recreational use that carries serious risk of physical harm or addiction. However, others use it to refer to any illegal drug use. The best accepted term for non-medical use is &quot;recreational use&quot;.
&quot;Alcohol abuse&quot; is also vague; &quot;alcohol abuse&quot; also carries negative connotations.  In a medical context, the best accepted term is &quot;alcohol use disorder&quot;.  But others could use it to describe socially unacceptable behavior (e.g., a single drunken incident), drinking more than the average person, or high-risk drinking (e.g., any alcohol consumed by an under-aged person, during pregnancy, before driving, etc.). 
Should we discuss a new sentence to be added to this part of MEDMOS? WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:01, 15 August 2022 (UTC)
Is &quot;negative connotations&quot; the right word? I mean, nobody thinks this is a good thing. [https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/addiction-science/words-matter-preferred-language-talking-about-addiction Those advocating word change] suggest &quot;abuse&quot; is negatively judgemental about the person and their motivates and life choices, leading to feelings that they are to blame and warrant punishment. Even more so is language where the whole person is reduced to a single negative word (an abuser, an alcoholic, a junkie, addict or user). Instead it is neutral to simply state they have an &quot;alcohol use disorder&quot;. This seems similar to when we choose to say someone has a medical condition rather than say they suffer from it, and when we say someone has epilepsy rather than labelling them an epileptic. -- Colin°Talk 07:26, 16 August 2022 (UTC)
No we shouldn't. We should use that word that the sources use. FMSky (talk) 17:33, 19 August 2022 (UTC)
@FMSky, what do you mean by &quot;the sources&quot;?  For example, do you mean all the reliable sources in the world, or only the one that happens to be cited in a particular paragraph? WhatamIdoing (talk) 19:46, 19 August 2022 (UTC)
only those in the article obviously, and if you wanted to change the wording you'd also have to switch the sources to support those changes --FMSky (talk) 20:01, 19 August 2022 (UTC)
What if &quot;those in the article&quot; use a variety of terms?   WhatamIdoing (talk) 20:52, 19 August 2022 (UTC)
Then use the term that sources use the most often --FMSky (talk) 00:46, 20 August 2022 (UTC)
So if the subject's name changes (e.g., Facebook Inc. becomes Meta Inc.), you think editors should first change 50% of the sources in the article, so that the new name is now &quot;the term that sources use the most often&quot;, and after that, they are allowed to use the current name?
I don't think that's the actual practice on wiki.  I'm not sure that it's a good idea, either.  Especially in a shorter article, it would be too easy to cherry-pick sources that &quot;just happen&quot; to use a term that I prefer.  You could find that someone updates the cited sources until most of them &quot;just accidentally happen&quot; to use the Russian-based spelling for a Ukrainian city, &quot;just accidentally happen&quot; to use the same word people holding a certain opinion about abortion, &quot;just accidentally happen&quot; to use the wording terminology preferred by one side of a psychiatric concept and never the terminology preferred by the other side...  and the next thing you know, someone is saying &quot;Oh, we can't use the COMMONNAME anywhere in this article, because a majority of the cited sources in this article use this other name.&quot; WhatamIdoing (talk) 04:26, 20 August 2022 (UTC)
There has never been any restriction on Wiki that we are compelled to use the wording in our sources. FMSky, think for example if you were editing the French Wikipedia and most of your sources were in English. Our sources are a good indicator of language and terminology but very often they do use language that we don't want to on Wikipedia. For example, they may refer to people with a disease as &quot;patients&quot; or people in a study as a &quot;cohort&quot;, because their audience is other doctors and researchers. Whereas we are for a general audience and so people with a disease are &quot;people&quot; (unless we are writing about someone currently in intensive care for example). Medical sources often use jargon for body parts and therapies which we may want to simplify (particularly in the lead). 
*Open up Paracetamol in your browser and do a text search for &quot;acetaminophen&quot;. You'll notice our article uses &quot;paracetamol&quot; throughout and pretty much the only place acetaminophen appears is .... in the sources.
*Or how about Dracunculiasis, which is also known as Guinea-worm disease. The first source is [https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/guineaworm/gwep.html CDC], which is written for a general audience. The CDC describe it as &quot;Guinea worm disease&quot; and rarely say dracunculiasis. Indeed &quot;dracunculiasis&quot; is mentioned by all their sources and they just briefly note it is &quot;(also known as dracunculiasis)&quot;. But throughout that CDC article, they abbreviate the disease to &quot;GWD&quot;, and use that consistently. Are you suggesting that if we ever cite CDC in the article then we must say &quot;GWD&quot;? Or perhaps it is better if the article is consistent and editors use their own editorial judgement to decide which term is best for our readers. I don't know the history of why that article went with the formal name rather than the common name, but that's what they as editors chose and surely it is best they are consistent throughout the article.
*Or consider Monkey pox. There is talk of that disease being renamed[https://www.statnews.com/2022/08/01/the-campaign-to-rename-monkeypox-gets-complicated/] because it is misleading. They've already renamed the variants, which used to be called &quot;West African clade&quot; and &quot;Congo Basin&quot;, and are now just referred to as clade I and II. The virus authorities are realising that naming diseases after regions and countries is stigmatising (syphilis was initially called The French disease by the British). The disease only got that name because it was first spotted in some research monkeys in a Danish lab, but monkeys aren't the natural reservoir. I guess the Danes should be glad we didn't call it the Danish pox. So at some point in the future, our monkey pox article is likely to be renamed, and will consistently use the new name, relegating the old name to a brief mention. And I can be sure that at that point, nearly all our sources will likely still use the old name.
This idea that we are compelled to use the language of sources comes up from time to time when we have naming disputes, but it is very much one of those things that obey the old rule: For every problem, there is a solution that is simple, attractive ... and wrong. -- Colin°Talk 08:53, 21 August 2022 (UTC)
