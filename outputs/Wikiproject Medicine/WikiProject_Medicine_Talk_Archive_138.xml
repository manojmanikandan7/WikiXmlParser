Access to the British National Formulary (BNF) ?

Can someone with access to the British National Formulary (BNF) verify this change in Insulin glargine.

https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Insulin_glargine&amp;diff=965686745&amp;oldid=958351370

Thanks.  () 04:25, 3 July 2020 (UTC)

I believe that  has access to that source, and  knows the general subject.  () 06:45, 3 July 2020 (UTC)

, I can read [https://bnf.nice.org.uk/drug/insulin-glargine.html the current BNF online]. This page mostly has general repeated stuff about all insulins. There are two specific boxes about Insulin glargine:

*Prescribing and dispensing information
Insulin glargine is a biological medicine. Biological medicines must be prescribed and dispensed by brand name, see Biological medicines and Biosimilar medicines, under [https://bnf.nice.org.uk/guidance/guidance-on-prescribing.html Guidance on prescribing]. Dose adjustments and close metabolic monitoring is recommended if switching between insulin glargine preparations. [Btw, the linked page contains too much text for me to copy/paste here, but I can email it if required, and it explains the reason why the prescription should be for one brand].
*National funding/access decisions
**Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) Decisions
The Scottish Medicines Consortium has advised that Lantus® preparations (April 2013) and Toujeo® (August 2015) are accepted for restricted use within NHS Scotland for the treatment of type 1 diabetes:
in those who are at risk of or experience unacceptable frequency or severity of nocturnal hypoglycaemia on attempting to achieve better hypoglycaemic control during treatment with other insulins
as a once daily insulin therapy for patients who require a carer to administer their insulin
It is not recommended for routine use in patients with type 2 diabetes unless they suffer from recurrent episodes of hypoglycaemia or require assistance with their insulin injections.

Therefore it appears that it is true in NHS Scotland that this insulin is not the routine form recommended for patients. England and Wales have their own body (NICE) and there's nothing here from them (which I'd expect there to be, the BNF-online being hosted by NICE!) It should be possible to find the Scottish guidelines at their own website, which is more globally accessible than the BNF. I can look later but don't have time right now. The NICE guidelines are also accessible internationally. 

Btw, if you want to access the BNF, you can use a free VPN. I had a similar problem trying to access GoodRX.com, which blocks access outside of the US. I installed Windscribe into Chrome (I normally use Firefox) and set it up for me to appear to be in the USA. I reckon you could do the same and pop up in London. You can always disable that extension when you don't need it. -- ° 07:37, 3 July 2020 (UTC)

, I misread the statement in the article vs the BNF page and this because I'm ignorant about insulin. The Insulin glargine article currency says &quot;It is typically the recommended long acting insulin in the United Kingdom&quot; (previous said &quot;not&quot;) but I didn't spot the &quot;long acting&quot; qualifier. So it appears we are comparing insulin glargine with insulin detemir and ultralong acting insulin degludec (are there others?), and not specifically making a point about whether a long-acting insulin should be used. Here are the NICE guidelines:
*[https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng17/chapter/1-Recommendations Type 1 diabetes in adults: diagnosis and management] (Puts detemir as first choice over glargine)
*[https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng28/chapter/1-Recommendations#blood-glucose-management-2 Type 2 diabetes in adults: management]  (Puts glargine and detemir equally)
*[https://www.nice.org.uk/advice/esnm24/chapter/Key-points-from-the-evidence Type 1 diabetes: insulin degludec] (Does not offer any specific guidance about degludec vs others)

The [https://bnf.nice.org.uk/drug/insulin-detemir.html BNF for Insulin detemir] does not contain any &quot;National funding/access decisions&quot; comments. The [https://bnf.nice.org.uk/drug/insulin-degludec.html BNF for Insulin degludec] contains a funding decision comment for Wales, which you can [http://www.awmsg.org/awmsgonline/app/appraisalinfo/3158 read here] (restricted access for adults, not recommended for children).

Corresponding to the NICE guidelines for type 1 and 2, there are general guidance pages in the BNF: [https://bnf.nice.org.uk/treatment-summary/type-1-diabetes.html Type 1] and [https://bnf.nice.org.uk/treatment-summary/type-2-diabetes.html Type 2]. These follow the same pattern as the NICE guidelines (naturally) which prefer detemir as first choice over glargine for type 1, but hold both equal for type 2.

So it appears the statement in Insulin glargine is inadequate regardless of whether we have &quot;not&quot; in it: it is more complicated and really should be summarised by someone with the first clue about insulin and diabetes (i.e. not me). -- ° 17:14, 3 July 2020 (UTC)

 I'm happy to take a look at it and try to improve the wording, but unfortunately I cannot access the BNF pages - I definitely have a clue about insulin/diabetes though. If you could shoot me an email with the pages/articles I'd be happy to use them and improve the verbiage to be accurate. bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez (/) 23:46, 4 July 2020 (UTC)

Overanxiousness

I found Overanxiousness at NPP and am not sure what to do with it. Apparently &quot;overanxious disorder&quot; was a diagnosis in the DSM III that was later merged into general anxiety disorder, but the article conflates overanxious disorder with general anxiety disorder and the emotion of anxiety. It is poorly written and some of the sources are passing mentions, e.g. [https://books.google.ca/books?id=-brdBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT11#v=snippet&amp;q=overanxiousness&amp;f=false]. I have half a mind to just redirect it to anxiety, but thought I would check in here first to see if there's anything worth salvaging, since psychology isn't an area I know much about.  () 18:23, 4 July 2020 (UTC)
 Overanxious disorder was eliminated in the 1994 DSM-IV, but it does still get passing mention in literature. And it was once a valid diagnosis.  What is there now is a wreck that can be reliably knocked down to one real paragraph, explaining what it was and what it became. But ... I don’t know if the term “overanxious” warrants an article.  We don’t have obsessive, but we do have fixation (psychology).  Is overanxious a trait or behavior worthy of it’s own article?  Separate from the former disorder?  If so, it could be named something like overanxious (trait). Then what to do about the former disorder.  I see three options, after coming up with the one-paragraph summary:
# Create overanxious disorder (With or without overanxious trait?)
# Add summary to History section of generalized anxiety disorder and redirect there.
# Start a History section at anxiety disorder, add there and redirect.
 I am unsure which I prefer.  My concern is that Asperger syndrome is no longer a DSM diagnosis, but we don’t merge it away.  Let’s see what  and  think. Hinges on whether there is a notable behavioral trait, independent from the former disorder. Sorry, iPad typing, formatting issues. [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] ()  12:57, 5 July 2020 (UTC)
It should be redirected to GAD as it is clearly the predecessor. We just need some scholarly discussion discussing same to reference. And there should be mention of it in the history of GAD  ( · ) 13:24, 5 July 2020 (UTC)
 I found a few articles that can be used, but I just put a priority to-do list on my talk page because I am so far behind :(  We only need a brief para to add to GAD history, and there are reviews from the transition from DSM-III to IV. [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] ()  13:35, 5 July 2020 (UTC)
 Just looked at it, and it's not conceptually coherent. It blends overanxious disorder (the DSM and ICD predecessor to GAD) and overanxiousness as a dimension or subjective experience. There is no need for a page about the dimension, as that is already covered by the anxiety page on the series on Emotions. If the page were clearly about the DSM disorder, then the redirect to the GAD page and history section would be the clear winner. Is it possible to do a disambiguation and have two redirects, &quot;overanxiousness&quot; --&gt; anxiety page, &quot;overanxious disorder&quot; --&gt; GAD page?  () 20:08, 5 July 2020 (UTC)

 PS, kudos on Spicy for continuing at New Page Patrol, which is killer hard work.  Same user created nondepressive disorder (???) which warrants a look?? Is that a thing? [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] ()  13:47, 5 July 2020 (UTC)

 Agree, nondepressive disorder is not a consistent construct or definition, and definitely not in the DSM or ICD.  what I wrote on the talk page, too.  () 20:15, 5 July 2020 (UTC)
 I am determined to catch up with other (FAC) work today!  I can't remember how to support (endorse) a prod ... could someone teach Eyoungstrom?  Spicy, if you want to redirect to GAD, I can later add a section to History describing what happened to Overanxious disorder.  IF someone reminds me :0 It just doesn't seem we need two pages (one about the dimension)-- just a redirect to GAD.  [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] ()  20:51, 5 July 2020 (UTC)
I see you've created the OAD redirect already, looks good. I like Youngstrom's suggestion of redirecting overanxiousness to anxiety instead - [https://www.google.ca/search?source=hp&amp;ei=ok0CX8PII8W0tQbqsrAQ&amp;q=overanxiousness&amp;oq=overanxiousness&amp;gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIGCAAQChAeMgYIABAKEB46BQgAELEDOgUIABCDAToCCC46BQguELEDOgUILhCDAToCCAA6BAgAEAo6BAguEAo6BAgAEA1Q-gFYkhtg-htoAnAAeACAAbABiAGkDJIBBDEzLjSYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjDofiojrfqAhVFWs0KHWoZDAIQ4dUDCAg&amp;uact=5 search results] show it's used as a colloquial term for excessive anxiety, not as a synonym for overanxious disorder.

 Found it!   if you just endorse the prod by adding the  to the page, under my prod, it will go away in seven days.  If someone removes the prod tag, then we have to go to .  This is a good thing to learn, and admins feel better about prodding an article when more eyes have seen it (and endorsed).  I have it watchlisted in case you have problems with the syntax.  [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] ()  20:53, 5 July 2020 (UTC)
 I've made a note about notability requiring secondary sources at , and it's now on my watchlist. I'll repeat my comment at AfD if needed. -- () 22:21, 5 July 2020 (UTC)

 You all are faster than me! The page already has the redirect in place, and looks like it may already have been Prodded (I don't see the exact entry for that in the history). I was primed to drop the  after where  put it, but also not evident where it would go in the current versions. I have a bunch of meetings stacked up today and tomorrow; likely to be a bit more agile on Wednesday. I will continue following things and trying to learn next steps. (Feels a bit like playing volleyball and watching the more experienced teammates do the setting and spiking while I try to figure out jumping in. Funny, but apt, metaphor, since I am short, too!). LMK if anything else helpful from me here.   () 19:16, 6 July 2020 (UTC)

  We are converting you to a full Wikipedian as well as instructor :)  Hooray! I may have confused you by mixing the two articles here:  overanxiousness and nondepressive disorder.  Prods have to last seven days, so nondepressive disorder is there still. Anyone can challenge (remove a prod), in which case the alternative is to propose it for deletion, since It Is Not A Thing.  But overanxiousness is sorta/kinda a thing, misnamed, so it was redirected.  If someone were to challenge that, we'd have to start a merge discussion.  You are learning ... it is this sort of work that keeps us busy!  Keep on ... [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] ()  13:35, 7 July 2020 (UTC)

 Thanks, you are right -- I was confusing the discussion of the two pages. I went back to  nondepressive disorder and figured out how to add my endorsement. :-) Let me know what the equivalent to the |nom is for that template. I used that and it didn't throw an error. My intuition is that it is a way of tagging which account made the endorsement without using the ~~~~ signature. Thanks again for the coaching and opportunities - I am learning several things every day, and I am looking forward to really digesting the VMI talk page later this week.  () 00:17, 8 July 2020 (UTC)

 I have never used the prod endorsed template, and the documentation is poor.  It seems like it should be signed.  ??? [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] ()  02:27, 8 July 2020 (UTC)
  it's just a &quot;me too&quot; for the PROD, and you can just add  if you simply want to agree with the reason given in the original PROD. Optionally, you can add a comment as Eric did (&quot;See talk page&quot;) which shows up in addition. There's no way to sign it that will show up, but it's obvious from the page history who added the endorsement if anybody needs to check. Hope that helps. -- () 02:47, 8 July 2020 (UTC)

 Thanks-- that is simple and easy. Glad that I wasn't missing something. Happy Wednesday to you both! () 11:20, 8 July 2020 (UTC)

Government statistics and MEDRS

Hello all,

I am working on introducing MEDRS on Chinese Wikipedia and a user there has a question regarding MEDRS. The  Ministry of Health and Welfare routinely publishes statistics on causes of death. Although those are epidemiology data, they do not form a hypothesis per se. Is this type of statistics a primary source under MEDRS or a primary source in general? - () 17:58, 1 July 2020 (UTC)

Hello .  A plain statistical report, or a database full of numbers, is a primary source.  A report that talks about the statistics for example, &quot;Cancer deaths have gone up this year&quot; or &quot;The top 10 causes of death are...&quot; is probably a secondary source.
A primary source can be a good source.  We sometimes joke that &quot;secondary source&quot; is not a fancy way to spell the word &quot;good source&quot;.  It's okay to use a small number of primary sources.  You do have to be careful with them, to stop people turning &quot;Killed cancer cells in a lab&quot; into &quot;Cures all cancer in humans&quot;, but the risk for that is low with the MOHW database.  If you all agree that this source is appropriate for the material, then perhaps your version of MEDRS will say something like &quot;Primary sources should normally be avoided.  Some primary sources can be used appropriately.  For example, MOHW's statistics database on causes of death, although technically a primary source, can be used to make a simple, straightforward statement about how many people died from a disease in a given year.&quot;    () 23:48, 1 July 2020 (UTC)

Hello Calliopejen1, seems to me that it would be better placed on the Mastectomy page.-- () 11:39, 3 July 2020 (UTC)
 I agree with Iztwoz.  Notable doesn't necessarily mean we must have an article, if the topic fits better within another article.  An article of that type could become a commercial-interest magnet. [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] ()  14:30, 3 July 2020 (UTC)
I'm not sure about that.  There are so many kinds of mastectomies, with different indications and outcomes, that if we &quot;only&quot; wrote 500 words about each, we'd have a very unwieldy article.  I could probably source 500 words on &quot;going flat&quot; and not get past the history (reconstruction wasn't available until recent times) and social considerations (it's the first choice for a segment of LGBT breast cancer patients).

Oral and maxillofacial surgery

Can people lay eyes on this article.  It wasn't great to start but an IP editor has come in since March 27 and made very heavy, US-centric, off med-mos changes.  My plan was to let the dust settle a bit then clean it up again but the changes are constant for the last 2 months.   and  did some reverts and left notes on their talk page but no response.

Is there anything that the IP added that's worth preserving? -- () 02:55, 8 June 2020 (UTC)
i'm not really sure tbh. Someone is obviously putting a lot of work into the changes (and is persistent about it) so I'm reluctant to do a mass roll-back.  That's why I was hoping to have another set of eyes.  The changes appear to have a political flavour to them (around licencing bodies for the profession) and all the 'history' relates to US stuff.

No.  I'll wait it out a bit then improve.   () 20:17, 15 June 2020 (UTC)
It seems like the wait is gonna be a long one. Tbh I am of the opinion that the editing behavior can be considered disruptive, especially when you take a look at the talk page. I would not be opposed to someone sending the IP to . [[User:Bait30| Bait30 ]] [[User Talk:Bait30|Talk 2 me pls?]] 04:01, 20 June 2020 (UTC)
That would be inappropriate.  The first &quot;vandalism&quot; warning is about the IP removing hatnote templates and the image from the infobox.  New editors frequently don't understand what they're doing when they remove all that &quot;unnecessary&quot; stuff.  If you'd block someone over that, then you'd have blocked me years ago, for thinking that navboxes and categories with the same name must be redundant.
The other identified &quot;vandalism&quot; edit is because the IP knows that it's called &quot;free flap microsurgery reconstruction&quot; instead of &quot;microsurgery reconstruction with free flap&quot;, and  apparently prefers the older name.  
None of that is vandalism.  Please read the very first sentence of :  &quot;On Wikipedia, vandalism has a very specific meaning: editing (or other behavior) deliberately intended to obstruct or defeat the , which is to create a free encyclopedia&quot;.  The word deliberately is bolded and italicized in the original.  () 20:50, 20 June 2020 (UTC)
 I guess  is the wrong venue. But other than that, I specifically mentioned disruptive editing, which is different from vandalism. [[User:Bait30| Bait30 ]] [[User Talk:Bait30|Talk 2 me pls?]] 00:01, 21 June 2020 (UTC)

If it were actually disruptive, then I'd expect someone to have started a discussion on the article's talk page about something specific that (a) needed to be changed and (b) was more serious than the refs not being perfectly formattted on the first try.  () 04:53, 21 June 2020 (UTC)

Navigation of articles on pharmaceuticals

Hello, please see  for a list of navbox templates you can add to articles based on their ATC classification.

For the record, I twisted &quot;significant&quot; and &quot;contribution&quot; into an adverbed adjective simply because it was easier to fit into the previous revision's setup.

 And I won't even go to that article, because of the combination of legal and medical issues, in which we haven't even heard from the defense.  My personal view (irrelevant) is that Floyd was murdered in a city long known for rampant racism in the police force, but until there has been a trial and we hear from the defense, Wikipedia has already gone too far in this article.  We should be not judge and jury. We don't know if Floyd's other conditions matter until a judge rules on that, but that most likely will not be admitted as evidence.

Alpha-gal allergy article



Any thoughts on [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alpha-gal_allergy&amp;oldid=prev&amp;diff=965730637 this] edit by  to the article?  () 02:54, 4 July 2020 (UTC)

The cited source (a rather middling journal) recommends that &quot;Patients over the age of 5 years with an apparent new onset milk allergy should be investigated for the alpha-gal allergy&quot;, so there's probably some clinical relevance to the fact that alpha-gal is present in milk.  The cited source doesn't mention gelatin directly, but the first source cited in the paper is PMID 22480538, which does mention gelatin, so it's probably true, and it is verifiable, even though the inclusion of gelatin in that sentence is not directly supported by the cited source.  () 03:10, 4 July 2020 (UTC)

This is a dubious &quot;allergy&quot; [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6494999/ allegedly first reported in 2009], the article claims it is the first allergy with a delayed reaction, and with no diagnostic code except &quot;unspecified allergy&quot;. The ICD-11 ignores it.  PMID 22480538 is primary research which doesn't even connect me at allergy with Lyme infection. It may be better in alternative views or possibly Pseudoscience, if it's worth keeping that is. It may be sensitization rather than allergy. Gelatin is not present in dairy and  the sourcing is poor and mostly primary sources. MEDRS states secondary sources are needed.  (they/them pronouns)  21:31, 5 July 2020 (UTC)

[[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] ()  18:18, 6 July 2020 (UTC)

I don't think that any of those are the right choices.  First of all, redirecting away the whole page assumes that one editor's negative opinion of a 2009 primary source means that the whole thing is &quot;dubious&quot;.  Looking at sources that have a chance of passing MEDRS, such as these textbooks:
* 
* 
* 
* 

I think there's a more than fair chance that (a) this allergy exists, (b) it's mainstream, conventional medicine, and (c) the sensitization process probably does involve a tick bite.
Separately, Meat allergy redirects there, and I don't think that's appropriate.  Meat allergies could be expected to include the category of Poultry meat allergy, which is unrelated, and presumably there are other ways to become allergic to beef, pork, etc.  () 16:39, 7 July 2020 (UTC)

Idiopathic hypoglycemia 

I'm going through a list of &gt;1800 articles that contain , but  ,[https://petscan.wmflabs.org/?psid=16645246] and came across idiopathic hypoglycemia. I can't see why it would be a separate article to hypoglycemia other than perhaps the unreffed claim that it can be a synonym for reactive hypoglycemia. It's supported by a single reference from 1957. Could someone take a look, please?  () 17:38, 5 July 2020 (UTC)

COVID-19

COVID-19 information seems to get added to articles before it meets  standards. A recent example is Nitric_oxide#Covid-19. What is the consensus about the dissemination of ongoing COVID-19 research and speculation in articles? Should that kind of content be reserved for the COVID-19 drug repurposing research article instead? Thoughts?  () 20:26, 5 July 2020 (UTC)

 The problem is a lack of experienced editors prepared to struggle with numerous enthusiastic editors who think that we have to keep up with every piece of breaking news or speculative research connected to COVID-19. If you want to make a stand for MEDRS, you should simply remove any biomedical claims supported by primary sources. If you're sick of the unpleasantness thrown at you when trying to uphold the standards, you can simply side-track the offending content into a &quot;Research&quot; section as I've just done at Nitric oxide. -- () 22:33, 5 July 2020 (UTC)

I also think RexxS's approach is a sound one.  Enthusiasm should be supported (to a reasonable point), but the tentative nature of recent results should be made clear.  Also, as a purely practical matter, if it's mentioned somewhere on the page – even if it's as bland as &quot;X is being researched&quot;, then inexperienced editors will quit trying to force it onlt the page.  That's also one situation (i.e., when we say little about exciting news) in which readers will actually read the sources, so feel free to add several sources that will suit a variety of readers.

Contradiction?

Perhaps some clarification is needed here. In Magnesium sulfate (medical use) we say &quot;Common side effects include low blood pressure, skin flushing, and low blood calcium.&quot; Low blood calcium redirects to Hypocalcaemia which says &quot;Initial treatment for severe disease is with intravenous calcium chloride and possibly magnesium sulfate. Other treatments may include vitamin D, magnesium, and calcium supplements.&quot; Is the difference between long term and short term effects?  () 19:01, 7 July 2020 (UTC)

Or maybe it depends upon the cause?  UpToDate [https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypomagnesemia-causes-of-hypomagnesemia says] &quot;Hypomagnesemia is often associated with hypokalemia (due to urinary potassium wasting) and hypocalcemia (due both to lower parathyroid hormone secretion and end-organ resistance to its effect).&quot;  I believe these mineral levels can interact, or that something that throws one off might throw another off, with the end result that you test all three and treat as many problems as you find.

 I am not in favor of a piecemeal approach to repairing MEDMOS, which has gone out of whack over the last five years.  it needs a top-to-bottom rewrite, with rationalization of how it relates to broader guidelines. It was written originally to interpret broader guidelines as they applied to medicine, but has gotten away from that. [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] ()  19:49, 7 July 2020 (UTC)
The proposals weren't made because of the viewpoint that MEDMOS is in need of repair. I don't know what you mean about &quot;how it relates to broader guidelines&quot; and it now being out of whack. Maybe &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; links would help me see where you are coming from.  () 21:39, 7 July 2020 (UTC)
I agree that it's due for a re-write, but I think the first proposal is minor and can proceed, and the second may be possible. 
The &quot;out of whack&quot; situation happens both because of changes to MEDMOS that might not ultimately be desirable (e.g., someone removed the recommendation not to write whole articles at a reading level suitable for average 12 year olds; someone else removed the recommendation to consider
Management
instead of
Treatment
for chronic conditions) and because of changes to the other MOS pages that haven't been reflected in MEDMOS.  There are other subjects that may be relevant for editors that aren't covered.  For example, I recently reverted a well-intentioned effort to re-write a women's health article to use gender-neutral language, because 80% of 'women' isn't the same as 80% of 'individuals', nor is it even the same as 80% of 'people who menstruate'.  How Wikipedia should handle sex/gender in sex-specific medical conditions is not mentioned in MEDMOS; maybe it should be.
All that said, I don't see any serious likelihood of that re-write happening soon.  I wouldn't want to stop all proposals in the meantime.   () 05:53, 8 July 2020 (UTC)

I refer here just to the codes that are contained within the names of navigation boxes (navboxes). I also agree with what you mention here, which is that if there is an article that is the primary article, these codes should be moved to the medical resources box. Not all navboxes have this primary article however, and the codes sometimes relate to things in the navbox not found in the articles. Perhaps we could start another topic in the next few months about moving things from the infoboxes to the medical resource boxes in bulk fashion. -- () 07:05, 2 July 2020 (UTC)
I'm inclined to remove those codes from the navbox title bar.  It might be helpful to preserve them somewhere (in small type inside the navbox?  in the template's /doc page?).  () 16:02, 3 July 2020 (UTC)

Standardised oncology template names

Hi all, I've been having a look at some of our oncology templates ([[:Category:Oncology templates]]) and, although it's a minor issue, I was wondering what editors thought about a standardised name for most of our oncology templates. Currently we have tumor, neoplasia, malignancy and cancer used in a variety of templates. On the other hand, there might be unique reasons for each particular template. I'd like to ask what editors here think about a preferred standradised title? (another option would be Discuss each individually). Looking forward to hearing the opinion of other editors, -- () 03:21, 16 July 2020 (UTC)
* My preferred option would be tumor,  because it doesn't have the negative connotations associated with malignancy / cancer; and neoplasia is not readily understood). -- () 03:21, 16 July 2020 (UTC)
Template consistency and plain language doesn't seem particularly critical, given that the template names aren't reader-facing. Tumor doesn't work generally, as not all cancers form tumors, or if they do form tumors there are also many cells not in them; leukemias, for example. Also,  argues against the obfuscation of hiding cancer behind tumor. In other cases, neoplasia is more accurate. So, I'd leave the templates as they are and change on a case-by-case basis where there is a clear justification.  () 10:23, 16 July 2020 (UTC)
Some benign tumors are deadly, and some malignant cancers are so slow-growing that you'll die of old age before they become problems.  I don't think I'd use &quot;cancer&quot; on a navbox that contains benign tumors.  I might use it on all the others.  
I think that most readers won't grasp the distinction between cancers being carcinomas and the non-carcinomas not being cancers.  I think that distinction is only common for leukemias these days, and even there, writing &quot;blood cancer&quot; is not unusual in lay publications.  () 19:12, 17 July 2020 (UTC)

MEDRS problems

Menstrual psychosis is a disputed, controversial diagnosis that has been described in case reports off and on for over a hundred years.  It's not clear that it's &quot;a disease&quot; (i.e., a single clinical and etiological condition, as opposed to menstrual exacerbation of bipolar disorder, or any number of other ideas).  An inexperienced editor has been trying to expand this article, but the sources aren't there, and what sources exist have been used expansively (e.g., a single case report involving one woman with amenorrhea gets turned into a statement that implies amenorrhea is common).

To be clear:  This isn't pseudoscience.  This isn't altmed.  This is the routine case of conventional, mainstream medical science not yet having settled on an explanation for an uncommon situation.  Nosology takes time.

What would be most helpful at this point is:
*  to have a couple of people who keep up with their watchlists to put this on your lists.  The editor who wants to include all this information needs someone who will reply every time he posts something on the talk page.
*  to have a couple of editors steadily remove or fix the sourcing on any  (outside the
History
section) that is currently sourced to the 20th century.  Even with a very generous interpretation of MEDRS, I don't think we can justify sources older than the year 2000 for non-historical medical content.   just tagged a bunch of uncited statements, and some of those may turn out to be verifiable.  I don't believe that there is a single &quot;good&quot; version that could be reverted to.

Redirect?
I see  did some repair there, and Brockington has responded;[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AMenstrual_psychosis&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=968253906&amp;oldid=966702119] noting that the only review used (Reilly) is only very briefing citing ... Brockington ... for the number of proposed cases, I have proposed a merge and redirect from menstrual psychosis to Ian Brockington.  [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] ()  16:21, 18 July 2020 (UTC)
I think a merger is the best option. I've had this article on my watchlist of over 5 years and there hasn't been any significant development of the literature beyond Brockington's own work. The sources cited in the article are synthesis of very very old case studies and a review article written by Brockington and his book. I've come to the conclusion that the current article is not reflecting a well established medical syndrome or condition but Brockington attempt to draw attention to his own views that there is something called &quot;menstrual psychosis&quot;. Until Brockington's view gains more recognition in the field there should not be a stand alone article. Sydney Poore/ 01:57, 19 July 2020 (UTC)
 Five years ... ugh.  That is dismal, and brings me to another point I have been wanting to raise here.  Retention of content experts.  It is very Very VERY difficult for researchers to grok Wikipedia's policies and guidelines, but some show more promise than others.  I don't see a lot of promise here; Brockington's only interest seems to be in promoting his concept.  Alternately, I have been working with both  and  (psychology and gynecology) and they have both demonstrated an eager intent to learn, collaborate and participate.  We need to feed their interest, not let them become too dejected at so much to learn, rather than wasting time on menstrual psychosis.  Unless we have opposition from anyone, we should redirect menstrual psychosis to Ian Brockington in about a week ??  And give lots of encouragement to Eyoungstrom and Memdmarti-- these are editors who could make valued contributions, are eager to learn, and they're probably both tired already of dealing with all my typos and verbosity, so give them a hand if you can. [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] ()  03:18, 19 July 2020 (UTC)
Thank you, ! Your “typos and verbosity” parallel mine so they are easy to accept. 
Thank you for reminding me of the wonderful concept of grok. 
As you have read Heinlein, let me be the semi-retired Jubal Harshaw trying to understand Valentine Michael Smith. My, and likely many or most scientific writers’, difficulties are more than the basic understanding of Wikipedia; they involve grokking grok (it is difficult, if possible for earth-born humans, to fully understand fair witnesses and sharing water), grokking the Wikipedia culture, and grokking the scientific publication culture simultaneously. The Wikipedia and scientific cultures are so different that it unlikely an individual can grok each culture separately and even less likely simultaneously. That said, I will keep trying, as least as separate cultures. 
Thank you, SandyGeorgia!  ()
Addendum: , your suggestion elsewhere that I edit nonmedical Wikipedia pages to learn editing is excellent. I will only watch the endometriosis page for egregious changes and use the&quot;request edit&quot; template on those. If you have COI for Kistner, I have COI for endometriosis as a provider with 49 or so years of studying it beginning in academic year 1970-71 while Kistner was still in his prime.

# I would need to go back and read the literature. That looks to be an explanation of a subset of stress-related psychoses. Hormonal stress is as bad as personal, environmental, dietary, etc. stresses. I would have thought that it would be at Stress-related disorders, but it is not. I am behind on editing two papers that I need to submit and will come back to menstrual psychosis and Stress-related disorders toward the end of next week.
# Question: I do not know if this is for you someone else. If not for you, please direct it to someone. Are medical providers whose income is or was influenced by a disease such as endometriosis considered to have COI? As an example, a friend of mine is preparing to submit a manuscript on the conflicts that IVF providers have between 1) doing comprehensive evaluation and treatment before IVF rather than 2) proceeding directly to IVF. The second is the most lucrative and there is evidence that it is commonly used. My 51 of the 52 PubMed citations at https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=martin+d+endometriosis&amp;sort=date reflect my focus and thus COI. Does Wikipedia agree with the last sentence that says I have COI for endometriosis? As a matter that parallels your international experience, the three most recent papers on PubMed come from seven countries on three continents. Thank you, Dan  ()

 Thank you, ! As you possibly could conclude from reading the 313 concepts with more than 400 references including 18 publishing in 2020 in https://www.danmartinmd.com/files/endotheory.pdf, you might reasonably conclude that I have no commitment to The Truth™. I have even referenced theories that I think are mostly bogus (bogus theories can include some reasonable concepts) but cannot disprove. Theories are just theories. Although some have evidence, many do not, some are dangerous (Tomato effect and Medical reversal), and they would not be theories if there was proof.

Kistner
Robert Kistner was my endo surgeon (COI); at the time, my overseas physicians sent me to him because he was number one in the field. (And they were personal friends, so Kistner agreed to schedule my surgery without having met me, as I was on assignment in Colombia and had a busy work schedule-- he took the word of my Venezuelan ob/gyn that I was Stage IV.)  I cleaned up his article, and added inline citations.  There was very little new that I could add (just his fellowship and memberships).  I did encounter a COI problem, so am asking for other opinions.  As his patient, one knew he was smitten with his TV personality former model wife.  He committed suicide.  One source (marginal- Boston Herald- which I can't access) claims she had filed for divorce.  Original research had him committing suicide shortly after that.  But Boston Globe has her as his wife, and Associated Press had them &quot;estranged&quot;.  So I removed the original research connecting his marriage to his suicide, as the sources conflict.  No sources available online-- all through my local library access.

Finding promising new editors

I've been experimenting with ways to identify promising new editors, and I've got an idea to pass along to anyone who's interested in trying it out, too.  This uses the &quot;new&quot; (2017) filters on RecentChanges, which some old hands may have turned off.  But if you've got it on, then try this link:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked?userExpLevel=learner&amp;hidebots=1&amp;hidenewpages=1&amp;hidecategorization=1&amp;hideWikibase=1&amp;hidelog=1&amp;target=Wikipedia%3AWikiProject_Medicine%2FLists_of_pages%2FTop-%2C_High-importance_medicine_articles&amp;namespace=0&amp;limit=500&amp;days=7&amp;urlversion=2

This is a list of all edits made to Top-priority and High-priority WPMED articles.  The key point is the ?userExpLevel=learner bit.  This gives you a list of all edits by people who have made more than 10 edits (so there are very few spammers and vandals, and they're likely to stick around for a while) but less than 500 edits (so some encouragement and invitations to join us might turn the promising editor into a highly experienced one).  If you click that and get a list with an average of about 10 edits per day, then you have the &quot;new&quot; filters enabled (and the page will look [[:File:New filters for edit review - October 2017 interface.png|a bit like the top of this screenshot]], but without the blue and green highlighting).  I put this link in my bookmarks and checked it every day for a while.  In my experience, almost all of these edits are good-faith and helpful.  Some edits can be improved upon, and a few have been reverted (usually before I saw them), but most of them just need someone to click the 'thanks' button or to invite the editor to join us here.

If you want to see edits to all the WPMED articles by this group of editors, then this is the link: 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:RecentChangesLinked?userExpLevel=learner&amp;hidebots=1&amp;hidenewpages=1&amp;hidecategorization=1&amp;hideWikibase=1&amp;hidelog=1&amp;target=Wikipedia%3AWikiProject_Medicine%2FLists_of_pages/Articles&amp;namespace=0&amp;limit=500&amp;days=7&amp;urlversion=2

This is a great opportunity for anyone who wants to encourage and recruit promising new editors.  We can set up lists like this for any list of articles that interests you, so if you want, e.g., only articles about the pandemic, or only articles about cancer, or only articles that are currently mentioned on any page (seriously:  all the links on any page), then let me know what interests you, and I'll help you set it up.

* 

I &quot;solved&quot; this by redirecting to Ozone therapy, but now , the article's creator, has restored it to its former state. So the issue is back. While the article is obviously highly problematic as is, I wonder whether the subject is even sufficiently notable for an article at all. (I am also alerting  as there are fringe issues in play).  () 06:02, 11 July 2020 (UTC)

 Hi . Thank you for your message. 
 Ozonotherapy, whose protocol Lahodny has modified, is in fact only part of his professional activity. He is better known as a gynecologist and obstetrician specialized in obstetric oncology as well as an inventor and designer of several restorative surgical interventions targeting gynecological pathologies more specifically related to the female reproductive system—including urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. 
 I understand the caution and reservations with respect to most alternative medicines. 
 For the record, I would like to make one thing clear: I myself am suspicious and reticent about many unconventional therapies, although I remain “open-mindedly” sceptical. In fact, I'm mostly interested in them from a sociological point of view.
 Nevertheless, sometimes promising avenues are likely to emerge that could potentially bring together certain complementary methods. For example, a series of clinical studies in the USA would seem to show, against all expectations, that intensive targeted chemotherapy coupled with fasting under medical supervision would potentially allow the whole treatment not only to be significantly more effective in the curative eradication of certain tumors, but could even partially protect the patient against a certain number of side effects. It should be noted that this university study has even been officially funded by the pharmaceutical industry. The advantage being that this approach would even allow for increased doses of medication while minimizing the risks. The Franco-German channel Arte reported this study (in French) and can be consulted online via → [https://www.arte.tv/fr/videos/043980-000-A/le-jeune-une-nouvelle-therapie/ this dedicated link] (from 40:04) with an interview of Valter D. Longo.

 I look forward to hearing from you. Kind regards, —    08:18, 08:30, 09:52, 11 July 2020 (UTC)

And the fact that you are a scientist yourself is of particular interest to me, as your expertise in the medical field would certainly allow for a substantial improvement of this textual content with regard to current requirements. Thank you for your help. Kind regards, —  () 08:48, 11 July 2020 (UTC)
Okay thanks. I am not a scientist (not that it's important). The problem with the article is that is has almost no suitable sourcing (where it is sourced) and is written in a terrible tional way, making grand fringe claims. Whether it should be deleted or stubbified I'm not sure - and wait to hear the opinion of other medical editors.  () 08:52, 11 July 2020 (UTC)

 Thank you for your answer. I assume that you are implicitly referring, among other themes, to the alleged invigoration of stem cells that this specific process would induce. I have tried to express as much as possible what all of the sources currently available seem to emphasize. It is true that, unless I am mistaken, double-blind university clinical studies, including a placebo group, are still lacking. So I wrote the article with the means at hand. Therefore, any improvement, completion and neutralization of the content would be gratefully received. Yours sincerely, —    09:34, 09:36, 10:36, 11 July 2020 (UTC)
It's almost everything about the article really. I mean: &quot;tachyonic field therapy&quot; – that sounds like something out of Star Trek, or a hoax!  () 16:08, 11 July 2020 (UTC)
 I've removed as much of the promotional blurb and unsubstantiated narrative as I could, but the article is very poor. Articles about proponents of fringe medical practices can't be written as if those practices were effective and can't ignore the real issues of safety surrounding many of them. I've proposed deletion as non-notable and I'll take it to AfD if that is challenged. On the meantime, there remains the usual problem that when sourcing is weak, the editor/promoter add multiple poor sources everywhere in a believe that lots of poor sources add up to a good one. They don't. More eyes would be welcome. -- () 16:23, 11 July 2020 (UTC)

 Thank you very much for your help as well as your contribution to the improvement and neutralization of the article. 
 I added the following sources:   Sincerely yours, —    19:26, 20:12, 11 July 2020 (UTC)

 Ah, okay, thank you for that information and for the additional link to  that I thoroughly read with much interest. You are right. As a matter of fact, I was not aware (yet) that “case reports are primary studies”. I had ingeniously thought that → the two references above were acceptable secondary sources, since these articles had been published in a medical journal. That’s why, in the same vein, I had tried to neutralize and shorten as much as possible the section devoted to the OHT by reducing it to the strict informative purpose, cf. diff → [[special:diff/967214351#OHT:_Ozonhochdosistherapie|967214351]].
 This said, it is true that, → as described above, a series of double-blind clinical studies (with a placebo group) is still missing to allow the conclusion to be drawn about the alleged reliability—or, a contrario, the possible inefficiency—of this innovative approach which aims to sustain and assist other more conventional cures. 
 In this regard, a few years ago, I read a medical article on the use of OHT in combination with intensive chemotherapy in treating certain tumors. The content highlighted a potential synergistic benefit, arguing that OHT would improve the overall effectiveness of the treatment by allowing increased doses of chemotherapy while significantly reducing the risk of side effects. Unfortunately, I can no longer find this document. However, as far as I can remember, it was also a “case report” (written by a team of oncologists). Thus, according to the , this would still not be acceptable enough to allow its implementation under the current wording.
 Thank you for your kind and valuable cooperation, your diligent assistance and your sound advice.

 Update: your advice, help and guidance have enabled me to become more acquainted with the criteria which are specifically related to . I thank you for this cultural experience which allowed me to better scrutinize the content of several newly updated regulatory requirements. As a result, after careful consideration, I came to the conclusion that the proposal previously put forward by  was eventually the most appropriate for the situation, as shown by diff → . I have therefore reinstated it. Of course, it may still become subsequently possible to transform this redirection into a possible newly updated article to be completed later, should a randomized clinical study occur in double-blind conditions with respect to 0HT. If so, this would thus grant an increased pragmatic reliability to the former textual content, providing all legitimaly expected scientific evidence and guarantees. Yours sincerely, —    12:28, 12:44, 13:04, 12 July 2020 (UTC)

Side note:   Statements like  and  do not constitute , and therefore MEDRS does not apply.  I mention this merely for its possible long-term value; I think that the outcome here (redirecting the whole thing) is appropriate.   () 18:13, 12 July 2020 (UTC)
 No. Calling OHT &quot;an innovative form of ozone therapy&quot; is medical content and therefore  ( does apply. In particular,  is good guidance. The full sentence was  If you don't see the first part of that sentence as making problematical claims, and the whole sentence as promotional, I'd like to see where you set the bar.
 Moreover, how does redirecting Johann Lahodny to Ozone therapy represent an appropriate outcome when Lahodny is not mentioned once in the latter article? -- () 20:12, 12 July 2020 (UTC)

  The targeted sentence you mention has been revoked, thus helping to solve the issue you raised, cf. diff → .
 You are right. Lahodny is currently not mentioned in the section relating to ozone therapy. What about adding it to the article?  
 Furthermore, I would even suggest that the following list could be included:
* USA: Dr. Frank Shallenberger →  → [https://www.austinozone.com/wp-content/uploads/Ozone-Therapy-Intra-Articular-for-Osteo-Arthritis.pdf PDF], Dr. Robert Jay Rowen →  →  [http://ijppr.humanjournals.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/28.Hattur-Shanta-Shrisel-Solanke-Amruta-Suryakant.pdf PDF]

* Austria: Dr. Johann Lahodny [http://ortbul.lf1.cuni.cz/Data/files/PragueMedicalReport/2008_1/pmr_01-2008_seidler.pdf] [https://www.wcm-austria.at/images/stories/wcm/pdfs/WCM_EXKLUSIV_MAGAZIN_Juli_2017.pdf#Page=18] 
* Germany: Dr. Renate Viebahn-Hänsler
* Cuba: Dr. Silvia Menéndez-Cepero
* Etc. 
  Ozonotherapy has been implemented all over Cuba for more than 50 years, including in hospital settings. The same goes for Italy and Greece where, unless I am mistaken, this approach is also officially recognized and validated by the Ministry of Health. 
 This technique is also commonly applied in Germany, notably by many Heilpraktiker. 
 On the other hand, I would also like to point out that each national school tends to favor a different approach... and sometimes even a somewhat contradictory one. 
* For example, the German technique mainly uses minimal quantities with restricted dosages. 
* Lahodny, through Ozonhochdosistherapie or OHT, advocates the opposite: he uses massive injections and high dosages. 
* In Cuba, rectal insufflation prevails. 
* Several dedicated medical associations exist in Italy. Their respective messages sometimes contradict each other on certain points as well.
 According to what most practitioners say, this technique—provided that it is applied according to a rigorous protocol by an experienced and duly trained physician, using only medical grade certified equipment—would allegedly be free of undesirable side effects as well as having only few contraindications among which are glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (in Italian: “favismo”), severe hyperthyroidism, epilepsy and pregnancy. 
 Nota bene: I would like to expressly state that I am writing all the above in the conditional tense because I am the first to admit that these are claims that are still not sufficiently substantiated at the scientific level. Randomized, double-blind clinical studies are still sorely lacking to confirm or disprove the above. This is why, since I became aware of , I no longer dare to add anything in an article on en.wp dealing with unconventional medicine, for fear of being symbolically “stoned” in case the introduction of a word, semantic unit or unusual expression could potentially constitute an accidental infringement with respect to the draconian requirements that are explicitly stipulated for this purpose.

Is there anything there of significance to either of the two articles? -- () 22:34, 13 July 2020 (UTC)

 “So the Italian Minister of Health was concerned in 2003 about the unauthorised use of ozone”  “and makes the point that the only use allowed was for one specific procedure for experimental purposes” which refer to  to be only . 
 This was a legitimate government warning, all the more justified since any ozone injection must be carried out according to a precise protocol which should imperatively be performed by doctors who are highly qualified and specialised in this method, or even, ideally, in a hospital institution duly trained in this procedure, as previously describeb in → my former message above. 
 The above-mentioned government notice was precisely aimed at avoiding any fraudulent abuse, charlatanism of the “sorcerer's apprentice” type or, even more problematic, possible ill-considered uses that could potentially endanger the patient's health.

Not wanting to refer to Ozone therapy by its acknowledged name sort of puts us in a bind with respect to [[wikipedia:Verifiability|WP:V]].  We do usually call things by their names.  I don't share the belief that the average person would read &quot;ozone therapy&quot; and interpret it as &quot;ozone that's proven to really work&quot; (I think &quot;therapy&quot; sounds like talk therapy to most people), but even if I did, we can't avoid the name, and using the name doesn't turn the sentence into a biomedical claim of efficacy.
Separately, I wonder whether the first sentence of that article would really hold up under scrutiny.  It appears that this is indeed widely marketed by quacks, but also that there is some conventional, evidence-based research going on.  Consider [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32636631/ this review] in a [https://www.scopus.com/sourceid/4700152233 top-quartile] medical journal.

Depending upon exactly what the sources actually say, that might need to be re-written, maybe to something like &quot;frequently promoted by altmed sellers&quot;.  () 23:37, 13 July 2020 (UTC)

 Note: the second author mentioned in the aforesaid study, in this case H. R., is a strong supporter and promoter of an alternative method—DIV (Direct Intravenous Injection)— which is not recognized by the various international bodies using ozone in their practice because of the supposed risks of embolism and other induced problematic issues that, at least hypothetically speaking, could potentially occur.

Regardless of the above, I fully agree with  in the sense that the use of the word “therapy” is not a guarantee of proven efficacy and even less a guarantee of assured healing. 

The same is true for any form of chemotherapy, which sometimes proves conclusive, relieves and, ideally, cures... but, alas, can also fail in some cases for often mysterious reasons that are not always easy to identify. 

Moreover, the fact that any unconventional curative approach is based on precepts that have not yet been sufficiently endorsed by higher authorities does not necessarily mean that there is no therapeutic potential. 

For example, it is now commonly accepted that certain nosocomial infections with the dreaded bacterium called Clostridium difficile are sometimes resistant to all known antibiotics. However, at The Centre for Digestive Diseases in Sydney, a single fecal microbiota transplant (not FDA approved) might sometimes be enough to cure the patient in record time, whereas he/she has been suffering immoderately for years →  → [https://www.rts.ch/play/tv/369/video/microbiote-ces-bacteries-qui-nous-gouvernent?id=4600581 TV report in French]. 

The word therapy does not imply “we will heal you for sure”, but rather “we will try to help you as best we can to attempt to get you out of this rough patch”. 

In the case of ozone, even if one agrees or is fervently opposed to its use other than exclusively aimed for water disinfection, the fact remains that the semantic unit “ozone therapy” (or “ozonotherapy”) prevails in all languages: ozonoterapia, ononothérapie, Ozontherapie, etc. 

As → written above, the introductory sentence in this article would almost allusively suggest that a global consensus would currently stigmatize this use as a kind of unanimously condemned “hogwash”. 

However, the reality is a bit different. 

Admittedly, some renowned authors, including  Dr. David Gorski, do indeed consider most curative approaches labelled homeopathy and other related streams of thought as a form of charlatanism. He is assuredly right in a certain amount of instances where the adjectives “natural”, “biological”, “organic”, “quantic”, “futuristic” and other synonyms (alas, even with ozone in a few rare cases of “black sheeps”) are from time to time (thankfully, not always) nothing more than false promises designed to abuse the despair of patients. Those, no longer knowing to which saint to devote themselves, could easily fall into the insidious trap set by a few opportunistic swindlers. These would make the victims believe unrealistic and abusive promises, whereas the primary intention would be to plunder their assets, even if it means shamelessly emptying their bank accounts... while no convincing curative effect would ever occur in the end. Sometimes it is even much worse when, instead of any hoped relief, occurs, as a cynical added bonus, a dramatic worsening of the state of health that otherwise diligent protocolary care could have helped to prevent and avoid. 

Even if there are unfortunately regrettable exceptions with certain alleged physicians who, having sniffed out the right vein, allow themselves to charge exorbitant or even downright scandalous fees, there are also thousands of other doctors throughout the world who resort to “ozonotherapy” in a probing, honest, conscientious manner and primarily driven by the fervent Hippocratic oath which resolutely advocates the following vow: Primum, non nocere. 

In Italy, hundreds of doctors are duly trained in this approach. These practitioners apply the reasonable and official rates in force. A complete session lasts about an hour to an hour and a half. It supposedly implies in most cases a session of MAT (Major Autohemotherapy), rectal insufflation, several subcutaneous, intradiscal and/or interarticular injections, the drinking of ozonated water and, sometimes the washing of the eyes and nose with this same liquid. The whole session generally costs between 60 and 120 euros. In some cases, this amount is even covered by indigenous (or open-minded private international) health insurances. This price scale cannot therefore be described as truly abusive.   

Moreover, as → mentioned here, ozone for curative use has already been in full force for several decades in Cuba in most private and public hospitals. There, some of this type of care is even sometimes provided free of charge and on a voluntary basis.

Germany, for its part, has granted the authorization of this practice to doctors, clinics, hospitals and Heilpraktiker.

Sincerely, —  () 06:54, 17 July 2020 (UTC)
This is all getting a bit off-topic, but limited, regional acceptance of a therapy is a hallmark of quackery (something I believe Ben Goldacre writes about elsewhere). If something actually worked, it would be accepted and used everywhere. Science is not regional. Some very dubious things still go in in Germany because of its Heilpraktiker hangover. In any case, since in RS ozone therapy has been characterized as quackery, Wikipedia is quite right to relay that.  () 07:02, 17 July 2020 (UTC)
If something actually works, it will eventually be accepted almost everywhere.  One might notice, for example, that the US and France have very different, but equally scientific, approaches to treating ADHD in children.  Or that Japan bans drugs that are widely used in the rest of the world. 
More relevantly, this is a multi-axis situation.  The opposite of alternative is conventional – not &quot;scientific&quot; or &quot;evidence-based&quot;.  There are all sorts of purely conventional medical practices that turned out to be very bad ideas.  We could have a whole article about the 100% conventional medicine stupidity of trying to cure breast cancer with bone marrow transplants.  () 18:49, 17 July 2020 (UTC)

 @Alexbrn 
 I think that we are at the heart of the problem. 
 Let me quote you: “” 
 Of course, I totally agree. WP definitely  needs to relay this information. Have I ever written anything to the contrary? Not that I know of.
 More specifically, → as I mentioned earlier, it should also be mentioned that the word “quackery” is the personal opinion expressed by David Gorski, especially if his “diagnosis” is implemented in the . Otherwise, this introductory information would almost look like an attempt to “[[:fr:empoisonner le puits|empoisonner le puits]]” as expressed by a French semantic unit (sorry, I couldn't find any equivalent in English), especially if Gorski’s name disappears behind a vague and allusive “ has been said”.
 Thus, even if you have revoked—in my opinion a bit hastily—the “quotation needed” templates as well as other interpolations requiring additional references, the problem remains.
 Moreover, ozone therapy is officially accepted in many countries: Italy, Spain, Switzerland, Germany, Greece, Cuba, Romania, Russia, Ukraine, etc. Thus, the use of the word “regional” (see your message above) seems a bit reductive, given that this unconventional technique refers to far more than just a few “departments”. Thus, “regional” becomes rather “continental”.
 Specifically, reliable sources that condemn ozone must legitimately coexist with those that would take a more nuanced position. The only requirement is that all references included must be written by respectable and authoritative authors in their field.
 This is obviously the case with David Gorski... but he is not the only one.
 Sincerely, —    07:20, 18 July 2020 (UTC)
You are falling into the  trap. Wikipedia does not &quot;balance&quot; knowledge in this way, and has a  in fact to call out pseudoscientific/fringe ideas as being so with especial prominence. As to quackery, it is not just Gorski's view but rather a fact that he happens to mention; quackery is, by definition, charging money for unproven/ineffective treatments so this is obvious. Just to be clear: Ozone therapy does not cure cancer or HIV/AIDS, which is how it has been marketed. Are you really contending that selling ozone therapy for large sums of money as a cancer cure is not quackery? Checking QuackWatch I notice they say:
[https://quackwatch.org/related/cancer/oxygen/]
Per  we don't attribute statements of fact because that it has the non-neutral effect of making them seem like &quot;just&quot; a view. If you want we could simply assert that ozone therapy is the basis of a form of quackery, rather than the softer &quot;has been considered&quot; we currently use. Either would work in my view.  () 07:41, 18 July 2020 (UTC)

   Let me quote you: “”  I agree. “” Of course not. Should the case arise, this would definitely be a quackery. I agree with you all the more as this is → exactly what my previous message above is about. 
 This said, breach of trust, unfortunately, might potentially arise everywhere, sometimes even in conventional medicine.
 Cancer can sometimes be cured with conventional medicine, sometimes it cannot. Surgery can also help, sometimes it is not enough. All those treatments are extremely expensive, especially considering immunotherapy which is prohibitively expensive and not always successful..
 Something needs to be clarified: Most of the international organizations that oversee the use of ozone therapy give no credit or legitimacy to ozone as a cancer treatment. These same international bodies even vehemently condemn any reference that arbitrarily conveys what would clearly be considered false hope in this field. 
 Furthermore, if you re-read → one of my previous message, you will see that there are plenty of honest ozonotherapists doctors around the world who are not crooks, who are sincerely devoted to using the ozone procedure with integrity and probity, in the sole hope of helping their patients in their distress. Last but not least, they charge moderate and reasonable fees, under the strict supervision of local medical associations dedicated to ozone research.
 The article dated 2001 that you provided me with the link to is interesting. I didn't know it yet. Thank you for having allowed me to discover its content.

You keep asserting, without evidence, there is some kind of legitimacy to the sale of this &quot;therapy&quot; but I'm not seeing any sources for that; I'm seeing exactly the opposite. We cannot know the intent of the people selling this, whether it's greed or ignorance, or a mixture of the two, but some trivial googling shows that in the real world, &quot;ozone therapy&quot; is being actively sold as a cancer/AIDS treatment with a load of pseudoscientific marketing.

*From South Africa &quot;Ozone has cured AIDS in over 300 cases.&quot;[https://onemindbodysoul.co.za/blogs/articles/ozone-has-cured-aids-in-over-300-cases]
In this country (the UK) people making such claims about cancer would be guilty of a criminal offence. So far as I can see, this is (as our good sources say) about the rankest quackery imaginable, typically party of the quackery smörgåsbord that is naturopathy.  () 11:20, 18 July 2020 (UTC)
 
Of course, I respect your position, your restraint, your reserve and your praiseworthy concern for prudence in the face of this approach which, indeed, has not yet been sufficiently endorsed by irrefutable clinical studies. 
 I agree with you that the statements contained in the hyperlinks you mentioned would probably be liable to disciplinary or even criminal sanctions if they were issued in the United Kingdom.
 One question: you added in the introductory summary (and I quote):  Then you linked the reference  with that segment. However, its page only displays an abstract where there is nothing in the text that could refer to ozone. I finally managed to access the entire publication via  → [https://www.cancernetwork.com/view/cancer-quackery-persistent-popularity-useless-irrational-alternative-treatments this alternative link]. It says (and I quote): “Serious adverse effects and at least five fatalities associated with oxygen therapies have been reported”. However, link number → [http://www.cancer.org/Treatment/TreatmentsandSideEffects/ComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine/PharmacologicalandBiologicalTreatment/oxygen-therapy 26], which would allow one to read more details about such a weighty statement, has apparently become invalid.

I think your referring to ozone therapy as something that has &quot;not yet been sufficiently endorsed by irrefutable clinical studies&quot; is so economical with the truth as to be , especially that &quot;yet&quot;. This is a known, established quackery that is actively being used to defraud and harm vulnerable people, as our good sources tell us. As to the Cassileth citation, this is how citations are done on Wikipedia – whether readers will be able to progress beyond the abstract depends on many factors. The cited source's own cited web-based primary sources may well have disappeared (as sometimes happens), but this is not a problem since we are bound to respect good-quality secondary sources. If we could get updated figures on how many people these quacks are killing, that would be better to report.  () 14:27, 18 July 2020 (UTC)

  Please don’t lend me intentions that aren’t mine and don't make such hasty and arbitrary deductions about me. You are completely wrong. I make absolutely no claim to the alleged efficacy or possible ineffectiveness of this therapeutic procedure. I am merely expressing what a number of a priori reliable sources, since they are written by professional doctors, potentially suggest in their writings and in the publication of their results. That’s all. Nothing more.
 Moreover, this approach has indeed not yet been sufficiently deciphered in the form of randomized double-blind studies to be either endorsed or officially invalidated as null and void. Please reread → one of my previous interventions above as well as → this one and → this one instead of allusively lending me  propensities which are absolutely not mine, quite the contrary.  
 As far as I know, the practice of ozonotherapy has had only one and only accidental death in its history... and even then, it was due to a highly contested practice—the DIV—whose application has always been severely reproved and condemned by all international associative ozonotherapeutic bodies, → as described in detail in the correlated message above, because of the risks of embolism that could occur.
 More recently, a side-effect would also have occurred with a booed therapist who, acting as a free electron, not only practices DIV but also promotes it.

If is also a fringe gambit to suppose that a therapy being used needs to &quot;officially invalidated&quot; before Wikipedia says so, first because this is a  and secondly because it is nearly always logically impossible to &quot;disprove&quot; therapeutic effectiveness. The default assumption has to be that it does not work. But we do positively know some things about the therapy: it's sold for money with fucking evil marketing BS; it's illegal in some jurisdictions; it harms and kills people (and more than you claim). That's probably pretty much all that Wikipedia can say on the topic, in a neutral article. (BTW, I looked up your Shallenberger guy - aka &quot;Dr. Ozone&quot; - who it seems is a luminary in the field. It's not pretty.[http://faculty.uml.edu/sgallagher/california_medical_board_case_ag.htm])  () 15:45, 18 July 2020 (UTC)
  You are going to have to accept that the presence or absence of &quot;randomized double-blind studies&quot; is irrelevant to a medical article in Wikipedia, which demands secondary sources. I find your repeated posting of the same pro-fringe material tendentious, and it's time you dropped the stick. -- () 16:03, 18 July 2020 (UTC)

 I would like to clarify an issue: if really at least 5 people have really and directely died as a result of this therapy, it would be perfectly legitimate to include this unfortunate aspect of things. However, such an accusation is serious enough to be at least matched by concrete and absolutely focused sources that leave absolutely no doubt or possibility of misinterpretation. These sources must not only be clear, complete, irrefutable but also not subject to possible misunderstanding or imprecision. The problem is that the sentence in the linked reference does not indicate whether these deaths were specifically due to ozone therapy, oxygen therapy (which is something different) or, maybe, other unconventional alternative approaches that are also disputed. Moreover, if dramatic side effects specifically attributable to ozone therapy have been identified, they should of course also be reported, with crystal-clear sources. I have only one concern: verifiability, especially when a legal dimension is at stake and a particularly meaningful imputation has to be made publicly. Once this has been achieved, I immediately bow down with respect and deference. Therefore, if you manage to find additional sources that can scrupulously confirm in extenso the entirety of the foregoing, it goes without saying that you have my anticipated grateful blessing. 
 Independently of the few questions mentioned above, I find that you are doing a remarkable job of improving and completing this article and I would like to congratulate you on this. 
 Please, kindly note that this is my last message in this section which has indeed taken up a lot of time and attention from all of us. Thank you for your contradictory arguments, which have caught my full attention. Even if we did not necessarily manage to agree on all points, I thank you for the quality of your enlightened answers. 
 Have a great day and good bye. Sincerely, —    16:38, 18 July 2020 (UTC)

Update

@ —  — : 

Hello. 

Following the interesting information that came out of → our previous dialogues, I went to take a look at the [[:fr:ozonothérapie|French version of the article]] (of which I am not the creator). As its state was still a bit embryonic, I started trying to rework it and complete its structure. So I introduced the perceptions expressed by Gorski and Green in an appropriate “zetetic” section. I did the same as what concern the “Risks and Precautions” as well as “Indications, Dosages and Contraindications”. I still have to work quite a bit on the different legislations in force, in view of the international case law which varies considerably from one country and continent to another.

I have also been checking the content of the statement made by Burkhard, in relation to autologous blood, reported by Saul Green, in his article originally published in 1997 in the Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine. However, the author, in order to source this assertion, mentioned, via reference 58 (and I quote): “Burkhard, B. Personal communication to S. Green, 5/23/1995” [https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074406/http://naturalsolutionsradio.com/blog/natural-solutions-radio/oxygenation-therapy-unproven-treatments-cancer-and-aids]. It may have been so that German health insurances had not been concerned at that time, i.e. 25 years ago. However, consultation of the German website linked to current health insurances seems to suggest that, nowadays, at least 8 health insurance companies accept to reimburse this type of “treatment”: [https://www.krankenkassen.de/gesetzliche-krankenkassen/leistungen-gesetzliche-krankenkassen/alternative-heilmethoden/eigenbluttherapie/search-13.html]. 

As for the alleged deaths which (potentially) would—specifically and exclusively (?)—be attributable to ozone therapy, I have not yet managed to find sufficiently precise and irrefutable sources to dare to add this type of insert. The reason for my principled caution is not only based on  but also and above all on the fact that my criminal liability could potentially be engaged in case of missteps, as it has already happened for several European contributors who have been taken to court (one of them even had to pay 25’000 euros in damages) for similar reasons: [https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikip%C3%A9dia:Le_Bistro/28_avril_2020#Proc%C3%A8s?] [https://lexing.network/condamnation-pour-suppression-du-nom-dun-concurrent-sur-wikipedia/] [http://juriscom.net/documents/tgiparis20071029.pdf]  [https://www.village-justice.com/articles/responsabilite-wikipedia,31876.html] [https://360.ch/monde/5757-outing-sur-wikipedia-plaignants-deboutes] [http://juriscom.net/documents/tgiparis20071029.pdf] [https://www.itespresso.fr/wikipedia-trois-particuliers-perdent-un-proces-en-diffamation-contre-lencyclopedie-19939.html] [https://www.alain-bensoussan.com/avocats/condamnation-pour-suppression-du-nom-dun-concurrent-sur-wikipedia/2011/07/08] [https://www.alain-bensoussan.com/wp-content/uploads/22290673.pdf] [https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Requests_for_user_information_procedures_%26_guidelines] among others. 

Thus, should this “lethal” information appear in French, → as mentioned in my previous message, I absolutely must be able to consolidate and back it up with granite and 100% unassailable sources. I may have a still unconfirmed lead in relation to a reliable reference that would report a hypothetical death that might have possibly occurred during an ozonotherapy session some 20 years ago. The main interest of this medical source would lie in the fact that this unfortunate event would → not in this case be related to DIV (a practice that is disputed and even prohibited by most professional medical associations of ozonotherapists). However, access to the full article is subject to a charge. I managed to get part of the textual content. I am currently working on decrypting it. 

Sincerely,

We have multiple good sources referring to multiple deaths. Not sure why there's a problem with that? Just relay what those sources say, that is what we are meant to do here. What is specific to French Wikipedia is irrelevant here. If you want to follow-up on the misinformation about German insurance, maybe start [https://thepowerofozone.com/ozone-therapy-in-germany-facts-vs-fiction/ here].  () 15:53, 24 July 2020 (UTC)

 Thank you very much for providing me this informative hyperlink which I read carefully. 
 Moreover, here is the aforesaid reference to an autopsy relating to a possible accidental death that could be associated with the practise of the so-called autologous ozonated blood. This article was published in 2000 in The American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology. Access to the full and detailled *.PDF file is unfortunately subject to a (substantial) fee, but I was at least able to get a portion of the textual content. On the other hand, an overview of the abstract can be accessed for free via → [https://journals.lww.com/amjforensicmedicine/Abstract/2000/06000/An_Unexpected_Death_During_Oxygen_Ozone_Therapy.10.aspx this hyperlink]:

What is the point of producing (partial) autopsies? We are bound to reflect what reliable sources say; revisiting/reinterpreting various bits of primary material is outside the scope of this Project. As I said, we have multiple reliable sources reporting multiple deaths from this particular species of health fraud. (Add: and, FWIW, the full text of this report of an actual death - not &quot;possible death&quot; - begins with the words &quot;In February 1996, a 20-year-old woman suddenly lost consciousness during her 31st oxygen-ozone treatment by autohemotransfusion. Resuscitation was unsuccessful&quot; and ends with the words &quot;our case could be legally considered to be an incorrect medical ozone administration&quot;.) () 18:12, 24 July 2020 (UTC)

 Yes, I should definitely have been more clear and precise by writing that this an actual (and accidental) death which, most obviously, in this specific case, is—only and exclusively—due to the sad sequels which, regrettably, have occurred during a session of “ozonotherapy” implying ozonated autologous blood all along its process. This article, which was published in June 2000, also mentioned that “several literature reviews exist dealing with gas embolism as a potential complication of medical and surgical treatment but, to our knowledge, it has never been reported in relation to O2 / O3 therapy by autohemotransfusion.” Anyway, I’ll try to do my best to apply as much as possible , ,  and . This is quite an interesting challenge. Have a great day. Best regards. Sincerely, —    00:30, 25 July 2020 (UTC)
I'm also not sure about your emphasis on &quot;accidental&quot;. The killing could well be wrongful, as a result of negligence - that is something to leave to the sources.  () 06:32, 25 July 2020 (UTC)

If any editor – any editor – does not feel comfortable adding some content – any content – to an article, regardless of the editor's reason (or lack thereof), then that editor should not do so.  We're .  Editors who want that content should do so themselves.  () 01:30, 25 July 2020 (UTC)

 I couldn’t agree with you more.
 Here are three new and potentially interesting additional sources:   Update: 5 May 2020. Sincerely, —    08:44, 08:48, 29 July 2020 (UTC)
The first two are really too old to be usable.   () 19:22, 29 July 2020 (UTC)

Archive ?
Even with aggressive archiving, this talk page consistently approaches 200 MB.  Euphonie, you have not gained consensus.  Might it be possible to confine discussion to article talk pages? [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] ()  13:45, 28 July 2020 (UTC)

 Yes, I do agree and I thank you for your proposal. Indeed, since all this past discussion has been entirely focused on ozone therapy, I for one would be very much in favour of you transferring and archiving its content to the talk page relating to the article which is more specifically concerned by the aforesaid topic, in order to relieve this current page of the number of bytes that this interesting debate has generated. Sincerely, —    08:04, 30 July 2020 (UTC)

 On which article talk pages do you want this discussion linked after it is archived here? [[User:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia]] ()  14:59, 3 August 2020 (UTC)</segment>
