I don't know how many folks are watching  these days, so I thought I'd say that the following GA nominations might be interesting to some editors here:

* Brugada syndrome nominated by PeaBrainC
* Parasitism nominated by Chiswick Chap
* Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 nominated by Cincotta1
* Plasmodium nominated by Ajpolino
* Cerebellar theory of dyslexia nominated by AlexADP

You can find more (especially articles on different species) at .  If you've never reviewed an article before, then it's pretty straightforward.   will lead you through the process step-by-step, but the overall idea is that you check the article against the , and either &quot;pass&quot; or &quot;fail&quot; it on () that basis.

2003 Union for Reform Judaism resolution on the medicinal use of marijuana

Project members are invited to help improve the newly created 2003 Union for Reform Judaism resolution on the medicinal use of marijuana. By the way, , a campaign to create and improve cannabis-related content, runs during the month of April. You're more than welcome to help out, if interested. Thanks! ---Another Believer (Talk) 05:01, 6 April 2018 (UTC)
A whole article on one resolution from 2003? I doubt it's sufficiently notable for a standalone article. As for our our cannabis content - in general it's in pretty bad shape still: this list[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine/Archive_44#Where_does_work_stand?] from  is still pertinent. Alexbrn (talk) 15:16, 6 April 2018 (UTC)
I share Alex's skepticism about notability.  It feels like a candidate for merging to Cannabis and Judaism.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 15:31, 6 April 2018 (UTC)
It passes GNG, so it can be kept -- though if no one lengthens the article it could still be merged if that is most convenient, without prejudice to future recreation and expansion.  A comparable article is Matrimonial nullity trial reforms of Pope Francis.  We must be careful not to let majoritarianism, under guise of &quot;notability&quot;, turn into anti-Semitism. Wnt (talk) 23:50, 6 April 2018 (UTC)
I'm not convinced that it passes GNG.  I see no &quot;significant coverage&quot;.  The cited sources are mostly about something else and give only two or three sentences about the resolution.  They all basically repeat the same simple facts (which probably explains why the article is only five sentences long:  we can't verify anything else about it).  There's no indication of any significance other than a disputed claim to being &quot;first&quot;.  There's no analysis of why the resolution matters (assuming it does, which I begin to doubt), no explanation of any effects produced by the resolution, or anything else.  It's just &quot;Hey, this woman wanted them to pass a resolution on this topic, and they did, and they might have been the first religious 'body' (but definitely not the first religious 'organization') to do that.&quot;  
AFAICT, URJ has an annual meeting whose main purpose seems to be passing resolutions.  In 2003, they passed a dozen such resolutions.  Neither the current stub nor any of the cited sources give any explanation why anyone should care about this resolution, much less why this one is worth attention and not the one [https://urj.org/what-we-believe/resolutions/50th-anniversary-american-conference-cantors-acc congratulating the American Conference Of Cantors on their 50th anniversary], or their resolution in favor of [https://urj.org/what-we-believe/resolutions/resolution-stem-cell-research stem cell research].  We don't need an entire article to say &quot;They might have been the first (or second, or fourth) religious body to pass a resolution on this subject.&quot;  WhatamIdoing (talk) 06:28, 8 April 2018 (UTC)
 ← in what has been a bad week at ,  tops it off with the most fucking stupid contribution of all! Alexbrn (talk) 06:36, 8 April 2018 (UTC)
I was not suggesting anyone here wanted to be anti-Semitic, but if we start deciding whether religious concepts and events are notable based on the proportional amount of publicity, we inevitably will end up with that result, regardless of initial intention, because there are fewer Jews and presumably fewer Jewish religious periodicals.  We should look only whether we have multiple sources to make an article, which is a fixed threshold, and should be a low one -- I would abolish that threshold were it possible to make an article without any way to learn about the topic.  I should also note that what any religion thinks about the use of medical marijuana, or any other therapy, is strictly a religious question, not a medical issue at all.  There are not, nor ever have been, any medical claims in that article. Wnt (talk) 13:50, 8 April 2018 (UTC)
The GNG requires more than multiple sources.  It requires:
* multiple – 
* independent – 
* secondary –   Maybe we have that, and maybe we don't.
* reliable sources – 
* with significant coverage – 
The problem isn't getting two-sentence mentions in mainstream media.  The problem is that nobody – not the pro-cannabis people, not the Jewish people, not the anti-marijuana people – during the last decade and a half seems to have thought that this vote was worth writing 500 words about it.  We've got &quot;multiple&quot; sources.  What we don't have is any hope of getting past the  range or meeting the goals of .  WhatamIdoing (talk) 19:57, 8 April 2018 (UTC)

Gaslighting

Dear medical experts:

Re Gaslighting

A paragraph about self-help to combat the psychological effects of &quot;gaslighting&quot; has been added to the  above article. I'm not sure that it's appropriate. Can someone take a look?—Anne Delong (talk) 09:37, 9 April 2018 (UTC)
The citations in the paragraph added fail . The medical literature does discuss gaslighting. However, I am struggling to find anything that meets MEDRS that is suitable as a replacement here. It would seem worth citing Gass &amp; Nichols (Contemp Fam Ther (1988) 10: 3. ) as a key early paper, but it doesn't help much in terms of treatment. There's a recent, non-systematic, kind-of [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0141076818763326 review by Davendralingam] (2018, ) that may be of some use. Bondegezou (talk) 10:01, 9 April 2018 (UTC)
I've removed the passages, not because they fail , but because they were either very poorly sourced according to  or just simply unsourced. Medium is not an acceptable source, neither is lonerwolf.com — and that is for any statement. ,  — I have no problem with the message conveyed, but you need to use better sources. Aslo, be careful when saying things about psychological health, you then need to adhere to MEDRS. Carl Fredrik talk 05:59, 10 April 2018 (UTC)
Thanks, Bondegezou and Carl Fredrik. I was worried about the sourcing, but since the information seemed to have been added in good faith, I wanted to check with more knowledgeable editors.—Anne Delong (talk) 12:02, 10 April 2018 (UTC)
Medium.com actually would be an acceptable source if the author meets  standards.  It is certainly no worse than Facebook posts or Twitter links.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 15:34, 10 April 2018 (UTC)
True, but in the presence of other better sources I think we should prefer them. I do not feel Medium is acceptable in this case, especially as it straddles invoking MEDRS — where SPS is even less acceptable, nigh on forbidden. Carl Fredrik talk 20:39, 10 April 2018 (UTC)

Well, those diffs might contain about three times as many paragraphs as is warranted, but it's probably reasonable to consider it reliable for some of the claims made, e.g., &quot;This one paper suggested this as a problem, and that as a potential mitigation effort&quot;.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 04:35, 12 April 2018 (UTC)
It looks like a fascinating paper, and I'll have to read it properly, but it does say &quot;This study assesses the 10 most cited RCTs worldwide and shows that trials inevitably produce bias.&quot; which seems a stretch. You'd have to look at significantly more RCTs to come to this conclusion, even though it is quite notable. Carl Fredrik talk 08:54, 12 April 2018 (UTC)
I think that the examples given in the article suggest that it's formally impossible to remove all bias, in which case the findings aren't particularly interesting. — soupvector (talk) 23:44, 12 April 2018 (UTC)

thanks for posting?--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 23:29, 2 April 2018 (UTC)
Whether the article about the (US) National Rifle Association should state that they sponsor safety programs or certify firearm instructors does not seem even remotely like biomedical information.  Whether the safety programs produce safer behavior (their most famous likely doesn't) is not being discussed here.  The statement being made is purely about organizational activities, not about whether those activities meet their stated goals.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 21:36, 4 April 2018 (UTC)
 That turns out to be not the case. When the NRA baldly claim that they run safety programmes without further qualification, it gives the reader the impression that those safety programmes actually have a significant effect on safety - for which there is no evidence. It's called 'spin'. The misapplication of the label &quot;safety&quot; is the problem there, not the factual accuracy of these programmes' existence. --RexxS (talk) 16:23, 5 April 2018 (UTC)
 I'm not sure not getting shot in the head is a medical issue as such. Johnbod (talk) 17:54, 5 April 2018 (UTC)
Preventing (accidental and intentional) firearm injuries is a public health issue, but that's not really the point of the NRA article.  The point of that article is pretty much &quot;There's this org, which does lobbying and gives classes&quot;.  The proposed sentence , OTOH, is unrelated to health.
RexxS, I think it's fair to mention the existence of their programs (especially remembering that the proposed list includes programs with no clear connection to safety).  The fact is that these programs exist, and it's one of the two main things that the org does.  There'd be nothing wrong with saying &quot;They offer a bunch of classes, including a safety class that has been criticized as ineffective&quot;, but there is  wrong with omitting the fact that they offer classes altogether.  Eddie Eagle (their independently notable, largely ineffective safety program) needs to be mentioned somewhere in that article, and right now, there's no connection from the NRA to it.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 19:11, 5 April 2018 (UTC)
  I like your wording! There certainly wouldn't be anything wrong with saying &quot;They offer a bunch of classes, including a safety class that has been criticized as ineffective&quot;. Sadly, that alternative is not on the table as far as I can see. --RexxS (talk) 22:06, 5 April 2018 (UTC)
My impression of that discussion is that far too many editors have interpreted it as a Request For All-or-Nothing Votes, and what they needed was a Request for Help Finding a Compromise.  (Feel free to dress up that idea in an encyclopedic tone and propose it as an alternative if you want to.)  WhatamIdoing (talk) 02:03, 6 April 2018 (UTC)
Wikipedia voice in an article hat at Eddie Eagle says it is a &quot;safety&quot; program. Can someone familiar with  please review this for compliance?  (talk) 22:12, 11 April 2018 (UTC)
Eddie Eagle is a safety program.  The fact that it is a safety program does not mean that it is an effective program, but the fact that it is ineffective at improving safety does not magically transform it into some other kind of program.  It shouldn't be surprising that it's a failure; most Behavior-based safety programs are failures, and almost all one-off information sessions with children are doomed.  (Need proof?  Find the nearest parent and ask them how many years they spent saying things like &quot;Don't run around in busy parking lots&quot;.)  WhatamIdoing (talk) 04:30, 12 April 2018 (UTC)
We agree with the American Academy of Pediatrics and the review article that the Eddie Eagle program is ineffective. My understanding of  is that we may no more say in Wikipedia voice that Eddie Eagle is a &quot;firearms safety program for children,&quot; then we could for example describe apricot seeds as a cancer cure. What is your understanding? Better would be &quot;This article is about the NRA's firearm program for children.&quot;  (talk) 22:29, 12 April 2018 (UTC)
Your metaphor fails:  the primary purpose of apricot seeds is making more apricot trees, not treating disease.  
A more apt comparison would be to something like the US FAA's old Air Transportation Oversight System safety program.  ATOS didn't work.  It was still a safety program.  It did not stop being a safety program even though everyone concluded (eventually) that it was ineffective.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:19, 13 April 2018 (UTC)
Like most of us WAID is subject to a cognitive bias in favour of the mature complex organism. Dawkins argued convincingly that the tree is just an elaborate means for the reproduction of the seed, or at a more basic level, the reproduction of its constituent genes. However, the idea that the NRA is anything other than an elaborate sales organization rings false to most of the world. Even if Eddie had been effective as a user training program, its objective was still to sell more firearms to hit more targets. For those whose only interaction with firearms is in the role of potential targets, that does not seem like any kind of safety program.LeadSongDog come howl! 17:23, 18 April 2018 (UTC)

As a new page patroller, I don't think I've ever seen a new redirect page created with a WikiProject tagged on it. The only redirect tags I see are on pages that were once filled with content but moved to another page at some later time (rather than submit an AfD, for instance). Then the old page gets the tag for historical purposes (and it shows we've been there before). Tagging every single redirect just for the heck of it will add tens of thousands of pages to this project's article count, and I don't really see the positive of doing so. SEMMENDINGER (talk) 13:42, 13 April 2018 (UTC)

*I am not familiar with this practice. The Wikipedia category system is for human browsing, and I cannot think of a reason why a human would want to have easy access to a list of redirects.

** We usually have tags on pages if it was tagged before the article was moved.  The other reason is if there's been a controversy about a particular one.

A particularly bad example right now is Alzheimer's disease, which I promoted TEN years ago.  Both of the original FA writers are gone, and the article is in very bad shape. Just comparing the Table of Contents from the [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alzheimer%27s_disease&amp;oldid=234207986 2008 promoted version] to the current Table of Contents gives you an idea of how much unreviewed text the article has taken on, and the field has certainly changed in 10 years. Same can be said for any of the medical FAs where the original authors have moved on.  When I started working up dementia with Lewy bodies, I was surprised to find that not only was there no article on Parkinson's disease dementia, but it sure isn't linked at Parkinson's disease.  But AD is in bad shape, and should either be rewritten or defeatured.  I suspect you will find the same if you look closely at schizophrenia, autism, Asperger syndrome, and both of the multiple sclerosis articles.

I do wish there were some focus on keeping at least the FAs accurate, or submitting them to FAR, but not the case ...  I found a number of deficiencies at attention deficit hyperactivity disorder last month, and that was based on only a quick scan of what I knew (tics). SandyGeorgia (Talk)  14:49, 15 April 2018 (UTC)

 Yes ... since I helped develop the original  template and implement its rollout on every FA at the time we developed it (), I do know how to check for that data :)  Point being, the GA list is not accurate, because ADHD is not listed at . I don't participate in GA, so do not know if the bot was supposed to add it, if the reviewer was supposed to add it, if it was added and later deleted, etc ... don't much care, other than pointing out that Anthony can't rely on the GA list as he can the FA list.

Given that the question was &quot;How can we make Wikipedia more interactive for readers?&quot; it's not surprising that there was relatively little mention of video. Video can be a wonderful medium for enriching articles, but it's not interactive. Clayoquot (talk | ) 05:15, 20 April 2018 (UTC)

Are these sources reliable to include information on Ayurveda#History, that &quot;The origins of Ayurveda have been traced to around 6,000 BCE&quot;? I am copying the most convincing texts from the discussion held on .

Barondess, Stephen Lock, published by Oxford University Press. The authors if the chapter are Jagjit Singh Chopra and Sudesh Prabhakar, two prominent neurologists.

Written by Steven V. Pacia, Orrin Devinsky (Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry professor) and Steven Schachter (neurology professor) and published by Demos Medical Publishing. In the next page (28) it gives the details on Ayurveda as medical practice and also the scientific overview. On page 29, there is a conclusion about all these medicines provided, which seems to be mainstream.
*&quot;Ayurveda evolved in India some 8000 years ago and is often quoted as the oldest medical system in the world&quot;, from [https://books.google.com/books?id=M9oES85plfgC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Complementary Therapies for Pain Management: An Evidence-based Approach], written by a specialist, researcher of complementary and alternative medicine, Edzard Ernst, published by Elsevier Health Sciences. A journal[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00228-001-0400-y] from Edzard Ernst has been already used in this article for scientific statements for a long time and Ernst dominates the article on Alternative medicine (31 mentions) as a critical and expert source and have been used as a source on other CAM articles (Acupuncture, Traditional Chinese medicine, Homeopathy).

This is a side note about arbitration remedies:  Getting a notice about  is scary for most editors, especially if you don't happen to be particularly familiar with Wikipedia's backend work.  So for those who follow this page but not the drama pages, let me say that &quot;discretionary sanctions&quot; means that people who are NOT YOU have previously screwed up in a big way on those articles, and admins may be in a &quot;shoot first, and ask questions later&quot; mode.  It's meant to be fair warning about problems created by other people, and getting a &quot;warning&quot; about other people's problems really, truly doesn't say anything about you.

And, in the spirit of scaring off as few folks as possible, if you see a new editor fix a typo or slightly change a sentence in a sanctioned article, please don't warn them off.  Tracking warnings issued over uncontroversial changes creates pointless and wasteful bureaucracy as well as discouraging editors.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 15:31, 20 April 2018 (UTC)

Sociological and cultural aspects
Per , we have Sociological and cultural aspects ...  Sociological and cultural aspects of autism contains info about every condition on the autism spectrum, and is linked from FAs autism, Asperger syndrome and others. Sociological and cultural aspects of Tourette syndrome covers the media fascination and sensationalism that goes along with (FA) TS.  We have others.  They work well to explore the non-medical aspects of the conditions, summarized back to the main article with .  Like the autism spectrum, with Lewy bodies and synucleinopathies, we have overlapping conditions in the Lewy body dementias (LBD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), along with Parkinson's disease (PD).  The terminology is so dreadful, that when I started working up dementia with Lewy bodies, I was amazed to find that we did not even have articles on LBD or PDD, our PD article (another FA) doesn't even mention PDD, and that the DLB article was quite confused, mixing text about LBD into DLB.  So ...  Now that I have worked up dementia with Lewy bodies, I created a Sociological and cultural aspects of Lewy body dementia sub-article, because the DLB article is already 7,000 words.   And it promptly was tagged with a merge proposal, to take it back to one of the main articles (when it applies to four articles, spectrum style).  Could people please have a look at  for discussion of the merge proposal?  I laid out the reason for the sub-article there, but the editor who suggested the merge isn't convinced.

Wikipedia Translatathon April 2018 in NYC


I know this is late notice of the event, but I am sharing information rather than seeking any particular response or engagement.

LaGuardia Community College is hosting an  tomorrow and Friday, 26-27 April 2018. The context is that LaGuardia is the most linguistically diverse school in NYC and the world because it actively seeks to enroll students of diverse backgrounds from NYC's already diverse population. This school and its various faculty and staff have engaged in Wikipedia programs since perhaps 2010.  has some information about their projects, which include participation in the  and student and faculty engagement in various public events which  has presented.

 I would like for you to be aware of this event because you name yourselves as coordinators for the . The LaGuardia nursing program, which with the rest of the school is part of the City University of New York system, is one of this event's presenters. I am recommending the translation of the leads of medical articles as one of the program activities. There have been other casual translation events in NYC in the past. This is the first event in NYC which we have actually called a &quot;translatathon&quot; and where we have featured the leads of these medical articles as ideal to translate.

For the rest of WikiProject Medicine, I would like to share the story of this event as an example of innovative outreach which would not be possible without a community base of editors who develop medical content. For other languages Wikipedia is often the only available source of health information, as equivalents of the NHS, CDC, and NIH do not exist for other languages, and the United Nations and World Health Organization only operate in a few languages. The idea of bringing health information into other languages has been an inspiring goal.

For this particular event we are assembling undergraduate students, including many 18-19 year olds for whom English is not their native language, and we have some faculty from the nursing program present to coach them on editing. This is a modest event, and includes anyone who wants to translate anything and not just medical content. For the medical content though, the basis is what is in English Wikipedia, which is the best free information which anyone in the world has to offer. Thanks to everyone here who develops the quality of this content.  Blue Rasberry (talk) 14:22, 25 April 2018 (UTC)

 Parkinsonism was an improvement over what is typically seen with classroom editing projects; I was able to save four sentences.  And, honestly, the article was a wreck before the student edited, so they at least chose a good target (which is rare), and did have some grasp of MEDRS sourcing (used mostly secondary reviews).  But I did have to delete a lot of what they added because it was either poorly sourced, written in unencyclopedic tone, or didn't belong in that article, rather was already covered at Parkinson's disease, where it did belong.  Still, much better than what we usually find from student editing, so I commend  and hope they will pass that on the prof.  The situation at ADHD was more frustrating.  I tried to engage the student to explain sourcing, but they were having none of it, and none of their content was salvageable. SandyGeorgia (Talk)  23:42, 23 April 2018 (UTC)

 Well, it's what the CDC says, and I had it all, so not sure why you say it's over the top.  And I added it to the Side effects section-- how else would I better integrate it? Also, 1 out of 6 is a real number.  And this sore arm was not like a typical vaccine sore arm, so it seems to me that the CDC has it right.As a result, you are likely to have temporary side effects from getting the shots. The side effects may affect your ability to do normal daily activities for 2 to 3 days. Most people got a sore arm with mild or moderate pain after getting Shingrix, and some also had redness and swelling where they got the shot. Some people felt tired, had muscle pain, a headache, shivering, fever, stomach pain, or nausea. About 1 out of 6 people who got Shingrix experienced side effects that prevented them from doing regular activities.  Symptoms went away on their own in about 2 to 3 days. Side effects were more common in younger people.  Feel free to also add the NHS, though.

I just reviewed the new article Antipsychotic switching. I'm wondering what others think of the appropriateness of the article topic. It seems instructive in nature and may be best suited as a section in an article on antipsychotics. Natureium (talk) 02:25, 28 April 2018 (UTC)
I think the central concept, of &quot;switching&quot; is not sufficiently widely sourced so the article shouldn't exist. Some material may be salvageable to be merged elsewhere. Alexbrn (talk) 05:38, 28 April 2018 (UTC)

Silent treatment

what should we do with this.  it was a cesspool of bad content sourced to pop-psychology crap citations. Jytdog (talk) 04:54, 27 April 2018 (UTC)

Not by way of an answer - just to note that i've made some changes to the page.--Iztwoz (talk) 05:59, 27 April 2018 (UTC)
Refusing to speak to someone is not a medical subject.  The origin of the name (but not the behavior) is in the way that some (Western, mostly English-speaking) prisons treated their inmates.  None of that sounds like this group.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 15:22, 27 April 2018 (UTC)
The version before i edited it down was all full of pop-psych crap, see [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Silent_treatment&amp;oldid=834471073 here]. 
I struggle with the perspective that psychology content is completely outside of what we do in WP:MED but please hear me when i say that i have not thought carefully about where the the not-MED line is. Jytdog (talk) 15:27, 27 April 2018 (UTC)
If you're not sure where MEDRS stops and psychology begins maybe don't edit articles where the line isn't clear to you. I don't agree with some of your edits on Silent Treatment and am wondering whether to  make changes or not. Everything human beings do impacts their physiologies so its understandable that the line separating behaviour and health related articles is blurred. However, this is primarily an article about behavior not physical health so I don't think MEDRS applies. I also wonder if Silent Treatment is a clinical term; if not we don't necessarily need research papers to describe it.(Littleolive oil (talk) 15:57, 27 April 2018 (UTC))
I like it when people say that they don't know everything. 
That seemed like an aggressive purge (e.g., blanking the paragraph that says it's a common tactic by bullies in the workplace), but looking at a few sources, I'm thinking that this might be a good candidate for a merge/redirect (as might several others).  There are so many different terms for the same basic behavior.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 20:59, 29 April 2018 (UTC)
I had the same thought, that there is a bunch of merging that could be done. maybe we would end up with enough sources by the end of that. Jytdog (talk) 05:02, 1 May 2018 (UTC)

Adenoid vs Pharyngeal tonsil

Hello, as I mentioned , that text books said &quot;adenoids are a symptomatic pathological hypertrophy of the nasopharyngeal tonsil. That in presence of certain predisposing factors (like allergy, environmental pollution..etc), abnormal hypertrophy of the nasopharyngeal tonsil occurs and normal physiological regression is slowed down (nasopharyngeal tonsil normally starts to diminish in size at the age of 7-8 years), and the hypertrophy condition here called adenoids&quot;. So if there's no objection I'll move the article from Adenoid to Pharyngeal tonsil? --Alaa  :)..! 11:35, 2 May 2018 (UTC)

I think a List of journals accused of being a predatory open access publisher will be a good article. Before it goes live we can create a draft. Thoughts? QuackGuru (talk) 16:35, 15 April 2018 (UTC)
*Bad idea. 1/ Will be an enormous list. Beall had over 1000 entries on his list. 2/ Near impossible to maintain. 3/ Magnet for edit warring between supporters and opponents of these journals. Note: Most of the entries in the above list (which is copied from  were placed in that cat by me, before giving up). --Randykitty (talk) 22:35, 15 April 2018 (UTC)
**I like a challenge. QuackGuru (talk) 22:38, 15 April 2018 (UTC)
* This would be a huge undertaking. I have no strong feeling for or against, but if you need help I'm in. SEMMENDINGER (talk) 13:14, 17 April 2018 (UTC)
**I'm not going to start a draft. I don't know all the sources to cite. If someone else creates it then I will pitch in. Someone who is familiar with the topic can provide sources here. QuackGuru (talk) 14:44, 17 April 2018 (UTC)
* Neutral. I think we need very clear inclusion criteria, one of which should ideally be a secondary source that claims a publication is predatory. I think there is a lot to be said for maintaining such a list, if  is game. (Conflict of interest: I get spammed on an almost daily basis by predatory publishers wanting me to &quot;submit my research&quot; to them. All because my email address is on Pubmed.) JFW | T@lk 18:30, 17 April 2018 (UTC)
**I know very little about this topic. I will wait for sources and wait for others to start the draft. We don't need a source that claims a publication *is* predatory. There could be a source that claims a publication maybe a predatory or potentially or other similar words. In other words, we can follow each source accurately and include supported weasel words such as *possible* predatory. QuackGuru (talk) 20:18, 17 April 2018 (UTC)
*Starting with Beall's list as a reference seems reasonable. Just make sure every item is referenced. One could group them alphabetically. We have larger lists than this. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 10:20, 18 April 2018 (UTC)
* This is a bad idea. It refers to Beall's list which has been challenged and withdrawn. This list will be out-dated, inaccurate and hedged with weaselly words like &quot;accused&quot;, &quot;potential&quot;.  Yes, those of us who are in academia get invitations all the time to publish in &quot;new&quot; journals and would not aim for this or usually dream of citing them in WP reviews.  But occasionally a relevant source may end up in one of them.  For instance, World Journal of Gastroenterology has had mistakes along the way but now has an adequate review process and a reasonable impact factor in the top half of Gastro journals.  Maybe we should just list journals with citation indices &lt; 1 (or 2 or 20) as Potential low impact journals.Jrfw51 (talk) 12:57, 18 April 2018 (UTC)
** Including supported weasel words will make it accurate. We can also include a list of journals with a zero impact factor in a separate section. The impact factor for World Journal of Gastroenterology has increased. I'm not sure if this should be included in the list for a new article. QuackGuru (talk) 13:19, 18 April 2018 (UTC)
* For transparency, Jytdog has [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine&amp;diff=836963495&amp;oldid=836963072&amp;diffmode=source removed] a comment that strongly opposes this idea.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 15:29, 18 April 2018 (UTC)
** I removed a comment that is or is very close to a BLP violation.  That they oppose or support is not the issue. Jytdog (talk) 17:05, 18 April 2018 (UTC)
* fwiw i oppose this approach to the issue. i think list articles are generally a waste of time. Jytdog (talk) 17:05, 18 April 2018 (UTC)
Please provide sources below. Thank you. QuackGuru (talk) 13:19, 18 April 2018 (UTC)
* Neutral - It could be a helpful list. My worry is that over time, if an editor or group of editors does not diligently keep it up-to-date, we might end up denigrating a &quot;reformed&quot; journal, as in the example Jrfw51 provided. On a related topic, if we decide to include impact factor, we should include a variety of journal citation metrics, not just the Impact Factor marketed by Clarivate Analytics.   - Mark D Worthen PsyD (talk) 21:26, 19 April 2018 (UTC)
*In general, this is a bad idea. The list would feature thousands of entries, if not more. The best way to do this is to add links to those lists in predatory journal/predatory publishing. Headbomb {t ·  ·  · } 22:47, 19 April 2018 (UTC)
*Per Headbomb, Randykitty, and others—we shouldn't be trying to place ourselves in the position of creating and curating a list of predatory publishers and journals.  While such lists are useful and valuable resources, they're out of scope for Wikipedia's mission.  Keeping such a list complete and up to date in perpetuity isn't something we can reliably and robustly do with Wikipedia's general volunteer labor pool, and presenting such a list that is incomplete and out of date does a disservice to our readers.  Wikipedia can and should link appropriately to respected outside resources (through external links sections and inline references) on this topic, but we shouldn't try to become the last word ourselves. TenOfAllTrades(talk) 14:01, 20 April 2018 (UTC)
*Agree with  and others. Bondegezou (talk) 14:54, 20 April 2018 (UTC)
*That being said, a Wikipedia-space worklist to make sure those aren't used in our articles for referencing things beyond  would be entirely fine. Headbomb {t ·  ·  · } 16:05, 20 April 2018 (UTC)
**I agree.  An 'internal' list of useful resources for identifying predatory publishers would be quite handy to have.  Lists of publishers and individual journals would be, again, subject to concerns regarding completeness and curation, but editors – as opposed to readers – are much better positioned to understand the limitations of a work-in-progress crib sheet.  Such a page might also be used retain and consolidate links to historical discussions on Wikipedia (on article talk pages and on noticeboards like WT:MED, WP:FTN, WP:RSN, etc.) about particular publishers/journals to help reduce the need to 'reinvent the wheel' when questions about a particular source arise....  TenOfAllTrades(talk) 17:43, 20 April 2018 (UTC)
 I like this idea. On a couple of occasions I've had some citation edits reverted because the next editor knew the journal/book I was citing was unreliable for one reason or another - something I wouldn't have known without previous knowledge or a hard lit search. It would be a nice resource to check before including a journal/publisher/etc. It would also be a daunting task though...there's been hundreds of citations I've come across (usually through Google Books) that are just horrible and I couldn't imagine the process it would require to round those all up in a Wiki page. SEMMENDINGER (talk) 16:14, 23 April 2018 (UTC)
Well... It's great when folks can collaborate together like that, but I also hope that you'd think about whether the other person is correct.  Over the years, I've had editors tell me that journals are bad because you have to buy the article, because it's not written in English, because it's not in a particular database, because it's  is only the median for its field (most editors don't understand how low typical impact factors are, especially for specialized journals) – even because the editor-in-chief wasn't a successful businessman.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 15:18, 24 April 2018 (UTC)
See  at TWL. Headbomb {t ·  ·  · } 12:38, 24 April 2018 (UTC)
*Frankly, I think the main problem here may be that we need to define what qualifies as an &quot;accusation&quot;. Does it just have to be some random blogger calling a journal predatory for us to list it on our hypothetical list of such journals? What kind of sources would be used to decide whether a journal should be listed or not? This is aside from the other issues with such a list already mentioned above.

Hans Asperger and the Nazis

A paper recently published in Molecular Autism (full text [https://molecularautism.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13229-018-0208-6 here]) has claimed that, in Nazi Germany, Hans Asperger &quot;joined several organizations affiliated with the NSDAP (although not the Nazi party itself), publicly legitimized race hygiene policies including forced sterilizations and, on several occasions, actively cooperated with the child ‘euthanasia’ program.&quot; It has gotten a lot of media attention and I wanted to see if other editors think it is fairly incorporated into the current article on Asperger himself. Every morning (there's a halo...) 21:06, 1 May 2018 (UTC)
(not an easy article) however your edit[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hans_Asperger&amp;diff=838565314&amp;oldid=838017099] seems consistent w/ source--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 11:27, 2 May 2018 (UTC)
Oppose — Per rationale on that talk page. Carl Fredrik talk 11:32, 2 May 2018 (UTC)
This has been all over the news recently; I'm surprised that there hasn't been even more effort to expand upon possible Nazi ties.  Looking at the article's talk page, I see that it's almost the only thing that readers and editors have posted about for years.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:14, 3 May 2018 (UTC)

Greetings! I've been combing through stale drafts, and happened upon one . Wikipedia already has an article over this topic, at Pes anserine bursitis.

HTML errors in medicine-related articles

I'm going through , and I've found a few high-priority HTML errors in articles tagged by this WikiProject.  The , and any page with an error may display strangely.

What's needed right now is for someone to click these links and compare the side-by-side preview of the two parsers.  If the &quot;New&quot; page looks okay, then something's maybe technically wrong with the HTML, but there's no immediate worry.  If that column looks wrong, then it should be fixed.  

The first list is all &quot;deletable table&quot; errors.  If you want to know more about how to fix these pages, then see .  Taking the first link as an example, there is highlighting in the wikitext that shows where the lint error is; it's in the
I
section.  The cause is probably the bad wikitext code at the end of the previous section, which currently ends with |-}.  In the current parser, this error makes the H and I tables be connected; in the upcoming parser, it will make them separate but the
I
section heading will still be misplaced.  It should be an easy fix.

Castleman disease rewrite

Hi everyone, thanks in advance for any help, it is much appreciated! Full disclosure about a potential COI, I am a medical student working for the non-profit Castleman Disease Collaborative Network.

I have been working to rewrite the page for Castleman disease. When I was considering my approach to rewriting the page I figured I would have to include 3 subcategories for each heading reflecting the 3 commonly accepted subtypes of the disease (Unicentric Castleman disease, HHV-8-associated multicentric Castleman disease, idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease). I thought that would be cumbersome and it would be better to have a separate page for each subtype instead. My feeling (which I believe reflects that of experts in the rather small field) is that these 3 diseases likely differ enough in pathogenesis, symptoms, treatment, and prognosis that they are best thought of independently. Recently published high impact articles tend to focus on a single subtype rather than all 3.

I have drafted all 3 articles:







I am new to wikipedia and I was hoping to get feedback on:

1) Whether my approach with 3 articles makes sense

2) General feedback on my drafts, is the content appropriate? is the tone correct? Do I have enough sources?

3) What is the fastest way to get these articles up? Should I wait for the formal review process as I am currently doing?

4) Is my COI significant, I tried to be as unbiased as possible. I did mention the CDCN in the article as I feel it is a notable and valuable resource, but I understand if my COI might be concerning.

Thank you so much for any feedback!--CDK55 (talk) 20:15, 3 May 2018 (UTC)  — Preceding  comment added by CDK55 (talk • ) 20:12, 3 May 2018 (UTC) 

For rare diseases, it is normal and appropriate to mention the largest non-profit organization in the article.
I started an infobox at the top of the .  If you open the page in the visual editor, and click on it, then you can get a list of things you can add (like ICD-10 codes and OMIM numbers).  Including an infobox is typical in this kind of article, but if you don't like it, then you can remove it.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 21:32, 3 May 2018 (UTC)

Thanks so much for the help! I'll try add an infobox to the other pages and expand on the one you added to the UCD page. CDK55 (talk) 13:49, 4 May 2018 (UTC)

Ivanhoe and medical marketing

We have just been through a bit of a slog at  about Greg J. Marchand (about to be deleted), an ob/gyn who got his MD at Spartan Health Sciences University, practices laparoscopic surgery, and likes to go after &quot;world records&quot; for removing biggest X and then put out press releases about them.

Nobody bought this argument, but it was such a clear (and egregious) example that I thought it worth posting at INDY, and did so , and have made [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AIdentifying_and_using_independent_sources&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=839788826&amp;oldid=839787705 a bold edit] to INDY to explicitly address syndicated stories in discussions of notability and weight.

But what I wanted to discuss here was Ivanhoe Broadcast News (I just nominated that for speedy as it is mostly a copy/paste from their website) which apparently creates pieces about &quot;breakthroughs in medicine&quot;  and sells them to other news organizations.  I don't know much about them.  If they are doing legit news, or are really oriented toward doing PR, or if they don't care what subjects want and will just do anything if they think they can sell it.  I can say that their piece on Marchand was pretty much a mouthpiece, and not at all independent journalism. ([https://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/health/2017/10/30/mesa-doctor-faces-criticism-using-controversial-surgical-technique/799237001/ Here] is the one piece i found with INDY reporting on Marchand; the Ivanhoe syndicated pieces  - for example [https://www.ksat.com/news/video-in-bag-morcellation-removes-tumor-safely this], are nothing like that.)

Anyway, I wanted to post here to see if anybody is aware of Ivanhoe. ?? Their stuff is not MEDRS of course but there is lots of non-biomedical content we all deal with. Is anybody familiar with them? Jytdog (talk) 18:10, 5 May 2018 (UTC)

Dean Edell, the syndicated multimedia medical reporter who calls himself &quot;America's Doctor,&quot; has built a thriving business dispensing news and advice about everything from cancer treatments to erectile dysfunction. What followers of his &quot;Medical Journal&quot; on KGO Channel 7 may not realize is that the reporting he takes credit for on the air often is not his own.

There is nothing about Print syndication that makes it inherently non-independent.  
However, WP:N has said (for years and years) that when the same story is republished in a bunch of different media outlets, that's still exactly one (1) story.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 20:33, 5 May 2018 (UTC)

 Unfortunately, the wording of   is liable to ambiguous interpretation (the problem is in the &quot;or&quot;). We know it means that when Wendy Chioji of Ivanhoe Media writes a story and gives it to multiple news stations, that counts for only one source for the purpose of satisfying GNG. But you only have to look at the socks voting &quot;keep&quot; at  to realise that the UPEs will read our policy as stating that each news station counts as a separate independent source becaus they are not the same organisation. 
 Examples: 
* ;
* ;
* 
 and so on. That's the sort of persuasive crap that leads to AfDs ending in &quot;no consensus to delete&quot;, because not even the closers pay enough attention to the point that &quot;1 story = 1 source for GNG&quot;. It's time you spruced up that policy again,   --RexxS (talk) 20:59, 5 May 2018 (UTC)
The rule is explained in , but .  If it's a pervasive and good-faith problem (e.g., not just a bunch of socks at AFD), then it might be worth expanding. WhatamIdoing (talk) 22:01, 5 May 2018 (UTC)
 The snag with the current system is that you have to prove that the comments are coming from socks before their deceptive comments can be exposed for what they are. Most of the time we just don't know whether the SPAs are socks or not. I shudder to think how many AfDs may have given free passes to UPEs and their sockfarms because the nominator lacked Jytdog's insight and tenacity. My vote is for spelling the guidance out clearly in GNG. Something like  --RexxS (talk) 23:45, 5 May 2018 (UTC)
I spent a little while looking into Ivanhoe.  It appears that they're basically a standard news media organization.  It's sort of freelancing on a larger scale:  they write stories, and they sell stories to outlets.  It's licensing rules are different from (i.e., worse than) the Associated Press's, but it's not necessarily different in kind.  Since they are profitable, I assume that they're talking to media outlets about the kinds of content that will get bought, but I also assume that their independence is approximately the same as every other newsroom:  they get jillions of press releases whether they want them or not, they are under a lot of time/productivity pressure, and they are more skilled than the average person at noticing when someone's trying to twist the facts.
I think that there may be some confusion of &quot;hard-hitting&quot; with &quot;independent&quot;.  Glowing puff pieces can be absolutely independent, just like critical pieces can be wildly non-independent (see:  every attack ad ever published during a political campaign).  You can build a journalistic career on writing positive stories, without compromising your independence.  There's a market for good/hopeful news, especially for health content.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 22:05, 5 May 2018 (UTC)
Thanks for your thoughts on Invanhoe, WAID.  The whole point of journalistic independence is that we look for them to actually look into stuff and report what they find.  A &quot;piece&quot; that is just a puff piece providing a mouthpiece for the subject is not independent, in the spirit of what we are looking for. This is a much murkier ball of wax, I know... Jytdog (talk) 23:50, 5 May 2018 (UTC)
No, that's not what journalistic independence means.  Journalistic independence does not mean that you get a complete or accurate story.  It means that you get a story that was published because the journalists (e.g., not the advertisers or the government) wanted to publish it. 
This is why journalistic independence is so valuable for determining notability:  the decision to publish a story on X tells us that someone with no vested interest in X thought that X was important enough to bring X to the attention of the world at large.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 00:27, 6 May 2018 (UTC)

* happy to have dialogue but I intended this thread to be about Ivanhoe as source of medical &quot;news&quot;.  My sense is we should avoid it like the plague. 
Folks have seemed tetchy lately, about what is &quot;in-scope&quot; here on this talk page.  The general issues should (in my view) be discussed at the INDY talk page,  as they are not specific to MED. If folks agree there, it might well be worth adding a clarification about syndidated stories at N, BIO, CORP, etc. but those are discussions for those guidelines/essays.... Jytdog (talk) 22:06, 5 May 2018 (UTC)
I think that Ivanhoe is probably every bit as good a source of medical news as your typical local newspaper.  
I am curious where you draw the line between &quot;medical news&quot; and information that needs to meet MEDRS standards for biomedical content.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 00:09, 6 May 2018 (UTC)
So something like Marchand getting a guinness world record would be Society and Culture. something about first X would be history (although popular media is generally bad for that).  Perhaps for public controversy. That's not a surprising answer is it? Jytdog (talk) 00:53, 6 May 2018 (UTC)
I think that Ivanhoe is a reliable source for that kind of news.
I also think that news stories (in any typical news media) that are initiated through press releases and PR campaigns are reliable for that kind of news, too.  What we need from a source for WP:V is a reason to think that the facts are accurate; a typical news story provides us with that.  What we need from a source for WP:N is their &quot;gatekeeper&quot; function, to determine what deserves their readers' attention; the fact that they can't (and won't) run a story on every single press release provides us with that.
The main problem with the Marchand stuff isn't the &quot;wow, modern medicine is so amazing&quot; aspect of the stories.  It's just that there's not much to say about him.  Stripped of puffery, trivia, and stuff pulled from self-published and non-independent sources, the article would probably be a  – a few sentences that would say little more than &quot;He did this, and he was criticized for it&quot;.

Frontier journals

https://www.frontiersin.org/

What are peoples thoughts on these? They have been described as predatory [https://predatoryjournals.com/publishers/ here].

Doc James (talk ·  · ) 03:30, 28 March 2018 (UTC)
For those interested in some background that led to this question, I recommend seeing my talk page, wherein  and I discussed this matter. It also includes my rationale for at least selectively using Frontiers journals as citations to articles so long as the article or study being cited is otherwise acceptable, as well as my stated concerns about considering Frontiers Media to be a predatory publisher. As I said in the aforementioned talk page discussion, I agree that there appear to be some problems with Frontiers journals, but I would nonetheless consider it a problematic publisher (like with Hindawi Publishing Corporation) rather a predatory one. This conclusion was primarily based on a review of sources mentioning or otherwise discussing the status of Frontiers journals as predatory, which I deemed mixed and overall inconclusive. Links to those sources can be found on my talk page, as well.I would also like to note , whose consensus seemed likewise inconclusive but which appears to accept selective usage so long as that which is being cited is otherwise acceptable. If necessary, I would also support including a  template along with any such citation, though I personally do not think that should be necessary. ―Nøkkenbuer (talk • ) 04:26, 28 March 2018 (UTC)
at the very least questionable[https://predatoryjournals.com/publishers/] and [https://www.nature.com/news/backlash-after-frontiers-journals-added-to-list-of-questionable-publishers-1.18639]--Ozzie10aaaa (talk) 13:05, 28 March 2018 (UTC)
Yes it depends on the claim. Any exceptional claim (e.g. of treatment efficacy) which appears only in a Frontiers journal is a huge , and as for the AIDS denialism &amp;c. stuff they've run .... In general anything worth including that appears in a Frontiers journal will almost certainly be source-able to something more conspicuously reputable. Same goes for Hindawi journals, PLOS ONE, etc. Most of the times we see these sources being raised from  editors banging an altmed drum. Alexbrn (talk) 13:22, 28 March 2018 (UTC)

*I definitely don't consider Frontiers journals to be predatory -- I have read dozens if not hundreds of useful articles in them. However, the fact that something is published in a Frontiers journal should not imply that it should be treated as a reliable source. They are better than things like Medical Hypotheses, but reliability is not their primary goal. Looie496 (talk) 15:24, 28 March 2018 (UTC)
We should lean on the side of caution  [http://neuroconscience.com/2016/01/15/is-frontiers-in-trouble/index.html if as reported] we shold error on the right side. They are by far not alone ...as there are thousands  of other publishers we can use instead. Editors are expected to uphold the integrity of Wikipedia....thus simply avoid questionable sources if we want to look credible.--Moxy (talk) 23:50, 28 March 2018 (UTC)

This was just added based on Frontier journal: &quot;In vitro and in vivo studies found that methadone significantly inhibited the growth of human lung cancer cells&quot;[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Methadone&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=833009481&amp;diffmode=source]
An extraordinary claim IMO. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 16:11, 29 March 2018 (UTC)
Yup, and it's wacky articles like this that exemplify why Frontiers journals need to be treated with extreme caution. Alexbrn (talk) 16:19, 29 March 2018 (UTC)
I actually think this Frontiers article is quite good, but the edit to the methadone article does not accurately reflect what it says. The Frontiers article notes that methadone has shown anti-tumor activity in preclinical studies, which is perfectly true; it also notes that these effects have not been tested at the clinical level. Looie496 (talk) 00:26, 1 April 2018 (UTC)
The specific subject of methadone as antineoplastic is reviewed in Int J Cancer at . No need to use the primary source. More generally though, it's worth restating that no source is reliable (or unreliable) for all statements: one can cite an issue of Mad Magazine for a statement describing the cover of that particular issue. LeadSongDog come howl! 18:05, 4 April 2018 (UTC)
It appears, at least to me, that the consensus (or lack thereof) on generally citing Frontiers journals has thus far remained the same as I described above. This discussion originated from my citation of two specific review articles, namely the following two: [https://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/neuro.01.1.1.006.2007/abstract 1] and [https://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2010.00224/abstract 2]. Does anyone have any opinion on these two particular sources, especially as worthwhile additions to the Asperger syndrome, Autism, Autism spectrum, or other such article? I originally included it as another theory in Asperger syndrome § Mechanism and its reversion is what led to this. If any of you would like more context, I recommend reading . Everything, including relevant diffs, is documented therein. ―Nøkkenbuer (talk • ) 08:48, 9 April 2018 (UTC)
Yeah, both URLs you give caused my browser to raise a security alert - so I wouldn't include those links! Alexbrn (talk) 09:06, 9 April 2018 (UTC)
It does for me, too, specifically SSL_ERROR_BAD_CERT_DOMAIN. This is because the certificate is not valid for the journal.frontiersin.org subdomain, only the www.frontiersin.org subdomain and the subdomain-free frontiersin.org. I have no clue why the website's certificate does not include the journal subdomain, even though it's just used as a hop to the www subdomain anyway (adding a temporary exception demonstrates as much). My guess is that someone misconfigured the certificate and nobody ever bothered to fix it. Regardless, the landing pages for each are as follows: [https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/neuro.01.1.1.006.2007/full 1] and [https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2010.00224/full 2]. I was trying to include the original articles, but forgot about the subdomain nonsense. My apologies for not linking them initially, ; it has been a long day for me.I might as well note that in  (which  had  to ), those bad subdomain links are only available (unavoidably) in the DOI parameter of the citations. The URLs I included were PDF copies from ResearchGate, namely [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kamila_Markram/publication/23449479_The_Intense_World_Syndrome_-_an_Alternative_Hypothesis_for_Autism/links/551180d10cf21209d528b0d3/The-Intense-World-Syndrome-an-Alternative-Hypothesis-for-Autism.pdf 1] and [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kamila_Markram/publication/49714733_The_Intense_World_Theory_-_A_Unifying_Theory_of_the_Neurobiology_of_Autism/links/551180d00cf24e9311ce6e3d/The-Intense-World-Theory-A-Unifying-Theory-of-the-Neurobiology-of-Autism.pdf 2]. ―Nøkkenbuer (talk • ) 09:31, 9 April 2018 (UTC)
So these sources are about the &quot;Intense World Syndrome&quot; which is the idea of a few researchers. The question is has this been picked up and discussed by decent secondary sources? If so, we can cite them; if not we ignore the topic as Wikipedia is meant to be a tertiary publication summarizing &quot;accepted knowledge&quot; (which is generally found only at the secondary level or deeper). Alexbrn (talk) 10:50, 9 April 2018 (UTC)
Actually, I think that might be a secondary source.  It's not labeled as a review article, which is a particular type of secondary source, but it synthesizes previous work into a coherent whole.  Putting together puzzle pieces is pretty much the definition of secondary.  (Maybe you meant that this idea needed to be picked up by someone ?)  WhatamIdoing (talk) 23:54, 9 April 2018 (UTC)
Well, I'm not sure what content the OP want to source, but if it's about the novel &quot;hypothesis&quot; of Intense World Syndrome so far as I can see  these works are primary for that hypothesis. But yes coverage would need to be independent. Alexbrn (talk) 06:27, 10 April 2018 (UTC)
Yes, , I specifically want to include this &quot;intense world&quot; theory because I believe it is a  and appropriate addition to Asperger syndrome § Mechanism. I was simply stating the theory in a brief paragraph as a significant hypothesis for the neurological mechanism(s) behind Asperger syndrome and the autism spectrum alongside the others. The theory has been mentioned, discussed, or otherwise cited by hundreds of papers, [https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=15040611151112301409 if Google Scholar] [https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=13085685404239729685 is any estimate]; and it has received significant media coverage from  (some of which are listed on ). I therefore think a paragraph on the theory is .What specifically would constitute sufficient &quot;independent coverage&quot; of this theory (or these specific papers) in your opinion? For example, do you basically just mean a review article about this theory and whatever research may have occurred since its publication by those  (as  stated)? Or do you mean it in some other way? I apologize if my inexperience is showing; although I have been editing Wikipedia for years, I am still new to adding and editing medical content. ―Nøkkenbuer (talk • ) 15:36, 19 April 2018 (UTC)
According to the two articles, , they are indeed both labeled as review articles. I am talking about these two links specifically: [https://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/neuro.01.1.1.006.2007/abstract 1] and [https://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2010.00224/abstract 2]. Am I misunderstanding something here? Are they not technically review articles? I agree that they are both secondary sources, though I understand 's point that the &quot;intense world&quot; theory is primary to these papers and their authors. From what I can tell, if there is any basis for excluding these two particular sources, it appears to be on them not being secondary for the theory itself, despite otherwise satisfying . Perhaps that is what you meant? That they are not review articles for the theory itself, since the papers are the primary source for them? ―Nøkkenbuer (talk • ) 15:36, 19 April 2018 (UTC)
Usually – but not always, and it's not a requirement – journals submit metadata to PubMed about their articles, to identify things such as whether they're review articles.  The PubMed records contain no such data for these papers.  That's not proof that it's not a review article, but it does mean that the papers are excluded from search results (at PubMed) that are limited to review articles.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 17:24, 19 April 2018 (UTC)
Thanks for the explanation, . I will be sure to keep that in mind in the future. I also appreciate the  to document the potential notability of this &quot;intense world&quot; theory. Given that you mentioned , however, do you think that it may be more prudent in this case to focus on developing a separate article about this before including it in a section like Asperger syndrome § Mechanism (which was the original edit)? Or should the focus—at least, at this time—remain with including it somewhere within an appropriate Wikipedia article, assuming it should be included at all? Perhaps someday this &quot;intense world&quot; theory will have its own article, anyway, but I am not sure if that day should be anytime soon. ―Nøkkenbuer (talk • ) 07:33, 10 May 2018 (UTC)
I think that this subject meets or exceeds the minimum requirement for having a stand-alone article about just IWS.  However, considering everything, I think that you may have an easier time getting it mentioned (perhaps only briefly) in some article(s) first, and later creating the article specifically about that theory.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 15:46, 10 May 2018 (UTC)
