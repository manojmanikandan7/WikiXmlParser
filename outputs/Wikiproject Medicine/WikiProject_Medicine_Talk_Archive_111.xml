 Need some GA reviewers 
ile:Malaria.jpg|thumb|100 px|Malaria
I don't know how many folks are watching ikipedia:WikiProject Medicine/Article alerts these days, so I thought I'd say that the following GA nominations might be interesting to some editors here:

* rugada syndrome nominated by ser:PeaBrainC|PeaBrainC
* arasitism nominated by ser:Chiswick Chap|Chiswick Chap
* pinocerebellar ataxia type 1 nominated by ser:Cincotta1|Cincotta1
* lasmodium nominated by ser:Ajpolino|Ajpolino
* erebellar theory of dyslexia nominated by ser:AlexADP|AlexADP

You can find more (especially articles on different species) at P:GAN#BIO.  If you've never reviewed an article before, then it's pretty straightforward.  ikipedia:Good article nominations/Instructions#Reviewing will lead you through the process step-by-step, but the overall idea is that you check the article against the ikipedia:Good article criteria, and either &quot;pass&quot; or &quot;fail&quot; it on (P:GANOT|only) that basis.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:35, 6 April 2018 (UTC)

 2003 Union for Reform Judaism resolution on the medicinal use of marijuana 

Project members are invited to help improve the newly created 003 Union for Reform Judaism resolution on the medicinal use of marijuana. By the way, P:420, a campaign to create and improve cannabis-related content, runs during the month of April. You're more than welcome to help out, if interested. Thanks! ---ser:Another Believer|Another Believer (ser talk:Another Believer|Talk) 05:01, 6 April 2018 (UTC)
A whole article on one resolution from 2003? I doubt it's sufficiently notable for a standalone article. As for our our cannabis content - in general it's in pretty bad shape still: this list[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine/Archive_44#Where_does_work_stand?] from |SandyGeorgia is still pertinent. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 15:16, 6 April 2018 (UTC)
I share Alex's skepticism about notability.  It feels like a candidate for merging to annabis and Judaism.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 15:31, 6 April 2018 (UTC)
It passes GNG, so it can be kept -- though if no one lengthens the article it could still be merged if that is most convenient, without prejudice to future recreation and expansion.  A comparable article is atrimonial nullity trial reforms of Pope Francis.  We must be careful not to let majoritarianism, under guise of &quot;notability&quot;, turn into anti-Semitism. ser:Wnt|Wnt (ser talk:Wnt|talk) 23:50, 6 April 2018 (UTC)
I'm not convinced that it passes GNG.  I see no &quot;significant coverage&quot;.  The cited sources are mostly about something else and give only two or three sentences about the resolution.  They all basically repeat the same simple facts (which probably explains why the article is only five sentences long:  we can't verify anything else about it).  There's no indication of any significance other than a disputed claim to being &quot;first&quot;.  There's no analysis of why the resolution matters (assuming it does, which I begin to doubt), no explanation of any effects produced by the resolution, or anything else.  It's just &quot;Hey, this woman wanted them to pass a resolution on this topic, and they did, and they might have been the first religious 'body' (but definitely not the first religious 'organization') to do that.&quot;  
AFAICT, URJ has an annual meeting whose main purpose seems to be passing resolutions.  In 2003, they passed a dozen such resolutions.  Neither the current stub nor any of the cited sources give any explanation why anyone should care about this resolution, much less why this one is worth attention and not the one [https://urj.org/what-we-believe/resolutions/50th-anniversary-american-conference-cantors-acc congratulating the American Conference Of Cantors on their 50th anniversary], or their resolution in favor of [https://urj.org/what-we-believe/resolutions/resolution-stem-cell-research stem cell research].  We don't need an entire article to say &quot;They might have been the first (or second, or fourth) religious body to pass a resolution on this subject.&quot;  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 06:28, 8 April 2018 (UTC)
q|&quot;turn into anti-Semitism&quot; ← in what has been a bad week at T:MED, |Wnt tops it off with the most fucking stupid contribution of all! ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 06:36, 8 April 2018 (UTC)
I was not suggesting anyone here wanted to be anti-Semitic, but if we start deciding whether religious concepts and events are notable based on the proportional amount of publicity, we inevitably will end up with that result, regardless of initial intention, because there are fewer Jews and presumably fewer Jewish religious periodicals.  We should look only whether we have multiple sources to make an article, which is a fixed threshold, and should be a low one -- I would abolish that threshold were it possible to make an article without any way to learn about the topic.  I should also note that what any religion thinks about the use of medical marijuana, or any other therapy, is strictly a religious question, not a medical issue at all.  There are not, nor ever have been, any medical claims in that article. ser:Wnt|Wnt (ser talk:Wnt|talk) 13:50, 8 April 2018 (UTC)
The GNG requires more than multiple sources.  It requires:
* multiple – one|got that
* independent – one|got that
* secondary – ot sure  Maybe we have that, and maybe we don't.
* reliable sources – one|got that
* with significant coverage – ot done|missing that
The problem isn't getting two-sentence mentions in mainstream media.  The problem is that nobody – not the pro-cannabis people, not the Jewish people, not the anti-marijuana people – during the last decade and a half seems to have thought that this vote was worth writing 500 words about it.  We've got &quot;multiple&quot; sources.  What we don't have is any hope of getting past the P:PERMASTUB range or meeting the goals of P:WHYN.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 19:57, 8 April 2018 (UTC)

 Gaslighting 

Dear medical experts:

Re aslighting

A paragraph about self-help to combat the psychological effects of &quot;gaslighting&quot; has been added to the  above article. I'm not sure that it's appropriate. Can someone take a look?—ser:Anne Delong|Anne Delong (ser talk:Anne Delong|talk) 09:37, 9 April 2018 (UTC)
The citations in the paragraph added fail P:MEDRS. The medical literature does discuss gaslighting. However, I am struggling to find anything that meets MEDRS that is suitable as a replacement here. It would seem worth citing Gass &amp; Nichols (Contemp Fam Ther (1988) 10: 3. oi|10.1007/BF00922429) as a key early paper, but it doesn't help much in terms of treatment. There's a recent, non-systematic, kind-of [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0141076818763326 review by Davendralingam] (2018, oi|10.1177/0141076818763326) that may be of some use. ser:Bondegezou|Bondegezou (ser talk:Bondegezou|talk) 10:01, 9 April 2018 (UTC)
I've removed the passages, not because they fail P:MEDRS, but because they were either very poorly sourced according to P:RS or just simply unsourced. Medium is not an acceptable source, neither is lonerwolf.com — and that is for any statement. |Dbaechle, |Anne Delong — I have no problem with the message conveyed, but you need to use better sources. Aslo, be careful when saying things about psychological health, you then need to adhere to MEDRS. ser:CFCF|Carl Fredrikser talk:CFCF| talk 05:59, 10 April 2018 (UTC)
Thanks, ser:Bondegezou|Bondegezou and ser:CFCF|Carl Fredrik. I was worried about the sourcing, but since the information seemed to have been added in good faith, I wanted to check with more knowledgeable editors.—ser:Anne Delong|Anne Delong (ser talk:Anne Delong|talk) 12:02, 10 April 2018 (UTC)
Medium.com actually would be an acceptable source if the author meets P:SPS standards.  It is certainly no worse than Facebook posts or Twitter links.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 15:34, 10 April 2018 (UTC)
True, but in the presence of other better sources I think we should prefer them. I do not feel Medium is acceptable in this case, especially as it straddles invoking MEDRS — where SPS is even less acceptable, nigh on forbidden. ser:CFCF|Carl Fredrikser talk:CFCF| talk 20:39, 10 April 2018 (UTC)

Well, those diffs might contain about three times as many paragraphs as is warranted, but it's probably reasonable to consider it reliable for some of the claims made, e.g., &quot;This one paper suggested this as a problem, and that as a potential mitigation effort&quot;.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 04:35, 12 April 2018 (UTC)

Whether the article about the (US) National Rifle Association should state that they sponsor safety programs or certify firearm instructors does not seem even remotely like biomedical information.  Whether the safety programs produce safer behavior (their most famous likely doesn't) is not being discussed here.  The statement being made is purely about organizational activities, not about whether those activities meet their stated goals.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 21:36, 4 April 2018 (UTC)
 That turns out to be not the case. When the NRA baldly claim that they run safety programmes without further qualification, it gives the reader the impression that those safety programmes actually have a significant effect on safety - for which there is no evidence. It's called 'spin'. The misapplication of the label &quot;safety&quot; is the problem there, not the factual accuracy of these programmes' existence. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 16:23, 5 April 2018 (UTC)
 I'm not sure not getting shot in the head is a medical issue as such. ser:Johnbod|Johnbod (ser talk:Johnbod|talk) 17:54, 5 April 2018 (UTC)
Preventing (accidental and intentional) firearm injuries is a public health issue, but that's not really the point of the NRA article.  The point of that article is pretty much &quot;There's this org, which does lobbying and gives classes&quot;.  The proposed sentence t|&quot;The organization issues credentials and trains firearm instructors&quot;, OTOH, is unrelated to health.

Wikipedia voice in an article hat at ddie Eagle says it is a &quot;safety&quot; program. Can someone familiar with P:MEDRS please review this for compliance? pecial:Contributions/64.134.172.62|64.134.172.62 (ser talk:64.134.172.62|talk) 22:12, 11 April 2018 (UTC)
Eddie Eagle is a safety program.  The fact that it is a safety program does not mean that it is an effective program, but the fact that it is ineffective at improving safety does not magically transform it into some other kind of program.  It shouldn't be surprising that it's a failure; most ehavior-based safety programs are failures, and almost all one-off information sessions with children are doomed.  (Need proof?  Find the nearest parent and ask them how many years they spent saying things like &quot;Don't run around in busy parking lots&quot;.)  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 04:30, 12 April 2018 (UTC)
We agree with the merican Academy of Pediatrics and the review article that the ddie Eagle program is ineffective. My understanding of P:MEDRS is that we may no more say in Wikipedia voice that ddie Eagle is a &quot;firearms safety program for children,&quot; then we could for example describe apricot seeds as a cancer cure. What is your understanding? Better would be &quot;This article is about the NRA's firearm program for children.&quot; pecial:Contributions/50.233.97.130|50.233.97.130 (ser talk:50.233.97.130|talk) 22:29, 12 April 2018 (UTC)
Your metaphor fails:  the primary purpose of apricot seeds is making more apricot trees, not treating disease.  
A more apt comparison would be to something like the US FAA's old Air Transportation Oversight System safety program.  ATOS didn't work.  It was still a safety program.  It did not stop being a safety program even though everyone concluded (eventually) that it was ineffective.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:19, 13 April 2018 (UTC)
Like most of us WAID is subject to a cognitive bias in favour of the mature complex organism. Dawkins argued convincingly that the tree is just an elaborate means for the reproduction of the seed, or at a more basic level, the reproduction of its constituent he Selfish Gene|genes. However, the idea that the NRA is anything other than an elaborate sales organization rings false to most of the world. Even if Eddie had been effective as a user training program, its objective was still to sell more firearms to hit more targets. For those whose only interaction with firearms is in the role of potential targets, that does not seem like any kind of safety program.ser:LeadSongDog|LeadSongDog ser talk:LeadSongDog#top|come howl! 17:23, 18 April 2018 (UTC)

As a new page patroller, I don't think I've ever seen a new redirect page created with a WikiProject tagged on it. The only redirect tags I see are on pages that were once filled with content but moved to another page at some later time (rather than submit an AfD, for instance). Then the old page gets the tag for historical purposes (and it shows we've been there before). Tagging every single redirect just for the heck of it will add tens of thousands of pages to this project's article count, and I don't really see the positive of doing so. ser:Semmendinger|SEMMENDINGER (ser talk:Semmendinger|talk) 13:42, 13 April 2018 (UTC)

This is a side note about arbitration remedies:  Getting a notice about ikipedia:Discretionary sanctions|discretionary sanctions is scary for most editors, especially if you don't happen to be particularly familiar with Wikipedia's backend work.  So for those who follow this page but not the drama pages, let me say that &quot;discretionary sanctions&quot; means that people who are NOT YOU have previously screwed up in a big way on those articles, and admins may be in a &quot;shoot first, and ask questions later&quot; mode.  It's meant to be fair warning about problems created by other people, and getting a &quot;warning&quot; about other people's problems really, truly doesn't say anything about you.

And, in the spirit of scaring off as few folks as possible, if you see a new editor fix a typo or slightly change a sentence in a sanctioned article, please don't warn them off.  Tracking warnings issued over uncontroversial changes creates pointless and wasteful bureaucracy as well as discouraging editors.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 15:31, 20 April 2018 (UTC)

After new data harvests from various sources, about 11,500 PubMedCentral identifiers have been found which need to be added to existing citations in English Wikipedia articles. Each PMC identifier helps verifiability and the consultation of reliable sources: the open access version of an article, registered in PubMed, gets linked from the title of the citation and from the ID link next to a reen open access open lock (ile:Lock-green.svg|9px|link=|alt=Freely accessible|Freely accessible).

 Sociological and cultural aspects 
Per P:MEDMOS, we have Sociological and cultural aspects ... b ociological and cultural aspects of autism contains info about every condition on the autism spectrum, and is linked from FAs utism, sperger syndrome and others. ociological and cultural aspects of Tourette syndrome covers the media fascination and sensationalism that goes along with (FA) TS.  We have others.  They work well to explore the non-medical aspects of the conditions, summarized back to the main article with P:SS|summary style. b Like the autism spectrum, with Lewy bodies and ynucleinopathies, we have overlapping conditions in the ewy body dementias (LBD), ementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and arkinson's disease dementia (PDD), along with arkinson's disease (PD).  The terminology is so dreadful, that when I started working up ementia with Lewy bodies, I was amazed to find that we did not even have articles on LBD or PDD, our PD article (another FA) doesn't even mention PDD, and that the DLB article was quite confused, mixing text about LBD into DLB.  So ... b Now that I have worked up ementia with Lewy bodies, I created a ociological and cultural aspects of Lewy body dementia sub-article, because the DLB article is already 7,000 words.  b And it promptly was tagged with a merge proposal, to take it back to one of the main articles (when it applies to four articles, spectrum style).  Could people please have a look at alk:Lewy body dementia for discussion of the merge proposal?  I laid out the reason for the sub-article there, but the editor who suggested the merge isn't convinced. ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  02:21, 23 April 2018 (UTC)

 Wikipedia Translatathon April 2018 in NYC 

ile:LAGCC.png|thumb|right|aGuardia Community College
I know this is late notice of the event, but I am sharing information rather than seeking any particular response or engagement.

aGuardia Community College is hosting an ikipedia:LaGuardia Community College/Translatathon April 2018|April 2018 Wikipedia Translatathon tomorrow and Friday, 26-27 April 2018. The context is that LaGuardia is the most linguistically diverse school in NYC and the world because it actively seeks to enroll students of diverse backgrounds from NYC's already diverse population. This school and its various faculty and staff have engaged in Wikipedia programs since perhaps 2010. ikipedia:LaGuardia Community College has some information about their projects, which include participation in the P:Wikipedia Education Program and student and faculty engagement in various public events which P:Meetup/NYC|Wiki NYC has presented.

ing|Doc James|CFCF|Lucas559 I would like for you to be aware of this event because you name yourselves as coordinators for the P:TTF|Translation Task Force. The LaGuardia nursing program, which with the rest of the school is part of the ity University of New York system, is one of this event's presenters. I am recommending the translation of the leads of medical articles as one of the program activities. There have been other casual translation events in NYC in the past. This is the first event in NYC which we have actually called a &quot;translatathon&quot; and where we have featured the leads of these medical articles as ideal to translate.

For the rest of WikiProject Medicine, I would like to share the story of this event as an example of innovative outreach which would not be possible without a community base of editors who develop medical content. For other languages Wikipedia is often the only available source of health information, as equivalents of the NHS, CDC, and NIH do not exist for other languages, and the United Nations and World Health Organization only operate in a few languages. The idea of bringing health information into other languages has been an inspiring goal.

For this particular event we are assembling undergraduate students, including many 18-19 year olds for whom English is not their native language, and we have some faculty from the nursing program present to coach them on editing. This is a modest event, and includes anyone who wants to translate anything and not just medical content. For the medical content though, the basis is what is in English Wikipedia, which is the best free information which anyone in the world has to offer. Thanks to everyone here who develops the quality of this content. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 14:22, 25 April 2018 (UTC)

 arkinsonism was an improvement over what is typically seen with classroom editing projects; I was able to save four sentences.  And, honestly, the article was a wreck before the student edited, so they at least chose a good target (which is rare), and did have some grasp of MEDRS sourcing (used mostly secondary reviews).  But I did have to delete a lot of what they added because it was either poorly sourced, written in unencyclopedic tone, or didn't belong in that article, rather was already covered at arkinson's disease, where it did belong.  Still, much better than what we usually find from student editing, so I commend ser|Se Lawson and hope they will pass that on the prof.  The situation at ADHD was more frustrating.  I tried to engage the student to explain sourcing, but they were having none of it, and none of their content was salvageable. ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk)  23:42, 23 April 2018 (UTC)

 Well, it's what the CDC says, and I had it all, so not sure why you say it's over the top.  And I added it to the Side effects section-- how else would I better integrate it? Also, 1 out of 6 is a real number.  And this sore arm was not like a typical vaccine sore arm, so it seems to me that the CDC has it right.As a result, you are likely to have temporary side effects from getting the shots. The side effects may affect your ability to do normal daily activities for 2 to 3 days. Most people got a sore arm with mild or moderate pain after getting Shingrix, and some also had redness and swelling where they got the shot. Some people felt tired, had muscle pain, a headache, shivering, fever, stomach pain, or nausea. About 1 out of 6 people who got Shingrix experienced side effects that prevented them from doing regular activities.  Symptoms went away on their own in about 2 to 3 days. Side effects were more common in younger people.  Feel free to also add the NHS, though.

Refusing to speak to someone is not a medical subject.  The origin of the name (but not the behavior) is in the way that some (Western, mostly English-speaking) prisons treated their inmates.

If you're not sure where MEDRS stops and psychology begins maybe don't edit articles where the line isn't clear to you. I don't agree with some of your edits on Silent Treatment and am wondering whether to  make changes or not. Everything human beings do impacts their physiologies so its understandable that the line separating behaviour and health related articles is blurred. However, this is primarily an article about behavior not physical health so I don't think MEDRS applies. I also wonder if Silent Treatment is a clinical term; if not we don't necessarily need research papers to describe it.(ser:Littleolive oil|Littleolive oil (ser talk:Littleolive oil|talk) 15:57, 27 April 2018 (UTC))
I like it when people say that they don't know everything. 
That seemed like an aggressive purge (e.g., blanking the paragraph that says it's a common tactic by bullies in the workplace), but looking at a few sources, I'm thinking that this might be a good candidate for a merge/redirect (as might several others).

 Adenoid vs Pharyngeal tonsil 
at top
Hello, as I mentioned alk:Adenoid#Article name: pharyngeal tonsil vs. adenoid|here, that text books said &quot;adenoids are a symptomatic pathological hypertrophy of the nasopharyngeal tonsil. That in presence of certain predisposing factors (like allergy, environmental pollution..etc), abnormal hypertrophy of the nasopharyngeal tonsil occurs and normal physiological regression is slowed down (nasopharyngeal tonsil normally starts to diminish in size at the age of 7-8 years), and the hypertrophy condition here called adenoids&quot;. So if there's no objection I'll move the article from denoid to haryngeal tonsil? --ser:علاء|Alaa  ser_talk:علاء|:)..! 11:35, 2 May 2018 (UTC)

I think a List of journals accused of being a predatory open access publisher will be a good article. Before it goes live we can create a draft. Thoughts? ser:QuackGuru|QuackGuru (ser talk:QuackGuru|talk) 16:35, 15 April 2018 (UTC)
*Bad idea. 1/ Will be an enormous list. Beall had over 1000 entries on his list. 2/ Near impossible to maintain. 3/ Magnet for edit warring between supporters and opponents of these journals. Note: Most of the entries in the above list (which is copied from Category:Potential predatory journals were placed in that cat by me, before giving up). --ser:Randykitty|Randykitty (ser talk:Randykitty|talk) 22:35, 15 April 2018 (UTC)

* Neutral. I think we need very clear inclusion criteria, one of which should ideally be a secondary source that claims a publication is predatory. I think there is a lot to be said for maintaining such a list, if l|Quackguru is game. (Conflict of interest: I get spammed on an almost daily basis by predatory publishers wanting me to &quot;submit my research&quot; to them. All because my email address is on Pubmed.) ser:Jfdwolff|JFW | ser_talk:Jfdwolff|T@lk 18:30, 17 April 2018 (UTC)
**I know very little about this topic. I will wait for sources and wait for others to start the draft. We don't need a source that claims a publication *is* predatory. There could be a source that claims a publication maybe a predatory or potentially or other similar words. In other words, we can follow each source accurately and include supported weasel words such as *possible* predatory. ser:QuackGuru|QuackGuru (ser talk:QuackGuru|talk) 20:18, 17 April 2018 (UTC)
*Starting with Beall's list as a reference seems reasonable. Just make sure every item is referenced. One could group them alphabetically.

* This is a bad idea. It refers to Beall's list which has been challenged and withdrawn. This list will be out-dated, inaccurate and hedged with weaselly words like &quot;accused&quot;, &quot;potential&quot;.  Yes, those of us who are in academia get invitations all the time to publish in &quot;new&quot; journals and would not aim for this or usually dream of citing them in WP reviews.  But occasionally a relevant source may end up in one of them.  For instance, orld Journal of Gastroenterology has had mistakes along the way but now has an adequate review process and a reasonable impact factor in the top half of Gastro journals.  Maybe we should just list journals with citation indices &lt; 1 (or 2 or 20) as Potential low impact journals.ser:Jrfw51|Jrfw51 (ser talk:Jrfw51|talk) 12:57, 18 April 2018 (UTC)
** Including supported weasel words will make it accurate. We can also include a list of journals with a zero impact factor in a separate section. The impact factor for World Journal of Gastroenterology has increased. I'm not sure if this should be included in the list for a new article. ser:QuackGuru|QuackGuru (ser talk:QuackGuru|talk) 13:19, 18 April 2018 (UTC)

Please provide sources below. Thank you. ser:QuackGuru|QuackGuru (ser talk:QuackGuru|talk) 13:19, 18 April 2018 (UTC)
* Neutral - It could be a helpful list. My worry is that over time, if an editor or group of editors does not diligently keep it up-to-date, we might end up denigrating a &quot;reformed&quot; journal, as in the example ser:Jrfw51|Jrfw51 provided. On a related topic, if we decide to include mpact factor, we should include a ournal ranking|variety of journal citation metrics, not just the Impact Factor marketed by larivate Analytics. ser:Markworthen|  - Mark D Worthen PsyD ser talk:Markworthen|(talk) 21:26, 19 April 2018 (UTC)
*In general, this is a bad idea. The list would feature thousands of entries, if not more.

*Per Headbomb, Randykitty, and others—we shouldn't be trying to place ourselves in the position of creating and curating a list of predatory publishers and journals.  While such lists are useful and valuable resources, they're out of scope for Wikipedia's mission.  Keeping such a list complete and up to date in perpetuity isn't something we can reliably and robustly do with Wikipedia's general volunteer labor pool, and presenting such a list that is incomplete and out of date does a disservice to our readers.  Wikipedia can and should link appropriately to respected outside resources (through external links sections and inline references) on this topic, but we shouldn't try to become the last word ourselves. ser:TenOfAllTrades|TenOfAllTrades(ser_talk:TenOfAllTrades|talk) 14:01, 20 April 2018 (UTC)
*Agree with |TenOfAllTrades and others. ser:Bondegezou|Bondegezou (ser talk:Bondegezou|talk) 14:54, 20 April 2018 (UTC)
*That being said, a Wikipedia-space worklist to make sure those aren't used in our articles for referencing things beyond P:SELFSOURCE would be entirely fine. ser:Headbomb|Headbomb {ser talk:Headbomb|t · pecial:Contributions/Headbomb|c · P:PHYS|p · P:WBOOKS|b} 16:05, 20 April 2018 (UTC)
**I agree.  An 'internal' list of useful resources for identifying predatory publishers would be quite handy to have.  Lists of publishers and individual journals would be, again, subject to concerns regarding completeness and curation, but editors – as opposed to readers – are much better positioned to understand the limitations of a work-in-progress crib sheet.  Such a page might also be used retain and consolidate links to historical discussions on Wikipedia (on article talk pages and on noticeboards like WT:MED, WP:FTN, WP:RSN, etc.) about particular publishers/journals to help reduce the need to 'reinvent the wheel' when questions about a particular source arise....  ser:TenOfAllTrades|TenOfAllTrades(ser_talk:TenOfAllTrades|talk) 17:43, 20 April 2018 (UTC)
 I like this idea. On a couple of occasions I've had some citation edits reverted because the next editor knew the journal/book I was citing was unreliable for one reason or another - something I wouldn't have known without previous knowledge or a hard lit search. It would be a nice resource to check before including a journal/publisher/etc. It would also be a daunting task though...there's been hundreds of citations I've come across (usually through Google Books) that are just horrible and I couldn't imagine the process it would require to round those all up in a Wiki page. ser:Semmendinger|SEMMENDINGER (ser talk:Semmendinger|talk) 16:14, 23 April 2018 (UTC)
Well... It's great when folks can collaborate together like that, but I also hope that you'd think about whether the other person is correct.  Over the years, I've had editors tell me that journals are bad because you have to buy the article, because it's not written in English, because it's not in a particular database, because it's P:Impact factor is only the median for its field (most editors don't understand how low typical impact factors are, especially for specialized journals) – even because the editor-in-chief wasn't a successful businessman.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 15:18, 24 April 2018 (UTC)

*Frankly, I think the main problem here may be that we need to define what qualifies as an &quot;accusation&quot;. Does it just have to be some random blogger calling a journal predatory for us to list it on our hypothetical list of such journals? What kind of sources would be used to decide whether a journal should be listed or not?

 ans Asperger and the Nazis 

A paper recently published in olecular Autism (full text [https://molecularautism.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13229-018-0208-6 here]) has claimed that, in azi Germany, ans Asperger &quot;joined several organizations affiliated with the NSDAP (although not the Nazi party itself), publicly legitimized race hygiene policies including forced sterilizations and, on several occasions, actively cooperated with the child ‘euthanasia’ program.&quot; It has gotten a lot of media attention and I wanted to see if other editors think it is fairly incorporated into the current article on Asperger himself. ser:Everymorning|Every morning ser talk:Everymorning|(there's a halo...) 21:06, 1 May 2018 (UTC)

 HTML errors in medicine-related articles 

I'm going through pecial:LintErrors, and I've found a few high-priority HTML errors in articles tagged by this WikiProject.  The w:Parsing/Replacing Tidy|wikitext parser is going to change in June, and any page with an error may display strangely.

What's needed right now is for someone to click these links and compare the side-by-side preview of the two parsers.  If the &quot;New&quot; page looks okay, then something's maybe technically wrong with the HTML, but there's no immediate worry.  If that column looks wrong, then it should be fixed.  

The first list is all &quot;deletable table&quot; errors.  If you want to know more about how to fix these pages, then see mw:Help:Extension:Linter/deletable-table-tag.  Taking the first link as an example, there is highlighting in the wikitext that shows where the lint error is; it's in the I section.  The cause is probably the bad wikitext code at the end of the previous section, which currently ends with |-}.  In the current parser, this error makes the H and I tables be connected; in the upcoming parser, it will make them separate but the I section heading will still be misplaced.  It should be an easy fix.

 astleman disease rewrite 
ile:Castleman disease - high mag.jpg|thumb|160 px|Castleman disease 
Hi everyone, thanks in advance for any help, it is much appreciated! Full disclosure about a potential COI, I am a medical student working for the non-profit Castleman Disease Collaborative Network.

I have been working to rewrite the page for Castleman disease. When I was considering my approach to rewriting the page I figured I would have to include 3 subcategories for each heading reflecting the 3 commonly accepted subtypes of the disease (Unicentric Castleman disease, HHV-8-associated multicentric Castleman disease, idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease). I thought that would be cumbersome and it would be better to have a separate page for each subtype instead. My feeling (which I believe reflects that of experts in the rather small field) is that these 3 diseases likely differ enough in pathogenesis, symptoms, treatment, and prognosis that they are best thought of independently. Recently published high impact articles tend to focus on a single subtype rather than all 3.

I have drafted all 3 articles:

raft:HHV-8-associated MCD

raft:Unicentric Castleman disease

raft:Idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease

I am new to wikipedia and I was hoping to get feedback on:

1) Whether my approach with 3 articles makes sense

2) General feedback on my drafts, is the content appropriate? is the tone correct? Do I have enough sources?

3) What is the fastest way to get these articles up? Should I wait for the formal review process as I am currently doing?

4) Is my COI significant, I tried to be as unbiased as possible. I did mention the CDCN in the article as I feel it is a notable and valuable resource, but I understand if my COI might be concerning.

Thank you so much for any feedback!--ser:CDK55|CDK55 (ser talk:CDK55|talk) 20:15, 3 May 2018 (UTC)  — Preceding ikipedia:Signatures|unsigned comment added by ser:CDK55|CDK55 (ser talk:CDK55#top|talk • pecial:Contributions/CDK55|contribs) 20:12, 3 May 2018 (UTC) 

For rare diseases, it is normal and appropriate to mention the largest non-profit organization in the article.
I started an infobox at the top of the raft:Unicentric Castleman disease.  If you open the page in the visual editor, and click on it, then you can get a list of things you can add (like CD-10 codes and MIM numbers).  Including an infobox is typical in this kind of article, but if you don't like it, then you can remove it.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 21:32, 3 May 2018 (UTC)

Marchand (about to be deleted), an ob/gyn who got his MD at partan Health Sciences University, practices laparoscopic surgery, and likes to go after &quot;world records&quot; for removing biggest X and then put out press releases about them. He uses orcellation to get the big things out but still work laparoscopically.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Greg_J._Marchand&amp;oldid=836854148 Here] is how it looked when it was created.  I one point I pared it down to something as good-as-it-could be given the sources, and got [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Greg_J._Marchand&amp;oldid=839390756 this].

The socks argued that syndicated news stories about this guy each counted toward N and one of them wrote [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Greg_J._Marchand&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=839706171 this]: q|these 14 news stories did not come from a press release, they came from national reporter.  The original story was produced by Wendy Chioji of Ivanhoe Media (they do a lot of the medical interest national stories for CBS, NBC, ABC.  Her [https://www.ivanhoe.com/interview/bag-morcellation-removes-tumor-safely-depth-doctor-interview/ original story is easy to find] so I suspect you already knew this.  It's a real national story shared with many legitimate CBS, NBC, and ABC affiliate stations. 

Nobody bought this argument, but it was such a clear (and egregious) example that I thought it worth posting at INDY, and did so ikipedia_talk:Identifying_and_using_independent_sources#Syndicated_stories|here, and have made [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AIdentifying_and_using_independent_sources&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=839788826&amp;oldid=839787705 a bold edit] to INDY to explicitly address syndicated stories in discussions of notability and weight.

But what I wanted to discuss here was vanhoe Broadcast News (I just nominated that for speedy as it is mostly a copy/paste from their website) which apparently creates pieces about &quot;breakthroughs in medicine&quot;  and sells them to other news organizations.  I don't know much about them.  If they are doing legit news, or are really oriented toward doing PR, or if they don't care what subjects want and will just do anything if they think they can sell it.  I can say that their piece on Marchand was pretty much a mouthpiece, and not at all independent journalism. ([https://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/health/2017/10/30/mesa-doctor-faces-criticism-using-controversial-surgical-technique/799237001/ Here] is the one piece i found with INDY reporting on Marchand; the Ivanhoe syndicated pieces  - for example [https://www.ksat.com/news/video-in-bag-morcellation-removes-tumor-safely this], are nothing like that.)

Anyway, I wanted to post here to see if anybody is aware of Ivanhoe. ?? Their stuff is not MEDRS of course but there is lots of non-biomedical content we all deal with. Is anybody familiar with them? ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 18:10, 5 May 2018 (UTC)

There is nothing about rint syndication that makes it inherently non-independent.  
However, WP:N has said (for years and years) that when the same story is republished in a bunch of different media outlets, that's still exactly one (1) story.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 20:33, 5 May 2018 (UTC)

 Unfortunately, the wording of P:GNG alkquote|1=Multiple publications from the same author or organization are usually regarded as a single source for the purposes of establishing notability. is liable to ambiguous interpretation (the problem is in the &quot;or&quot;). We know it means that when Wendy Chioji of Ivanhoe Media writes a story and gives it to multiple news stations, that counts for only one source for the purpose of satisfying GNG. But you only have to look at the socks voting &quot;keep&quot; at ikipedia:Articles for deletion/Greg J. Marchand to realise that the UPEs will read our policy as stating that each news station counts as a separate independent source becaus they are not the same organisation. 
 Examples: 
* q|&quot;In the US [he] has articles all over the national news about him&quot;;
* q|&quot;There's no way this can fail WP:GNG. If you read WP:GNG it plainly says:&quot;&quot;Independent of the subject&quot; excludes works produced by the article's subject or someone affiliated with it. For example, advertising, press releases, autobiographies, and the subject's website are not considered independent.&quot; Individual ABC, NBC and CBS stations all over the nation ran the story.&quot;;
* q|&quot;That is not what WP:GNG says. It says they have to be independent from the Subject, not independent from each other. Most stories you see on the news will come from the same Associated Press press releases no matter where you are in the United States.&quot;
 and so on. That's the sort of persuasive crap that leads to AfDs ending in &quot;no consensus to delete&quot;, because not even the closers pay enough attention to the point that &quot;1 story = 1 source for GNG&quot;. It's time you spruced up that policy again, |WhatamIdoing|WAID miley|wink --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 20:59, 5 May 2018 (UTC)
The rule is explained in ikipedia:Notability#cite_note-3, but ikipedia:Nobody reads the directions.  If it's a pervasive and good-faith problem (e.g., not just a bunch of socks at AFD), then it might be worth expanding. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 22:01, 5 May 2018 (UTC)
 The snag with the current system is that you have to prove that the comments are coming from socks before their deceptive comments can be exposed for what they are. Most of the time we just don't know whether the SPAs are socks or not. I shudder to think how many AfDs may have given free passes to UPEs and their sockfarms because the nominator lacked Jytdog's insight and tenacity. My vote is for spelling the guidance out clearly in GNG. Something like alkquote|1=&quot;Multiple publications from the same author or organization, and the same source repeated by multiple organizations are almost always regarded as a single source for the purposes of establishing notability.&quot; --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 23:45, 5 May 2018 (UTC)
I spent a little while looking into Ivanhoe.  It appears that they're basically a standard news media organization.  It's sort of freelancing on a larger scale:  they write stories, and they sell stories to outlets.  It's licensing rules are different from (i.e., worse than) the Associated Press's, but it's not necessarily different in kind.  Since they are profitable, I assume that they're talking to media outlets about the kinds of content that will get bought, but I also assume that their independence is approximately the same as every other newsroom:  they get jillions of press releases whether they want them or not, they are under a lot of time/productivity pressure, and they are more skilled than the average person at noticing when someone's trying to twist the facts.
I think that there may be some confusion of &quot;hard-hitting&quot; with &quot;independent&quot;.  Glowing puff pieces can be absolutely independent, just like critical pieces can be wildly non-independent (see:  every attack ad ever published during a political campaign).  You can build a journalistic career on writing positive stories, without compromising your independence.  There's a market for good/hopeful news, especially for health content.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 22:05, 5 May 2018 (UTC)
Thanks for your thoughts on Invanhoe, WAID.  The whole point of journalistic independence is that we look for them to actually look into stuff and report what they find.  A &quot;piece&quot; that is just a puff piece providing a mouthpiece for the subject is not independent, in the spirit of what we are looking for. This is a much murkier ball of wax, I know... ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 23:50, 5 May 2018 (UTC)
No, that's not what journalistic independence means.  Journalistic independence does not mean that you get a complete or accurate story.  It means that you get a story that was published because the journalists (e.g., not the advertisers or the government) wanted to publish it. 
This is why journalistic independence is so valuable for determining notability:  the decision to publish a story on X tells us that someone with no vested interest in X thought that X was important enough to bring X to the attention of the world at large.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 00:27, 6 May 2018 (UTC)

* happy to have dialogue but I intended this thread to be about Ivanhoe as source of medical &quot;news&quot;.  My sense is we should avoid it like the plague. 
Folks have seemed tetchy lately, about what is &quot;in-scope&quot; here on this talk page.  The general issues should (in my view) be discussed at the INDY talk page, ikipedia_talk:Identifying_and_using_independent_sources#Syndicated_stories|here as they are not specific to MED. If folks agree there, it might well be worth adding a clarification about syndidated stories at N, BIO, CORP, etc. but those are discussions for those guidelines/essays.... ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 22:06, 5 May 2018 (UTC)
I think that Ivanhoe is probably every bit as good a source of medical news as your typical local newspaper.  
I am curious where you draw the line between &quot;medical news&quot; and information that needs to meet MEDRS standards for biomedical content.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 00:09, 6 May 2018 (UTC)
So something like Marchand getting a guinness world record would be Society and Culture. something about first X would be history (although popular media is generally bad for that).  Perhaps for public controversy. That's not a surprising answer is it? ser:Jytdog|Jytdog (ser talk:Jytdog|talk) 00:53, 6 May 2018 (UTC)
I think that Ivanhoe is a reliable source for that kind of news.
I also think that news stories (in any typical news media) that are initiated through press releases and PR campaigns are reliable for that kind of news, too.  What we need from a source for WP:V is a reason to think that the facts are accurate; a typical news story provides us with that.  What we need from a source for WP:N is their &quot;gatekeeper&quot; function, to determine what deserves their readers' attention; the fact that they can't (and won't) run a story on every single press release provides us with that.
The main problem with the Marchand stuff isn't the &quot;wow, modern medicine is so amazing&quot; aspect of the stories.  It's just that there's not much to say about him.  Stripped of puffery, trivia, and stuff pulled from self-published and non-independent sources, the article would probably be a P:PERMASTUB – a few sentences that would say little more than &quot;He did this, and he was criticized for it&quot;.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 21:33, 7 May 2018 (UTC)

For those interested in some background that led to this question, I recommend seeing ser_talk:Nøkkenbuer#Frontier_journals|my talk page, wherein |Doc James and I discussed this matter. It also includes my rationale for at least selectively using Frontiers journals as citations to articles so long as the article or study being cited is otherwise acceptable, as well as my stated concerns about considering rontiers Media to be a redatory publisher. As I said in the aforementioned talk page discussion, I agree that there appear to be some problems with Frontiers journals, but I would nonetheless consider it a problematic publisher (like with indawi Publishing Corporation) rather a predatory one. This conclusion was primarily based on a review of sources mentioning or otherwise discussing the status of Frontiers journals as predatory, which I deemed mixed and overall inconclusive. Links to those sources can be found on my talk page, as well.bI would also like to note ikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine/Archive 78#On the use of Frontiers journals as sources|Archive 78 § On the use of Frontiers journals as sources, whose consensus seemed likewise inconclusive but which appears to accept selective usage so long as that which is being cited is otherwise acceptable.

Yes it depends on the claim. Any exceptional claim (e.g. of treatment efficacy) which appears only in a Frontiers journal is a huge P:REDFLAG, and as for the AIDS denialism &amp;c. stuff they've run .... In general anything worth including that appears in a Frontiers journal will almost certainly be source-able to something more conspicuously reputable.

*I definitely don't consider Frontiers journals to be predatory -- I have read dozens if not hundreds of useful articles in them.

I actually think this Frontiers article is quite good, but the edit to the ethadone article does not accurately reflect what it says.

The specific subject of methadone as antineoplastic is reviewed in Int J Cancer at MID|29516505. No need to use the primary source.

It appears, at least to me, that the consensus (or lack thereof) on generally citing Frontiers journals has thus far remained the same as I described above. This discussion originated from my citation of two specific review articles, namely the following two: [https://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/neuro.01.1.1.006.2007/abstract 1] and [https://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2010.00224/abstract 2]. Does anyone have any opinion on these two particular sources, especially as worthwhile additions to the sperger syndrome, utism, utism spectrum, or other such article?

So these sources are about the &quot;Intense World Syndrome&quot; which is the idea of a few researchers. The question is has this been picked up and discussed by decent secondary sources?

Actually, I think that might be a secondary source.  It's not labeled as a review article, which is a particular type of secondary source, but it synthesizes previous work into a coherent whole.

Yes, |Alexbrn, I specifically want to include this &quot;intense world&quot; theory because I believe it is a ikipedia:Relevance|relevant and appropriate addition to sperger syndrome#Mechanism|Asperger syndrome § Mechanism. I was simply stating the theory in a brief paragraph as a significant hypothesis for the neurological mechanism(s) behind Asperger syndrome and the autism spectrum alongside the others.

According to the two articles, |WhatamIdoing, they are indeed both labeled as review articles. I am talking about these two links specifically: [https://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/neuro.01.1.1.006.2007/abstract 1] and [https://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2010.00224/abstract 2].

I agree that they are both secondary sources, though I understand |Alexbrn's point that the &quot;intense world&quot; theory is primary to these papers and their authors. From what I can tell, if there is any basis for excluding these two particular sources, it appears to be on them not being secondary for the theory itself, despite otherwise satisfying P:MEDRS.

Usually – but not always, and it's not a requirement – journals submit metadata to PubMed about their articles, to identify things such as whether they're review articles.  The PubMed records contain no such data for these papers.  That's not proof that it's not a review article, but it does mean that the papers are excluded from search results (at PubMed) that are limited to review articles.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:24, 19 April 2018 (UTC)

Or should the focus—at least, at this time—remain with including it somewhere within an appropriate Wikipedia article, assuming it should be included at all?

I think that this subject meets or exceeds the minimum requirement for having a stand-alone article about just IWS.

 Intense world syndrome 
I'm looking into this idea, and I think it's probably P:Notable.  Here's some sources:

In fact, Henry Markram, Tania Rinaldi, and Kamila Markram proposed such a theory in a 2007 article aptly titled,“The Intense World Syndrome—An Alternative Hypothesis for Autism.&quot;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LK5bAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT120]

A note
As a note P:JCW/Target1 will contain usage information about most Frontiers journals. P:JCW/F17 will have information about the three standalone journals rontiers in Endocrinology/rontiers in Plant Science/rontiers in Psychology. The exact pages may differ over time but you can always find them based on pecial:WhatLinksHere/Foobar. ser:Headbomb|Headbomb {ser talk:Headbomb|t · pecial:Contributions/Headbomb|c · P:PHYS|p · P:WBOOKS|b} 15:58, 27 April 2018 (UTC)
This also works for things like pecial:WhatLinksHere/Scientific Research Publishing. This tells you, for instance, that sychology (journal) is an SCIRP journal, which can be found at P:JCW/P55, where it is cited 5 times on Wikipedia (with links to those articles). ser:Headbomb|Headbomb {ser talk:Headbomb|t · pecial:Contributions/Headbomb|c · P:PHYS|p · P:WBOOKS|b} 16:22, 30 April 2018 (UTC)

Still more links to DAB pages
The following are all recent (within the last 6 weeks or so?) medicine-related links to DAB pages where expert attention seems needed. Some may need minor rewriting or unlinking. Two are about dinosaur anatomy, but I have a strong suspicion that paleontologists borrowed existing terms rather than attributed new meanings to existing ones. As always, search for &quot;disam&quot; in the displayed text; and if you solve one of these puzzles, remove the l|dn tag and post l|done here.
