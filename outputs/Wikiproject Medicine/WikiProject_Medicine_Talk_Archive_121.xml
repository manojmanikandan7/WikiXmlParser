 Antisperm antibodies, template of neutrality and weight 

I [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Antisperm_antibodies#ASA_are_found_in_3%%E2%80%9312%_of_men_seeking_evaluation_of_infertility propose] to remove the template of neutrality and weight.  The prevalence in populations is proved by sources, and additional data: 
# &quot;Immunological infertility is assumed to be the cause of infertility in 9-36% of the concerned couples. ASA were present in sera of 30% women with unexplained infertility. In this study ASA have been identified in 10-15% of men experiencing infertility and 15-20% of women with unexplained infertility. The frequency of ASA in fertile population of women and men is &lt;2%. In infertile men and women ASA are present in 5-25% of individuals.&quot; [http://medind.nic.in/jaq/t11/i3/jaqt11i3p307.pdf] 
# Data on the frequency of ASA in infertile men have shown high variability (from 7% to 44%), depending on the method applied [http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4843329] 
# &quot;The incidence of ASA in infertile couples is 9–55%, depending on the reporting center. Antisperm antibodies have been described in 8–21% of the infertile men (autoantibodies) and in 6–43% of infertile women (isoantibodies). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24863647]

The source used in the article (2017) has more weighted and relevant information.  10–30% of infertile couples, and in males, about 12–13% (20,4% in meta-analysis[5])  --ser:Путеец|Путеец (ser talk:Путеец|talk) 08:12, 21 January 2019 (UTC)

P:POV templates can be removed whenever the dispute has stopped (e.g., no discussion about it on the talk page for a couple of months).  ser:Путеец|You just re-started the talk-page discussions, so now you either have to figure out if people agree with you now, or wait until everyone gets bored and stops talking about it for a month or two again and boldly remove them without re-igniting the dispute first.  (Of course, in the second case, there's a chance that someone will revert you, and then you're back to the 'find consensus' part.)
On the subject matter, I glanced at the article, and I wonder whether there might not be an important gap between &quot;our test found some antibodies&quot; and &quot;these antibodies produce a clinically meaningful effect for this couple&quot;.  Antibody detection tests are not always as specific as one might hope, and developing immunological tolerance to a long-term partner's sperm is a known thing (check the literature on Japan, where the local choice of condoms as the primary form of birth control interferes with this process).  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:17, 21 January 2019 (UTC)
1)P: POV templates have already been [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antisperm_antibodies&amp;diff=827900264&amp;oldid=827900138  deleted]. The script canceled the edit. Active editor who put the templates for a long time does not work. Is it possible to repeat the deletion? 2) We discuss only the statistical results described in the sources. A source has been suggested that refers to very old data. I proposed several new ones that confirm the article’s content. --ser:Путеец|Путеец (ser talk:Путеец|talk) 17:15, 21 January 2019 (UTC)
That reversion was by ing|CASSIOPEIA, whom I'm sure would be happy to explain how removing a year-old pair of maintenance templates got categorized as &quot;unexplained content removal&quot;.  (&quot;Misclick&quot; is my first guess, since maintenance templates aren't content by any stretch of the imagination.)  
The emplate:POV_section/doc|rules for removing those templates are pretty clear (although ikipedia:Nobody reads the directions).  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:42, 22 January 2019 (UTC)
ing|WhatamIdoing Hi, at P:Huggle there is no &quot;removing of maintenance templates&quot; but &quot;AFD/deleted whole page/CSD/removing content&quot;, for such I chose removing of content as sub for the edit. (the summary edit and warning template on editor page are automated text from Hunggle once the edit is perfromed). Thank you. ser:CASSIOPEIA| CASSIOPEIA(ser talk:CASSIOPEIA|talk) 06:21, 27 January 2019 (UTC)
ing|CASSIOPEIA  Why did you revert it at all?  Those templates are supposed to be present only while a dispute is being actively discussed by editors.  They're not supposed to linger merely because someone disagreed with the article at some point in the past.  Did you check to see whether there was such a dispute going on?  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:48, 27 January 2019 (UTC)
ing|WhatamIdoing The revert as no reason (edit summary) was given for the removal - see [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antisperm_antibodies&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=827900138&amp;diffmode=source]. Thank you. ser:CASSIOPEIA| CASSIOPEIA(ser talk:CASSIOPEIA|talk) 16:54, 27 January 2019 (UTC)
ing|CASSIOPEIA I don't think you understood my question.  Okay, you reverted it because he removed it.  Why did you think that anyone needed to restore stale tags about an already-solved dispute?  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:06, 27 January 2019 (UTC)
ing|WhatamIdoing, I restored because it did not state why the info was deleted.I am not an involved editor of the page. We at Hunggle (vandalism/ disruptive/deletions/etc) fighters, do not usually look in dept of (to investigate and read all the talk page messages) in details of such edit as editor should indicate the nature of the edits they performed in edit summary as there are thousands of such edits daily in Wikipedia. Thank you. ser:CASSIOPEIA| CASSIOPEIA(ser talk:CASSIOPEIA|talk) 00:31, 28 January 2019 (UTC)
There is no rule that actually requires editors to use an edit summary; this is ikipedia:Perennial proposals#Automatically prompt for missing edit summary|a perennially rejected proposal.  There is especially no rule that requires an editor use an edit summary that will make sense to someone who would rather quickly revert edits than take the time to figure out whether the edit was appropriate.
Huggle's rules say that ser:CASSIOPEIA|you will take responsibility for the edits you make with it.  That means that when you screw up – say, by reverting a valid edit on the flimsy grounds that it was too hard for you to figure out whether it was appropriate, so you decided to assume that it was vandalism – then you don't claim that it's the other guy's fault for not pre-explaining, for your convenience, in your preferred location, that this was actually a good edit.  
I'm also concerned to see that you are claiming that your use of a misleading edit summary isn't your fault.  I'm sure that it's true that Huggle doesn't provide you with a single-click alternative that matched the actual situation, but under Huggle's rules, that means that you have to stop using Huggle for that edit and use a regular editing system.  Note, too, that you're making this argument in favor of your poor edit summary in the context of you deciding to revert an edit because you disapproved of it not having a useful edit summary attached to it.  You can't seriously expect us to believe that your factually inaccurate edit summary is supposed to be okay, but his missing one is grounds for reversion.  Should someone with Huggle now go revert yours, on the grounds that the canned edit summary is wrong?  
Usually, &quot;taking responsibility&quot; is enacted quickly, by saying something like &quot;Oops, sorry&quot; and self-reverting.  I wonder whether it would ultimately be more useful to have you write a section at P:CVUA on the importance of never using a misleading edit summary just because some scripts make clicking on a half-wrong canned edit summary easier than providing an accurate one.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 07:45, 28 January 2019 (UTC)
ing|WhatamIdoing Wikipedia dont really operate under rules but guidelines. The revert is not based on vandalism but deletion without explanation/reason. An automatic message has been sent to the editor on info editor to provide edit info or if I have make any mistake, the editor would info/discuss with me. - see here [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Shamash]. If you think the tag should be removed, then do it and place a edit summary on the edit. Thank you. ser:CASSIOPEIA| CASSIOPEIA(ser talk:CASSIOPEIA|talk) 07:56, 28 January 2019 (UTC)
ser:CASSIOPEIA|Please show me the guideline that says &quot;deletion without explanation&quot; (you mean blanking, not deletion, and remember that we're talking about maintenance tags, not article content) is grounds for reversion.  I think that after editing for more than a dozen years and all the work I've done on policies and guidelines (including writing a large portion of ikipedia:Policies and guidelines itself), I'm tolerably familiar with our ruleset, and I do not remember any rule in any page that says to revert the removal of maintenance tags unless there is an edit summary.  I do, however, know that there is a rule on all of the POV-related maintenance tags that says you shouldn't restore them unless there is an active dispute underway (yet another part of our extended ruleset that I helped write years ago, by the way).  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 15:54, 28 January 2019 (UTC)
ing|WhatamIdoing  I revert on the ground as no edit summary stated (as a way to communicate with other editors so such like now the issues of so many message here would be avoided) as I did not know if the maintenance tags issues has yet to resolve. A message had sent to the editor and if the editor disagree, they would always restore the tag and stage the reason - that is all. My intention had no ill reason. Apologizes if I cause any inconvenience instead of helping Wikipedia. Thank you. ser:CASSIOPEIA| CASSIOPEIA(ser talk:CASSIOPEIA|talk) 22:35, 28 January 2019 (UTC)
When ser:CASSIOPEIA|you (&quot;we&quot;, really, because this is true for all of us) are uncertain whether an edit is good, then you should not revert it.  Leaving a message is really irrelevant.
If Huggle doesn't have a clear method for skipping edits that you're uncertain about, then let's request one.  It turns out that I know one of the devs, and perhaps it's a design question that would interest ser:TutterMouse, so we'd have a reasonable chance of getting that on their list for future improvements.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 23:48, 28 January 2019 (UTC)
 ing|WhatamIdoing Hunggle does have the option to skip edits.cheers.ser:CASSIOPEIA| CASSIOPEIA(ser talk:CASSIOPEIA|talk) 23:58, 28 January 2019 (UTC)
Now I'm mystified by ser:CASSIOPEIA|your response again.  You've said here that you reverted because you &quot;did not know&quot; whether it was a good edit.  You also indicate that you understand that editors can't just go around reverting possibly appropriate edits on the chance that something that looks possible might happen to be a bad edit.  So:
...if it's easy for Huggle users to skip edits that they're uncertain about, and 
...if you know that Huggle users are only supposed to revert edits that they're reasonably certain are actually bad (not merely unexplained or an edit that the Huggle user doesn't understand),
...then why did it seem easier or better to revert that edit, instead of just skipping it?  
I am worrying about how much good content will we lose, if even a few RecentChanges patrollers think that they're supposed to take a &quot;guilty until proven innocent&quot; approach to edits.  Some systems really reward people for exercising veto power:  the one who dies with the most reverts wins, and who cares whether those reverts were appropriate.  Reversions don't build the encyclopedia.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 00:23, 29 January 2019 (UTC)
utdent
I reverted the edit as there were no indication why it was removed. if the issues of the still remain and then removing the it might cause the issue remain and lack of editors to action in helping to improve the issue and if I have done a mistake (which a message had sent to the editor, they could always restore their edit and or send me a message on it). I did it in good well, yet cause so much unpleasantness of my mistake of my quick action of my service. Sadly. ser:CASSIOPEIA| CASSIOPEIA(ser talk:CASSIOPEIA|talk) 00:37, 29 January 2019 (UTC)

 Plan S open-access initiative requesting feedback 


The lan S initiative aims to make academic articles open access as a condition of funding. It is [https://surveys.scienceeurope.org/index.php/746597?lang=en requesting feedback about itself] on these questions:

uote|
#Is there anything unclear or are there any issues that have not been addressed by the [Plan S] guidance document?
#Are there other mechanisms or requirements funders should consider to foster full and immediate Open Access of research outputs?

It seems to me as though people here may have useful answers. Feedback is open until the 8th of February. 

The plan launched in September and has a large proportion of European research funders and a couple of US ones onside; if you are affiliated with a research funder, they might want to look into it. The best comment on Plan S I've heard so far comes from lsevier (which doesn't really like the financial transparency provisions, for starters). An Elsevier spokesman said &quot;If you think that information should be free of charge, go to Wikipedia&quot; (&quot;Als je vindt dat informatie gratis moet zijn: ga naar Wikipedia&quot;).

Hello fellow Wikipedians, here is my take on this: 
The popular use (in some countries) of cable ties within veterinary surgery is indeed a problem; the formation of chronic granulomas is sadly well described. This is important to inform others about; at the end of the day, it is an animal welfare issue.
The suggested text is information about research and development carried out at the university where I work. I believe providing information about this is important to the readers seeking information. In my opinion this is relevant to any reader with an interest in surgery (the subject that I teach), the use of cable ties in surgery and readers with an interest in development of medical devices. ser:Odd Höglund (SLU)|Odd Höglund (SLU) (ser talk:Odd Höglund (SLU)|talk) 13:06, 3 February 2019 (UTC)

 P:CRAPWATCH expansion. 

I'm currently expanding the CrapWatch list to include sources other than Beall's list. I've added (see P:CRAPWATCH/SETUP) a section on P:CRAPWATCH/SETUP#Unreliable fields, as well as journals lying about being in the DOAJ and some based on uackwatch's [https://www.quackwatch.org/04ConsumerEducation/nonrecperiodicals.html list of non-recommended periodicals]. I've stuck to the 'fundamentally flawed' magazines and journals, but it could be expanded to cover more. I'm thinking Printed Newsletters, Electronic Newsletters, Newspapers, and Online Publications (minus HuffPo). I could include Journals/Magazines/Newsletters 'That Are Excellent Except for Too Many Poorly Reasoned Articles on &quot;Complementary&quot; and/or &quot;Alternative&quot; Medicine' (plus HuffPo), but I feel this would not be very useful.

Quackwatch's &quot;Journals, Excellent Except for Too Many Poorly Reasoned Articles on &quot;Complementary&quot; and/or &quot;Alternative&quot; Medicine&quot; only names three journals:  nnals of Internal Medicine, he BMJ, and one called Patient Care that may have stopped publishing, since the most recent article I can find at PubMed is from 1991.  I would not recommend putting AIM and BMJ on your list of journals.  
I'm honestly not even sure that all of the &quot;fundamentally flawed&quot; magazines would actually be appropriate.  uscle &amp; Fitness isn't my idea of an ideal source for biomedical information, but that doesn't mean that it can't ever be cited appropriately in a Wikipedia article.  (I did a quick check; Muscle &amp; Fitness is mostly cited in BLPs, and it's likely appropriate for that purpose.)  I'm concerned that in trying to cast a wide net, we might end up with so many false positives that we lose the main value of this project, which is quickly finding real problems.  Alternatively, since there's been demand for a list of banned sources for years now, we may have editors misuse the list and try to enforce non-existent rules (&quot;It's on the list, so it's banned&quot;).  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 05:32, 3 February 2019 (UTC)

Right now, I'm casting wide and I'm putting a emplate:JCW-Crapwatch-Warning|lot of disclaimers on the list. In particular t|This list may therefore feature publications and publishers which... &quot;... are problematic in some areas (e.g. promotes junk science), but reliable in others (e.g. biographies, general news)&quot; and &quot;... reflect Jeffrey Beall's or Quackwatch's good but imperfect judgment of what crap is (miscategorized as crap) would apply.
However, the end-point is indeed to have a list that is useful. So if say uscle &amp; Fitness is cited appropriately 95% of the time, there's probably a good case to remove it from the list. It's mostly why I stuck to the 'fundamentally flawed' publications for now, because I don't really know where the threshold should be, and like you, putting nnals of Internal Medicine/ritish Medical Journal (and possibly atient Care (journal)|Patient Care, but I don't know that journal) on a crap list seems... odd at best.

 eptospirosis as MEDRS microcosm 

There is an issue with eptospirosis#Treatment and at first sight it could be dealt with simply by deletion of unsupported content. On reflection, and in my role as Wikimedian in Residence looking at MEDRS, it looks more like a case study.

The issue is antimicrobial treatment for leptospirosis, a bacterial infection that includes Weil’s disease, which is probably better known as a term. It is on the WHO radar as having the potential to become one of its recognised “neglected zoonotic diseases”, by the accumulation of evidence.[https://www.who.int/neglected_diseases/zoonoses/infections_more/en/] A 2012 Cochrane review (details below) found no clear benefit to patients from treatment with a selection of prominent antibacterials. On the other hand the article here states: &quot;Effective antibiotics include penicillin G, ampicillin, amoxicillin and doxycycline. In more severe cases cefotaxime or ceftriaxone should be preferred.&quot; Hence the problems.

(1) One problem, certainly, is with P:MEDDATE and a 2012 review. It can't be ruled in as a source, by the letter of the guideline, but it can hardly be ruled out either. There may be later clarifications in the review literature. But [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=(+%22Leptospirosis%22+)+AND+(%22Doxycycline%22)+AND+Review%5Bptyp%5D+AND+%22last+5+years%22%5BPDat%5D this MEDLINE query] for leptospirosis+doxycycline (reviews from the last five years) apparently produces nothing very definite. The wording in the abstracts about prophylaxis isn't really convincing.

(2) Another issue is that Wikidata holds no information on drugs used to treat leptospirosis. So, if there is a MEDRS-compliant source about doxycycline or other treatment, Wikidata can be improved.
 
Under (2), such information could be used in infoboxes. Leptospirosis has Wikipedia articles in 65 languages, and many of those already have infoboxes. The English Wikipedia infobox, not drawing from Wikidata, cites antibiotic treatment to MID|20628664, a review article published in 2010, before the Cochrane systematic review of 2012 which is MID|22336839. There was also a 2011 comment on the paper MID|21391357.

So, I'm interested here in the expert verdict via on the referencing in the existing article of the treatment information, via MEDASSESS and MEDDATE. I also have some detailed comments on the drug-disease information that does exist on Wikidata, but perhaps they are matters better raised on :Wikidata talk:WikiProject Medicine. Lastly, it would not be surprising if people here were wondering how [http://sciencesource.wmflabs.org/wiki/Main_Page ScienceSource] is getting on with a MEDRS algorithm. Well, there is a version zero that takes into account publisher, publication type and date information, with allowance for a MEDDATE (or other good cause) whitelist; and version 1 will filter to take out retracted papers. Whitelisting and more case analysis, for neglected diseases (how to define?) and rare diseases (more easily defined) are ways forward to better versions.

ser:Charles Matthews|Charles Matthews (ser talk:Charles Matthews|talk) 12:04, 13 February 2019 (UTC)
I don't think there's a MEDRS problem here. The &quot;5 year&quot; rule-of-thumb is only for areas of research which are active, and Cochrane reviews are regarded more leniently in any case as they are assumed (perhaps optimistically) to be updated if there's a significant shift in the evidence. As to Wikidata - it has zero policy bearing on what we write in our articles here. Personally, I ignore it completely as a waste of time. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 12:46, 13 February 2019 (UTC)

ser:Charles Matthews|Charles, is your &quot;publisher&quot; field generally going to contain the organization that sponsors the publication (an &quot;Academic Society of Researchers&quot;), or the publishing house (e.g., Elsevier)? 
As for the MEDDATE question, Alex is correct about what the guideline says, but in practice, some editors revert anyone who dares to use their best judgement to determine that a six-and-a-half-year-old source in an under-researched area is acceptable for a specific statement.  :-/  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 21:50, 13 February 2019 (UTC)
ing|WhatamIdoing The &quot;publisher&quot; is determined by going paper -&gt; journal -&gt; publisher defined by &quot;organization or person responsible for publishing&quot; e.g. Elsevier. What we are actually doing, for open access papers which are the focus, is relying on the irectory of Open Access Journals to filter out the redatory publishers. On your &quot;best judgement&quot; point, yes indeed, something could be done here, if &quot;under-researched&quot; had a more tangible definition. 
Effectively, operating by blacklists (e.g. predatory publishers) and whitelists (cases for lenient application of MEDDATE) is all about lists and how they are compiled. For actual Wikipedia lists, there is what is said at P:LSC, i.e. clearcut criteria. The incidence of uncompromising reverts, as you describe them, could be reduced by being more explicit, in other words. For example, LOS Neglected Tropical Diseases gives a definite list on [https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/s/journal-information this page], that includes leptospirosis, where the WHO list has a narrower focus. ser:Charles Matthews|Charles Matthews (ser talk:Charles Matthews|talk) 08:31, 14 February 2019 (UTC)
I'm not sure ser:Charles Matthews|that is quite right, but ser:DGG is far more informed on this subject than I am.  Consider a case such as ournal of the European Economic Association, which was created after a dispute between the uropean Economic Association and Elsevier:  Wiley-Blackwell is certainly the publishing house.  Would you also call Wiley-Blackwell the publisher, or would you call the EEA the publisher? 
The problem with making a list of journals for MEDDATE leniency is that the journal is irrelevant.  A paper in Journal X that is 5 years old can be out of date.  A paper in that same Journal X, but twice as old, can be the not merely up to date, but also the best possible source for a given claim.  In practice, a reasonable starting point is to go to PubMed and search for the material in question.  If the currently cited article is in the five most recent review articles (or primary sources, if it's a subject that can be acceptably supported by a primary source), and you didn't see anything in the list that appeared to contradict the content, then it's probably fine, even if it's more than ten years old.  In short, you can't evaluate MEDDATE unless you consider both the availability of newer sources and P:RSCONTEXT.  It is not really something that can be easily automated.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 20:53, 14 February 2019 (UTC)
Journals change publisher. We include the information on the article for the journal. For the purposes of a single term in a citation, the publisher is the publisher at the time the article was published. As for what sources to use , and how far back to include references, I agree wholeheartedly with |WhatamIdoing that it needs judgement, not fixed rules or automation. We list the date and the journal and the authors, and the readers are given the information to judge. Just like everywhere in WP , we do not judge for them.  There are very few parts of human knowledge  where there are simple answers that cannot be expected to change with time.   The general concept is known asprogress.  ser:DGG| DGG (ser talk:DGG| talk ) 06:09, 15 February 2019 (UTC)
ing|WhatamIdoing ing|DGG That was actually not what I meant, so I'll expand. For the purposes of MEDDATE, and MEDREV, one can compile a list of exceptions to be treated differently, calling it a whitelist if the treatment is lenient, a blacklist to exclude. Instead of a case-by-case whitelist of papers, one can use the &quot;main subject&quot; property on Wikidata, and create a list of subjects, in relation to which one will show leniency. So that addresses the &quot;neglected disease&quot; concept, which is an example of what we are used to calling systematic bias, within the biomedical literature. The main point is that it is possible to correct for that bias in applying MEDRS, and this is common ground. So the next point is exactly how to do that.
Putting it another way, the phrase used above &quot;only for areas of research which are active&quot; can be turned around to ask &quot;what medical areas are there (with a serious global burden of disease) where research is (undeservedly) relatively inactive?&quot;, and use that as a working definition of &quot;neglected disease&quot;. Operationally, one then needs a reasonable consensus definition in terms of a list. Leptospirosis is an example for which the WHO is still making up its mind. ser:Charles Matthews|Charles Matthews (ser talk:Charles Matthews|talk) 07:17, 15 February 2019 (UTC)
If ser:Charles Matthews|you're looking for something that works to a first approximation, then you could probably use rare disease status in the U.S. as the dividing line.  There are cases where this isn't true (e.g., ack labor probably affects a million American women each year, but almost nobody has ever done any serious research into it; cystic fibrosis is rare but actively researched), but as a starting point, you can assume that the five-year advice doesn't apply to most rare diseases, and that it does apply to most non-rare diseases.
But I think you'll find that it's more complicated than that.  Research into heart attacks is common, but a source that talks about a specific subpopulation might be quite rare.  For example, MID|28238152 is the only review article I could find at PubMed during the last five years that was obviously about myocardial infarction in babies.  &quot;Neonates&quot; and &quot;Myocardial infarction&quot; are both common keywords, but when you put them together, we wouldn't necessarily want to apply the five-year standard to the resulting subject.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 20:43, 18 February 2019 (UTC)
ing|WhatamIdoing Thanks, I am actually considering factoring in rare disease status, in terms of the GARD ID (Genetic and Rare Disease database of the NIH). But &quot;neglected&quot; and &quot;rare&quot; are certainly different, with &quot;neglected&quot; seeming to be a harder issue to handle all round.

The nature of the most reliable sources will change with the subject, not just from field to field, but within the many special areas making up the broad field of medicine.  The general rule has always been that we use the best we can find, as long as it meets the basic criteria of being a publisher with editorial control. I understand the reasons why this project has very reasonably thought it necessary to limit itself to a subset of possible sources, but   unless this is interpreted very flexibly it can be in some degree of conflict to the basic principles of WP.  I appreciate the recognition that there are fields whee the medical orthodoxy is still uncertain  The problem |JzG mentions is not that uncommon here or elsewhere-:it's the general problem where the majority of the available sources in a subject represents an unusual or nonscientific prospective. Within our policies, there is sometimes no easy solution, except making sure our articles on the questionable sources indicate their nature. Overall,I don't think we're in basic disagreement. ser:DGG| DGG (ser talk:DGG| talk ) 11:00, 15 February 2019 (UTC)

 emplate:Infobox medical condition (new) vs. alternative names in the lead  

Doc has been updating medical articles with emplate:Infobox medical condition (new). While doing that, he has also moved a number of alternative names out of the lead and into the synonyms field of the new infobox, such as [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spinal_disease&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=883065285 here] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paroxysmal_cold_hemoglobinuria&amp;diff=883058764&amp;oldid=883058287 here]. But considering that P:NCMED|our medical articles often go by the scientific/medical name, the scientific/medical name isn't always P:Common name|the common name. For example, in the case of yocardial infarction, &quot;heart attack&quot; is the common name and the article [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Myocardial_infarction&amp;oldid=882857248 currently] states &quot;commonly known as a heart attack.&quot; I think that &quot;heart attack&quot; should continue to be mentioned and bolded in the lead of that article. In cases like that one, where the topic is dealing with a very common name, or an otherwise significant alternative name, I think that the alternative name should remain in the lead. I'm not stating that three or more names need to be in the lead, though. I understand how that can make the lead cluttered. P:Alternative name states, &quot;If there are three or more alternative names – including alternative spellings, longer or shorter forms, historic names, and significant names in other languages – or there is something notable about the names themselves, a separate name section is recommended.&quot; 

Anyway, while updating these articles with the new infobox, Doc has also left the alternative name in the lead in some cases. For example, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hypotonia&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=883078798 here], [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Functional_gastrointestinal_disorder&amp;diff=883077651&amp;oldid=883077023 here] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Braxton_Hicks_contractions&amp;diff=883083194&amp;oldid=883083110 here]. 

Thoughts? And, Doc, are you weighing the benefits of keeping the alternative name in the lead in some cases? Is that why you have left the alternative name in the lead in some cases but not in others? The old infobox has a synonyms field as well, but we still kept the alternative name in the lead. ser:Flyer22 Reborn|Flyer22 Reborn (ser talk:Flyer22 Reborn|talk) 11:04, 13 February 2019 (UTC) ser:Flyer22 Reborn|Flyer22 Reborn (ser talk:Flyer22 Reborn|talk) 11:13, 13 February 2019 (UTC)
ser:Flyer22 Reborn if the alternative name is simple a minor spelling difference IMO that does not need to be in the first sentence. If the alternate name is the more common one it should remain in the first sentence. So I agree heart attack should remain in the first sentence of MI.
&quot;dorsopathy&quot; is a term that no one really uses so should go in the infobox IMO.

 rugada syndrome versus udden unexpected nocturnal death syndrome versus udden unexplained nocturnal death syndrome versus udden arrhythmic death syndrome 

Hi, so there appears to be separate bodies of research on SUNDS and Brugada, although I believe the Brugadas themselves are actively doing research that Brugada syndrome is SUNDS. ing|Doc James I think prefers to use NIH sources that makes this assertion. However, I believe we should also address that physicians in East Asia had known SUNDS for 60 years before Brugada, the indigenous peoples possibly centuries before that, and while very important work was done in the 1980s, it would be P:UNDUE|UNDUE to only focus on research by Western physicians and to exclude the history of SUNDS (pre 1980) from discussion at rugada syndrome. I am not sure exactly why Doc James wants to remove this discussion from Brugada syndrome, and certainly I believe udden unexplained nocturnal death syndrome should redirect to udden arrhythmic death syndrome. I_Na is not SCN5A, so neither is SUNDS the same as Brugada. ser:Yanping Nora Soong|Yanping Nora Soong (ser talk:Yanping Nora Soong|talk) 17:26, 15 February 2019 (UTC)
The requests were: 
(1) use sources that fulfill P:MEDRS and lots are avaliable as we have discussed on the talk page
(2) the exact same term can be used for a number of medical conditions, so yes SUNDS can be used by various people to refer to BOTH Brugada syndrome and to the wider category of sudden arrhythmic death syndrome. As such a disambig is perfectly fine.
(3) the final request was to write in easier to understand language and to put most of the discussion of mechanism in the mechanism section. Best ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk · pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 17:31, 15 February 2019 (UTC)
 Nearly all my sources except one (which was from an established investigative news journal) are peer-reviewed, and the secondary source (review article) tying in the contextual history is from JAHA in 2018. I don't get why Doc James wants to remove the contextual history tying together SUNDS and Brugada, and I was planning to add sourced material that further clarified what is linked and what is not. AFAIK, BrS is primarily diagnosed by ECG (e.g. to investigate unexplained asovagal syncope) whereas SUNDS is diagnosed by manner of death or history of sudden unexplained ventricular arrhythmia / aborted udden cardiac death. This second diathesis was known to the indigenous peoples of Asia hundreds of years before the Brugadas arrived with their ECG analysis. Naturally, this leads to some divergence. ser:Yanping Nora Soong|Yanping Nora Soong (ser talk:Yanping Nora Soong|talk) 17:38, 15 February 2019 (UTC)
 I respect the NIH as an authoritative and trusted source as much as anyone, and some of my past income was funded by NIH grants, but the NIH is a human institution and I don't think it's fair to think of any authoritative institution as completely immune from systemic bias, e.g. the type that might lead to ignoring or glossing over the work of non-Western researchers and cultures. ser:Yanping Nora Soong|Yanping Nora Soong (ser talk:Yanping Nora Soong|talk) 17:44, 15 February 2019 (UTC)
We are looking for &quot;review articles&quot; not just &quot;peer reviewed&quot;.

It doesn't.  But deciding to make the NIH – an institution that has such a strong history of downplaying others' contributions that even its supporters say that its initials might as well stand for ot Invented Here – the arbiter of whether Asian indigenous cultures were aware of this before the NIH was founded could do that.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 22:42, 18 February 2019 (UTC)

 Brugada syndrome was discovered in Southeast Asian patients first, and the Brugadas have spent considerable effort to try to establish that the Asian diathesis of SUNDS is very much interlinked to (if not outright) Brugada syndrome. Even if we accept the NIH's nail in the coffin that SUNDS = BrS we should at least note the background history and not erase the Asian cultural context. ser:Yanping Nora Soong|Yanping Nora Soong (ser talk:Yanping Nora Soong|talk) 17:12, 21 February 2019 (UTC)
The NIH does not say &quot;SUNDS = BrS&quot; and neither do we. What they say is the term &quot;SUNDS&quot; is sometimes used to mean &quot;BrS&quot;. Those are very two different statements. Just like we say &quot;heart attack&quot; sometimes means &quot;myocardial infarction&quot;. But it also sometimes means &quot;cardiac arrest&quot;. Does this mean &quot;cardiac arrest&quot; and &quot;myocardial infarction&quot; are the same thing, of course not. ser:Doc James|Doc James (ser talk:Doc James|talk · pecial:Contributions/Doc James|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Doc James|email) 19:04, 21 February 2019 (UTC)

The testing of vaccines in third-world countries is controversial without implicating the propriety of vaccination.

 BGR-34 
ile:Emoji u2695.svg|60 px|right
The GR-34 article is currently a Biology and Medicine Good Article Nominee.  It concerns an Ayurvedic drug which appears to have received quite a bit attention in the lay press (largely in India) but very little in peer-reviewed medical journals.  Accordingly, the long list of references is largely to articles in the lay press. I'm just wondering what the stance is on P:MEDRS for this sort of article.  I haven't been much involved in pharma articles so far, and even less so in articles on alternative therapies and wondered if this still applied. These kinds of sources seem to be very thin on the ground for this drug based on a quick PubMed search despite the drug appearing to be a notable subject and well worth including in the encyclopaedia.  Secondly, what do others think of the neutrality?  The article is quite critical of the drug which is probably justified, but I wondered if others felt that it was too slanted in this direction.

I was tempted to have a go at doing a Good Article review for this one, but wanted some opinions on sourcing and neutrality beforehand.  

Also notifying the main contributor to the article. ing|Winged Blades of Godric Thanks, ser:PeaBrainC|PeaBrainC (ser talk:PeaBrainC|talk) 10:48, 15 February 2019 (UTC)
Thanks for your willingness to do the GAR. 
IMHO, MEDRS is applicable only if I wish to make a claim that the drug works or cures some disease or the like. That there is no MEDRS related to the drug is one of the core locus of criticism (and the article).
As to the negative slant, anything otherwise falls in FALSE BALANCE territory, IMO. Every report on the drug, that came out after the initial buzz, has been uniformly critical of it and the process invested in it. I also have two more sources (atleast one of which is more scathing than any I have read) but are sitting behind lofty paywalls:(ser:Winged Blades of Godric|∯WBGser talk:Winged Blades of Godric|converse 11:48, 15 February 2019 (UTC)

Given that the heart itself is innervated by visceral afferents rather than somatic afferents, pain from a cardiac etiology can present as so many things, not just chest pain. An article titled heart pain could so easily turn into a how-to/medical advice of the differential diagnosis of hest pain (and to add to the problem, cardialgia generally refers to pain that originates from the cardia of the stomach, i.e. heartburn.) In my (not quite yet professional) opinion, when people talk about &quot;heart pain&quot; they usually mean angina, since they see it as &quot;chest pain that comes from my heart&quot;, but given the conflicting arguments it is probably best redirected to chest pain. ser:Keilana|Keilana (ser talk:Keilana|talk) 19:27, 22 February 2019 (UTC)

Based on my findings, &quot;heart pain&quot; can mean angina, but it's not the only thing it can mean. It might be different when speaking to a physician who can observe and ask about other symptoms, but there is no primary topic when people search for this phrase on the internet. Sometimes they mean angina, sometimes chest pain, sometimes heartburn, sometimes emotional pain. ser:Thryduulf|Thryduulf (ser talk:Thryduulf|talk) 17:50, 25 February 2019 (UTC)

But those are a differential of what a person is referring to just like all conditions have a differential. Pts also say &quot;doc I got pneumonia&quot; when in fact they have &quot;heart failure&quot;.

 Ants and derangements 

Wikipedia's article titled ist of ICD-9 codes 710–739: diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue contains this line:
 
* erangement, nt, ed meniscus, nee
 
The link to nt is to an article about certain insects of the family Formicidae, and the article titled erangement is about a topic in mathematics. A derangement is a certain kind of permutation of a finite set, namely a permutation with no fixed points.

Hi all, could you help determine whether this is a reliable source, or junk science? Two editors at CBD are not seeing eye to eye on this.

It's not a great paper.  The stats used to combine the pooled data have been executed poorly.  The primary outcome was not specified in the methods but the outcome that the authors felt was more robust (50% decrease on seizures) was similar between groups.  Despite this, the more wishy-washy outcome of 'improvement' was stated first in the abstract as there was apparently a difference when assessed using what are arguably inappropriate statistical techniques.

Thank you all for the feedback. Other sources might be preferable, but published research, particularly meta-analyses, on CBD are in very short supply since the field is so new. The Wikipedia page for rontiers_Media has: &quot;The publisher has &quot;a history of badly handled and controversial retractions and publishing decisions&quot;. Nevertheless, both COPE and OASPA have retained Frontiers as members after concerns were raised.&quot;
It seems we should follow the lead of COPE and OASPA with regard to reliability rather than opinions of WP editors (no offense of course).  ser:Petrarchan47|petrarchan47ser talk:Petrarchan47|คุpecial:Contributions/Petrarchan47|ก 19:45, 6 March 2019 (UTC)
If such papers &quot;are in very short supply&quot; that compounds the problem. We are meant to be reflecting &quot;accepted knowledge&quot;.

The idea of a meta-analysis is &quot;accepted knowledge&quot;. The journal is not &quot;dodgy&quot;, as I mentioned in my previous comment. You would need to find that most of the studies included in the analysis are  of little value in order to make such a sweeping statement. Have you looked at the individual studies? Are none of them &quot;published respectably&quot;? And what is considered respectable (for instance PUBMED, etc)? I ask because [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1182327/recent literature suggests] we have a serious problem. And [https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2017/jun/06/why-we-cant-trust-academic-journals-to-tell-the-scientific-truth here's another one].  ser:Petrarchan47|petrarchan47ser talk:Petrarchan47|คุpecial:Contributions/Petrarchan47|ก 21:08, 6 March 2019 (UTC)
I agree with Petra that we should follow the lead of COPE and OASPA and not write off papers just because they've been published in Frontiers.  Equally, we should not blindly accept a study just because it is a &quot;meta-analysis&quot;. Even if the individual studies that a meta-analysis combines the results of are of good quality, if the synthesis is performed badly then the results of the meta-analysis are open to criticism.
This is not a well-performed meta-analysis.  To state For epileptics, CBD-rich extracts were found to have a &quot;better therapeutic potential&quot; misrepresents the findings of this paper.  The robust outcome measure of efficacy (&gt;50% seizure reduction) was similar between groups.  The weak outcome measure (improvement in frequency of seizures) attained statistical significance through the inappropriate use of statistical tests.  Without meaning to get technical, if you are doing a meta-analysis you cannot just add all the numerators together and all the denominators together and compare that to another group of summed numerators and denominators with a simple test like a Fishers (as they have done here). If you have such heterogeneity between studies, as is seen in this case (e.g. sample size &lt;10 to &gt;100, large differences in dosing), you need to do a proper random-effects pooled estimate.  This makes it much harder to achieve statistical significance.
If you really wanted to include this paper then my feeling is that the only accurate description of the findings would be to say that &quot;Observational studies suggest that CBD may improve the symptoms of epilepsy, but strong evidence that purified CBD is more effective than whole-plant extracts is lacking&quot;. ser:PeaBrainC|PeaBrainC (ser talk:PeaBrainC|talk) 22:18, 6 March 2019 (UTC)
On the one hand, I am absolutely thrilled that ser:PeaBrainC|you have outed yourself as being competent in statistics.  Expect to get pinged for help, and I hope to see many, many more comments from you.  ;-)
On the other hand, we have had such a long and ugly history of editors who &quot;interpret&quot; the study's methodology according to whether its conclusions match their pre-existing opinions, and then come up with plausible-sounding objections to justify their bias, that we've basically had to ban that.  It really hurts when we get an editor like you, but it's just been such a problem that we can't do it.  
Please note that no editor is ever (absolutely, zero exceptions, not ever) required to cite a source that the editor personally thinks is weak (even if everyone else says that the editor is indisputably wrong).  You are never required to write something that you personally believe is not justified by a reliable source.  We are determined to protect your right to refuse to do something that you believe harms the project.  You can even explain (as you did here) your concerns about it.  Where the &quot;ban&quot; comes in to play is that an editor can't actually force other editors to reject a source based upon an editor's own analysis of its flaws.  
I grant that this rule has downsides.  I grant that it leads to some disingenuous objections.  Many times, &quot;I think this source sucks because it says _____&quot; gets presented as &quot;The ikipedia:Impact factors are too low for this journal&quot;.  But the rule stops a whole lot of other arguments, and on balance, I think it's the right decision.
And, if you know anyone who wants a few article credits, then please feel free to ask them to publish a critique.  While we can't accept the word of an editor, because ikipedia:You are not a reliable source|editors are not reliable sources, a properly published source that says a statistical analysis was incorrect is a very good reason to drop or downplay a source.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 03:33, 7 March 2019 (UTC)

 Hi |SlimVirgin|Sarah, I think the clearest exposition is at P:MEDASSESS: q|&quot;Assessing evidence quality&quot; means editors should determine quality of the type of source and quality of the publication. Editors should not perform detailed academic peer review. WAID may have had other examples in mind. We have had so many problems over the years in medical topics with editors wanting to reject sources because the conclusions of a review differed from their own analysis, that we've had to reluctantly accept that it is not safe to allow editors' analyses to overrule the analyses of published authors in reputable journals. HTH --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 22:21, 7 March 2019 (UTC)
Yes, that's the part of MEDRS that I had primarily in mind.  Looking at the quality of a source is necessary, but we should not be picking apart details like whether the researchers included the &quot;correct&quot; patients in their clinical trial or whether the funding source compromised the study.  That's a job for reliable sources, not for Wikipedia editors.
The standard we're aiming for is pretty close to NOR's views on primary sources:  we want editors to evaluate potential sources in ways &quot;that can be verified by any educated person with access to the primary source but without further, specialized knowledge&quot;.  If the reason for rejecting a source effectively begins with &quot;First, take statistics classes for the next several years&quot; (or become a medical specialist in the specific disease area, or get a PhD in biochemistry, or whatever), then that's well beyond a reasonable level of analysis.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 05:47, 8 March 2019 (UTC)

*I've never seen this hatred for Frontiers anywhere else, and I've read lots of good papers from those journals.

***# The authors hold the opinion that whole-plant extracts have a &quot;better therapeutic potential&quot; (which is almost redundant with &quot;had fewer side effects&quot;).
***What exactly is &quot;exceptional&quot; here?  It's not really surprising, it's not contradicted by the prevailing view, and it doesn't significantly alter mainstream assumptions (because AFAICT there weren't any mainstream assumptions about whether taking a lot of purified CBD would be better, worse, or the same as than a little whole-plant extract).  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 20:36, 7 March 2019 (UTC)

Thanks!  So now that it's been several years since it was in the popular news, I thought I'd look into ua's layer by running searches for .  Our med school doesn't have an optics track, so I was restricted to nursing and general medical resources, out of which I checked three:
*JAMA — two false positives, nothing real
*Medline — lots of results written by Dua, so I excluded anything with his name in the author field and ended up with sixteen references.  Some are significant, e.g. DOI 10.1111/aos.12823.
*vid Technologies|Ovid from Wolters Kluwer: thirty uses, including some written by Dua.  Some items unrelated to him are significant, e.g. DOI 10.1097/ICO.0000000000000413.
By &quot;significant&quot; I mean an actual article that (aside from its publication date) looks useful in my non-medical opinion — it's published in a refereed journal, it's a research article (as opposed to things like book reviews), and it has non-trivial references to Dua's layer.  But since I know that medicine has different standards from those in my academic background (history), I didn't want to assume that these were useful.  Could someone, therefore, examine these articles and check databases to look for coverage in others, in order to see whether this concept really has been accepted by scholars in this field?  And does anyone have access to textbooks with detailed coverage of ocular anatomy?  Dua claimed that textbooks would need to be rewritten; it would be good if someone could look at recent textbooks to see whether they have accepted or rejected the concept.  Our article doesn't address anything on the subject, aside from noting that no textbooks were scheduled for rewriting within a couple of months of the publication of Dua's article: no surprise, since they need to be cautious on this kind of thing.  ser:Nyttend|Nyttend (ser talk:Nyttend|talk) 21:46, 11 March 2019 (UTC)

 ermanwings Flight 9525 / deliberation despite psychotic disorder? 

Hi!
I still doubt, that a severe psychotic disorder allows deliberation.
Can somebody here describe the state of the art opinion on this question?
I mean: Would a MD say, that a rabies patient deliberately refuses to drink water?
And: Why does it feel different, when a cancer patient would choose morphine instead of a gamma knife?
In that article i even found some OR: It says it was &quot;suicide by pilot&quot; (i. e. _intentional_ self harm), but the report does not.

 Revising MASA syndrome page and creating L1 syndrome page 

Currently, the ASA syndrome page incorrectly lists MASA syndrome, a rare neurological disorder with XLR inheritance, as being synonymous with L1 syndrome (for which a wiki page does not currently exist). Multiple sources including [https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/l1-syndrome Genetics Home Reference] and [https://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?Lng=GB&amp;Expert=2466 Orphanet] state that MASA syndrome is currently considered to be a disorder on the L1 clinical spectrum (which also includes disorders other than MASA syndrome, namely HSAS syndrome, spastic paraplegia 1, and X-linked complicated agenesis of the corpus callosum). It was once thought that the disorders that make up L1 syndrome were distinct and genetically heterogeneous, however they are now understood to be subtypes of L1 syndrome (sharing a common genetic aetiology of variants in L1CAM). With this in mind, it seems timely to modify the MASA syndrome page to reflect the most recent classification of MASA syndrome being under the umbrella of L1 syndrome (rather than MASA syndrome being synonymous with it), and to create raft:L1_Syndrome|a new wiki page for L1 syndrome.  Fellow editors ser:Mahomeboy15|Mahomeboy15 and ser:Habibm10|Habibm10 are in agreement with this and would like to collaborate on the MASA syndrome page changes and the creation of an L1 syndrome page.

For right now, it's enough to just type what you've written here (something like &quot;L1 syndrome is a clinical spectrum that includes a, b, c, d,&quot;).  You'll want to add a source (so that editors unfamiliar with rare diseases – which is most of them – will know that you're not just making something up), and that Orphanet URL will do for the first ref.  It's also a good idea to add a category.  This is very easy, as you can probably use the same categories that are listed in the MASA article.  If you're editing in the visual editor, then the category tool is in the ☰ menu (near &quot;Publish changes&quot;) and will let you search for category names.  In the source editor, open the MASA article, scroll to the end, and just copy and paste the ones you want to the bottom of the new page.
Getting that redirect turned into an article is the hardest part (technically), and from there it's normal editing on the two articles.  Use the best medical textbooks and eview articles you can find to add content, and come back here whenever you have a question or problem.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 18:01, 13 March 2019 (UTC)

I suspect it's even more profound in emerging countries where medical systems are fragmented, and I have to wonder how many lives are saved by the information the community provides, how many women turn to Wikipedia during childbirth?  I'd add that there is 30-50% illiteracy in many of these regions with a [https://www.who.int/healthpromotion/conferences/7gchp/Track1_Inner.pdf clear correlation] between illiteracy and higher mortality/infant mortality.

Is this a dispute about whether &quot;CR [calorie restriction] is an established tumor preventative regimen&quot;, in an article that mentions the word fasting fifty-five times, should be interpreted as including calorie restriction through the method of fasting, or is there some dispute over whether fasting actually restricts calories?  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 06:24, 15 March 2019 (UTC)
P:SYNTHESIS is best avoided. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn (ser talk:Alexbrn|talk) 06:39, 15 March 2019 (UTC)
 There is little doubt that fasting restricts calories, but fasting restricts other foodstuffs as well, and calorie restriction may introduce substitute foods. In addition the timescales involved will be very different. Because we do not know what sort of mechanisms are at play, nor what the potential effects of other restrictions/other substitutes may be, it is not sensible to equate calorie restriction with fasting. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 11:55, 15 March 2019 (UTC)
I thought fasting was generally believed to restrict all foodstuffs (temporarily).  ;-)

Would you continue to object that it's not verifiable if the term calorie restriction was used instead of fasting in that sentence?  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 15:35, 15 March 2019 (UTC)
Well, it'll work eventually as the fastee wont have cancer at the end of the process. Or a heartbeat. -ser:Roxy the dog|Roxy, the dog. ser talk:Roxy the dog|wooF 16:11, 15 March 2019 (UTC)
 e|WhatamIdoing I'm sorry I wasn't clear enough. Yes, you think exactly as I do that fasting was generally believed to restrict all foodstuffs (temporarily). But that's not the point. Let me try to be clearer:
# If an unexplained effect is observed following fasting (i.e. restriction of all foodstuffs), we don't yet know whether the effect was a result of restricting calories or of restricting one of the other foodstuffs.
# if an unexplained effect is observed following calorie restriction (which often involves additional non-calorific supplements), we don't yet know whether the effect was a result of the decrease in calories or a result of the increase in a supplement (which would not be present when fasting).
 As a result, it is potentially erroneous to conclude that an unexplained effect observed following calorie restriction will be observed following fasting, and vice-versa. Please let me know if you still don't follow the line of argument. --ser:RexxS|RexxS (ser talk:RexxS|talk) 18:16, 15 March 2019 (UTC)
Your line of argument sounds like a very nice piece of peer review, and might have been useful to the authors before publication.  But what we're working with here on Wikipedia is a source that clearly treats fasting as merely a sub-type of a broad class of behaviors called &quot;calorie restriction&quot;, and that directly says that calorie restriction prevents cancer.  It does not seem plausible that &quot;any educated person...without further, specialized knowledge&quot; (to quote NOR) would honestly read that whole article and conclude that the authors didn't mean for that statement to encompass fasting.  
Note that I'm not saying that the authors are correct; I'm only saying that it seems implausible that the authors didn't intend for readers to understand that the authors believe that calorie-reduction-through-fasting prevents cancer.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 06:16, 16 March 2019 (UTC)
