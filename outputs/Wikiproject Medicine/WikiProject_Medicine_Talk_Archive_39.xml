 Cochrane reviews 

The WMF has agreements with a number of cell phone companies to give free access (without data charges) to all of Wikipedia to 470 million people. If people however click on our references via their cellphone they will incur data charges.

Have been in discussions with Wiley regarding the release of the abstracts of Cochrane reviews under a CC-BY-SA license and hopefully the entire paper under this license one day. My hope is that it might be possible to place theses abstracts somewhere within Wikipedia and link them from the references thus allowing our readers via the cellphone partnerships to get free access. I have discussed this with Kul and he does not see it as a concern. What are peoples thoughts? ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 12:54, 23 September 2013 (UTC)
Material released under CC-BY-SA can be changed by anyone for any reason (e.g., adding the word &quot;not&quot; in the middle to completely change the meaning).  If I were an author, I'd insist on CC-BY-ND (no derivatives/no tinkering with the wording).  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 15:13, 23 September 2013 (UTC)
The standard copyright in open access publishing is in fact CC-BY. ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 15:14, 23 September 2013 (UTC)
the standard copyright desired by most advocates of open access is CC-BY.  Some OA publishers use  variations on this.As for ND, one of the presuppositions of OA publishing is secure archiving, so an authentic copy remains available. Just as with WP. People can mess up our articles, but we  get the proper versions back again from the article history. ser:DGG (NYPL)|'DGG (at NYPL) (ser talk:DGG (NYPL)|talk) 21:34, 23 September 2013 (UTC)
We could of course begin by placing copies of Open Access (CC-BY) publications we use on Wikipedia right now. And than this could be a justification we could give to push more publishers to use open access copyright. ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 09:11, 24 September 2013 (UTC)

I agree, Wikipedia is not the correct place for such work -- some other WMF site would be better. ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 07:34, 25 September 2013 (UTC)
The point is to get access to people via cell phones (via the agreement that some companies will provide free access to WP). It will allow another potentially 470 million people to verify what they read on Wikipedia without incurring data charges when what is referred to is a CC BY document. Doing this may also convince Cochrane to release their reviews under an open license. 
Maybe people who are accessing WP from the developing world via their cellphones do not care about the references and may not be interested in becoming editors. But I am not willing to write them off without even giving them a chance. This move would allow them to 1) find free reference material 2) edit Wikipedia, all for free. We are not putting this material within the articles. This material is just as much for editors as it is for readers. ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 13:07, 25 September 2013 (UTC)
WhatamIdoing writes &quot;Material released under CC-BY-SA can be changed by anyone for any reason (e.g., adding the word &quot;not&quot; in the middle to completely change the meaning)&quot;. This is not true. The licence does not make it a wiki. The original abstract by the original authors (+ whatever editing the journal does) is copyright and the authors have rights over it and any copies made. If the text is is published in a form that does not allow open editing (which I would certainly advise), then it will come to no harm. If you made a copy and published such a copy with textual differences (beyond the most trivial) -- an adaptation -- then you would (a) no longer be able to claim it was the abstract for that paper (but rather, a work based on the abstract and are required to clearly state that it has been modified) and (b) no longer be able to claim the original authors were the sole authors. Furthermore, you mustn't imply the original authors endorse your change. The CC licence asserts the user's oral rights, so if the original authors feel your change represents a &quot;derogatory treatment&quot; of the work (which changing the meaning of a scientific paper absolutely would) then they can demand you remove any mention of their names from it. ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 07:34, 25 September 2013 (UTC)
Which, unfortunately, won't stop people from doing it anyway.  Under the current rules, at least they can get sued for copyvios or file a take-down notice when they do it.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:30, 25 September 2013 (UTC)

It may be a good idea to inform the participants there of the existence of this WikiProject and that they can get help here about the specific requirements and standards for medical articles. ser:Dodger67|Roger (Dodger67) (ser talk:Dodger67|talk) 20:29, 26 September 2013 (UTC)
Thanks for the notice and very good of you to help them out, |Biosthmors. Having run through the list of titles I would recommend that students do a search for existing content on many of the articles before creating their own articles, as I think that would be (a) needless duplication of existing content, (b) liable to create an article that will have exceedingly low readability; or (c) creating an article that already exists under an alternate name.

 For example, these articles (eg. Perisynaptic (Terminal) Schwann Cells; Cholinergic Neuron; Twice Exceptional Neurobiology;  Lower Limb Neuromechanics;  Neural Control of Limb Stiffness) may have existing articles full of content that could do with a sectional expansion or rewrite; (Temporoparietal Junction) looks to be a spelling mistake; and some are probably best covered as two separate articles or a section in a parent article (eg Estrogen and Neurodegenerative Diseases). 

That said, there also appear to be some really good articles proposed including (Neuroeffector Junction, Nerve Staining, Frontostriatal circuits) that could do with some expansion, and I think it's great that this class is working in WP. Next month I will start wiki-linking from existing articles to any articles that have been created. ser:LT910001|LT90001 (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 21:29, 26 September 2013 (UTC)

And the course page now links to that section at WikiProject Neuroscience as well, so presumably the students will be reading everyone's feedback.

 I just submitted a request for a small very small grant to rework the project page 

Hello all. I've wanted to help rework the project page for a while now. I've made quite a few edits, but I'd like to take it to the next level (with consensus of course, and an old idea I had along these lines was shared ikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine/Archive_30#WikiProject_Military_history|here.) Given that this ambition has been on my to-do list for too long, I've decided to submit an Individual Engagement Grant to the tune of $300 (now reduced to $10) dollars to force me focus on the task.

Making it more concise/professional looking by playing around with ser:Biosthmors/TestProjectPage, perhaps. Improving the navigation bar. Maybe doing some consolidation.

Hi |Biosthmors, I can't say I agree with this. Firstly and primarily, I don't think this is fair or equitable considering the large amount of non-paid Wikipedians who put time and edit into editing this encyclopedia. Secondly, I don't think this is fair because I am sure the editing effort will involve other editors who will not be compensated. Thirdly, I would be discouraged that money solicited by Wikipedia's advertisements for administrative fees would be spent on such an end (which to me is a little misleading). Fourthly, I am in totalis against the idea of paid editing. Fifthly, I think that this disincentivises further unpaid edits to the project and its pages. Lastly, this is already an active Wikiproject and that an improved page wouldn't really add that much benefit, whereas a targeted grant (if there was some imperative this money be spent on Wikimed) would be better spent on improving a top-priority stub or low-quality popular page. So in conclusion, although I can see renovating the project page is very important, I quite strongly object to this grant. Kindly, ser:LT910001|LT90001 (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 02:26, 1 October 2013 (UTC)
The grant program does not provide direct support for content creation.  I have doubts that this grant proposal will be accepted, but if it is, it will mean that the project is considered organizational rather than content-creating. ser:Looie496|Looie496 (ser talk:Looie496|talk) 03:30, 1 October 2013 (UTC)

If you enable section editing, craziness like that page is much more simple to tackle, but I get the point that newbies will not have this enabled.

Thanks Lesion. And thanks also to Doc James, because I think it's great you mentioned the problem of material being tucked away into templates. My other &quot;micro-grant&quot; (for $40 dollars) is to address that problem in relation to training materials.

I propose to do this for all the P:Trainings, which can have many slides. If anyone has a problem with me getting $40 dollars to do this, I can also reduce that dollar amount down to a token $10. Or if you don't have a problem with me getting $40 dollars for this, then maybe you could support my grant proposal over there.

 Alternative Medicine Pages 

I think there should also a focus on the alternative medicine pages. I feel that these pages seem in many cases to give too much credence to practices that often seem to be lacking in evidence or only supported by poorly conducted trials. It seems, particularly in the case of hiropractic that too much weight is given to trials that show little benefit, and their seems to be NPOV issues where people's livelihood is based on what scientifically is often regarded as pseudoscience. After all, it's just as important to show what 'medical' treatment has no effect (or is possibly dangerous) as to show what is effective

 Diarrhea in Developing Regions 

Hello Wikipedia,
My name is Jordan, I am an undergraduate at Rice University, and 	I am here to propose the writing of a new Wikipedia article on Diarrhea in Developing Regions. Diarrheal diseases are among the most prolific in the world, accounting for a significant fraction of all infections, as well as a massive number of child mortalities. Given that children with diarrhea are significantly more likely to die, most within the first two years of life, Diarrheal diseases are a serious threat to the livelihood of children globally. Clearly, diarrheal disease is a significant issue in developing regions, and I hope to use this Wikipedia entry to outline the impacts of diarrheal disease, elucidate the primary causes of the issue (usually linking back to poverty and limited access to vital resources and human capabilities) and finally discuss both potential solutions and those that have already been implemented in these at-risk regions. I will draw my information from a variety of academic sources, mainly from journal articles, but also from information and data made available by some of the major organizations interested in this topic such as the CDC, and WHO.
Though a page already exists on the topic of iarrhea, it approaches the topic from a highly scientific/medical perspective which is incompatible with my approach and proposed writing on this topic, which will take a point of view more oriented around the concepts of poverty, justice and human capabilities. Another related page, iseases of poverty, already exists, however this article approaches a number of different diseases with depth; if I were to add to this page, my content would dramatically outweigh the content on any other disease. Instead of extending on these pages, I propose the development of a new page on the topic of Diarrhea in Developing Regions, which will focus on the topics I outlined above. In order to supplement the existing articles, I plan to add small sections to these pages with a brief summary of the information that will be present on the proposed page, and add links between these three pages.
Any comments, questions, or suggestions that I can use to improve my work are greatly appreciated!

Best,

That looks like a very worthy idea to me. Some random thoughts:
*Presumably you'd have some emphasis on watsan and on other technical aspects of development?
*It's quite hard to get an article started nowadays - if you're less experienced creating articles, it could be a good idea to start a draft in your userspace and then take it &quot;live&quot; when it's improved a bit.
*Sources are vitally important - they should underlie everything you write (but don't just copy &amp; paste). 
*If you need any help with the obscure wiki-technical stuff, just ask.
Good luck! ser:Bobrayner|bobrayner (ser talk:Bobrayner|talk) 21:06, 28 September 2013 (UTC)
This sounds great.  The main article at iarrhea should have a section called Society and culture, which could give a paragraph or two summarizing your subtopic, and a link to the proposed article at iarrhea in developing regions.  That will improve the main article and also dramatically increase the likelihood of people finding and reading your new one.
Look over P:MEDRS for information on sources.  We generally like secondary sources, such as eview article and higher level textbooks, rather than original experimental results.  Secondary sources have the advantage of summarizing a lot of work, which helps us get the overall feel instead of accidentally &quot;cherry picking&quot; an experiment that seems interesting but might not be representative.  You might want to look over sources like MID|22796685, MID|22480268, MID|22436130, MID|22419779, and MID|21975154 as examples of possible sources.

Hi All,
I really appreciate all of the help being provided to support this small project. Though I recognize that articles on the subjects of both Diarrhea and Gastroenteritis exist, I hope to approach this topic from a non-medical perspective (I know, I'm probably not in the most ideal wikigroup for such an endeavor, but I think it's a productive discussion all the same), but rather from a human capabilities point of view, which focuses more on the impacts on human development and quality of life. A more detailed proposal for my work, including many of my sources, can be found at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e8yzk7dj1MxIRIfa6aqykydIlhybukAgITgp4QDW9DY/

 Hi, that article sounds like a great idea. Keeping in mind what has been said above about sources and citations and duplicating content, as a registered user you can simply P:BOLD|be bold and create the article yourself.

All articles combine both medical and non-medical content. The article on gastroenteritis has a section on &quot;society and culture&quot;. What you are proposing is a co tract. A duplication of content we already have. The sections you mention in the doc are all medical in nature.
We have a section on epidemiology in the gastroenteritis article. We could start a subpage on pidemiology of gastroenteritis were country by country details can be added if proper refs are found. We could also great a subsection on anagement of gastroenteritis and revention of gastroenteritis were greater details could be placed. ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 17:50, 2 October 2013 (UTC)
No, he's not.  A P:COATRACK is when you say that the article is about diarrhea in developing nations, but you instead write a page that is almost entirely about something barely related, like your complaints about the World Health Organization or the importance of vaginal childbirth, and says almost nothing about the alleged subject of the article.  You might be thinking about a P:CFORK (content fork), which involves duplicating information—but specifically, duplicating information to push one point of view, not to split up things because of their P:SIZE.
Jpoles1 is proposing a perfectly fine l|Main article about a subtopic that can be properly given a P:SUMMARY in the existing articles about gastroenteritis or diarrhea.  iarrhea in developing countries is just as good a subject as IDS in Africa.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 21:15, 2 October 2013 (UTC)

I remember the WMF doing something like this for Wikipedia as a whole lately, not sure if and when results are out. IMO quality of some articles are as good as any professional published literature; however, the quality of many articles is poor. Readability is also hit and miss. We are definitely less readable than most government sites / charities but IMO most people want more detail than the government sites and charities allow.
In summary we have a massive amount of work to bring Wikipedia up to a consistent high standard. We need to figure out how to get more independent and intelligent people involved. I hope that the outreach to medical schools will accomplish this. ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 17:44, 2 October 2013 (UTC)
Just to be clearser:Jmh649|, do you think we need a thorough, rigorous independent analysis of the coverage, quality, safety and clarity of en.Wikipedia's medical content? If so, do you think that need would justify whatever WMF resources and volunteer effort it takes?

I wanted to do a trial of medical students giving one group Wikipedia, another group UpToDate, and a third nothing. Than have them write a medical exam and see which group did best. It would answer the question &quot;which source is better for answering the questions one the licensing exams&quot;. We proposed it at the U of T Samir and I and were unable to get ethics approval.
I would say that most of it is not very good. But not horrible either. Some of it is excellent. Do we need a study to prove this? I think we would do better by spending our energies fixing the errors Wikipedia is full of. ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 04:13, 3 October 2013 (UTC)
To chime in on this answer, I agree that it would be better to continue editing as it is. Such a study would have to be hit-and-miss given how much articles differ in quality, and because Wikipedia is not static it may only be relevant for a short period of time. On the other hand I empathise with your desire to improve and validate the quality of medical articles. As an aside, as well as the small risk of inaccuracies which I believe to be small, I feel the biggest problem with the medical data on Wikipedia is what is the omissions from articles; that is, relevant medical content about changes in aetiology, epidemiology and pathology and/or diagnostic tests used that have not yet been added to articles. ser:LT910001|LT90001 (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 13:09, 3 October 2013 (UTC)

*Re: &quot;I think we would do better by spending our energies fixing the errors Wikipedia is full of.&quot; &quot;it would be better to continue editing as it is.&quot; I'm not proposing anyone stops editing, or that we change our editing norms. The most I would hope for from this project would be prior criticism of the study design, and to at least read the abstract of the results.  
*Re: &quot;Such a study would have to be hit-and-miss given how much articles differ in quality&quot;. I'm presuming a design that would adequately take that variation into account.
*Re: &quot;Wikipedia is not static it may only be relevant for a short period of time.&quot; This is true of all dynamic topics (such as epidemiology). 
*Re: &quot;the small risk of inaccuracies which I believe to be small.&quot; Your belief is valuable but until we actually know with some confidence how often people consult our medical content (a stat ser:Bluerasberry|Blue Rasberry is seeking support for elsewhere on this page) and how much unsafe information it contains - from a well-designed scientific study - all we, the WMF, our partners, our critics and the people we serve (our readers) have to go on is our opinions. I'm personally a supporter of evidence over expert opinion, even my own. It is comforting to believe our content is safe but the possible consequences if that is a false belief are concerning, and all the necessary data and WMF funds are readily available.
All I'm looking for here is an acknowledgment that this kind of information is important. Forget about contributing any of your own time or energy to the exercise. I can't move on this with any vigor or expectation of success without significant genuine moral support from this project.

With your convincing points and some reflection I do agree this is an important topic. Some suggestions for research are here: Wikipedia:WikiProject Medicine/Research. I don't think that WMF should fund this research (at least not until we're improved in quality) but a good starting point would be to have a page and further discussions where we can discuss some ways to assess the quality and utility of our articles.

I would still like to do the study I described. IMO that is one of the best and simplest ways to compare Wikipedia to UpToDate or another source. Do we have people interested in doing this study?

 medical marijuana, NPOV/CITE policy, at edMen 

So this article looks entirely promotional to me, written entirely by one person. It has been tagged as WP:MED by someone else. One of my issues is that all of the links to media establishing WP:N are actually hosted on the website of the article topic. This, to me, would seem to run afoul of P:CITE where it says that external links, when they are duplicates of other media, should be in compliance with NPOV.

I removed these links individually, as well as some sources I believe to be non-RS, and made sure to tag them as such so that they could be reverted individually. I have started a discussion on the talk page.

 MEDRS and pay-to-play journals, Science sting 

Here is something that participants in this project should be aware of.  Executive summary:  Science created a spoof medical paper with glaringly obvious flaws and submitted it to about 300 open-access journals that claimed to be peer-reviewed.  255 of them responded, and many of them rejected the paper, but 157 accepted it -- which basically means that no genuine peer review could have occurred.  See http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154/60.summary for more info, if you have online access to Science.  The message for us is to emphasize that the mere fact that a paper appears in a journal that claims to be peer-reviewed does not guarantee validity. ser:Looie496|Looie496 (ser talk:Looie496|talk) 15:35, 4 October 2013 (UTC)
But where is the comparator in this study? Did they also submit it to closed access journals? Bad peer review is not the only issue in publishing. What about host writing were the &quot;author&quot; is found after the paper is written? People not submitting their article to trial databases before beginning and still finding journals willing to publish the resulting papers?

q|The message for us is to emphasize that the mere fact that a paper appears in a journal that claims to be peer-reviewed does not guarantee validity. - This is not exactly news, and the Science study is also flawed in singling out open access journals. Even papers that pass peer review with flying colours may well be wrong: after all, theoretically perfect studies with a statistical significance threshold of 0.99 will find false results 1% of the time. What does it mean for us is complicated: mostly it means what we always do, that is we should prefer, as sources, reviews summing up the state of the art instead of individual studies, especially for controversial claims. --ser:Cyclopia|cyclopiaser talk:Cyclopia|speak! 15:41, 5 October 2013 (UTC)

 Are mnemonics encyclopedic? 

Are mnemnoics encylopedic? There seem to be quite a lot under Wikimed. I believe some are (eg. SOAP), due to their development alongside organisational efforts at reducing medical error. However, a lot seem to be shorthand memory aids for students or doctors. Is this encyclopedic? Here are some examples I have somewhat arbitrarily grouped them into ones I think are just memory aids, and ones that I would say are encyclopedic by virtue of being the target of publicity campaigns, or representing an underlying effort at organisational reform, ie have some notability or relationship to the practice of medicine, or society etc.
* PQRST
* AMPLE history
* CAP-BTLS
* SHICE
* AST (stroke)
* s and Ts
* ocrates (pain assessment) ?
Encyclopedic mnemonics:
* BC (medicine)
* ICE (medicine)
* OAP note / BAR ?
Any others that anyone else has found? Opinions? ser:LT910001|LT90001 (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 02:24, 5 October 2013 (UTC)
I am okay with them on their own pages. We are not a standard encyclopedia as we are not limited by paper limits. IMO they are a little undue for mention within the main articles on these diseases. ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 03:16, 5 October 2013 (UTC)
Sometimes I use SOCRATES in the signs and symptoms section of articles for conditions which involve pain (e.g. typical_facial_pain#Signs_and_Symptoms). I will stop doing this if the consensus is it is not encyclopedic. Re articles which are about mnemonics, I would say that some are worthy of their own page and others are not. FAST would be notable imo, others which are used mainly by doctors, maybe they are not encyclopedic. Case by case basis I think... ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 08:57, 5 October 2013 (UTC)
In my opinion, we should have a ist of medical mnemnoics and separate pages for the ones that are notable. Anything that's not notable should just be a redirect. Ideally, this would be a featured list. If medical students can use and benefit from Wikipedia while studying we can hope to get more of them editing.

There is indeed a list in categories (Category:Medical_mnemonics|here) of mnemonics. I think that on a case-by-case basis the redirect idea is a good one as many of the mnemonics are simply 'how to' lists rather than things that should be in an encyclopedia.

Mnemonics belong, according to the existence of ist_of_mnemonics#Medicine and I will argue vociferously for their inclusion. No verifiable medical mnemonic should ever have been deleted off of the site, in my opinion.

I think that very few are notable/qualify for a separate, stand-alone article.  Specifically, the goal for notability is 'attention from the world at large', not being mentioned in study guides as a method of remembering something that is notable (like how to assess pain).  However, I have no objection to a list that collects them all.  That would be a great use for a list. ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 15:16, 5 October 2013 (UTC)

 Merge eponymous/non-eponymous medical signs + symptoms templates? 

See eg:
Template:Digestive system and abdomen symptoms and signs
and 
Template:Eponymous medical signs for digestive system and general abdominal signs

Arguments supporting merge between system signs + symptoms + eponymous signs + symptoms templates:
* Distinction between eponymous signs and symptoms and other signs and symptoms is quite historically arbitrary. 
* Separation between eponymous/non-eponymous impacts on readability and navigability and leads to template clutter (for example see the navigation tree provided on Template:Cardiovascular system symptoms and signs)
* I don't think many people would look through both signs and symptoms and eponymous signs and symptoms to find something. 
* No objections from creator (Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Medicine/Archive 9#Eponym_templates|see here, in 2008)

I think it would be best to merge these templates and retain eponymimity in a categorisation system rather than through these templates. Opinions?

Are we sure that &quot;template&quot; is complete, except for the eponymous ones?  They look more like general categories (&quot;nausea&quot;), whereas the eponymous seem very specific/rare.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:10, 6 October 2013 (UTC)
There's no guarantee of that, but either way it'd be better to have it on one nav. page. My main issue is that by far the majority of users will be using these pages to find signs + symptoms, so isolating them by whether or not they are recognised by an eponymous name is not helpful. Only a small amount of users will specifically come on to Wikipedia in order to find out about the eponymous ones alone. ser:LT910001|LT90001 (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 22:31, 6 October 2013 (UTC)

 Uncited alterations to WP:Med articles 

Hi everyone,
I've recently encountered an editor, ser:Nikpapag, on the ethylphenidate article that has been adding unsourced content to that article in spite of clearly stating that this is an issue.  Moreover, after checking his pecial:Contributions/Nikpapag|edit history, I noticed that he doesn't seem to add any sources when making deletions or additions to articles (you can more or less eyeball this just by noting the consistently small number of characters changed between revisions), and some of those changes, like &quot;bupropion is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor only,&quot; are just completely wrong - (see pharmacodynamics) http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2001/20358s19lbl.pdf

Based upon his history with edit warring and lack of response to other editors - https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nikpapag&amp;oldid=553041732 - (note that he constantly blanks his talk page), I think it would be prudent to watch the edits this user makes on articles requiring p:medrs, as he's been ignoring that policy.  That said, I'm out of P:3RR reverts, so I can't do anything more to fix the uncited additions I expect he'll re-add on the ethylphenidate page.ser:Seppi333|Seppi333 (ser talk:Seppi333|talk) 22:01, 7 October 2013 (UTC)

The nature of the editing aside, I think the statement about ignoring talk pages has to be qualified by saying there are often detailed edit summaries.

I am sorry to sound discouraging, but I don't think that the article should be expanded in this way. &quot;Gastrointestinal cancer&quot; is a collection of disparate diseases—different pathological processes, different treatments, different prognoses. The article should be no more than a simple list or a disambiguation page. ser:Axl|Axl ¤ ser talk:Axl|[Talk] 20:45, 25 September 2013 (UTC)

Hey, I think think that's a great idea. If we're going to do collaborations of the month, I don't think we should expand too quickly or we'll run out of steam; this small article (whilst with not too many views) seems like a good place to start. It seems like the next month's has also been nominated too (alaria, in the above discussion). I think it might be a good idea for the collaboration discussions to be kept on the main talk page to encourage interest, discussion and also to ensure that the collaborations don't die out from lack of interest or attention (which they might when isolated). ser:LT910001|LT90001 (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 11:50, 26 September 2013 (UTC)

I was thinking summary style article might be good. Basically a subheading of each type with a short paragraph giving key epidemiology stats, prognosis, causes and treatment. As long as the sections were kept short this basically would look like a list. ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 20:55, 25 September 2013 (UTC)

I like what Lesion has been doing there.  
I like the idea of descriptions that are longer than a disambiguation page would be, but still pretty brief.  If you want something more list-like overall, it could probably get tagged as a l|set index (&quot;all the things that are called GI cancer&quot;).  But if you just want to mention the rarer ones, and leave fuller explanations for the main ones, then then list at the end of eukemia#Classification might be a reasonable model for the rarer ones.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 15:42, 26 September 2013 (UTC)

Done before the month started?
From the great work of Lesion/Axl, I would say we're way past presenting something embarrassing, which was my main concern, so maybe we should pick something else? I think getting things from embarrassing to acceptable is a better result overall than focusing on the good to make it fantastic. Does anyone else want to find an embarrassing article that might not be too hard to cleanup?

Health information on Wikipedia
*ealth information on Wikipedia
NCurse, of course we should respond in some way. Biosthmors, yes, Wikipedians should have a central place to coordinate other Wikipedians who want guidance in doing PR on behalf of the movement. Lots of people already do this anyway so it seems worth regulating if people can be asked to voluntarily agree. Axl, these media mentions are becoming more numerous and I think that a proper response is a Wikipedia article documenting them. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 15:02, 2 October 2013 (UTC)

A lot of people ask me if health information on Wikipedia matters and I do not know what to tell them. I need help. In my mind, if Wikipedia articles are getting significant amounts of traffic then these articles are important. If they are not getting much traffic then they are less important, and if they get a lot of traffic, then they are more important. How do other people here feel about that rationale? Some content is more important than other content, but generally, traffic is a reasonable measure of importance, right?

I have trouble explaining to people that Wikipedia articles get significant amounts of traffic because the data behind this belief is not robust. I made a page on meta - eta:Wiki Project Med/traffic - which I am about to send to the Wikimedia analytics mailing list and maybe some other places and to Wikimedia Foundation people. In this page I say that I want data and WMF backing to support my making the following statement - &quot;Health information on Wikipedia gets significant amounts of traffic.&quot; If I am empowered with evidence to make that assertion, then I would feel a lot more able to say, &quot;Because significant numbers of people are using this health information, anyone who has a stake in providing health information ought to consider the Wikipedia articles which themselves are significant sources for this information.&quot; Thoughts from anyone? I might like comments on the meta page. To what extent does this sound like a reasonable request?

Also... I have been asked by a certain journal to write something about Wikipedia and medical information. I would like to be able to say something about traffic to health content on Wikipedia, if anything could be said that the Wikimedia Foundation could back me on. ser:Bluerasberry| Blue Rasberry ser talk:Bluerasberry|(talk) 20:02, 2 October 2013 (UTC)

 Traffic numbers seem like a reasonable request to me, but traffic doesn't tell the whole story. For instance, how many of those visits are bots mining WP info? Perhaps Google ageRank could be useful. It is one purported measure of a page's importance and it is undeniable that one reason WP articles get so much traffic is the articles' high rank in a typical Google search. --ser:Mark viking|Mark viking (ser talk:Mark viking|talk) 22:43, 2 October 2013 (UTC)

 Representing Social, Economic, and Public Health Aspects of Diseases 

I'm a professor who teaches using Wikipedia regularly on courses relating to poverty, economic development and justice.  Many of my students are interested in contributing to Wikipedia on the social and policy aspects of public health issues. (User JPoles is one my students.) It appears that most of the health and disease topics represented on Wikipedia focus on diseases and treatments at an individual or even at a pathological level. Although epidemiological aspects are often included, such information generally does not reflect the broader literatures that look at economic and social interactions and policies relating to health and well-being. Public health and social aspects are generally badly represented in Wikipedia so far as I can tell  ~ even the page on Public Health is only a C class article.   I do not see a clear organization for raising the social and public health aspects of specific diseases beyond an epidemiological tag on.  An extensive public health and economic development literature shows that poverty and lack of access to clean water, general health care, etc. contribute to the likelihood of getting sick in the case of many such illness, often through the related adverse impact on immune systems.  There are important feedbacks from such public health issues into various other non medical social issues.  Public health is an important area in its own right so adding this material to articles that emphasize prevention and treatment at the individual level doesn't seem to me to be the best plan. I would suggest that the whole area of public health and related social and policy topics should become a priority for further development; perhaps another project group is a better place for this discussion, but wanted to raise it here first and would welcome everyone's thoughts on this topic. ser:DStrassmann|DStrassmann (ser talk:DStrassmann|talk) 01:33, 7 October 2013 (UTC)
Welcome and this is the place to bring this up. Many of our articles have sections on society and cultural aspects of disease. For example for low back pain we discuss the economics and the effects on employement ow_back_pain#Society_and_culture and the article on HIV/AIDS discusses some public health issues under IV/AIDS#Prevention and economic ones under IV/AIDS#Society_and_culture. Each of these sections have sub articles that than go into greater detail. Much of Wikipedia need improvement however and more could be written. We request that all contributors familiarize themselves with our referencing guideline as see here P:MEDRS and our manual of style P:MEDMOS. Happy to discussion further. ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 01:54, 7 October 2013 (UTC)
That's a good point. In fact a lot of public health is covered under &quot;Epidemiology of...&quot; and &quot;History of...&quot; articles. For example, pidemiology of HIV/AIDS, revalence of female genital mutilation by country, emale genital mutilation (GA) which is an article about a medical topic written in a non-medical style, and istory of malaria (GA). For articles significant to global health, I think it's quite reasonable to have separate articles like this. ser:LT910001|LT90001 (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 02:11, 7 October 2013 (UTC)

I think it's important to get this information summarized in the main articles.

I experimented by typing in several different medical conditions into google. Not sure if this is unique to google.co.uk ... but Wikipedia's place at the first google hit has dropped to four or fifth for medical conditions. NHS choices and patient.co.uk results are now usually appearing first. I understand that google does not actually rank the search results in order of most visited, but rather they adjust the order of search results for reasons of their own. Apparently wikipedia has been demoted. I think the main reason for this is that Wikipedia articles are thought of as being too hard to understand compared with sites that are offering a simple and brief summary that is directed specifically at patients. Since patients are not supposed to be our specific target audience, I suppose we do not really have the right to complain about this. Other websites are just more user-friendly for patients perhaps? Or maybe the order of search results has not really changed and it is my imagination. Didn't wikipedia usually come up first for pretty much any medical topic?

Would be interesting to get some kind of statement from them about this, but I tried for about 10 minutes to find a way to contact google and failed. ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 13:54, 7 October 2013 (UTC)

 Moving two nav pages to history 

These two pages should be marked as historical:
* Pages needing attention
* Medicine articles needing expert attention
Their function is duplicated in the 'cleanup listing', which is also more comprehensive and up-to-date. Also this would help clean up the nav bar. 
* Also, we already have an 'Editor outreach' so both functions of the expert attention page (field queries; list marked pages) are already duplicated.

The requests are almost never clear enough to be useful, and nobody seems to respond to them anyway.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:03, 7 October 2013 (UTC)
I've reordered the 'cleanup' page to provide a link to the expert attention category (which is a category so can't be redirected), redirected the pages needing attention to the cleanup page (page hasn't been edited recently and is duplicated), removed the link to 'top importance' cleanup (as this was last edited in 2010 and presumably the bot is dead) and for good measure alphabetised the list to make it easier to read. I hope this is satisfactory and improves the overall usefullness and ease-of-use of the interface. ser:LT910001|LT90001 (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 10:21, 8 October 2013 (UTC)

 Welcoming new members 

As our project page has been getting more hits lately, I figure now is as good of a time as any to say this. There was a recent person who signed up on our list as a member.

ls|MedWelcome points people to useful pages like MEDRS and MEDMOS.  Since I usually welcome people because of their article edits, I usually add a sentence about that as well.  What we need, though, isn't another &quot;rule&quot;, but someone to actually do it.  We had two or three people doing that for a while, but perhaps they're busy with other things now.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:05, 7 October 2013 (UTC)

Sometimes I feel like we come on too strong and this is as bad as biting ... I'll use this template now, it's easier than writing out one or two sentences like I would normally. Btw I tweaked the wording of this template earlier today, no major changes just made it a bit more measured. Still not happy with it, but see what others think. I know this template is based heavily on the TW one, but these welcome messages come across a bit intense I think.
*Consider also taking out the second &quot;welcome&quot; and the exclamation marks. 
*Consider removing &quot;an essay from PLoS&quot;
*Consider removing &quot;general advice&quot; and &quot;general style guide&quot; (MEDRS and MEDMOS both conspicuously link to said pages at the top.
*Again consider removing wikilinks in text &quot;Welcome&quot; and &quot;your contributions&quot;. Too many hyperlinks, won't know what to click. Keep as few as possible imo. 
*What about integrating the sentence about WPMED into the first line? Like &quot;Welcome ser:WhatamIdoing, from ikipedia:WikiProject Medicine|WikiProject Medicine (sign up ere or say hello ere).&quot; Below I post the welcome template as it is currently, and below that a slightly tighter version to have a look at. ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 23:18, 7 October 2013 (UTC)

 Welcome to Wikipedia from the P:MED|Medicine WikiProject!
ile:New medical editor.ogv|thumb|right|thumbtime=2:59|320px|Welcome to Wikipedia and P:MED|WikiProject Medicine 

Welcome to Wikipedia from P:MED|WikiProject Medicine (also known as WPMED).

We're a group of editors who strive to improve the quality of medical articles here on Wikipedia. I noticed that you are interested in editing medical articles; it's great to have a new editor on board. In your wiki-voyages, a few things that may be relevant to editing Wikipedia articles are:

* Thanks for coming aboard! We always appreciate a new editor. Feel free to leave us a message at any time ikipedia talk:WikiProject Medicine|on our talk page.  If you are interested in joining the project yourself, there is a ikipedia:WikiProject Medicine/Participants|participant list where you can sign up. Please leave a message on the WPMED talk page if you have any problems, suggestions, would like review of an article, need suggestions for articles to edit, or would like some collaboration when editing!
* Sourcing of medical and health-related content on Wikipedia is guided by ikipedia:Identifying reliable sources (medicine)|our medical sourcing guidelines, commonly referred to as MEDRS. These guidelines typically require recent econdary sources to support information; their application is further explained ikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2008-06-30/Dispatches|here.  rimary sources (case studies, case reports, research studies) are rarely used, especially if the primary sources are produced by the organisation or individual who is promoting a claim.
* The Wikipedia community includes a wide variety of editors with different interests, skills, and knowledge. We all manage to get along through a lot of discussion that happens under the scenes and through the P:BRD|bold, revert, discuss editing cycle. If you encounter any problems, you can discuss them on an article's talk page or post a message ikipedia talk:WikiProject Medicine|on the WPMED talk page.

Feel free to drop a note on my talk page if you have any questions. I wish you all the best on your wiki voyages!

 Edit of Human Nutrition Planned 

I plan on providing an extensive edit of Human Nutrition, mostly comprised of adding content rather than deleting content. This contribution will be part of a class assignment. My contribution will present information on the health consequences for malnutrition not yet mentioned in the page including dysentery, susceptibility to infectious disease, obesity, and long-term non-infectious disease complications. This contribution will be set within the context of the social aspect of understanding malnutrition amongst human populations This will entail providing not only operational definitions of malnutrition and under-nutrition, but also providing the context that produces poor nutrition, including environmental factors and social determinants. My article will also discuss nutrition programs in the United States and programming aimed at rectifying disparities in access to nutritious meals and other social determinants that cause inequalities. This contribution aims to rigorously analyze all the different perspectives of malnutrition and inaccessibility of foods by including sections pertaining to: nutrition education, obesity, poverty and food insecurity, minority populations, rural populations, special needs populations, and the lifetime benefits of these provisions. I will draw from academic sources including academic journals accessible through my Rice University access, as well as government and NGO reports. I hope my contribution will improve the article by providing a different context for information about human nutrition and malnutrition. Also, I will be including primarily secondary and tertiary sources, as opposed to the primary sources over-represented in the article, helping it gain better status in the WP:Medicine. Please provide any feedback you would like or ask any questions about my more specific approach to editing and restructuring the article either here, on my userpage, or on the talk page of uman Nutrition. I am interested in helping this article reach better class status, as well as help differentiate it from the Nutrition article.

Welcome, Lauren.  This sounds great.  I'm interested in how US programs compare to other places, so if you have an opportunity to add a bit of non-US information, I think that would improve the article.

The term is &quot;coined by news organizations to describe scientific findings that link Toxoplasmosis to several mental disorders and behavioral problems&quot;. There is already a subsection of oxoplasmosis#Signs and symptoms called &quot;crazy cat lady syndrome&quot;. Whilst I agree with you that merge to Toxoplasmosis is appropriate, I think all mention of &quot;crazy cat lady syndrome&quot; should be in the society and culture section. Not to say the content about the possible links with mental disorders should go into society and culture. There is no &quot;pathophysiology&quot; section, in the article, and perhaps one is needed? Some of the sources are Media sources, and others are medical publications, some of which are primary sources.

 Hyperthermia-Disambiguation 

Hyperthermia is the morbid elevation of body temperature.
Hyperthermia is also the artificial elevation of body temperature for medical purposes, among others for boosting the immune system and as a complementary anticancer treatment modality http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthermia_therapy. 
In this context, hyperthermia is subdivided to: Whole body hyperthermia, loco-regional hyperthermia, intra-operative hyperthermia. Loco-regional hyperthermia is further subdivided to superficial and deep hyperthermia. Whole body hyperthermia is subdivided to mild, moderate and extreme hyperthermia.
Modern WBH (whole body hyperthermia) is generally based in heating the body externally, while at the same time preventing the heat from escaping to the environment. Heating is generally achieved by water-filtered infra-red light; other, more conventional means are also applicablehttp://www.heckel-medizintechnik.de/en/hyperthermia/products.shtml. The biological result is equivalent to monitored, artificial fever. The technology needed is rather simple, but the medical aspects are rather complicated.
Loco-regional hyperthermia on the other hand is technologically more involved, but medically very simple. The only technologically tricky point is to measure the temperature within the target tissue. Modern loco-regional hyperthermia is achieved by emission of a radio-frequency of 13.56 Mhz between two electrodes. The elevation of temperature within malignant tumors is achieved by condensation of the electromagnetic field, due to altered electrochemical properties of tumorous tissues. For this reason, this particular technology is referred to by use of the term oncothermia, instead of hypethermia http://www.oncotherm.com/web/.

 &quot;Society and Culture&quot; Cholera Section, Effective Cholera Vaccines 

I would like to add a “society and culture” section to the existing Cholera article for a class. This section will include information about the role governments play on the prevention and spread of cholera, and other socio-economic factors that influence its spread. I think it is important to make these connections because if cholera spreads, there are serious economic and social political repercussions for the country. Governments also play an important role in preventing/ helping cholera spread, an important connection that is not always made. As the current Wikipedia article on “Cholera” notes, the disease is pretty much under control in developed nations. However, it is still a huge issue in developing countries. This is a highly relevant topic, since cholera prevention in developed countries shows it can be stopped, but recent outbreaks in poorer countries show that it is still occurring, when it does not need to be. The amounts of cholera outbreaks have actually risen in some countries-like Haiti- over the past few years. This makes exploring its spread a highly relevant topic.  Does anyone have thoughts about creating a “society and culture” section? In this section, I will summarize a lot of existing Wikipedia articles related to cholera, like  “Cholera Outbreaks and Epidemics,” “Cholera Vaccine,” “Zimbabwean Cholera Outbreak,” and “2010-13 Haiti Cholera Outbreak.” What other topics do you think should be covered in a “society and culture” section on Wikipedia? Are there specific vaccines or treatments that have been particularly effective at preventing Cholera? Are there some vaccines that are still being used, but are actually not very effective?

 Hospital gown 

It would be very helpful if someone with some (any) hospital experience could go over to ospital gown and remove garbage.  At the moment, it's long on sexual side effects and the only style of hospital gown in existence is the style favored for comedy shows.  I don't want to speak for the whole world, but I'm pretty sure that my local hospital doesn't require patients to lie in bed with no underwear and open gowns, and I'm even pretty sure that they've discovered this invention called &quot;pants&quot;.  But I don't know just how much of it is junk, so I'd rather let someone else have a go at it.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 02:07, 9 October 2013 (UTC)
About 50% of that article is not really encyclopedic and unreferenced to boot. I don't like the image either. If no-one has any objections I am happy to trim it down to sourced content and tweak the language used. In my limited experience, for surgical inpatients, underwear would stay on under the gown unless it would be near the operating field or if the patient was going to have a urinary catheter placed before the operation begins (e.g. for a long procedure). Most non-surgical inpatients would be told they could keep underwear on I would say, unless there is some specific reason not to, if they are waiting for some examination or investigation which underwear would interfere with. Then again hospital policy is sure to vary around the world, from one district to the next, and even from one department to the next. ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 11:03, 9 October 2013 (UTC)

You mean this edit [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spinal_manipulation&amp;diff=569342374&amp;oldid=569328495]? We have secondary sources dealing with the question of safety. No need to use a primary case controlled study. This design does not prove that the risks are &quot;identical&quot;.

Yes that edit. To be honest, I think it was arbitrary and P:BITE|bitey, so that's why I reverted it and tagged the article with l|medref. If we have a new person improving Wikipedia content we shouldn't revert them because it's not perfect. In fact, we should P:PRESERVE when we can. And the edit summary there is factually incorrect per P:MEDREV because MEDRS allows the use of primary sources. 

Let's consider another scenario. What if we had a nice paragraph with content from secondary sources but then we had an edit that incorporated good content from a primary source but could be converted to a secondary one, by simply changing the reference? In that case then we have perfect example of why we might use l|npsn. It would be horrible to revert that contribution. I feel like we should have some essay about this, or maybe a section somewhere. I'm afraid &quot;secondary&quot;/&quot;MEDRS&quot; mis-application chases away potential new editors. ser:Biosthmors|Biosthmors (ser talk:Biosthmors|talk) pls ikipedia:Notifications#Features|notify me (i.e. [Template:U|U) while signing a reply, thx 17:54, 4 October 2013 (UTC)

Should we, as WikiProject Medicine editors, use factually inaccurate edit summaries, generally speaking? When should we revert and when should we not?

We should not be determining our policy around primary versus secondary sources at someone RfA nomination. If you want to alter the MEDRS policy please bring the discussion there.
For example just reverted [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder&amp;curid=64976&amp;diff=575760217&amp;oldid=575667848] with the summary that we need a proper secondary source. Primary sources and especially newspaper are often over promotional.  
This review states &quot;in our view the QEEG variables are artifact-prone and biologically unspecific&quot; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23381169].

Thanks for your edits. In my opinion, there's nothing I've said that suggests I want to change MEDRS.

*|Biosthmors I think I see two points you'd like addressed, one about the edit summaries, and one about how to respond to edits based on primary sources when the article already has so many primary sources in it, what's the difference--why revert it if it will avoid a &quot;bite&quot;?Regarding edit summaries, things like &quot;secondary sources are required&quot; or &quot;all we do is summarize secondary sources&quot; aren't technically correct, as P:MEDRS does allow for the use of primary sources in certain situations. In the future, where needed I will change my edit summaries to something like &quot;secondary sources should be used if available&quot; or &quot;please use secondary sources&quot;.Regarding primary sources added in a situation like the addition of Cassidy 2008 to pinal manipulation, I see your point: if the article section is already poor and has orphaned primary sources in it, what's the harm in letting another one get added to avoid having a new editor feel bitten? Personally, I see this situation as the right time to introduce a new editor to the importance of secondary sources. In this particular case, after the Bold edit and ser:Jmh649|Doc's Revert, there was a really great Discussion ser talk:Jmh649/Archive 50#Spinal Manipulation Cassidy et al|here between yourself, Doc James and the editor, and the editor was very welcoming of the pointer to P:MEDRS, the explanation of the importance of secondary sources, and the help and advice they were receiving--all with the edit removed from the article (before it was restored). I think that's exactly the way it should work. The existence of poorly-used primary sources isn't justification for allowing the addition of more. Our article content shouldn't be allowed to get worse because we're welcoming or teaching new editors, and the discussion pointed to above shows that we don't have to. Doing so would be putting editors ahead of our content and readers, and I don't agree with that ordering of priorities. ser:Zad68|Zadser_Talk:Zad68|68 15:17, 8 October 2013 (UTC)
I saw the addition of Cassidy 2008 as an improvement to the paragraph, which is why I reverted. As mentioned at the RfA it had other problems, but let's try to imagine it from a newcomer's perspective. If we have a scenario in which we have old primary literature cited already, and someone comes along and adds newer primary literature, they are only responding the the paragraph's structure. Wouldn't reverting their new primary source addition without altering the old primary source paragraph be arbitrary and only based on the fact that it was a new edit? ser:Biosthmors|Biosthmors (ser talk:Biosthmors|talk) pls ikipedia:Notifications#Features|notify me (i.e. [Template:U|U) while signing a reply, thx 16:04, 8 October 2013 (UTC)
|Biosthmors, I can only point to what I wrote already.  In this scenario, the best thing to do would be to have a discussion with the new editor about the current poor state of the article and what needs to be done to improve it.  Allowing the edit to stand not only worsens the article (in my view), but also teaches the new editor something wrong about our sourcing guidelines. As a result the article edited isn't improved and the new editor leaves with an incorrect understanding of sourcing, and will probably go make the same kind of edit somewhere else. As it turns out, after that discussion ended with the added primary source in place, the editor went on to make [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Denticulate_ligaments&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=569559456 this] edit adding a primary source, and used inappropriately.  Maybe if the importance of secondary or tertiary sources were emphasized in the original discussion, the editor would have used [http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00381-013-2044-5 this] review article and/or [http://books.google.com/books?id=JDC-dFMy-BIC&amp;pg=PA18 this] textbook instead? When the edit happens would be the best possible time to have that discussion, just like you and Doc had with the editor. ser:Zad68|Zadser_Talk:Zad68|68 02:33, 10 October 2013 (UTC)
Just because previous poor quality content / refs exist does not mean we should add more.

Cleanup goal?
I think this calls attention to the importance of the issue that was just fixed with [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gastrointestinal_cancer&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=574153458 gastrointestinal cancer]. The fewer embarrassments we have floating around the website the more likely we are to be the default choice of google (if that has influenced our page-view stats). We currently have over 19,000 issues identified in our ~28,000 articles. We should make it an explicit goal to reduce this count every month. How about we make a time in the future at which we hope to have these issues down by? How about by 1 Jan 2015 we shoot to have only 8,000 issues identified, for example? ser:Biosthmors|Biosthmors (ser talk:Biosthmors|talk) pls ikipedia:Notifications#Features|notify me (i.e. [Template:U|U) while signing a reply, thx 09:34, 7 October 2013 (UTC)
I do not find the cleanup tags the most useful. Any article that is not a GA/FA needs work and that means more than 99% of them. A number of GAs/FAs are in need of a good updating. ser:Jmh649|Doc James (ser talk:Jmh649|talk · pecial:Contributions/Jmh649|contribs · pecial:EmailUser/Jmh649|email) (if I write on your page reply on mine) 23:43, 7 October 2013 (UTC)
I agree with everything you said. But sometimes the cleanup tags make good points, and I encourage them to be applied wisely. These &quot;good tags&quot;, I might call them, are an inventory that contain valuable information.

If we can legitimately get the total number of them down to 8,000, then we will made good progress, because they are essentially serving as Wikipedia-allowed &quot;negative advertisements&quot;. Also, if we can get them down to 8,000, then the ones that remain will likely increase in their usefulness. Maybe 70% of tags are deserved right now, to throw out a number, for discussion's sake. But if we can reduce the number of total tags to a number of 8,000, then we might also make the 8,000 that remain 85% deserved. And in that process, we might generate 1000 new tags that are 95% deserved. All that would be tremendously helpful for our project and our public image, in my opinion. ser:Biosthmors|Biosthmors (ser talk:Biosthmors|talk) pls ikipedia:Notifications#Features|notify me (i.e. [Template:U|U) while signing a reply, thx 10:05, 8 October 2013 (UTC)
Hello, that is certainly a noble aspiration. I've been looking at the listings a lot over the past few months in order to try and winnow down the things which need winnowing. In my opinion if there was a way to view by date that would be useful, but as it is there are only a few categories (merge, split, copyright flaws) that are small enough to deal with. Moreover, having looked at the list, you end up with about 50% of the tagged pages being ones that are either in dispute, or 'difficult' pages that require significant editing to remove the tag (eg to complete a merge with reasonable quality, or integrated an orphan). Lastly, you could end up wasting your time fixing up articles with an aggregate view of 1 per month, which is probably a bot, by fixing orphans and what not, but could help tens to hundreds of thousands of viewers by providing good-quality articles on the top 1500 list. I think that what you're proposing is a very reasonable and noble aspiration but that having been looking over myself and working through merges and orphans I think about 95% of the time spent on such an endeavor is completely wasted. ser:LT910001|LT90001 (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 10:34, 8 October 2013 (UTC)
On the other hand one possible way we could do this is what you have previously proposed, which is to have a specific &quot;clean-up&quot; drive once a quarter (once a month might be a little unachievable), and select a specific criteria, eg merges, orphans or what not, and work through that. I'd be in full support of such an undertaking, which with our many hands should be light work. ser:LT910001|LT90001 (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 10:34, 8 October 2013 (UTC)
By the way, I think performing mergers that need merging is quite noble work. It's essentially &quot;classifying&quot; articles in article space, so to speak. This has much more impact than going behind the scenes and making sure everything classified as &quot;mid&quot; importance is truly &quot;mid&quot; importance, in my opinion. ser:Biosthmors|Biosthmors (ser talk:Biosthmors|talk) pls ikipedia:Notifications#Features|notify me (i.e. [Template:U|U) while signing a reply, thx 08:21, 9 October 2013 (UTC)
Thanks. Actually, one of the reasons this project has such an active back-end is because of the users (|WhatamIdoing, for example) who tirelessly work to classify articles by importance and class. This allows us to not only focus our efforts, but is also very useful when proposing and resolving merges and so forth, because you immediately get a good idea of where an article stands. So, more important than it seems at first blush. ser:LT910001|LT90001 (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 01:36, 12 October 2013 (UTC)

As shown above, the health issues that venomous spiders may cause are within this project's scope. Not everything within this project's scope is tagged as such; topics that mostly aren't medical, but have some medical aspects, usually aren't tagged as being within this project's scope. However, this is the obvious place to query help for medical aspects of those topics. So there is like a division of &quot;directly related&quot; and &quot;indirectly related.&quot;  The Latrodectism and Latrotoxin articles are currently tagged as being within this WikiProject's scope, by the way. LT910001's assessed both articles on September 30th, as seen [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Latrodectism&amp;diff=570788385&amp;oldid=564948836 here] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Latrotoxin&amp;diff=570788492&amp;oldid=400999620 here]. ser:Flyer22|Flyer22 (ser talk:Flyer22|talk) 14:27, 9 October 2013 (UTC)

 I can't judge reliability of the content, but it is indexed in Medline/Index Medicus, Scopus, and Cochrane Center, as shown [http://www.elsevier.com/journals/journal-of-bodywork-and-movement-therapies/1360-8592/abstracting-indexing here].

 Student editors 

I have moved the 'classes editing' to our 'departments' page for prominence. Might I suggest:
* Developing and posting on that page a 5-step curriculum so that poor |biosthmors and other interested editors have a standardised and evolving way to educate students. For example:
** Step 1: create account
** Step 2: introduction to guidelines on wikipedia
** Step 3: introduction to reliable sources
** Step 4: how to create articles, selecting an appropriate title or place for edits
** Step 5: encouragement to be bold, position statement.
* Development of a tag to be appended to talk pages so that the aggregated edits on student-related talk pages can be easily tracked.
* A wikiproject statement that outlines our position towards student editors (particularly those in editing classes). This may include:
** Acknowledgement of student editors as valuable contributors who may or may not have a permanent prescence after the project is done
** Respect for the autonomy of student editors.
** Encouragement to be bold (within reason) 
** Acknowledgement that student editors may not be as aware of guidelines as other editors, but this doesn't detract from the quality of their contributions
** Encouragement of feedback given to be clear and concise without excessive use of guidelines.

Example:
uote|
Wikiproject medicine acknowledges the valuable contributions that can be provided by our student editors. We respect the autonomy of these editors to make edits as any other users. We recognise that these editors may not be familiar with guidelines and may only have a temporary presence on Wikipedia, and thus encourage existing users to be positive, clear and concise in their feedback to this group of new users. We encourage these users to make bold, but well thought-out and well-sourced edits, and recognise that students have the potential to make lasting, high-quality edits.

This would have the additional benefit of standardising and clarifying our current stance. Kind regards, ser:LT910001|LT90001 (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 09:15, 10 October 2013 (UTC)

 Medicine in 2013 

Hello all, I am planning to create the article Medicine in 2013 as a list article that refers in chronological order to significant events in Medicine in the year 2013. I think this list should include: significant changes in international guidelines; significant retractions; significant prizes awarded; significant deaths; outbreaks; first uses of experimental technology; acquisitions of medicine-related companies &gt; $1 billion; NGO work, and so on. I think it is useful and would be very interesting to have this almanac. I would value feedback and any suggestions for significant medical events this year. So far this would include:
* Release of DSM-5
* PACA
* Transition from an involuntary to a voluntary organ-donation system in China

I would love to hear suggestions from other users as to significant medical events this year so I can start working on a draft. If possible I would like to use the principle of P:Affirmative voting, and request submissions rather than criticism of existing submissions. 

Kind regards, ser:LT910001|LT90001 (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 09:15, 10 October 2013 (UTC)

The article can be categorized with similar articles for other years in Category:Medicine by year [red link now] or in Category:Years in medicine [red link now], which can be categorized in Category:History of medicine and in Category:Years by topic.

 Feedback on WPMED tab navigation 

Tab navigation for WPMED was suggested by Biosthmors, and I think it's a great idea to improve navigation between major project pages, so I made an illustrative mock up of what these tabs could be like (see top of page). I added the tabs pretty randomly and I am sure it is not the best selection. Please see emplate:WikiProject Medicine Tabs if you wish to make any changes to the number or selection of tabs (it's a really easy template to work with), or leave a message below if you prefer. Importantly, what project pages do people use most often, and what would be convenient to have in the tabs?

I am also working on changing the look of emplate:MedTalkheader (here is a work in progress: emplate:MedTalkheader#Mock up- need to add archiving). There is no real reason to change the template other than to make it fit with the new right hand WPMED nav template and tabs. ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 11:10, 11 October 2013 (UTC)

Apologies, I thought you wanted tab navigation because I saw tabs in the sandbox mock up you were working on. I see you have removed them entirely, but if you were unhappy with the selection of tabs, these were just illustrative and I was awaiting feedback about which tabs people would want in the selection. If no-one wants them, no worries.
Apart from the tabs, I think the further changes you are making to the project page are great. The page is slowly heading to a more minimalist feel instead of being information overload.

We have a huge issue with the poor quality of medical publishing generally as garbage in equals garbage out. There is 1) fake journals 2) ghost writing 3) the changing of primary endpoints after the start of trials 4) journals that accept publications with the understanding that a certain number of reprints will be ordered 5) publication bias were much of the evidence never sees the light of day 6) and fabricated results. 
Much of this can only be dealt with by our governments stepping up and putting a stop to it. Some of the measures would be fairly easy. 1) All human trials need ethics approval and part of the approval should be a requirement that full data be published. If it isn't the authors / company are not allowed to carry out any future trials until it is. 2) The use of trial registries need to be enforced. If you did not use a trial registry you do not get ethics approval. The authors need to be submitted to the trial registry before the trial begins. No more finding authors after the trial is done.

 Molecular Diagnostics Good Article nomination 

Hi,

With help, I've brought olecular diagnostics up to (I think) ikipedia:GA level. So I've nominated it.

I've got a PhD in ioinformatics, so I'm confident of the olecular biology side of the article. But if anyone with specialist knowledge would take a look at it from the medical testing side, just to check I haven't missed out anything important, that'd be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

ser:Drianmcdonald|Ian McDonald (ser talk:Drianmcdonald|talk) 22:05, 13 October 2013 (UTC)

 I have no experience judging GAC, but like the article so far. Since GA is in part about comprehensiveness, here are some suggestions for expansion. In the Development from Research Tools section, I think it is important to note that lab and lab personnel also need to be accredited in addition to just the tools--a solid LIMS, good sample tracking protocol, HIPAA compliance, etc.  On the medical side, it isn't mentioned in the article, but should be, that molecular diagnostics play a central role in the burgeoning field of ersonalized medicine. Molecular diagnostics were the subject of a recent Supreme Court case involving yriad Genetics and the BRCA1 tests with implications for both companies and basic research.  There is also controversy about molecular diagnostics done within vs outside the clinical setting, e.g., geneticists' reactions to companies like 3andMe performing SNP assays for sort-of-diagnostic and entertainment purposes. --ser:Mark viking|Mark viking (ser talk:Mark viking|talk) 22:39, 13 October 2013 (UTC)

 I've mentioned staff &amp; system personnel, and biological patents, though agree more could be said on that.
 I've mentioned it's used by ersonalized medicine; I do not think there's a need to go beyond that.
 If it's outside the clinical settings, surely by definition it's not part of diagnostics; is there a reason why I'm wrong?

* It's great to have such active contributors, and thanks for your attention to the article, |Drianmcdonald. I agree with the above comments and suggest that you add some of these sections before the GA progresses. One or two paragraphs (eg definition of cancer, molecular diagnostic stages) are not cited, and page numbers are not provided for the citations in the book (you can use  p|page number  to produce an inline page number (like this p|page). Also for lay readers it may be a good idea to expand some of the paragraphs to help lay readers understand some of the issues in the article, such as SNPs and karyotyping, and how molecular diagnostics can help you karyotype something. Does molecular biology include FISH, PCR, ELISA, and the plethora of other acronym-based testing modalities used? If so, these should definitely be included. Lastly, it is convention here for all words in titles to be in lowercase except the first. I trust you are now replete with well-meaning advice!

** Thanks for your feedback! Molecular biology includes those test; molecular diagnostics uses them, but I don't think there's a need (nor, on my side, time) to describe all the tests that molecular biology uses.

 Wondering if I should skip GA and nominate mphetamine for FA. 

Hi everyone, over the past few months, and especially this past month, I made countless ([https://tools.wmflabs.org/xtools/pcount/index.php?name=Seppi333&amp;lang=en&amp;wiki=wikipedia or apparently ~200+]) edits to the amphetamine article, such as removing numerous primary sources and replacing them with reviews and fleshing out several sections.  Consequently, I was wondering if someone familiar with the FA review process would be willing to take a look at that article and tell me if it seems ready for an FA review or if it's worthwhile to going through the GA process first.  I'm at a point where I really can't think of additional ways to make substantive content improvements. Thanks, ser:Seppi333|Seppi333 (ser talk:Seppi333|talk) 02:28, 14 October 2013 (UTC)
I would recommend going to GA first.  The value of a GA review depends on whether you have the luck of getting a good reviewer, but in the best cases a GA review is more useful -- in the sense of improving an article -- than an FA review, which can easily turn into a circus. ser:Looie496|Looie496 (ser talk:Looie496|talk) 02:41, 14 October 2013 (UTC)
Definitely go for GA first... even if it looks great, you'll probably have a hard time getting serious attention at FAC unless it already has that green plus on it, they pretty much expect to see it at GA before FAC. ser:Zad68|Zadser_Talk:Zad68|68 04:13, 14 October 2013 (UTC)
Adding:  Right off the top, I see the article is missing Society and culture and also History sections that honestly I would expect to be there to pass GA, much less FAC.  I see you split those off to istory and culture of amphetamines... you can't just split it off without having at least a paragraph or three in the main article summarizing the sub-article, per P:SUMMARYSTYLE. ser:Zad68|Zadser_Talk:Zad68|68 04:15, 14 October 2013 (UTC)
 I was aware of that policy, but I was wondering what the general interpretation of it was before I went about including a summary section like that.  In any event, I'll have a cited section of that on the page in about 30 minutes, as I'm not surprisingly very familiar with that material.  Any other suggestions besides that? ser:Seppi333|Seppi333 (ser talk:Seppi333|talk) 04:42, 14 October 2013 (UTC)
Hi Seppi, if you can wait a few days until I've returned from vacation, I'd be happy to do a GA review for you.

 Frequently-updated Sources 

DRUGDEX, DrugPoint, Medscape, UpToDate are excellent resources that quote reliable sources and while I realise they're updated regularly (which is not a horrible thing seeing how we're in a hopefully rapidly-evolving field) and this makes verifiability sometime tricky I still believe that while they may not be considered first-line or preferred sources, they should be deemed acceptable. A good example of their utility comes with side effects, their incidence (which gives the reader some context) and pharmacokinetic data — to quote all their (these resources) sources instead of these sources themselves would be, to say the least, tedious and a waste of time that could be better used on other parts of drug pages.  ser:Fuse809|Fuse809 (ser talk:Fuse809|talk) 11:50, 16 October 2013 (UTC)
A source needs to be strong enough to support its claims.  These are likely to be strong enough for some claims and not for others.

It doesn't look like a puff piece, but there isn't enough evidence yet to say that it is a great thing.  Lunasin is a polypeptide found in soybeans, with substantial evidence for anticancer activity in laboratory paradigms.  Normally a polypeptide can't be ingested orally because it would be digested, but apparently soybeans also contain a owman–Birk protease inhibitor that protects the lunasin as it passes through the digestive system.  As far as I can see there is no clinical evidence for its usefulness, and the world is full of things that work well in lab paradigms but turn out not to work -- or to be toxic -- in a real-world setting. ser:Looie496|Looie496 (ser talk:Looie496|talk) 18:05, 19 October 2013 (UTC)

Depending on the claims made, these are probably reliable sources.  You are allowed to P:USEPRIMARY sources.  We strongly discourage, but do not outright prohibit, them for medicine-related information.  You might also consider whether the biggest problem is the lack of analysis (analysis is a common characteristic of secondary sources) or the sources' possible conflicts of interest.  l|Third-party sources may be a more appropriate tag, and one that speaks directly to notability issues:  if the only people writing sources for it are trying to make money off of it, then there should be no article at all.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:00, 20 October 2013 (UTC)

 ospital gown 

Hello,

This article is rated as a &quot;mid-importance&quot; article on medicine, but it needs help. I tried to clean it up but I couldn't find any references, other than sales sites and patent applications. I think all the emphasis on children and teen age boys worrying about underwear shouldn't be the main focus of the article.  It's also a &quot;fashion&quot; article, due to iane von Fürstenberg having been commissioned to design hospital gowns for a clinic in Cleveland.

There's a good reference about the proper disposal of paper hospital gowns to prevent the spread of infections, and I think from personal experience that the point of hospital gowns for both patients and staff is to prevent infection, and (for patients) to allow access during surgery or other procedures to the relevant patient body parts by surgeons and medical technicians, etc.  

This article pops up as first in all search engines I've tried because there doesn't seem to be any other info on the subject that I can find. Thanks, ser:Soranoch|Soranoch (ser talk:Soranoch|talk) 02:03, 18 October 2013 (UTC)

Have you tried specifically searching for nursing textbooks?  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 17:25, 18 October 2013 (UTC)

According to the article's definition, a ospital gown is &quot;a long loose piece of clothing worn in a hospital by someone doing or having an operation.&quot; It's not in any online dictionary, except the one in the article. 
Could you give me a tip on how to search specifically for nursing textbooks?   I used all the  search engines I know about, including academic ones.  I don't know how to search outside of search engines. ser:Soranoch|Soranoch (ser talk:Soranoch|talk) 20:12, 18 October 2013 (UTC)

Not sure there is any searchable online repository of nursing textbooks. Would have to go to a medical library and do some old fashioned research. I think searching keywords &quot;hospital gown&quot; on Google books is the best bet... ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 21:54, 18 October 2013 (UTC)

Thanks, but a search keywords &quot;hospital gown&quot; on Google books is not very fruitful. I put in a couple of references in the article from that search, but they are about at the kindergarten level. [http://books.google.com/books?id=4RakpSStTogC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq=%22hospital+gown%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=S6VhUtvqC4jo9ASMlIHIBQ&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22hospital%20gown%22&amp;f=false This] (which says that the hospital gown is to clothing what the VW car was to automobiles) is one of the few  on google books. I removed from the article some of the obsession with boys being frightened and saddened by thinking about being forbidden to wear underwear. 

I recommend that the importance of the article be reduced to &quot;low&quot; or whatever, since no one in the Medical Project is willing to fix it. Thanks for your answer though. I very much appreciate it.  ser:Soranoch|Soranoch (ser talk:Soranoch|talk) 22:41, 18 October 2013 (UTC)
Low importance sounds reasonable for this topic. I had a look on google books when I posted above, agree not many sources. Google scholar is one page of patents as you suggested before. I tried altering the keywords to &quot;patient gown&quot; which seems to generate a bit more book results... not sure if any will help. Also not sure if anyone can access these sources and what they are like: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23668100,2634202,11187850,4580818,4729213,260079?report=docsum]Difficult article to expand.

I usually search for &quot;nursing&quot; or &quot;nurse&quot; plus my other keywords (in this case, 'nursing gown').  It turns up books like [http://books.google.com/books?id=DMjexUibId0C&amp;pg=PA396&amp;dq=nursing+gown#v=onepage&amp;q=nursing%20gown&amp;f=false this one].
There's also information in that search about sterile gowns (worn by medical staff), which aren't what most people think of when they hear the word &quot;hospital gown&quot;.  Perhaps this should be moved to &quot;patient gown&quot;.  
(We've got about a hundred articles per person watching this page [many of whom aren't primarily working on medicine-related articles, or only make a handful of edits each month].

Importance and quality are two different scales on article assessment on Wikipedia; downgrading an article's importance because the article needs work is wrong.  This information may be dated (from 2008), but it explains the difference:  ikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2008-06-23/Dispatches.

Hi,

This is Ally, I've recently made some edits to the society and culture page the emale infertility article. I hope that the additions made will help contribute to an overall more balanced article. The edits I have made involve the world approach to female infertility, a growing global concern. I will continue to edit this page for my class, and hope that they will help to increase the rating and traffic to this site.

Am tempted to respond and hit the nail on the head, but conversely this is article is very small and responding may elevate its notoriety and be counter-productive. If a reply had to be drafted, suggest something like: Wikipedia is one of the most accessed health-related resources on the internet, if not the most. It has an accuracy comparable to, if not exceeding, other encyclopedias. Wikipedia editing enshrines many principles which are very important to the practice of medicine, including presenting and structuring information in a clear, cohesive and comprehensive way, using a strong evidence-base and understanding what constitutes good sources, understanding the internationalisation of medicine and regional variation, and operating in a collaborative environment.

I don't think there's much point in responding to a student's opinion piece, especially since her analysis didn't extend even so far as to explain why she expects academic credit for learning material and writing a short paper about it, but she doesn't think that other students shouldn't get credit for essentially learning material, writing a short paper about it, and posting it in public.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 19:52, 22 October 2013 (UTC)

I almost never review diagrams at FP, as I'm mainly interested in photographs. But good quality diagrams can be FPs. They tend to attract/need reviewers knowledgeable about the subject who can appreciate/criticise the qualities and perhaps compare to the literature. There are also reviewers who know what to look for in a good diagram (e.g. font legibility). The SVG format is encouraged as it scales so well, but for some images, PNG is fine. You could post a message on the FP talk page on Wikipedia and/or Commons and see what other people think. Alternatively, look at the FP criteria yourself and pick one you think may be a winner. For WP, the image has to be in an article, but on Commons this isn't required. ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 22:36, 23 October 2013 (UTC)

That's quite a good point Anthony, by pointing out that &quot;We don't do that&quot; is no reason at all. I think the &quot;no&quot; impulse comes from a place of reason (the no watermark preference). However, any wikilink should inform the reader about the subject of the article. So I would actually argue against linking in the ectopic pregnancy example. But, because I think we should acknowledge the artist, the best solution currently in my mind, is to have a subtle greyed out Blausen Medical at the end of the caption text that does not link to Blausen. ser:Biosthmors|Biosthmors (ser talk:Biosthmors|talk) pls ikipedia:Notifications#Features|notify me (i.e. [Template:U|U) while signing a reply, thx 11:48, 31 October 2013 (UTC)

Because photo credits and similar in-caption publicity for image creators is P:UNDUE in most cases.  In the case of a historically important image, the name of the artwork or the artist is often useful and relevant information:  readers will recognize the names of certain of very famous artists, and some may want to learn more about the style of artwork or the history of the specific image.  For example, there has been a famous painting in the lead of uicide off and on, and people looking at that image might like to read more about it (e.g., to find out if it's really a picture of a suicide).  In those cases, we provide information about the image and links out to the relevant content.  
In all other cases, we don't provide any in-article information about the image at all.  Modern graphical images are part of the &quot;all other cases&quot; category.  ser:WhatamIdoing|WhatamIdoing (ser talk:WhatamIdoing|talk) 16:04, 1 November 2013 (UTC)

This question is related to sexual desire of males. In the article SEXUAL DESIRE i could not find a very well known fact. It is generally seen that in sexually active active males, the time gap between the ejaculations affects their sexual desire. For example, if a man masturbates or ejaculates regularly(say once a day or once every two days or twice a day) and suddenly stops it, his sexual desire(or what we call libido) increases..It is also observed that the orgasm after a period of abstinence are also intense and getting and erection in a short term abstinence period is quicker..Why does this happen..?

 In fact, there are 10: Category:FL-Class medicine articles (reflecting a good deal of work by ser:Colin). More importantly, does anyone have a single example of a student editor who has helped content and has stayed around to continue helping?

auses of autism is generating the most trouble now, I gather? I'll take a look later today. But to answer your question, I've seen two, if I remember correctly, but I've personally observed a trend where the more positive interaction they get with a Wikipedian, the more likely they are to make edits after the class ends. I'll one up you, though. ;-) The professor I helped the most, and had the most interaction about Wikipedia with, makes an edit here and there on occasion. I'd say that being able to get the professor [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Wnt_signaling_pathway&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=571531206 to vouch] for student edits is superior than just having a student stick around. =) ser:Biosthmors|Biosthmors (ser talk:Biosthmors|talk) pls ikipedia:Notifications#Features|notify me (i.e. [Template:U|U) while signing a reply, thx 14:01, 24 October 2013 (UTC)
 No, that course is only one of many that are hitting my watchlist now ... for example, we also have potential meatpuppetry at cholalia, which is most likely unidentified student editing, although I can't get a single editor there to respond to talk.  I'm still looking for a single case where results amount to a fraction of effort expended.  Yes, the course discussed at ser talk:Sanetti is going to hit multiple medical Featured articles with text that is likely to be UNDUE based on the course focus; who gets to help?  Also, Colin knows featured lists better than I do, but I doubt that ikipedia:Featured list criteria|the comprehensive criterion could be met for ist of medical mnemonics.  Meaning, I think we could find far more useful ways to do something about editor retention, student editors, and the effect the latter is having on the former.  (For example, beefing up a guideline to deal with these messes.) But WMF employees will fight and put up faulty analyses of the benefits of student editing every step of the way, so ... soldier on, unpaid troops !!!  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 14:09, 24 October 2013 (UTC)

Oh I only did three of the ten medical featured lists and that was a long time ago. And I haven't reviewed at FL for years. But actually now you mention it, doing a list might be quite a good thing for a newbie or students. Lots of editors at WP cut their teeth on featured lists before progressing to full articles. You are much less likely to end up with an essay, or something controversial, or repeat work done elsewhere. I'm not sure about the medical mnemonics -- unlikely to be of interest to anyone other than medical students. ser:Colin|Colin°ser talk:Colin|Talk 14:23, 24 October 2013 (UTC)

FWIW, because this reminded me, and it was before Biosthmor's time: I remember good student work going into ikipedia:Featured article candidates/Osteochondritis dissecans and ikipedia:Featured article candidates/Phagocyte, but those two editors had 1:1 wiki mentors who were very experienced with FAs. These students were from a high school biology class, and a project which ran in ikipedia:WikiProject AP Biology 2008|2008, ikipedia:WikiProject AP Biology 2009|2009, ikipedia:WikiProject AP Biology 2010|2010, and ikipedia:WikiProject AP Biology 2011|2011. The classes primarily edited natural science articles; only 8 articles were WP:MED related. Out of a total of approximately 50 students, a few were arguably retained for a short period, but none is still editing except the teacher. ser:Maralia|Maralia (ser talk:Maralia|talk) 14:47, 24 October 2013 (UTC)
 hagocyte had GrahamColm and Colin on board, and you may have noted that I did not promote steochondritis dissecans.  Just sayin', because I don't see an example of good student editing yet. To further clarify:  I cannot speak to the other content review processes, but at P:FAC, every student-edited nomination I saw, promoted, or didn't promote concerned me to the extent that the work had to be pulled up to standard (and sometimes not) by established and knowledgeable FA writers, to such an extreme that I worried about the overall drain on the process and wondered if our scarce resources were being well used.  Not only that, but in some cases so many of our FA writers and FAC reviewers were involved in some projects that they became cheerleaders for the article, critical review slid, and I had to wait for independent reviewers to point out issues that were abundantly apparent.  It would be possibly worth the effort if any of the new or student editors stayed around to return the favor, but as far as I know, they do not and have not.  So, we put a drain on our scarce resources, where FA writers who could be doing many other needed tasks end up doing a prof's work for little return, and training students who most typically move on after they've done the obligatory work to get their grade.   The students are not invested in Wikipedia: they are here for a grade.  When we can barely keep articles clean, how do we have time to be doing TA work?  ser:SandyGeorgia|SandyGeorgia (ser talk:SandyGeorgia|Talk) 15:45, 24 October 2013 (UTC)
I understand your concerns. I hope we do things right at ikipedia:WikiProject Medicine/UCSF Elective 2013, and in such a cautious way that we don't eventually overburden WP:MED if we're successful.

I agree that the list would probably not meet the comprehensive criteria, and would most likely be an absolute monster without some tricky formatting such as the Abbr template (or other fancy formatting). I think welcoming new editors is probably more effective than engaging classes in retaining users, but on the other hand there a lot of articles that need attention and classes may be able to provide that. That said, I would hope that contentious articles or high-class articles are not the focus of such editing. ser:LT910001|LT910001 (ser talk:LT910001|talk) 22:28, 24 October 2013 (UTC)

 MEDDATE wording 

I have concern about how a sentence in MEDDATE may be giving the wrong impression from the rest of the guideline on P:MEDRS. Discussion here T:MEDRS#Suggested reword to MEDDATE section. 

Also, is the archiving bot still not working? Did this occur because of the cosmetic changes to the templates recently or is it a wider issue? ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 13:36, 24 October 2013 (UTC)

 Leaky gut 

I have just [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leaky_gut&amp;diff=578551588&amp;oldid=578508057 done a major re-write] of this article. It seems to me one of those cases where a fringe altmed topic is piggy-backing onto something more legitimate: that while &quot;leaky gut&quot; is a real phenomenon, the world-view in which it causes most things (e.g. autism, diabetes, etc.), and in which those can be &quot;treated&quot; with diets and supplements, is full-blown quackery. We were wondering in Talk how to deal with this. In particular I am wondering whether the legitimate &quot;leaky gut&quot; bits can be moved into legitimate articles, leaving this as a clearly-categorizable article on &quot;leaky gut syndrome&quot;. Any gut experts in the house? ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn ser talk:Alexbrn|talk|pecial:Contributions/Alexbrn|contribs|ser:Alexbrn#Conflict_of_interest_declaration|COI 14:58, 24 October 2013 (UTC)
No gut expert, but I am surprised to hear you say that this is &quot;piggy-backing on something more legitimate&quot;... was not aware this topic was considered legitimate at all... I feel a good example of what you describe would be &quot;small intestinal bacterial overgrowth&quot;; for which there is a legitimate scientific literature, and also a larger topic of commercially-motivated, CAM industry claims. I could draw a venn diagram of this. ser:Lesion|Lesion (ser talk:Lesion|talk) 15:15, 24 October 2013 (UTC)

As Alexbrn said, this is a real thing which has been hyped up in popular culture. The scientific name is typically ntestinal permeability which redirects to leaky gut. There's actually a pretty substantial body of high-profile literature around intestinal permeability, and it's not clear that it's directly related to losing protein. Although you wouldn't guess it from QW's perfunctory note about its faddishness, the research dates back to at least the late 1970s (probably earlier) with [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673679925078 Menzies et al 1979] (which was about sugars, not protein), and numerous reviews including the highly-cited Gastroenterology review by [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0016508595907084 Bjarnason et al 1995]. It's a fairly common and problematic thing in intestinal disorders. I was able to find a fully copy of a review MID|11907349 (2002) online, but given the aggressive interpretations of P:MEDDATE these days I won't bother citing it. A better choice if someone has access is [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1542356513009269 Intestinal Permeability Defects: Is It Time to Treat?] (2013). With regard to the autism connection, the 24 gastroenterology experts who wrote the 2013 review [http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/5/10/3839/pdf Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity: The New Frontier of Gluten Related Disorders] don't say it is quackery (although they do say &quot;only a small, selected sub-group of children affected by ASD may benefit from an elimination diet&quot;), but perhaps they're just part of the growing woo conspiracy. A suspected connection to autism is not new; see for example [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1651-2227.1996.tb14220.x/abstract D'Eufemia 1998]. ser:ImperfectlyInformed|II | (ser_talk:ImperfectlyInformed|t - pecial:Contributions/ImperfectlyInformed|c) 02:19, 25 October 2013 (UTC)
Thanks for those useful pointers to modern sources; I have incorporated them into the article. I suppose the money quote from the Gluten piece is: &quot;The leaky gut/autism connection has fuelled a strong debate within the scientific community, far from being settled&quot; - which is a bit more &quot;open&quot; that our NHS and skeptic sources; however the piece looks respectable enough. I don't suppose performing studies in the autism/leaky gut area is quackery; but delivering a &quot;diagnosis&quot; would be, and doing business off it it would be health fraud. ser:Alexbrn|Alexbrn ser talk:Alexbrn|talk|pecial:Contributions/Alexbrn|contribs|ser:Alexbrn#Conflict_of_interest_declaration|COI 06:00, 25 October 2013 (UTC)</segment>
