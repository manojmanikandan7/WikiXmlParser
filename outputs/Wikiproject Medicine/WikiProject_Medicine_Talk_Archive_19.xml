		<segment id="id27405145">Looking for citations

I see on [http://www.alexa.com/ alexa.com] that Wikipedia is ranked at #6.  Are there any other references, perhaps from a scientific journal, etc., available that I can site relative rank of Wikipedia among other top websites?  I would prefer to cite something other than alexa if possible. ---kilbad (talk) 15:18, 8 May 2010 (UTC)
I don't think that it is necessary to use a scientific journal as it is not a scientific statement you are trying to make but more just a statistical fact. Any secondary source, perhaps one discussing web trends could be used? If not then Alexa I think would be ok, it is not really controversial what you are wanting to state.--Literaturegeek | T@1k? 15:24, 8 May 2010 (UTC)
Also, is [http://stats.grok.se/ stats.grok.se] the best place to get page view statistics? Is there anywhere I can get some background information on what grok.se is all about? ---kilbad (talk) 16:01, 8 May 2010 (UTC)
Yea, stats.grok.se tells you basically how many people have viewed an article page per day, week or month. I am not aware off the top of my head of any other tools for generating page view statistics. You can read more about it on their [http://stats.grok.se/about &quot;about&quot; page].--Literaturegeek | T@1k? 17:37, 8 May 2010 (UTC)

Is it possible to find...

Is it possible to find the number of new pages created within a certain time frame which are within the scope of a particular project.  Restated, and more specifically, if I wanted to know how many new dermatology-related articles had been created since Nov 08, how could I find that out?  Could I use the  somehow? ---kilbad (talk) 19:05, 8 May 2010 (UTC)
You probably need a query using the [https://wiki.toolserver.org/view/Main_Page toolserver].  is the first name that springs to mind as someone who could tell you either if it's possible or where is best to request the information. --RexxS (talk) 19:59, 8 May 2010 (UTC)

Google editors

I have made a number of suggestion to improving our collaboration with google .  Comments would be appreciated.Doc James (talk ·  · ) 06:19, 4 May 2010 (UTC)

One concern is that a number of google editors are recommending against journals that are not free access.  I am not sure how to send a note out to all of them that none free access journals are acceptable.--Doc James (talk ·  · ) 06:31, 4 May 2010 (UTC)

Where are these discussions taking place?  (Do they need an explanation of the &quot;off-wiki consensus&quot; rule?)
Fundamentally, I think that we need to use the best available sources, and use paywall issues only to choose between two equally ideal sources.  If Google wants a pay-walled paper to be freely available to the world, then that can usually be arranged -- either by Google paying the publisher their open access fee, or by special arrangement with the author (who sometimes hold the copyrights and thus can reproduce the paper on their own websites).  WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:08, 4 May 2010 (UTC)
This is part of the google.org project linked above.Doc James (talk ·  · ) 18:49, 4 May 2010 (UTC)
Yes, but how are we communicating with these editors?  They're not posting to the Google project page, and they're not posting here.  How exactly do you know that they are recommending against paywall journals?  Where did they say this?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 17:21, 7 May 2010 (UTC)

Here is one comment which says this [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hemorrhoid#Citation_Verification] and it has been stated in one other place.  It is unfortunate that these reviews do not seem to be getting involved either here or the google project page.Doc James (talk ·  · ) 19:05, 7 May 2010 (UTC)

Good point, WAID. I was wondering about where this project is occurring. I keep seeing references to it but no actual messages between WP editors and the Google folks (who, incidentally, mostly (or all?) seem to work for a journal article editing company in North Carolina called American Journal Experts. Isn't this a bit odd?Postpostmod (talk) 00:21, 9 May 2010 (UTC)
Here is were the discussion is taking place [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine/Google_Project] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Medicine/Google_Project] But some more background on this would be nice.  Who are these people who have joined?  Are they reimbursed by google? Etc Doc James (talk ·  · ) 01:51, 10 May 2010 (UTC)
Well, that's where we're talking... to no one but ourselves, as far as I can tell.
My guess is that the reviewers (whose efforts I sincerely and deeply appreciate) are only looking at their assigned articles.  This means that we're likely to have to explain the same issues to each one, individually, at each and every article, instead of having a centralized communication point for them.  In the meantime, I suspect that we need to get a few more people to watchlist some or all of the articles.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 03:09, 10 May 2010 (UTC)
Good idea to get more people to watchlist the articles - but seems like a laborious way to check, for the long haul. Regarding transparency of communication, I posted at the project talk page [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Medicine/Google_Project] asking TimV how he's communicating with the editors. I'm not sure if that's the best way to contact him about it, though.Postpostmod (talk) 13:00, 10 May 2010 (UTC)

Will someone merge histories

Initially, the list of cutaneous condition was found at a different location than it is now.  Initially, the list was found at what is now called &quot;cutaneous conditions.&quot;  However, after various moves and renames, the list if now at &quot;list of cutaneous conditions.&quot;  However, the history of the list is fractured, and I wanted to know if someone could tidy up the histories somehow?  If that is even possible?  Basically, I would like to see the history of edits starting from [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cutaneous_conditions&amp;oldid=4407141 here] to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cutaneous_conditions&amp;oldid=236962648 here] moved over to the beginning of the history of the list of cutaneous conditions.

Craniosacral therapy pseudoscience needs fixing

Can you help me generate this data?

First, for pages within the scope of the Dermatology task force, I am looking to get a listing of articles that are either good or featured status, and the date at which they were given that status.  Second, I am looking for some data stating how many derm-related pages have images, and how many do not.  Could someone help me with this?  Thanks in advance! ---kilbad (talk) 16:06, 10 May 2010 (UTC)
There are 10 GA, 1 FA and 1 FL [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Medicine/Assessment]  Here is the list of GA [http://toolserver.org/~enwp10/bin/list2.fcgi?run=yes&amp;projecta=Dermatology&amp;quality=GA-Class].

All the pages are list within the .  Can you use that? ---kilbad (talk) 17:47, 10 May 2010 (UTC)
Or, here is a listing with 1000 results per page: [http://toolserver.org/~enwp10/bin/list2.fcgi?run=yes&amp;projecta=Dermatology&amp;namespace=&amp;pagename=&amp;quality=Assessed&amp;importance=&amp;score=&amp;limit=3000&amp;offset=1&amp;sorta=Importance&amp;sortb=Quality] ---kilbad (talk) 17:51, 10 May 2010 (UTC)
I can use the category - it should be straightforward to work up a script to pull all of the categorized articles, and then mine them for images. MastCell Talk 17:55, 10 May 2010 (UTC)
Can we somehow compare the number of photos present now, as compared with October 2008, before the derm taskforce was started? ---kilbad (talk) 17:59, 10 May 2010 (UTC)
It could be done, but would take a bit more work. Basically, you could use the API to pull the last page revision before October 1, 2008, and compare the number of images to the current page revision. It's a bit iffy since Wikipedia is sort of a moving target, and there are probably a lot of articles that weren't around back in 10/08... but if you're interested, it shouldn't require more than a bit of tinkering. MastCell Talk 23:14, 10 May 2010 (UTC)
* OK, I've trialed a script to collect the data you're interested in. The results are at . (Note that the page is very large, as there are ~2,000 articles tagged, so I don't recommend opening it on a mobile device or over a dialup connection unless you're very patient).The script I worked up is at , if anyone cares. The tricky thing is that a lot of pages have non-content images - that is, images from stub templates, maintenance templates, navigation templates, etc. I figure you don't want to count those, so I wrote a set of &quot;excludable&quot; images into the script. The set isn't complete - so I need to go through the output, find the non-content images, and add them by hand to the global exclude list in the script. That will make the count more accurate.I realized halfway through that you're probably most interested in the raw number of pages without images, which isn't readily available from the output I created. I'll modify the script to total up the # of pages, # with zero images, # with 1 image, # with 2 images, etc... it will be easy, but I'll probably get to it tomorrow. In the meantime, the table of results can be sorted by # of images, but that's probably not a great workaround. MastCell Talk 03:49, 11 May 2010 (UTC)

Transcendental meditation(TM)

I have done some work on this topic which is now before arbcom.  TM makes a number of health claims including improving BP, anxiety, and living forever.  A member of Arbcom has concluded that the ongoing debates is &quot;really about conflicting philosophies: on the one hand we have, for want of a better word, mysticism; on the other, rationalism.&quot; [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Transcendental_Meditation_movement/Proposed_decision#Arbitrators_active_on_this_case] 
Wondering if others could comment as this does pertain directly with our topic area.  Thanks Doc James (talk ·  · ) 00:23, 12 May 2010 (UTC)
It is quite possible that ArbCom does not appreciate the higher standards of sourcing agreed for medical claims in . I'm not sure how best to raise the issue with them at this late stage, but I'll think about it and try to formulate another post to the . If any other project members feel strongly about the sourcing issues – and how they may affect us – I'd recommend making your views known there. --RexxS (talk) 02:45, 12 May 2010 (UTC)
Isoflurane

Could someone with experience in the area of anesthetics please have a look at the recent IP edits to isoflurane?  They are presumably well-intentioned, but made by a someone whose native language is probably not English.  Also, though this is not my area of expertise, I suspect there may be some over-interpretation of the cited references. ChemNerd (talk) 11:43, 7 May 2010 (UTC)

I have no medical experience of anesthetics, as I am not an MD, but I have when reading through refs when working midazolam to GA status, found several references which discussed the neurotoxicity potential of general anesthetics. However, they were all talking about the neonate (and I think also pregnancy), causing apoptosis at doses equivalent to those used in humans. The FDA is currently investigating these issues. The two worst offenders were isoflurane and ketamine but all GABAergic and NMDA antagonist drugs seem implicated and combining anesthetic agents, eg giving a premed of midazolam or nitrous oxide with for example isoflurane appears to enhance the degree of apoptosis. With regard to the elderly, I did speak to a doctor who said that post-operative cogitive decline is fairly common and can be short-lasting or long-lasting. So it seems the very young and the elderly are more vulnerable to the effects of general anesthetics. I did do some rewriting and deleted and added some text. The sourcing for that section is not the best and if anyone wants to take the time to find recent reviews on post-operative decline it would be of value; I may do so when I get a chance.--Literaturegeek | T@1k? 11:19, 8 May 2010 (UTC)

Chagas disease review available

 has posted a great review at .  This  (from 2005) is in pretty good shape, but this list of improvements will give it a good update and correct a small number of inaccurate statements.  One of the things I particularly appreciate in the review is that the recommendations are concrete, specific, and actionable -- like, 'This uses the 2002 numbers, and the 2004 stats can be found here', or 'This newer source might replace that older one'.

If you're looking for a way to help out, please consider picking an open item from the review (at the moment, look under &quot;Management&quot;, &quot;Epidemiology&quot;, and &quot;References&quot;), and helping us take advantage of this opportunity to correct and update this featured article.

New article: Save the Children State of the World's Mothers report

I've begun an article on Save the Children's State of the World's Mothers report.  This year's report seems of particular relevance to upcoming events at the 36th G8 summit.  I've just proposed a rather provocative  hook for it, which unfortunately seems to be true however preposterous it might sound:
*... that Save the Children's State of the World's Mothers report ranked the U.S. 28th, citing a lifetime risk of maternal death five times greater in the U.S. than in Bosnia and Herzegovina?

I would welcome your insights. Mike Serfas (talk) 02:18, 7 May 2010 (UTC)

Data would look best turned into the form of maps.  There is a guy over at Wikimedia who has help me generate alot of maps who would probably be willing to help. [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Lokal_Profil] Doc James (talk ·  · ) 02:30, 7 May 2010 (UTC)

I thought about making the .svg map for the set of 57 countries with critical shortages of healthcare workers shown in the report.  Also, I suppose some of the statistics (child mortality) might be bracketed and colorized.  Is that what you mean?  (I know how to do this, but thanks) Mike Serfas (talk) 02:49, 7 May 2010 (UTC)

Here is an example of such a map [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Unipolar_depressive_disorders_world_map_-_DALY_-_WHO2002.svg]  One could create on for mortality.

Unreferenced Biographies of Living Persons

The  (UBLPs) aims to reduce the number of unreferenced biographical articles to under 30,000 by June 1, primarily by enabling WikiProjects to easily identify UBLP articles in their project's scope.  There were over 52,000 unreferenced BLPs in January 2010 and this has been reduced to 32,665 as of May 16.  A  is now running daily to compile a list of all articles that are in both  and have been tagged by a WikiProject. Note that the bot does NOT place unreferenced tags or assign articles to projects - this has been done by others previously - it just compiles a list.

Your Project's list can be found at .  As of May 17 you have approximately 23 articles to be referenced. The list of all other WikiProject UBLPs can be found at . 

Your assistance in reviewing and referencing these articles is greatly appreciated.  If you have any questions, please don't hestitate to ask either at  or at my talk page.  Thanks, The-Pope (talk) 16:50, 17 May 2010 (UTC)
Simple wikipedia

[http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Immunize| I recently became involved] in Simple English Wikipedia, and it has come to my attention that this Wikipedia has very few medical articles. Although I have written a few articles there, including  [http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocellular_carcinoma| hepatocellular carcinoma],this Wikipedia remains in great need of expanded medical coverage. I would encourage any editors involved in wikiproject medicine to help out there as well. Regards. Immunize  (talk) 17:59, 15 May 2010 (UTC)
This Wikipedia also needs a great deal of work :-) I have been trying to decrease the number of different volunteer medical wikis and consolidate the input here without any luck.  We have Wikidoc.org , Ganfyd.org , Askdrwiki.com, and Medpedia.com all duplicating the effort.  Instead of one great source we have a multitude of okay sources.
A number of these projects have medical school contributing.  This would be a good way forwards for us too I think.  McMaster just started a Wikipedia club.  I emailed them but never heard a response.  Does anyone know who started it?  Or how to contact them? Doc James (talk ·  · ) 20:16, 15 May 2010 (UTC)

Docs come and go on Wikipedia.  But many don't stay long.  The usual problem with experts in general--- too frustrating having to deal with all the nonsense and abusive untrained editors on a mission from God.

Wowwwww... That is a name...!!! I will not merge since we may loose the longest single-word article name... :-) --Garrondo (talk) 18:53, 17 May 2010 (UTC)
This is actually the longest word in the english language, so this is, more than likely, the only reason that it has its own article. Based on quality standards here on Wikipedia, it would be favorable to merge the two, but some will argue against this based on the notability of the word itself. Tyrol5  [[User talk:Tyrol5|[Talk]]] 19:27, 17 May 2010 (UTC)
I would say than since the term is the important thing (it says that it was specially invented to serve as the the longest word), and it has an specific history for the term the notable as said above is the word, much less than the meaning... What I would do is to eliminate any medice-related content, (the disease subsection) and only leave info on the word itself.--Garrondo (talk) 10:13, 18 May 2010 (UTC)

I don't think that it has any significant possibility of expanding beyond a stub, so perhaps merging and redirecting to the section in Longest word in English that addresses it would be a good choice.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 17:08, 18 May 2010 (UTC)

Yes I agree there are many types of lupus.  But Lupus_erythematosus is described in fitzpatricks as a spectrum of diseases rather than a single disease.  I have changed the page to reflect this thanks. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 16:41, 18 May 2010 (UTC)

I think there are reasons to go either way, but what matters to me is that Wikipedia have all the information somewhere.  Consequently, this question needs some attention from someone who knows what other pages we have.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 01:27, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

Well we do not have a page on burning sensation in the chest which we would need if we decide that heartburn is strictly a burning sensation in the chest due to reflux.Doc James (talk ·  · ) 03:01, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

 Thank you - interesting what people look up (cocaine &amp; oxycodone above aspirin, paracetamol, asthma drugs, cardiac/lipid drugs). Top 20 only have 2 High importance topics and 10 are are low/mid-importance. 
Some topics though I dispute are in our remit - incest is about the social aspects, the subtopic linked to of Consanguinity addresses the genetic/medical aspects - I've moved the project assessment across (and downgraded its generally importance in the practice of medicine to low).
Why is chlorine on the list - no talk-page assessment for us ? 
Not sure as doctors, vs social anthropologists, we can work up the poorer rated items to at least GA status (Sex, Masturbtion, Vulva, Female ejaculation, Cocaine in the top 10 for a start). David Ruben  Talk  16:42, 22 May 2010 (UTC)
I have removed a number of these in the last few week such as chlorine and the page has not been updated which is why they still show up.--Doc James (talk ·  · ) 19:02, 23 May 2010 (UTC)
Keeping our banner off of non-medical articles requires constant effort.  I think it is often added by people who aren't aware of more appropriate projects, like WikiProject Anatomy, WikiProject Health and fitness, WikiProject Alternative Medicine, and WikiProject Sexuality (you can find a reasonably complete list at ).  We are pushing back against society's efforts to medicalize everyday life, but there may well be more people who want to classify sexual intercourse and eating as medical procedures than there are editors keeping an eye on the assessments.  But sometimes it's appropriate; we'll tag an article that has a substantial medical section, even if it's not primarily or entirely a medical subject.  (These usually end up with low priority ratings from us.)  I really appreciate the efforts of editors to substitute more appropriate project banners whenever they encounter them. 
Along those lines, we have a goal of listing more than 100 articles at  (currently about 75).  These should mostly be fundamental, big-picture subjects, like Cancer, Pregnancy, or Heart disease.  I'd like to invite any task force, specialist, or person with a particular area of interest to help me identify the one to three most important diseases or classes of treatment in your area of interest.  If these articles aren't currently rated top-importance, please leave a note at  with your recommendation for an upgrade. 
Additionally, if anyone would like to scroll through  and weed out the obviously unimportant articles (and anatomy), I'd appreciate it.  &quot;Top&quot; gets some vandalism, so I keep a pretty close eye on it, but &quot;High&quot; has been pretty much neglected.

One decision that you'd need to make is whether you really want to tag 100% of redirects.  It might be reasonable to tag synonyms, but do you want to tag alternate capitalizations, or spelling differences?  WhatamIdoing (talk) 23:12, 19 May 2010 (UTC)

Wilson's syndrome - more eyes?

I'd like to request outside input at Wilson's syndrome (note: distinct from Wilson's disease). This is a medically unrecognized entity. The article seems to be watched by me and by a handful of IPs/single-purpose accounts. Rather than participate further in a back-and-forth, I'd like to solicit some outside eyes.

Anti-psychiatry

There is a long anti-psychiatry rant in the Freedom of thought article under the section Canada. I think the article needs to be reworked and purged of the nonsense.

I think this editor is alledging that they suffered long-term damage from psychiatric drugs (tardive dyskinesia, I think) and his healthcare professional denies this. Nobody here can personally advise you, but when harm is done by a professional, it is sometimes easier for them to deny it to avoid a lawsuit or avoid accepting responsibilty etc. A lot of people benefit from psychiatric drugs, but unfortunately some people are harmed or even damaged by them, which is probably why there is controversy and sometimes drama on psychiatry related wikipedia articles and an antipsychiatry movement. Tardive dyskinesia, has quite characteristic features to it which aren't subjective, but are obvious to the outside observer so you either have it or you do not and can easily be diagnosed. I would imagine it is possible to delude that one has TD but really you need to talk to your doctor, or get a second opinion from another doctor if you don't trust your current one. If you read up at the top of this project page it will explain that this project is not able to give medical advice. Best of luck. :)--Literaturegeek | T@1k? 08:46, 27 May 2010 (UTC)

Heartened by the influx of outside eyes and helpful input at Wilson's syndrome, I have another such request.

Actually, it's basically 3 editors (one of them me) going around in circles, so I think more input would be useful. I'm asking here since a lot of the issues turn on  and the appropriate representation of procedural risks. I will say upfront that I personally think that the interpretation of  being pushed on the talk page is extreme and divergent from the actual content of the guideline. As one might imagine, it's a controversial topic and prone to agenda-driven editing, but all the more reason to ask for more outside eyes.

Tables as articles

An editor has created medical articles that consist solely of tables: Fibrous lesions and Polyp table. I don't know what to make of them, as they lack leads or any other context. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Types_of_myxomas&amp;oldid=360268068 Types of myxomas] was already redirected. Fences&amp;Windows 00:27, 2 June 2010 (UTC)
I'd say that the present Fibrous lesions article looks like the basis for the Classification and Signs and symptoms sections of a potentially larger article of that name. I would guess that anyone who knows where to find the sources could write the Causes, Prognosis, etc. I would expect the lead to define what a fibrous lesion is and then briefly summarise the rest. It looks to my non-medic eye like a reasonable starting point.
It looks like James has made good use of the polyp table already (although I don't think the redirect left behind is of any use so I'll tag it for deletion). After looking a bit harder, Polyp table (even though a rather useless redirect) has a useful page history, so can't be deleted for reasons of attribution. --RexxS (talk) 01:36, 2 June 2010 (UTC)

 I've seen similar discussions before. I believe that SandyGeorgia(?) pointed out a new tool that examines the &quot;readability&quot; of articles. However my concern about &quot;dumbing down&quot; these medical articles is that the &quot;comprehensiveness&quot; of articles would fall. I don't believe that &quot;there was no difference between the sites in depth of coverage&quot; can possibly apply to our featured articles, &quot;Acute myeloid leukemia&quot;, &quot;Cholangiocarcinoma&quot; and &quot;Lung cancer&quot;. Axl ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 08:54, 2 June 2010 (UTC)
Increasing readability doesn't have to equal dumbing down.   Take a few extra long sentences and break them into 2 (or 3) sentences which are at least as clear as the original one, and you may knock a year off the readability score (like 12th grade level to 11th grade level). And inevitably writing-by-committee will make for a mixture of styles.
Another reaction, however, to the above cited article, is about the point they make of providing patient information.  We have, and should have, a wider audience than that, I think.  --Hordaland (talk) 10:27, 2 June 2010 (UTC)
I agree with H well PDQ writes specifically for patients we write for the general population.  It is not hard to make stuff more readable using link for difficult terms and easier grammer.  This is important not only for those with less education but for those whose first language is not English.  We are I presume a common resource for physicians in third world countries who do not have access to comprehensive medical libraries.  Thus we need to be wider in scope and more indepth than say PDQ.Doc James (talk ·  · ) 15:23, 2 June 2010 (UTC)
 I am unconvinced that long sentences and awkward grammar are major problems in medical Wikipedia articles. In &quot;Acute myeloid leukemia&quot;, massaging the text of the &quot;Diagnosis&quot;, &quot;Pathophysiology&quot;, &quot;Treatment&quot; &amp; &quot;Prognosis&quot; sections is not going to make the text significantly easier to read. Axl ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 10:25, 3 June 2010 (UTC)
Readability calculations don't account for the effect of wikilinks.  If you use a &quot;difficult&quot; word, like osteoporosis, you get dinged for it, no exceptions.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 15:57, 3 June 2010 (UTC)

OUTDENT - Just for fun I'm checking readablility of &quot;Acute myeloid leukemia&quot; using [http://www.read-able.com/ the SMOG site] &amp; noting here some results.
#LEAD has 22 words/sentence and 15% complex words, grade level about 13 (1st year college, age 18-19).
#DIAGNOSIS has 24 words/sentence, 23% complex words, grade level about 16.
#PATHOPHYSIOLOGY has 25 words/sentence, 22% complex words, grade level about 16.
#TREATMENT has 22 words/sentence, 25% complex words, grade level about 16.
#PROGNOSIS (excluding the table &amp; subtitles) has 18 words/sentence, 24% complex words, grade level about 14.
 This was fun and a new experience.  One gets a whole lot more info, and quickly, than I've picked out here; these are not the only parameters examined. A machine may not define a word or a complex word the way a person would.  It gives just a rough idea.  Readability, aside from typography etc, is a whole science.  In the U.S., certain types of info to the public must be kept within certain grade levels, sometimes grade level 7. This paragraph tests at grade level 6! --Hordaland (talk) 12:11, 3 June 2010 (UTC)

That is a really cool site.  I just ran gout and croup and they come back at reading level 7.  Both I think give good overviews of the topic useful for both the general public and professionals.  Reading AML we have sentences like &quot;its incidence increases with age&quot; which could be written &quot;it becomes more common with age&quot;,  &quot;relapse rate varies&quot; could be &quot;reoccurs in&quot; or even &quot;comes back in&quot;.  I do think it is a great article and had suggested a clinical English Wikipedia a while back ( I am not sure still if that was a good suggestion ) but would have addressed this aswell as other concerns. I guess the question is &quot;should this be a priority for us?&quot; Doc James (talk ·  · ) 13:27, 3 June 2010 (UTC)
I know this is an evergreen debate, but I do want to encourage caution in attempts to reduce the reading level. For example, in the example above, &quot;its incidence increases with age&quot; is not quite equivalent with &quot;it becomes more common with age&quot;, because there is an important distinction between incidence and prevalence. The use of longer words and more precise syntax is often not as gratuitous as it appears. --Arcadian (talk) 20:50, 3 June 2010 (UTC)
Yes however in this case both the incidence and the prevalence increase with age [http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/197802-overview].  So I think one could say that &quot;it becomes more common with age&quot; Doc James (talk ·  · ) 21:27, 3 June 2010 (UTC)
I agree that one must exercise caution!  After writing the above I read, very carefully, the Diagnosis section of Acute myeloid leukemia, and I couldn't see a reasonable way to lower the grade level on that section.  I don't doubt that this is an evergreen debate.  I do believe one should keep the matter in mind while writing/editing.  --Hordaland (talk) 23:45, 3 June 2010 (UTC)
I will recuse myself from discussion of acute myeloid leukemia, since I had a hand in writing it to its current excessively hifalutin' level. :P I will say that in my line of work, I constantly struggle (usually in vain) for ways to clearly explain complex biological and medical phenomena to intelligent laypeople.An interesting comparison point: consent forms for medical treatment are generally required to be written at approximately an 8th-grade level, at least in my experience. Obviously there are ethicolegal reasons for that, but I wonder where our benchmark/&quot;target&quot; should be.As another aside, I think that Wikipedia is substantially more &quot;readable&quot; in ways that don't translate easily to existing automated tools. Think about it - to adequately explain graft-vs.-host disease in a traditional written form, you'd first have to explain how bone marrow transplantation works, what a T cell is, how MHC-based allorecognition works, etc. Here, you can wikilink those terms, allowing readers to explore them at their own level of interest/sophistication/etc. Although I think we probably get dinged on &quot;readability&quot; for that approach. MastCell Talk 23:48, 3 June 2010 (UTC)



 Exactly my point! Axl ¤ [[User talk:Axl|[Talk]]] 10:14, 4 June 2010 (UTC)

The other major problem with these 'readability' numbers is that they treat the entire text as a single entity.  We usually write in a different fashion:  The lead is a simple summary.  The first paragraph of a technical section often provides a simplified overview.  But all that gets lumped together in the analysis:  it doesn't say, &quot;The first paragraph of Leukemia#Causes has a grade level of 11, and the rest has a grade level of 14.&quot;  (The word leukemia, all by itself, produces a &quot;grade level&quot; of 17, i.e., graduate student.)
I think that we do best when we provide both simple summaries and technical descriptions, even though this won't produce &quot;good&quot; scores.
Overall, I'm happy with the general score of something in the range of about 18 year olds for most articles.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 19:14, 4 June 2010 (UTC)

Okay, that's weird:  [http://www.read-able.com/ The website] gives wildly different answers for ODDD (one of my usual 'examples'), depending on whether I give it the URL (it produces a result of grade 8) or just give it the text (it produces a result of grade 14).  I assume that the difference lies in  the rest of the page, e.g., bits like &quot;See Terms of Use for details.&quot;
We need to know what method they were using.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 19:19, 4 June 2010 (UTC)
I just ran the bare text of ODDD through the checker and they explain how each index is calculated along with the results, but don't state how they weight the 6 indices to get an overall grade level. I've made a page  with those results and the description of how the indices are calculated if anyone wants to see what it produces.
Putting in the url means it finds 227 sentences (16 for the bare text), 906 words (327), and 204 complex words (77). The calculated readability of the main article text is swamped by the References, page navigation, header and footer, toolbox, etc. As an aside, simply putting a full stop (period) at the end of each of the four headings in the article lowers the computed grade level to 13! It's a nice tool, but needs to be used with care. --RexxS (talk) 22:22, 4 June 2010 (UTC)

Doc James (talk ·  · ) 17:34, 3 June 2010 (UTC)

I wouldn't be against putting that table directly on WPMED, but I don't think the &quot;Former featured articles&quot; and &quot;Did you know&quot; sections should be removed.  Everything within the project should have a reason for being here, other than being interesting.  The purpose of the &quot;Showcase&quot; section is to highlight the achievements and accomplishments of this project.  The popularity of articles is a totally different thing.  It indicates what readers are interested in.  The biggest reason I see for having it within this project is to figure out which articles are important to work on - something more fit for the &quot;How you can help&quot; than the &quot;Showcase&quot; section.  --Scott Alter (talk) 23:53, 4 June 2010 (UTC)

Edit history processed in Excel and I set out summary as lists of articles edited once, articles edited repeatedly, articles for which my (hopefully longstanding edit) remained the most recent stable version. Previous appraisor impressed with listings several hundred deep, last appraisor was unimpressed (thought formally acredited evening meetings showed greater continuing personal development), so I'll await to see what this coming year's appraiser make of this :-) David Ruben  Talk  01:12, 20 May 2010 (UTC)

(undent) Have received a response from the College of Family Physicians of Canada which looks hopeful.I am responding to your query regarding credits for writing content for a medical Wikipedia.
I had this discussion with a group in the Department of Family and Community Medicine at the Universiy of Toronto a couple of years ago. I am not certain of the current status of their project.
Writing content for a medical wikipedia would qualify for M2 credits on an hourly basis. If a physician did a literature review for this they could earn Mainpro C credits as a PEARLS exercise.
If you wish to discuss this further you may contact me at the coordinates below Doc James (talk ·  · ) 19:48, 25 May 2010 (UTC)

For those not familiar with the above CME process 250 hours are required every 5 years.  125 can be the easy to acquire M2.  125 must be Mainpro C which are the difficult ones to get as these activities must be certified as such. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 19:51, 25 May 2010 (UTC)

Very encouraging, anymore updates? Are you going to persue this?--Literaturegeek | T@1k? 22:57, 3 June 2010 (UTC)

They explained a number of different way that they would give CME credits for editing Wikipedia.  Unfortunately all methods require a fair amount of paper work.  If people are interested I could explain it more fully.Doc James (talk ·  · ) 02:59, 4 June 2010 (UTC)

Liver disease in pregnancy

Should we have a separate article about this subject ??  22:39, 7 June 2010 (UTC)
Sure, it seems like it's a notable topic - but a half decent article on Liver disease would be nice too. Fences&amp;Windows 12:54, 8 June 2010 (UTC)
My instincts would be that it should be a section of the liver disease article, rather than a seperate article. Does liver disease in pregnancy have a seperate ICD code from liver disease? If it was added to the liver disease article and the section became too large, then it could be considered for splitting into a seperate article. :) I could be wrong in my thoughts though, so hopefully other people will chip in with their views.--Literaturegeek | T@1k? 16:12, 8 June 2010 (UTC)
I'd agree with LG. I'm no expert on the subject, but is there something special that distinguishes it from just liver disease, or liver disease in old age, etc. if you see where I'm going? Or even coming from it from the opposite view, how about kidney disease in pregnancy, etc. It seems to be an intersection of two categories, and while there's no reason not to have separate articles for any such intersection, I'd recommend incubating it at first as a section within Liver disease. Diseases in pregnancy would be the eponymous article for the other category, but that doesn't seem to exist yet. --RexxS (talk) 16:37, 8 June 2010 (UTC)

Oh, I'm not sure about this:  I've been busily failing to win friends and influence people over at  for a week or so now, and that would doubtless reflect poorly in an RfA.  
We have a problem with a couple of admins (e.g., [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Notability&amp;diff=364149661&amp;oldid=364147739 SlimVirgin]) making up their own definitions of , e.g., that self-published sources can't be primary sources (yeah, well, what do you think your blog post about your birthday party is?), or that if you have enough lawyers involved, then it doesn't matter if the author and the publisher are the same.  According this contingent, Coca-Cola's website wasn't written by the corporation and published by the corporation:  It was apparently written by the corporation's lawyers, and published maybe by Martians.
After 179 KB of discussion(!), I'm reaching the conclusion that the Wikipedia community would rather have no definition (freeing these admins [and, yes, every single person with a silly, unverifiable definition in this discussion is an admin] to make up their own rules) than to have a verifiable one (like , which, BTW, pretty well dispenses with the hysterical &quot;But if the identity of the publisher and the author is all that matters, then newspapers are self-published!&quot; claim [as if a reporter were the publisher anyway]).
Anyway, I think it'd be good to pick out a handful of WPMED folks to do an RfA -- it might be nicer for the candidates to have some company during the process, if nothing else -- but I'm not exactly sure that now's a good time for me to consider it.  
Besides, if I were choosing between getting a definition of self-publication into the policy to stop this nonsense, or becoming an admin, I'd choose ending the nonsense, hands down.  A drug company's website is written and published by and for the drug company, no matter how many lawyers were involved.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:57, 4 June 2010 (UTC)
Not to worry, perhaps when the dust settles, you can reconsider. I myself am not too eager to become an admin at this minute in time, never really have been.--Literaturegeek | T@1k? 22:26, 4 June 2010 (UTC)

I hadn't noticed an overly large delay in procedures requiring admin tools - or are the current admins being overworked? I've been content without the admin tools thus far, but if there is a need for more would consider helping out with the menial chores. I'm a fairly sporadic editor - sometimes get stuck right in - other times might go for weeks making only small edits, so it depends what areas you think need more support. I am assuming you mean pages moves ( as above ), maybe temporary page protection when a class is using the article!, are there any other areas you're thinking of ?  (talk •  12:39, 8 June 2010 (UTC)

It appears they are going to appear on June 14th!  They will be limited to 2000 and need to be applied by an admin.

Many of our articles related to sex, sexually transmitted diseases, and psychiatry which are often controversial I think would be well served.

Notability of various medical journals

I became aware of the edits of  via an edit he made that dropped a page onto the Short Pages report.  The user turned a redirect into a disambig, adding a link to a newly formed page on a medical journal.  That page showed no obvious indications that the particular journal, Cytotherapy, was notable.  Not being particularly knowledgeable about such journals, I dropped Notability and PrimarySources tags on it.  As I often do, I glanced at the user's other contributions, and from there noticed that this user has created quite a few of these articles on medical journals.  After similarly tagging several more, I realized that tagging dozens of such articles is likely not the best way to go about this.

So I'm here looking for assistance/advice as to what is the proper next step.  It's quite possible that every one of these journals are notable by WP standards.  But as the articles now stand, there's really no indication of such.  If A7 applied to publications, they could conceivably be A7 deleted, given the lack of notability indications.

Are there specific notability criteria for publications and/or scientific journals?  If so, where? - TexasAndroid (talk) 15:47, 10 June 2010 (UTC)

The edits of these redirects and disambig pages are for the abbreviations of the medical journals, so that if someone types in the abbreviation of the journal, they will be able to find it. For example, if you go onto the page on Audiological Medicine (SUAM), you will see on the infobox on the right that the abbreviated title is &quot;AUM&quot;. And on the publisher's (Informa's) website, you can see that this IS the abbreviated title of this. journal. I hope that this helps. Let me know if there are still any problems. {talk} 16:58, 10 June 2010.

 The redirects changes is just how I came across this situation.  The actual issue is whether the journals meet the project's  criteria.  I have absolutely no problem with your converting redirects to disambigs, assuming that the added articles are on notable topic.  It's that latter issue that I just do not have the expertise to answer, and thus I came here were we may find people who do have the expertise. - TexasAndroid (talk) 16:11, 10 June 2010 (UTC)

KIN 412 ACL injury

Obviously there's a problem with this article, but I'm not sure of the best way to handle it. Suggestions? --Arcadian (talk) 23:29, 10 June 2010 (UTC)
It will of course need merger into the main article.  I have left a note. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 23:37, 10 June 2010 (UTC)
It would be best to consider all of the relevant articles:
#Cruciate ligament
#Knee#Anterior cruciate ligament injury
#Anterior cruciate ligament
#Anterior cruciate ligament injury
#Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction
#KIN 412 ACL injury
#Lachman test
#Anterior drawer test
and then ponder on why we have so many articles with the same information? (I might have missed some, btw.) Having looked at the size of the articles, I would have thought that:
* 1 should contain the first part of 3 (and the other ligaments) but restrict itself to the anatomy, not the injuries
* 2 is ok
* 3 should be split between 1 and 4, and turned into a redirect to the section in 1
* 4 should be the definitive article on the injury, with any non-redundant info from 3 merged in, with subsections containing 7 and 8, and possibly 5 merged into it
* 5 possibly be stand-alone because of its size, or merged into 4
* 6 needs to be deleted as a duplicate of 4
* 7 &amp; 8 should be subsections of 4; merge the info in and turn into redirects to the relevant subsection
In an ideal Wikipedia, each subtopic could have its own article. As it is, I can't see any point in having numerous small articles that have obvious parent articles, along with a fairly massive repetition of the same information in several places. Afterthought: a lot of these desperately need sources. OMG we have Drawer test as well!! Thoughts? --RexxS (talk) 02:21, 11 June 2010 (UTC)
Yes I agree with your thinking.  Many of the subject areas are like this.  Without someone too apply some order to the group things often just spread out with content duplicated in many different articles.  I would be happy to follow your efforts attempting to correct the situation :-) Doc James (talk ·  · ) 03:37, 11 June 2010 (UTC)
I agree with much of the above, but anterior cruciate ligament shouldn't be merged out of existence -- it's the primary article about the anatomic structure. Most of the content should be removed from it, but the article should remain. --Arcadian (talk) 05:26, 11 June 2010 (UTC)
If all of the discussion about injury and surgery at the Anterior cruciate ligament article is moved to Anterior cruciate ligament injury, you are left with 3 paragraphs and 5 images. In reality, wouldn't it be better to have a section in Cruciate ligament called Anterior cruciate ligament, to which Anterior cruciate ligament would be a redirect? Cruciate ligament is rather short (start-class) and purely anatomical in its scope, and I would have envisioned that expanding it to cover each cruciate ligament would make sense ... until it became so large that daughter articles would be needed. Indeed, I can see the amount of work needed would be large, and I do understand the argument against taking apart Anterior cruciate ligament (a C-class article), only to have to recreate it at a later date. I'm undecided what is best now! Any other takes on the issues? --RexxS (talk) 17:21, 11 June 2010 (UTC)
I think your suggestion is good.  Cruciate ligament should be the main article with section on each of the ligaments.  Only when it becomes to big should it be split off into its own article.  We need as few co tracts as possible as they end up just duplicating effort. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 18:28, 11 June 2010 (UTC)
Per MEDMOS, we organize our articles around the internationally accepted names for the entities. Anterior cruciate ligament is in TA, &quot;cruciate ligament&quot; is not. If you open up any anatomy textbook, you'll find a section on the ACL, but you almost certainly won't find an entry for cruciate ligaments as a class. &quot;Cruciate&quot; just means &quot;cross-shaped.&quot; It's a superficial similarity. Why would we put the ACL and PCL in a single article with the Cruciate ligament of atlas and cruciate crural ligament? We wouldn't put all the Bipennate muscles in a single article. --Arcadian (talk) 20:12, 11 June 2010 (UTC)
Yes as always it seems I agree with Arcadian.  Okay so I have merged the two tests into the diagnosis section of the ACL injury article.  Have added a &quot;main&quot; template to the knee article.  And left the ACL and Cruciate articles alone.  Finally I have proposed KIN 412 ACL injury for deletion.Doc James (talk ·  · ) 20:41, 11 June 2010 (UTC)

James, the  is really intended to be a place to discuss improvements to , and I don't think you're asking for MEDRS to be changed. Unfortunately, we don't have our own noticeboard like  where we can ask for outside opinions on the reliability of medical sources. I understand your frustration at seeing your commendable efforts to find reliable sources stonewalled, but I'd ask you to be patient. It is possible that Nutriveg will understand the spirit and letter of MEDRS eventually. If not, I am fully prepared to open an  on Nutriveg on the grounds of edit-warring, tendentious editing, and disruption of the process of finding consensus at Abortion; and if necessary seek sanctions such as a topic ban, if he does not show progress in moving towards collaborative editing. At present, he is making suggestions in talk for article text. That is productive and a sign of progress. The medical expertise of yourself and Mastcell is needed in arriving at the best form of words, so I hope you'll both feel able to contribute to that. Personally, I'm not inclined to suspend AGF with Nutriveg yet, as I think he is sincere in his intentions, but lacks the experience of collaborative editing that would make the work at Abortion far less unpleasant than it currently is. --RexxS (talk) 15:59, 11 June 2010 (UTC)

Ah yes diagnosing people post mortum with mental disorders is a very popular hobby.  The number of mental disorders characterized has increased tremendously over the last 50 years.  Via the current DSM 4 TR 46 % of people qualify for at least one mental disorder at some point in their life.  The more important question in my opinion is were we should draw the line between normal and diseased when it comes to continuous conditions such as feelings.

It would be nice if a volunteer or 2 could help and improve the article; the eyes and comments from medical professionals would be good just to make sure that I have not made any errors or left out important facts etc; it also needs work on layout, flow and other  issues need fixed. At a later date I might try and get it to GA but think I would need a helping hand or two to do that. I read through every review from 2000 - 2010 to build up the article, which previously only had an epidemiological section (which is still a mess), so health effects are well sourced and not much pubmed work needs doing. The article subject is considered a major public health issue, lots of adverse social and medical consequences, for example regular heavy binge drinking may induce brain damage more quickly than alcoholism (due to frequent repeated acute withdrawal/rebound states-via a kindling mechanism and excito-neurotoxicity), adolescents and young adults make up most binge drinkers and are more sensitive to alcohol related neurotoxicity, also strongly associated with violent crime and vandalism, suicide and quadruples risk of alcoholism etc etc. As it is a topic which affects so many people in most western countries especially parents of adolescents and professionals who work with adolescents the article should be in better shape. One idea I have is redundant paragraphs might be worth moving to alcohol abuse under a subsection of binge drinking, which needs a section on binge drinking.--Literaturegeek | T@1k? 21:43, 19 June 2010 (UTC)

Another issue that requires attention is that there are a couple of red links to medical cardiological terms which may need to be turned into redirects or new articles created. and the epidemiological section needs a lot of work. Any help appreciated.--Literaturegeek | T@1k? 22:11, 19 June 2010 (UTC)

Dealing with vanity citations?

Hi, I am mildly annoyed by someone adding citations of a certain &quot;Walid M.S.&quot; all over English as well as a few other language wikipedias. As far as I can tell at least 99% are added by IPs from Macon/GA, not surprisingly the place where one of the authors work.

As far as I can see it is not outright vandalism but undoubtedly in many cases there might be better sources and in the past there were a few edits that did fit badly into the structure of the article, in other cases the citations were just attached to halfway fitting text without touching the article at all. 

For a few examples see , however to get the whole picture it is necessary to search &quot;Walid MS&quot; in all subprojects.

I am wondering if anyone else noticed? What is the way to deal with it? Richiez (talk) 20:13, 19 June 2010 (UTC)
If the research is not a review article delete it based on  Doc James (talk ·  · ) 20:41, 19 June 2010 (UTC)
On basis of  anyone so systematically adding that author across multiple articles is probably linked to that person, and so if fail to restrain themselves to merely suggesting a link on talk pages... should be threatened with block. I think does amount to &quot;outright vandalism&quot; as in breach of our guidelines and disruptive to forming a reliable body of work. 
Separately would be interesting to know if Walid MS contributed so far to anything but primary sources or is notable - if not, then one option is to threaten to black list the term (i.e. gets expunged from mention across wikipedia). David Ruben  Talk  01:34, 20 June 2010 (UTC)
* Example [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Buccal_index&amp;oldid=359977243 previous version Buccal index] the  abstract makes no specific mention of &quot;buccal&quot;, it was added by  of the same name [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Buccal_index&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=168369116&amp;oldid=168363307] - so per  I've zapped it,[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Buccal_index&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=369100903&amp;oldid=359977243] unless someone else cares to see fit to re-insert.

So the &quot;Walid-Robinson Index (WRI)&quot; gets references by Walid.

Thanks for looking at it. I did not identify any substantial contribution in this edits although I did not care to search how all Walid MS citations were introduced.

I will then use those e-mail addresses to solicit authors to help on Wikipedia.  Would someone be willing to help me with this? ---kilbad (talk) 02:58, 19 June 2010 (UTC)
That is a great idea.  We should do a pilot than depending on whether or not we get a good response expand it to general medicine topics aswell. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 03:25, 19 June 2010 (UTC)
Is there someone who could help us generate this list of e-mails? ---kilbad (talk) 03:30, 19 June 2010 (UTC)
I can probably do this, but it will take me a little time since my coding skillz are iffy at best. Since I'm a bit busy IRL, you might want to solicit help from people who do a lot of Web programming (you could try the bots group). If you don't turn up anyone willing to work on it, let me know and I'll take a shot. MastCell Talk 04:04, 19 June 2010 (UTC)
This is certainly your prerogative, but (as an established corresponding author in the biomedical literature) I think you should be cognizant of some issues.  First, prospective editors recruited from such sources will need some orientation on , because they almost certainly will have strongly-held views on the topics for which you recruit them.  They should also try to avoid directly editing content that relates to (or cites) their own published work to avoid  - they should probably restrict themselves to making suggestions on the relevant Talk page.  In addition, I get huge amounts of spam email regarding my publications already (due to bots trolling the literature), and some authors may not react positively to wikipedia recruiters, especially if they're automated.  I think you actually do have a good idea here, but I suggest exercising some caution.  Just a thought.  -- Scray (talk) 04:35, 19 June 2010 (UTC)
I agree that any approach to these authors needs to be personalized. I actually try to bow out of being corresponding author if possible, solely because of the spam that ensues. I considered whether we would just be adding to that problem, but in the end I think that we're not selling anything - we just want to notify people of an opportunity to help contribute to freely available medical knowledge. So I'm OK with it, but I agree with Scray that we should not send these folks automated email (not that anyone has suggested it). I'm assuming we'd make some kind of personalized, handwritten appeal for them to donate their expertise.MastCell Talk 04:43, 19 June 2010 (UTC)
I do not know if it is a good idea since it is too close to spam tactics. Even if our aim is a good one we cannot use such methods... Such a decision would have to be approved by the wikimedia foundation and the community. I agree that we have to get more experts to wikipedia but I do not believe that this is an ethical one. Emails on publications are not given to receive this kind of information. --Garrondo (talk) 07:46, 19 June 2010 (UTC)
I have received email asking me to contribute to textbooks.  This is not that different.Doc James (talk ·  · ) 20:42, 19 June 2010 (UTC)
(outdent) I think that this is a good idea. It is possible that some authors may be annoyed at being asked but I think most would view it as a compliment (depending on how the email is worded). I think that the worst that could happen is that the emails will be ignored or most that reply will say they are too busy but the bonus is that a few new wikipedians will join the project. Scray, yes many of the authors will have strongly held beliefs on the topics that they edit but does that not describe about half of wikipedian community? :) Dermatology I don't think is a controversial area of medicine, it is pretty routine laboratory testing of skin and treatments (a bit more complicated than that but you know what I mean) etc and being peer reviewed published and likely dermatologists they would presumably be pushing a mainstream POV. Any interested parties could be given via a follow-up email the 5 core policies of editing wikipedia and will likely also get a welcome template soon after joining like other newbies.--Literaturegeek | T@1k? 21:07, 19 June 2010 (UTC)

Hmmm. I just read Garrondo's comment and now I am thinking maybe my post in support was premature. I had not thought of the need of contacting the foundation and the effort possibly being viewed as spamming. I struck my above comment. If the email is sent by an individual rather than an official wikipedia foundation effort and not a project effort, then perhaps it is outside the scope of the foundation, ie because the email will not be representing the foundation?--Literaturegeek | T@1k? 21:15, 19 June 2010 (UTC)

I do agree with the concerns expressed here however do not think we should discount this idea completely.  If it is done in a personal individualized method from someone within your own field I do not think there would be hard felling (ie if Kilbad as a dermatologist approached other dermatologists ).  Maybe Kilbad you could try 5 to 10 people to see what sort of response you get?
Other less aggressive way to promote participation would be via posters at Universities, the publication of papers on Wikipedia, and lecturing at conferences.Doc James (talk ·  · ) 22:53, 19 June 2010 (UTC)
I think James has hit the nail on the head with the point about a collegial invitation. I can see it would be more work, but if Kilbad felt able to start by contacting a few other dermatologists with a personal email, explaining how important Wikipedia is, inviting them to collaborate, then we could see if a small-scale trial produced any results. My own experience in PR strongly suggests that a targeted and focussed approach is always better received than scatter-gun tactics. I collaborate regularly with Gene Hobbs, who has been trying for some time to persuade some of his colleagues at Duke to contribute, but I know progress is slow because people are so busy. Are there any other specialists, perhaps, who would feel able to make contact with experts in their field, with a view to them becoming Wikipedians? --RexxS (talk) 00:34, 20 June 2010 (UTC)
Mel Herbert an ER doc, the producer of EMRAP, and the organizer of one of the largest ER conferences in the world is a big fan of Wikipedia.  I will speak to him about publicity.Doc James (talk ·  · ) 01:53, 20 June 2010 (UTC)
If someone is willing to help me get a listing of e-mails, I will solicit help with individual and personalized e-mails, not with generic/spam notices.  Perhaps if we could generate a three column list of (1) corresponding author name, (2) paper title, and (3) e-mail address, that would be most helpful for this type of mailing?  Also, with regard to reception (and I realize this is anecdotal), I have already sent out a few e-mails to various corresponding authors, all of which have been well received thus far. ---kilbad (talk) 06:34, 20 June 2010 (UTC) 
As another established corresponding author in the biomedical literature, I agree with Scray's first point, above. To quote Scray, &quot;This is certainly your prerogative, but (as an established corresponding author in the biomedical literature) I think you should be cognizant of some issues. First, prospective editors recruited from such sources will need some orientation on neutrality, because they almost certainly will have strongly-held views on the topics for which you recruit them.

Diasagree with above: experts should be able to write about their area of expertise if they write on non-controversial subjects and they try to maintain neutrality. The opposite would be a shame for wikipedia since we are forbidding those how can contribute more from doing it (and is probably a reason why most experts do not feel welcome in this environment).--Garrondo (talk) 15:30, 22 June 2010 (UTC)

medical hypotheses

Hi. I have a friend whose business is setting up RCTs who has developed a physiological hypotheses about the digestive system. Obviously not suitable for Wikipedia but I wondered if anybody knew of a website or blog where hypotheses can be published and discussed. I note the Medical Hypotheses Journal appears to be in the process of committing suicide so I wondered if there were any other forum? Fainites barley 20:25, 24 June 2010 (UTC)
It's hard to make progress solo these days. If your friend is affiliated with an academic institution, s/he could cast around for people who might be interested in collaborating to investigate the hypothesis. If s/he is in the private sector, then s/he might want to see if any academic institution would be interested in partnering to look into it. I don't know how the research funding situation works in your friend's country of residence, but generally one can look for governmental or private funding - the former involves a lot more ridiculous bureaucracy, and the latter typically requires some sort of commercial payoff, so it depends on the specifics. In terms of putting the hypothesis out there, it might be best to try to develop some sort of preliminary data which could at least be presented at a relevant scientific meeting - those are often geared more toward the airing of speculative hypotheses, while publishing in the peer-reviewed literature usually requires a bit more of a cohesive story. Just a few suggestions. MastCell Talk 16:55, 28 June 2010 (UTC)
Thanks MastCell. He's pretty much retired now and probably wouldn't be in a position to put any money into it. The preliminary data idea sounds the most promising. I was just wondering really if there was a sort of internet equivalent of the MHJ but which was at least reasonably respectable!Fainites barley 17:26, 28 June 2010 (UTC)
Amateur science has a good track record, from antiquity to Patrick Moore, so there's good reason to encourage it. One of the great things about Web 2.0 is that just about anyone can self-publish; so if your friend spends some time collecting data and developing hypotheses, he could use WorldPress to make a blog site and let the world know about it. Who knows? he might have made a great discovery! --RexxS (talk) 18:48, 28 June 2010 (UTC)
I wonder if the Wikimedia foundation would be interested in this sort of project.  It could be called WikiHypothesis and deal with ideas that have not reached sufficient notability / verifiability to be included in Wikipedia. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 19:11, 28 June 2010 (UTC)
Yes though I suppose it might suffer from the same problems MHJ suffered from - or maybe vigorous wiki style argument would help protect it from that, the internet being more immediate. I'll suggest it to him! Fainites barley 20:47, 28 June 2010 (UTC)
By the way - Patrick Moore is paid. It's just that rumour has it he's paid the same now as he was when they started The Sky At Night back in the '50s. If anybody asks for more it will be cut. Boo! Fainites barley 20:48, 28 June 2010 (UTC)

Medroxyprogesterone versus medroxyprogesterone acetate

Can someone tell me the difference between Medroxyprogesterone and Medroxyprogesterone 17-acetate?  One is a progestin, one is a pregnane, does that mean MPA is converted to progesterone in the body?

Discussion copied to RD/S

(Original research alert) First, pregnanes and progestins are not mutually exclusive. Pregnane refers to the structure of the molecule, while progestin refers to its biological activity. Medroxyprogesterone is the active molecule. In order to stabilize medroxyprogesterone in a form that can be administered orally or intravenously, it's acetylated (see the final step in . In the body, the acetate residue is degraded and you get the active molecule back.If you're talking about administering medroxyprogesterone as a pharmaceutical, then you're technically talking about MP acetate. If you're talking about steroid biochemistry in vivo, then it's more correct to refer to medroxyprogesterone, period. I'm not sure what implications this has for our article structure (and this is just me talking - it's been awhile since I took pharmacology, and I don't have a supporting source at my fingertips, so take it with a grain of salt because I have been known to be wrong). MastCell Talk 03:58, 3 July 2010 (UTC)
MastCell, thanks for correcting me (pending further corroboration/refs).  That was my initial sense (see the RD/S history for my original comments if curious) but I couldn't quickly find anything reliable that supported me.  I'll look again tomorrow if no one weighs in further.  -- Scray (talk) 04:02, 3 July 2010 (UTC)
I wish I had some refs handy to back me up. BTW, I saw your comment at the Ref Desk about MPA levels ([https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Science&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=371484186]). Are you sure those are actually looking at levels of medroxyprogesterone acetate? I'm not familiar with measuring levels of it. On the other hand, there's an extensive literature on monitoring plasma levels of mycophenolic acid (also abbreviated MPA), which is the active metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Like most immunosuppressants, MMF pretty finicky and has a narrow therapeutic window, so a lot of work has been done on MPA pharmacokinetics (mycophenolic acid) in the organ transplantation literature. You've probably already looked into this, but is it possible that the &quot;MPA&quot; levels you saw were actually mycophenolic acid, rather than medroxyprogesterone acetate? MastCell Talk 04:30, 3 July 2010 (UTC)
I'm very familiar with mycophenolate; the particular paper that made me doubt myself was [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1410743/?tool=pmcentrez this one], which led me to , which is entitled &quot;Medroxyprogesterone acetate in human serum&quot;.  On re-reading the abstract, this may simply be sloppy terminology, since the RIA they're using might not distinguish medroxyprogesterone from the acetate.  Clarity remains elusive, but I think you're probably right.  -- Scray (talk) 05:01, 3 July 2010 (UTC)

The paper does little to justify the equal weight given to all of these questions (many of which are off-topic, represent how-to, etc).  JAMIA is generally excellent, but this one is not impressive from an informatics point of view.  -- Scray (talk) 16:06, 3 July 2010 (UTC)

fuch's endothelial dystrophy page oddity

Hope this is the right place to ask this.  The page on Fuch's endothelial dystrophy http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuchs'_dystrophy contains this =

&quot;Anecdotally, botulinum toxin type A given to the periocular tissues for a patient with blepharospasm and hemifacial spasm resulted in dramatic and immediate improvement in vision, lasting about 2–3 months after each quarterly treatment.&quot;

It is totally unclear to me why this is in this page.  I have never heard of either spasm being associated with Fuch's and nowhere else on the page are they mentioned.

Medical software needs help

Hi. It has been brought to my attention that this page is in a rather poor state. I would have thought it would have included personal (home) medical software, GP knowledge-base software (such as SOPHIE (sp?)), a link at least and summary of the (disastrous) UK NHS IT program, etc. Lots of mainstream and medical press articles have been written about software and how it can improve (or not!) medical practice, and this should be covered here. I think this article is ripe for improvement from people with the knowledge and the correct references. Best, Verbal chat 09:44, 6 July 2010 (UTC)

Online Sources That Discuss 

I had a pleasant conversation with some more experienced editors than I on a user talk page about websites that guide readers on how to interpret primary research findings. One such site is the personal site of Google Director of Research Peter Norvig, including the article [http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html Warning Signs in Experimental Design and Interpretation]. That article links to both primary and secondary sources that help Wikipedians distinguish reliable publications from unreliable publications for medicine-related articles. Another interesting site is [http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/ Science-Based Medicine], a blog that today just happens to have an article on [http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=6050 Reliability of Health Information on the Web], sure to be of interest to editors here. I try to link to sites like these in article talk pages so as to encourage Wikipedians to set high standards for sources as they edit medicine-related articles. -- WeijiBaikeBianji (talk) 15:46, 14 July 2010 (UTC)

Article needs renamed?

Acording to [http://en.sanofi-aventis.com/binaries/Atherothrombosis_backgrounder_tcm28-28226.pdf this source], atherosclerosis should be renamed to atherothrombosis, unless I misread the source. I stumbled across this issue when creating a redirect for atherothrombosis and trying to figure out what to redirect to.--Literaturegeek | T@1k? 23:46, 3 July 2010 (UTC)

No. Atherosclerosis is the formation of the plaques. Thrombosis is when a plaque ruptures, forming a thrombus in the blood vessel. JFW | T@lk 12:24, 4 July 2010 (UTC)

Ah ok, thank you. I changed the redirect of atherothrombosis to point to thrombosis, rather than pointing to atherosclerosis. I hope that this is correct.--Literaturegeek | T@1k? 21:33, 4 July 2010 (UTC)

Just a note to tell you what you already know:  Encyclopedia articles don't normally include current retail prices for drugs.

If you ever run across anything similar, please feel free to remove it.

You could use them yourself on a non-commercial website, as long as you didn't change them and you properly attributed their source.

Sadly, people seem to be very possessive about images, and I haven't found any free ones from that search yet. I also checked &quot;dermatology pictures&quot;+free on Google, but that's got a lot of chaff in with the wheat. If you can read arabic, then it's possible that http://arabdentist.netfirms.com/medical_pictures.htm might have free images, but I can't read the copyright terms.

Hi I'm trying to de-orphan this article Enterostatin while at the same time build up content from references (heaps of good references can be found on google). This is not my field of expertise, but I think it is about using a drug to help with weight loss. Any suggestions for articles that might be suitable to link to would be helpful. Thanks Blackash have a chat 12:35, 7 July 2010 (UTC)

Obviously you'll need an article with the text 'enterostatin' in it to make a wikilink. A Google search on &quot;site:en.wikipedia.org enterostatin&quot; unfortunately only shows up Eating which already has an outgoing link to Enterostatin. It means you'll have to add relevant text to other articles (with references, of course) to be able to create those links. Apologies if you'd already realised that. Off the top of my head, I can only think of Obesity, Weight loss, and Procolipase – the last being a redlink at present.

A research proposal

Hi everyone, I'm James, a soon-to-be fourth year medical student at Keele University in the UK. I've just finished doing an audit at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire, and the project has got me thinking. Wikipedia is still treated as being the devil's spawn by most of the faculty at my medical school, and I'd like to prove them wrong. I was wondering if anyone would be interested to carrying out a research project, with the aim to publish a paper at the end of it, examining Wikipedia's articles for breadth and accuracy in comparison to more traditional sources? If anyone's interested, do please let me know! Colds7ream (talk) 09:47, 14 July 2010 (UTC)

Changing cerebrum cortex types navigation box

Hi, I tried to correct the cerebral cortex types nav box as it wasn't quite right (e.g. allocortex was redirecting to neocortex), but when I got into it it was more complicated than I thought. I've had a go, but does anyone have any thoughts on it?Keepstherainoff (talk) 15:26, 22 July 2010 (UTC)
Ouch, that's a tough one, and well beyond my knowledge of what are the correct terms. However, what I can say is that a navigation template is exactly that – a place where readers could refer to, so that they can find closely related articles. The result of that is there shouldn't be any &quot;Easter eggs&quot;; for example, a reader shouldn't click on &quot;True isocortex&quot; and arrive at the Neocortex article; similarly, a reader ought to be able to see a direct link to the Neocortex article, in case that is a term they are looking for. In other words, piped links are generally a bad idea in nav templates (unless it is a link to a section of a parent article). Also, if there's no article on Mesocortex, for example, there's no point in having such a red link in a nav template, unless you expect that article to be created soon. The template serves a different purpose from a list, categorisation, or discussion of a topic (where red links may be much more appropriate), if you see what I mean. Anyway, I don't mean to be negative, and your efforts have improved  by changing what seem to have been inaccuracies. Could I suggest you have another look at it and see if you can address any of the issues I raised? The key point is that a template doesn't have to be any more comprehensive than what Wikipedia has articles (or sections within articles) for. Would you be able to actually expand any of the Allocortex, Paleocortex, or Archicortex articles? – somewhere in those articles may be the place to explain the various categories of this part of the brain. --RexxS (talk) 02:00, 23 July 2010 (UTC)

This seems like a good community to ask this off-topic question.  Have any of you seen a really good personal website for a doctor?  I recently bought a domain name and would like to host my own personal dermatology page, and am trying to come up with a simple and good looking design.

I hope nobody will take offence at the off-topic discussion, but I've been designing web sites/applications since the mid-1990s, and my advice nowadays is take a look at WordPress software. It's possibly the simplest way for the end-user to create and keep up-to-date a useful website; there's good documentation and numerous 'themes' to pick from (or modify as you gain experience). The other option is to pay a good graphics designer to produce a bespoke design and then a website designer to implement it, and that's expensive. Whatever you decide, you can always drop me a line – you have my email. --RexxS (talk) 01:08, 24 July 2010 (UTC)

* Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine — after a bad experience, this article needs a reviewer who knows 
* Chlorpromazine — Casliber and MacDaid would welcome your help in wrapping up this review
* Organ transplantation in the People's Republic of China — SilkTork nominated this a couple of weeks ago
* Decompression sickness — RexxS would love to find a reviewer without waiting as long as everyone else

The Good article folks seem to be having a bit of a backlog problem overall, but WPMED is within sight of being caught up.  If you've never reviewed an article for  status before, it's not difficult.  There are , and you don't have to bother with the kind of fiddly details (or endless discussions with overly picky editors) that can bedevil FA nominations.  A good review is a bit like a focused .

Blood irradiation therapy

Greetings, friends,

This therapy is used very widely in China, Russia, and several other places; it's a mainstream therapy in these countries. For whatever reasons, it's not very well known in the US.

What we see with this article is that an editor keeps deleting the entire 'Further reading' section, which contains numerous valid peer-reviewed refs.

Here are these refs,

*Further reading*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*

There's no reason IMHO that these peer-reviewed articles cannot be used for Further reading. Especially this,

*

which is a recent meta-review. (The reason for deleting it, as given, seems rather specious.)

My next concern is about the apparent ethnocentrism that I believe is apparent in the behaviour of .

Wikipedia does not belong to USA alone. This is an international encyclopedia. The fact is that this treatment is used by millions of people outside the US (often being a mainstream treatment, actually), and I believe Wikipedia should reflect this. What is the current Wikipedia policy in this area, I wonder?

The research in this area has been conducted primarily in non-English speaking countries, and there's a huge amount of published research in Chinese, for example. But WLU keeps deleting all that.

And, finally, at this time we have a new editor () who actually knows something about this therapy (i.e. practical experience), and is trying to contribute to the article. But, by the looks of it, I'm afraid he won't be sticking around much longer, considering how he's being treated by WLU. Is it really to the advantage of Wikipedia to drive away knowledgeable and credentialed people from editing articles in their area of expertise? I wonder...

So I'm bringing these concerns here in the hope of receiving some good guidance in these areas.

Regards, --Dyuku (talk) 16:53, 4 August 2010 (UTC)

Since the discussion began a couple of days ago on the article's talk page, please consider sharing your perspective at .  I'm sure that Dyuku and WLU would love to hear from several editors there.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 02:29, 5 August 2010 (UTC)
Interesting stuff. While &quot;blood irradiation&quot; as described in the article is most definitely not a part of mainstream medicine in the US (or in any Western country that I'm familiar with), it bears some resemblance to extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) - which is an accepted, if relatively obscure, treatment for various autoimmune and alloimmune conditions. ECP is definitely immunosuppressive, or more accurately immunomodulatory, in complex ways, so it would be interesting to see what overlap exists with blood irradiation. MastCell Talk 05:07, 5 August 2010 (UTC)
The &quot;best&quot; article on the topic appears to be [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1743298/pdf/v081p00436.pdf this one]. Of interest, the summary of studies on pages 438-9 includes several RCT, but doesn't mention blinding.  A vivid, dramatic, &quot;sciencey&quot; treatment is expected to have a fairly strong placebo effect, making blinding and adequate controls extremely important.  Though it is possible there is something here, at this point I think it's pretty far from being conclusive.  Further, the work seems to parallel acupuncture in a lot of ways (and indeed, at least one form appears to stimulate &quot;acupuncture points&quot; - though I'd ask which ones?  Korean?  Chinese?  Japanese?  An interesting question since each tradition identifies different points, and there's no known anatomical basis for the points).  Like acupuncture, it's exotic (from Russia!  And Asia!), it's dramatic (lasers!), it's &quot;scientific&quot; (LASERS!!!), it's hard to blind (because of the existence of visible light), and it's suggested as a panacea for many conditions.  It also includes the hallmark of quackery - &quot;strengthening the immune system&quot; (making MastCell's comparison about ECP interesting to say the least - strengthening the immune system of someone with autoimmune conditions is a very bad thing).  
My biggest beef with Dyuku's additions is the inclusion of a bucket of primary (animal and in vitro) research as further reading.  My second-biggest beef in general is that most of medicine isn't even aware of this technique, making it very easy to cherry-pick the (incredibly low-impact, third, fourth, fifth and lower-string) journals to make all sorts of claims, which can not be juxtaposed with any skepticism because none exists - because most researchers aren't even aware of it.  This is research still in its inception outside of Russia and China, and with the latter at least notorious for producing only positive studies (see [http://books.google.com/books?id=bZjlC2LELlIC&amp;pg=PA71#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Singh &amp; Ernst, p. 71-2]) versus the West where results are extremely mixed and generally negative for everything but pain and nausea.  My third biggest beef is that Quackwatch sees at least one type (ultraviolet therapy) as quackery debunked 40 years ago.  
So overall, I am quite concerned about the small number of extremely preliminary sources being used to grossly oversell BIT because, as of yet, the skeptical (and medical) community is not yet aware of it.  I don't want the wikipedia page to turn into whale.to (and there is a spam blacklisted page - whale.to/a/ultraviolet_blood_irradiation) or [http://www.meditech-bioflex.com/ Bob's House of We'll Treat Anything With A Laser!]  I prefer the current version, which essentially avoids claims, until skeptical sources turn up which balance claims against actual evidence.  This is an issue requiring  and  rather than a strict parsing of the sources, because of the substantial imbalance between positive/credulous and negative/skeptical.  WLU (t)  Wikipedia's rules:/ 07:45, 5 August 2010 (UTC)
In Germany there is yet another variant popularly called &quot;UV Eigenblutbestrahlung&quot;. Only very remote similarity to Extracorporeal photopheresis, both the effects and procedure are significantly different. No idea if it even has an English name but it is somewhat popular among physicians. Richiez (talk) 12:47, 5 August 2010 (UTC)

(To clarify, what follows is my reply specifically to WLU's message above. --Dyuku) Most of this is just irrelevant chatter and guilt-by-association with a strong whiff of ethnocentrism. Yes, we all know that the Chinese just love acupuncture, and therefore why should we trust them about anything? I guess the Russians don't really care about acupuncture all that much, so there must be some other way to smear them. Why should Americans be so smug about their medical 'achievements', considering that for the amount of money USA spends on health services the results are so poor?
WLU says: Of interest, the summary of studies on pages 438-9 includes several RCT, but doesn't mention blinding. A vivid, dramatic, &quot;sciencey&quot; treatment is expected to have a fairly strong placebo effect, making blinding and adequate controls extremely important.
Clearly WLU doesn't know very much about the subject matter. His information is rather outdated, since there are now numerous double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trials that have been published re LLLT. For example, this, 
It's really not the fault of any serious researcher in this area that the American &quot;Quackbusters&quot; are so behind in their homework re LLLT. I don't know why are they goofing off lately, but this can hardly be used as any sort of evidence against the efficacy of LLLT.--Dyuku (talk) 22:01, 6 August 2010 (UTC)
You are the one who brought this up here, and it sounds like you didn't like the answer you got.   It's not ethnocentrism, it's the reality that many claims are made for laser therapy, yet it's only been tested in two countries and not adopted wholesale.  Even from an  perspective, it's undue weight to place emphasis on it as an intervention when it's not widely accepted, and trying to force it as &quot;proven&quot; onto wikipedia is inappropriate.  The best article, , is from 2005 and is a call to research.  Clearly, it has not been answered.  I'm not sure why LLLT is being brought up, since the original section topic was blood irradiation therapy.  WLU (t)  Wikipedia's rules:/ 22:28, 6 August 2010 (UTC)

Convert them to .png if you want a lossless conversion, otherwise you can convert photos to .jpg which have greater compression (but are lossy) - I use a free program called IrfanView (http://www.irfanview.net/) to do batch conversions. Tip is to work on a copy of the files you have until you're confident with using the program. --RexxS (talk) 04:58, 4 August 2010 (UTC)

Mastitis reorganisation

Currently there is mastitis which most people consider a synonym for puerperal mastitis. While puerperal mastitis was originally intended to be the main page for that editors were adding their stuff to mastitis instead so we now have essentially 2 pages dealing with puerperal mastitis and plenty of wasted effort if that continues. So another reorganisation seem unavoidable, I see this options:
* make mastitis a pure disambiguation page for all inflammatory breast disorders linking to already existing subpages
* merge puerperal and non-puerperal mastitis and possibly create inflamatory conditions of the breast. There is also breast disease which might be better than creating a new page for the inflammatory conditions

Pathway to depression-related articles

I'd like anyone searching Wikipedia for &quot;depression&quot; to find useful stuff by the most direct route. 
A while ago I stumbled across Depression (mood) when it consisted of a fairly unfocused discussion of some of the psychiatric disorders featuring depressive symptoms and some speculation about the adaptiveness of depressive symptoms.[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Depression_(mood)&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=362458553]  So after discussion with Casliber [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Depression_(mood)#Trim_and_direct_readers_to_Mood_disorders] I cut it down to a list of signs and symptoms, with links to Mood disorder, Adjustment disorder and Borderline personality disorder. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Depression_(mood)&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=364835579&amp;oldid=362458553]

The article has recently been reviewed by BSW-RMH as part of the Google.org project, and I've incorporated some of their suggestions. [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Depression_(mood)&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=378486035&amp;oldid=364835579]

Also recently 7mike5000 (talk) has created Depression (differential diagnoses), a page discussing &quot;physical&quot; illnesses that produce depressive symptoms.

Could some knowledgeable med editors please look at this pathway and see if there are any delays, misdirections or roadblocks for readers looking for information about depression? I guess it starts with Depression (the disambiguation page). Anthony (talk) 13:25, 12 August 2010 (UTC)

In re  and 

(copypasted from )

I have to concur with your concern. I've argued in the past that we need to automate the process of checking pubmed records for &quot;Publication Type&quot; fields and reflecting their values in our citation templates. Right now, I think that it is simply too handraulic for the few editors on medical topics to keep up with. Perhaps  could be brought to bear on the problem of doing the checks, but we would need some agreement on how to indicate citations of primary sources. My recent pattern has been to simply insert &quot;(primary source)&quot; before the closing /ref tag, but that's rather a work-around instead of fixing the templates. How would you feel about adding a  to ? LeadSongDog come howl! 19:01, 12 August 2010 (UTC)
 We do need a much better way of identifying overreliance on primary sources in medical articles, but I'm not sure it can be automated or added to templates, since not all reviews are identified as such in PubMed.  Perhaps open a discussion thread at ?  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 19:22, 12 August 2010 (UTC)
(continuing)
While not all reviews are so marked at PubMed, I believe it is still useful to be able to attach to a citation an indication of whether it is a &quot;Review&quot;, an &quot;Original paper&quot;, a &quot;Comment&quot;, an &quot;Author response&quot;, an &quot;Editorial&quot;, etc. The few cases in which manual intervention would be required should not dissuade us from conveying this information to critical readers. Most scientific journals and abstracting services make it clear which is applicable, and in cases of uncertainty we always have article talkpages. LeadSongDog come howl! 19:39, 12 August 2010 (UTC)

The problem is that many people who add content containing primary research do not use the template fillers. Patrolling new additions is something we all hate (especially on controversial topics like the Zamboni zone in the MS article) but it is crucial to maintain the integrity of the encyclopedia. JFW | T@lk 19:51, 12 August 2010 (UTC)

IMO the problem is too complex to solve with automation.  Even if we assumed that every entry in the database were correct, the fact is that primary sources can be used on Wikipedia -- just within limits.  A bot will never be able to differentiate between an appropriate citation to a historically important primary paper (e.g., ), a primary source being presented within the limits of our content policies, and a primary source being used to debunk secondary sources or to make inappropriately sweeping claims. 
I have no objection to adding a  field to the templates, or to begging Diberri to automatically fill it in (if that's possible), but the most important work is still going to have to be done by humans.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 20:01, 12 August 2010 (UTC)
A bot that fills in a field indicating what type of article the reference is would definitely be of some us.  One could than create a tool that determines what percentage of articles are reviews versus other types of articles.  This could be added to the FA tools we currently use and would be useful for GA as well.  Pubmed will limit your search to only review article ( which I often do ) thus their categorization must be mostly correct.
In one of the current debates I am involved in I have been adding the direct quote from the source I am using which supports the text written.  I been adding this to the quote parameter.  It makes it easier for others to verify sources one must pay for.  I think small bits of text directly quoted still false under fair use.Doc James (talk ·  · ) 20:45, 12 August 2010 (UTC)

 Note that many articles marked as review in pubmed are actually a case report on an exorbitantly rare phenomena and review of literature - see eg . Hardly the kind of phenomena we want to automatically mark as proven. On the other hand I want to have the freedom to use primary sources where I see them fit, especially for conditions where literature is thin. No bot can judge that. Richiez (talk) 20:51, 12 August 2010 (UTC)
I don't think anyone here would seriously advocate leaving the include/exclude decision for a reference up to a bot. There are far too many special cases. All the bot should do is the initial populating of the empty field in the template. A well-behaved bot would leave intact any parameter value entered by humans. But even modifying the template solely by hand would be a step forward, as it would make it clear to reviewers that WP:PSTS had been considered by the editors. LeadSongDog come howl! 22:13, 12 August 2010 (UTC)
The final content will not be decided by a bot but by people.  Yes there are exception but that does not mean that this information is not useful.Doc James (talk ·  · ) 22:55, 12 August 2010 (UTC)
I agree that having this info would be useful, and if it is automated would be even better: as any bot or automatic classification will have mistakes that we will have to fix but even so it would be of great help.--Garrondo (talk) 08:16, 13 August 2010 (UTC)

Having seen Sandy's note below, I hereby nominate Schizophrenia as an important test case for the bot.  ;-)

Good news

Just a note to say that I've just passed Croup for  status.  (Congratulations to Doc James and other editors.)

It sometimes seems like we report lots of problems here, but not really anything good -- and yet, somehow, when I look at my watchlist, I see useful things being done all the time.  For example, I saw some badly sourced information being removed earlier today, there are a couple of civil conversations at some of our most important articles that look like they're going to be productive, BSW-RMH is doing wonders with the reviews for  (which needs your help, of course, because a review on a talk page doesn't fix the article), I notice that Looie496 has taken on the oldest of the , and I see that JFW has yet another article nominated for GA that looks &quot;practically perfect in every way&quot;.  And there's doubtless a lot of good work being done that I haven't noticed, too.

So let me say that it's great to work with this low-drama, high-productivity, very experienced group of editors, and that if you see good work being done, or if you did something that you enjoyed, please feel free to post about that, even when it feels a bit like you're tooting your own horn or embarrassing your friends by calling attention to their normally excellent work.  We need to hear about problems so we can help you solve them, but we also need to know about your successes, too, so we can help you rejoice with them.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 22:07, 12 August 2010 (UTC)

Thanks for your wise words, WhatamIdoing, and thanks for the accolade. I've been a Wikipedian since 2004. For a while, particularly in 2005 and 2006, I found myself engaged in silly edit wars. I then discovered that focused content-related work on a single article is much more fulfilling. Once good content has been produced it is very uncommon for it to become degraded (although it might occasionally warrant some updating). I am willing to offer advice to anyone looking for good sources, because in most instances there is very good source material in the literature that just needs to be adapted to Wikipedia standards. JFW | T@lk 23:29, 12 August 2010 (UTC)
I hate to get too effusive with my praise—always seems to come back and bite you where it hurts—but, from what I can gather about your process from the Talk page, HHT could be mentioned in some guideline as a textbook case of good  and adherence to  and . In fact, I am inclined to review it myself—as long as no one thinks I'll be biased, of course :) There's no need to make the massive GAC backlog even bigger with an article that clearly meets the criteria.
And, of course, let me join WhatamIdoing in congratulating Doc James. I hope this particular case of Croup develops not into respiratory arrest but into a Featured article :) Fvasconcellos (t·) 01:25, 13 August 2010 (UTC)
 I love the citations list at croup; when you see ten high-quality sources, you know the article is written to MEDRS.  Try loading schizophrenia, with its 217 citations, many of which just have to be primary sources, but imagine checking all of them !  Nice work!  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 01:38, 13 August 2010 (UTC)
 It took me much too long to find  HHT (I went to the GAN page instead of checking Jfw's contribs), and there's another great source list, reflecting MEDRS.  JFW, you might consider reducing some of the blue links, though-- you really don't have to link common country names like France (French), or common body parts like legs, but this is your choice.  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 01:52, 13 August 2010 (UTC)
Well said WhatamIdoing, there's a lot of truly great going on behind the scenes - from subtle one liners gradually improving numbers of articles to complete reworks that one just stumbles across rather than hears about. To all those people - you are great ! :)  (talk •  08:50, 13 August 2010 (UTC)

Sources again

Reminded me of an older idea of me: each citation should have an own page, such as  already have. 

The interesting part is we can be tremendously creative in what can be done with such thing. My idea was the page-top would have the filled out template as it has now and the rest could be used for many interesting things such as assessment of the source(mark known crap:), comments, citation web links, explanatory notes,  short text citations where the source is not easily or freely available. Of course the pages also have &quot;what links there&quot;, a talk page and similar already now. Richiez (talk) 08:59, 13 August 2010 (UTC)
While I was initially enamoured of  etc, it soon became apparent that the template-space subpage model fails for sources that are used in multiple disciplines because it cannot adapt to the differing required citation styles for those disciplines. Consider the scenario where you transclude it into an article on rectocranial inversion syndrome that achieves FA status (hurrah!). Another editor then transcludes it into an article on neologisms. Unhappy with the citation style, that editor clicks on the handy &quot;edit&quot; button and &quot;fixes&quot; it. In the process he breaks the citation format consistency in the FA without even showing up in that article's edit history! This can be simply avoided by using  or  instead. LeadSongDog come howl! 13:47, 13 August 2010 (UTC)
In an ideal world I would say  should simply take an additional parameter &quot;displaystyle=&quot; or even better inherit it from the page but no idea if that can be implemented. Richiez (talk) 16:32, 13 August 2010 (UTC)
I'm pretty sure this would foul up cache management. OTOH we could potentially have style-specific templates e.g.  or .LeadSongDog come howl! 17:35, 13 August 2010 (UTC)

I have a big problem with citations being kept off page. This means you cannot at a glance identify the name and journal of the source, which can lead to terrible confusion if you need to cite several sources several times. I much support keeping the references close to the text.

What I would support is  that automatically expands (with the help of a bot) into a full reference. JFW | T@lk 16:14, 13 August 2010 (UTC)

Might be an idea if the bot would fill the ref name= with something meaningful like name=Watson_2009 ? I find it unwieldy to edit articles that have lengthy references inline so I definitely like the pmid shortcut. Richiez (talk) 16:28, 13 August 2010 (UTC)
Yes, a meaningful name for the reference is a big help; I'd always prefer  using the same logic that  does. Combined with  which take the full reference out of the text, it makes find your way through the text in the edit box much easier. --RexxS (talk) 16:40, 13 August 2010 (UTC)
Ah, if only MediaWiki supported simultaneous edits to two sections of a page so we could see both the LDR and the text needing citation! Ah well, I think you'll find that  and  both, being based on cite/core, take the input harv in order to address this wish, though it diverges significantly from the Vancouver style. Re JFW's comment, what if citation bot were to subst the template some time after expanding it? That would (I think) avoid the reformatting problem and the problem of content buried on unwatched template-space subpages. LeadSongDog come howl! 17:24, 13 August 2010 (UTC)
I suspect that the feature you want is easily available in your web browser, by using Tab (GUI) and Window (computing) features.  I fairly often have multiple tabs open or change the size of windows to do just that.  As long as I'm not changing the number of sections, it usually seems to work out all right.  (Or perhaps I'm so inured to edit conflicts that I don't notice repairing them any longer.)  WhatamIdoing (talk) 19:19, 13 August 2010 (UTC)
Firefox also has the &quot;split browser&quot; extension. Splits a single window or tab in multiple. But the issue was how wikipedia server software deals when multiple sections are edited at once? I thought it handles that since age but may be mistaken. Richiez (talk) 19:32, 13 August 2010 (UTC)
I can't recall ever having a problem with editing both a section and the References section with them open in different tabs (or tiled windows). Maybe I'm just lucky. --RexxS (talk) 22:10, 13 August 2010 (UTC)
Claudication

I added some secondary review full-text sources to claudication, and did a bit or reorganization to help distinguish neurogenic and vascular.  Some of the wording was pre-existing and uncited.  Could one of the docs check and expand on my work?  Some mention of the differential diagnosis when numbness vs. pain is present would be helpful.  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 19:56, 9 August 2010 (UTC)
 I also added several full-text secondary reviews to peripheral vascular disease‎ and did what I could there.  Done now, if any medical folk can check and expand on my work.  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 00:05, 10 August 2010 (UTC)
How do I cite Cochrane reviews (is there a template)?  SandyGeorgia (Talk) 01:41, 10 August 2010 (UTC)
Which Cochrane review?  I use the diberri tool [http://diberri.dyndns.org/cgi-bin/templatefiller/index.cgi?ddb=&amp;type=pubmed_id&amp;id=20091540] which gives me  I do not think there is a specific template. Doc James (talk ·  · ) 01:59, 10 August 2010 (UTC)
 Oh, I'm stupid-- it didn't occur to me that I could find a PMID for a Cochrane review and feed that into Diberri. SandyGeorgia (Talk) 02:01, 10 August 2010 (UTC)
There's no specific template. I don't think there's a way to make one either, as there are no discrete identifiers (updates keep the CD number of the original review, for instance). Fvasconcellos (t·) 02:08, 10 August 2010 (UTC)

Cochrane reviews are methodologically much stronger than &quot;standard&quot; reviews and automatically trump everything. JFW | T@lk 18:16, 15 August 2010 (UTC)
You forgot to put &quot;Cochrane review&quot; in [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAutism_therapies&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=378916375&amp;oldid=376190623 scare quotes]. HTH. :P As an aside, Bernard Rimland made some seminal contributions to autism research in the first part of his career, but segued into blaming thiomersal and vaccines in his later career. That doesn't diminish the value of his work, but his opinions on the cause and treatment of autism, particularly in the 1990s/2000s, are clearly at odds with current medical understanding, so we should be congisant of that when interpreting this review. MastCell Talk 18:49, 15 August 2010 (UTC)
Yes, this is the choir being preached to.

Mixing medical, botanical, and herbal stuff

I was doing some work on Vitex agnus-castus when I realised that the article tries to cover 3 fairly distinct domains: Botanical description etc, traditional herbal use, and use in modern medicin.

The sources on modern medical usage are good enough that I am tempted to split the article and create something like Vitex medication. Does that sound like a good idea or should I keep stuffing everything into one article? Are there other examples?

In Germany it has the status of a prescription free &quot;apothekenpflichtig&quot; (available in pharmacies only) medication with standartised extracts manufactured by several companies. I have fairly good overview of clinical and research aspectss but little knowledge about classical herbal stuff. 

What name would I choose for such an article? Richiez (talk) 14:27, 17 August 2010 (UTC)

 I would keep it in one article, unless you are going to add a lot of text. Although it covers three domains it is all about the same  herb, so as long as it doesn't get too long there is no reason to split. --WS (talk) 15:43, 17 August 2010 (UTC)

I agree:  one article unless and until you encounter  problems.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 16:56, 17 August 2010 (UTC)

What about adding templates like dopaminergics and melatonergics to the article? At least the dopaminergic effects are well establishd but I have not such a good feeling about doing that because what does this template then apply to? A particular extract, a plant? Richiez (talk) 17:18, 17 August 2010 (UTC)
I'd refrain from adding those, actually—strictly speaking, these effects are produced not by the plant but by its constituents (vitexin, for instance, has radical scavenger and antithyroid effects) Fvasconcellos (t·) 17:56, 17 August 2010 (UTC)

So that would be a good reason to split away the article to botanical and medical articles? In the long term I would want to have normal templates apply to it. Richiez (talk) 18:10, 17 August 2010 (UTC)

No;  splitting should happen when the article size merits it.  Vitexin already has an article;  for other compounds isolated from the plant create a redirect to the plant article and put the redirect in whatever categories that compound belongs in.   (talk) 01:43, 20 August 2010 (UTC)

A similar discussion would be in order for Medicinal mushrooms, which article freely mingles discussion of mushrooms used in traditional medicine with discussion of specific constituents extracted from them. LeadSongDog come howl! 14:50, 19 August 2010 (UTC)

Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma

I think the redirect is wrong. Although this type of lymphoma is associated frequently with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, these two pathological entities are not interchangeable. The term Waldenström's macroglobulinemia identifies a hyperviscosity syndrome due to secretion of large amounts of monoclonal IgM. Therefore, this syndrome identifies alteration of a blood parameter and its consequences, but not its origin, which can be manifold. Instead, the term lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma identifies pathological entity, characterized by a tumor mass with typical histological changes and not always results in a Waldenström's macroglobulinemia.

Trichotillomania

I've never encountered this &quot;focused&quot; vs. &quot;automatic&quot; classification: if anyone has access to the full text of  , could they verify this text just added?
Trichotillomania is also subdivided into &quot;automatic&quot; versus &quot;focused&quot; hair pulling.  Trichotillomania is often not a focused act, but rather hair pulling occurs in a &quot;trance-like&quot; state. This &quot;automatic&quot; pulling occurs in approximately three-quarters of patients with trichotillomania. Environment is a large factor which affects hair pulling. Sedentary activities such as being in a relaxed environment are conducive to hair pulling. A common example of a sedentary activity promoting hair pulling is lying in a bed while trying to rest or fall asleep. An extreme example of automatic TTM is found when some patients have been observed to pull their hair out while asleep.  Children are more often in the automatic, or subconscious, subtype and may not consciously remember pulling their hair.  Other individuals may have focused, or conscious, rituals associated with hair pulling, including seeking specific types of hairs to pull, pulling until the hair feels &quot;just right&quot;, or pulling in response to a specific sensation.

Do you create new pages?

I've been thinking about the , and the negative effects that this has on our own work.  (For example, I've got a list of pages that need to be moved to their correct titles.)   shows me that several good editors here (e.g., Garrondo, LeadSongDog, RexxS, Leevanjackson) also don't have various editor privs (e.g., , , or ) set.  I suspect that the hassle of requesting these things is the biggest reason. 

I know that some editors aren't interested in an RFA, so here's something easy and quick that any new-page-creating editor can do in less than five minutes.  For those of us who create an occasional article, it's not so helpful, but if you fairly often create new articles (and if you've been around a while, you may not realize how many you've created), please consider this:

# Click [http://toolserver.org/~soxred93/pages/index.php here].  
# Put your username in, and change the pop-up menu to &quot;Exclude redirects&quot;. 
# If the result shows that you've created dozens or hundreds of non-redirect pages, then please [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_permissions/Autopatrolled&amp;action=edit§ion=new&amp;preload=Wikipedia:Requests_for_permissions/Autopatrolled/Preload click here] to request the &quot;autopatrolled&quot; priv.

New pages normally end up in , where volunteers attempt to look over each one of them.  People who have a demonstrated track record of creating lots of pages (that don't end up getting deleted) can help reduce the 's workload by requesting this bit.  WhatamIdoing (talk) 23:49, 17 August 2010 (UTC)
